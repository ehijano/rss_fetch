      <title>Liouville Flow Importance Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Liouville Flow Importance Sampler (LFIS), an innovative flow-based model for generating samples from unnormalized density functions. LFIS learns a time-dependent velocity field that deterministically transports samples from a simple initial distribution to a complex target distribution, guided by a prescribed path of annealed distributions. The training of LFIS utilizes a unique method that enforces the structure of a derived partial differential equation to neural networks modeling velocity fields. By considering the neural velocity field as an importance sampler, sample weights can be computed through accumulating errors along the sample trajectories driven by neural velocity fields, ensuring unbiased and consistent estimation of statistical quantities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LFIS through its application to a range of benchmark problems, on many of which LFIS achieved state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Approximation Error and Complexity Bounds for ReLU Networks on Low-Regular Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the approximation of a large class of bounded functions, with minimal regularity assumptions, by ReLU neural networks. We show that the approximation error can be bounded from above by a quantity proportional to the uniform norm of the target function and inversely proportional to the product of network width and depth. We inherit this approximation error bound from Fourier features residual networks, a type of neural network that uses complex exponential activation functions. Our proof is constructive and proceeds by conducting a careful complexity analysis associated with the approximation of a Fourier features residual network by a ReLU network.</description>

      <title>Compressed Online Learning of Conditional Mean Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conditional mean embedding (CME) encodes Markovian stochastic kernels through their actions on probability distributions embedded within the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). The CME plays a key role in several well-known machine learning tasks such as reinforcement learning, analysis of dynamical systems, etc. We present an algorithm to learn the CME incrementally from data via an operator-valued stochastic gradient descent. As is well-known, function learning in RKHS suffers from scalability challenges from large data. We utilize a compression mechanism to counter the scalability challenge. The core contribution of this paper is a finite-sample performance guarantee on the last iterate of the online compressed operator learning algorithm with fast-mixing Markovian samples, when the target CME may not be contained in the hypothesis space. We illustrate the efficacy of our algorithm by applying it to the analysis of an example dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Marginal Fairness Sliced Wasserstein Barycenter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein barycenter (SWB) is a widely acknowledged method for efficiently generalizing the averaging operation within probability measure spaces. However, achieving marginal fairness SWB, ensuring approximately equal distances from the barycenter to marginals, remains unexplored. The uniform weighted SWB is not necessarily the optimal choice to obtain the desired marginal fairness barycenter due to the heterogeneous structure of marginals and the non-optimality of the optimization. As the first attempt to tackle the problem, we define the marginal fairness sliced Wasserstein barycenter (MFSWB) as a constrained SWB problem. Due to the computational disadvantages of the formal definition, we propose two hyperparameter-free and computationally tractable surrogate MFSWB problems that implicitly minimize the distances to marginals and encourage marginal fairness at the same time. To further improve the efficiency, we perform slicing distribution selection and obtain the third surrogate definition by introducing a new slicing distribution that focuses more on marginally unfair projecting directions. We discuss the relationship of the three proposed problems and their relationship to sliced multi-marginal Wasserstein distance. Finally, we conduct experiments on finding 3D point-clouds averaging, color harmonization, and training of sliced Wasserstein autoencoder with class-fairness representation to show the favorable performance of the proposed surrogate MFSWB problems.</description>

      <title>Distributed High-Dimensional Quantile Regression: Estimation Efficiency and Support Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on distributed estimation and support recovery for high-dimensional linear quantile regression. Quantile regression is a popular alternative tool to the least squares regression for robustness against outliers and data heterogeneity. However, the non-smoothness of the check loss function poses big challenges to both computation and theory in the distributed setting. To tackle these problems, we transform the original quantile regression into the least-squares optimization. By applying a double-smoothing approach, we extend a previous Newton-type distributed approach without the restrictive independent assumption between the error term and covariates. An efficient algorithm is developed, which enjoys high computation and communication efficiency. Theoretically, the proposed distributed estimator achieves a near-oracle convergence rate and high support recovery accuracy after a constant number of iterations. Extensive experiments on synthetic examples and a real data application further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image classification based on over-parametrized convolutional neural networks with a global average-pooling layer is considered. The weights of the network are learned by gradient descent. A bound on the rate of convergence of the difference between the misclassification risk of the newly introduced convolutional neural network estimate and the minimal possible value is derived.</description>

      <title>Improved Bound for Robust Causal Bandits with Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robustness of causal bandits (CBs) in the face of temporal model fluctuations. This setting deviates from the existing literature's widely-adopted assumption of constant causal models. The focus is on causal systems with linear structural equation models (SEMs). The SEMs and the time-varying pre- and post-interventional statistical models are all unknown and subject to variations over time. The goal is to design a sequence of interventions that incur the smallest cumulative regret compared to an oracle aware of the entire causal model and its fluctuations. A robust CB algorithm is proposed, and its cumulative regret is analyzed by establishing both upper and lower bounds on the regret. It is shown that in a graph with maximum in-degree $d$, length of the largest causal path $L$, and an aggregate model deviation $C$, the regret is upper bounded by $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{L-\frac{1}{2}}(\sqrt{T} + C))$ and lower bounded by $\Omega(d^{\frac{L}{2}-2}\max\{\sqrt{T}\; ,\; d^2C\})$. The proposed algorithm achieves nearly optimal $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret when $C$ is $o(\sqrt{T})$, maintaining sub-linear regret for a broad range of $C$.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis for Active Sampling, with Applications to the Simulation of Analog Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an active sampling flow, with the use-case of simulating the impact of combined variations on analog circuits. In such a context, given the large number of parameters, it is difficult to fit a surrogate model and to efficiently explore the space of design features.
  By combining a drastic dimension reduction using sensitivity analysis and Bayesian surrogate modeling, we obtain a flexible active sampling flow. On synthetic and real datasets, this flow outperforms the usual Monte-Carlo sampling which often forms the foundation of design space exploration.</description>

      <title>Localized Adaptive Risk Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive Risk Control (ARC) is an online calibration strategy based on set prediction that offers worst-case deterministic long-term risk control, as well as statistical marginal coverage guarantees. ARC adjusts the size of the prediction set by varying a single scalar threshold based on feedback from past decisions. In this work, we introduce Localized Adaptive Risk Control (L-ARC), an online calibration scheme that targets statistical localized risk guarantees ranging from conditional risk to marginal risk, while preserving the worst-case performance of ARC. L-ARC updates a threshold function within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), with the kernel determining the level of localization of the statistical risk guarantee. The theoretical results highlight a trade-off between localization of the statistical risk and convergence speed to the long-term risk target. Thanks to localization, L-ARC is demonstrated via experiments to produce prediction sets with risk guarantees across different data subpopulations, significantly improving the fairness of the calibrated model for tasks such as image segmentation and beam selection in wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Hedging American Put Options with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to hedge American put options, utilizing the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method. The agents are first trained and tested with Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) asset paths and demonstrate superior performance over traditional strategies like the Black-Scholes (BS) Delta, particularly in the presence of transaction costs. To assess the real-world applicability of DRL hedging, a second round of experiments uses a market calibrated stochastic volatility model to train DRL agents. Specifically, 80 put options across 8 symbols are collected, stochastic volatility model coefficients are calibrated for each symbol, and a DRL agent is trained for each of the 80 options by simulating paths of the respective calibrated model. Not only do DRL agents outperform the BS Delta method when testing is conducted using the same calibrated stochastic volatility model data from training, but DRL agents achieves better results when hedging the true asset path that occurred between the option sale date and the maturity. As such, not only does this study present the first DRL agents tailored for American put option hedging, but results on both simulated and empirical market testing data also suggest the optimality of DRL agents over the BS Delta method in real-world scenarios. Finally, note that this study employs a model-agnostic Chebyshev interpolation method to provide DRL agents with option prices at each time step when a stochastic volatility model is used, thereby providing a general framework for an easy extension to more complex underlying asset processes.</description>

      <title>ISR: Invertible Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an Invertible Symbolic Regression (ISR) method. It is a machine learning technique that generates analytical relationships between inputs and outputs of a given dataset via invertible maps (or architectures). The proposed ISR method naturally combines the principles of Invertible Neural Networks (INNs) and Equation Learner (EQL), a neural network-based symbolic architecture for function learning. In particular, we transform the affine coupling blocks of INNs into a symbolic framework, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable symbolic invertible architecture that allows for efficient gradient-based learning. The proposed ISR framework also relies on sparsity promoting regularization, allowing the discovery of concise and interpretable invertible expressions. We show that ISR can serve as a (symbolic) normalizing flow for density estimation tasks. Furthermore, we highlight its practical applicability in solving inverse problems, including a benchmark inverse kinematics problem, and notably, a geoacoustic inversion problem in oceanography aimed at inferring posterior distributions of underlying seabed parameters from acoustic signals.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear classification of neural manifolds with contextual information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how neural systems efficiently process information through distributed representations is a fundamental challenge at the interface of neuroscience and machine learning. Recent approaches analyze the statistical and geometrical attributes of neural representations as population-level mechanistic descriptors of task implementation. In particular, manifold capacity has emerged as a promising framework linking population geometry to the separability of neural manifolds. However, this metric has been limited to linear readouts. Here, we propose a theoretical framework that overcomes this limitation by leveraging contextual input information. We derive an exact formula for the context-dependent capacity that depends on manifold geometry and context correlations, and validate it on synthetic and real data. Our framework's increased expressivity captures representation untanglement in deep networks at early stages of the layer hierarchy, previously inaccessible to analysis. As context-dependent nonlinearity is ubiquitous in neural systems, our data-driven and theoretically grounded approach promises to elucidate context-dependent computation across scales, datasets, and models.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference from Slowly Varying Nonstationary Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal inference from observational data following the restricted structural causal models (SCM) framework hinges largely on the asymmetry between cause and effect from the data generating mechanisms, such as non-Gaussianity or non-linearity. This methodology can be adapted to stationary time series, yet inferring causal relationships from nonstationary time series remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose a new class of restricted SCM, via a time-varying filter and stationary noise, and exploit the asymmetry from nonstationarity for causal identification in both bivariate and network settings. We propose efficient procedures by leveraging powerful estimates of the bivariate evolutionary spectra for slowly varying processes. Various synthetic and real datasets that involve high-order and non-smooth filters are evaluated to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Online Bayesian Estimation of Frequency Distributions with Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel Bayesian approach for the adaptive and online estimation of the frequency distribution of a finite number of categories under the local differential privacy (LDP) framework. The proposed algorithm performs Bayesian parameter estimation via posterior sampling and adapts the randomization mechanism for LDP based on the obtained posterior samples. We propose a randomized mechanism for LDP which uses a subset of categories as an input and whose performance depends on the selected subset and the true frequency distribution. By using the posterior sample as an estimate of the frequency distribution, the algorithm performs a computationally tractable subset selection step to maximize the utility of the privatized response of the next user. We propose several utility functions related to well-known information metrics, such as (but not limited to) Fisher information matrix, total variation distance, and information entropy. We compare each of these utility metrics in terms of their computational complexity. We employ stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics for posterior sampling, a computationally efficient approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo method. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that (i) the posterior distribution targeted by the algorithm converges to the true parameter even for approximate posterior sampling, and (ii) the algorithm selects the optimal subset with high probability if posterior sampling is performed exactly. We also provide numerical results that empirically demonstrate the estimation accuracy of our algorithm where we compare it with nonadaptive and semi-adaptive approaches under experimental settings with various combinations of privacy parameters and population distribution parameters.</description>

      <title>Conformal Online Auction Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes the conformal online auction design (COAD), a novel mechanism for maximizing revenue in online auctions by quantifying the uncertainty in bidders' values without relying on assumptions about value distributions. COAD incorporates both the bidder and item features and leverages historical data to provide an incentive-compatible mechanism for online auctions. Unlike traditional methods for online auctions, COAD employs a distribution-free, prediction interval-based approach using conformal prediction techniques. This novel approach ensures that the expected revenue from our mechanism can achieve at least a constant fraction of the revenue generated by the optimal mechanism. Additionally, COAD admits the use of a broad array of modern machine-learning methods, including random forests, kernel methods, and deep neural nets, for predicting bidders' values. It ensures revenue performance under any finite sample of historical data. Moreover, COAD introduces bidder-specific reserve prices based on the lower confidence bounds of bidders' valuations, which is different from the uniform reserve prices commonly used in the literature. We validate our theoretical predictions through extensive simulations and a real-data application. All code for using COAD and reproducing results is made available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: We explicitly construct zero loss neural network classifiers. We write the weight matrices and bias vectors in terms of cumulative parameters, which determine truncation maps acting recursively on input space. The configurations for the training data considered are (i) sufficiently small, well separated clusters corresponding to each class, and (ii) equivalence classes which are sequentially linearly separable. In the best case, for $Q$ classes of data in $\mathbb{R}^M$, global minimizers can be described with $Q(M+2)$ parameters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) when both randomized control trial (RCT) data and real-world data (RWD) are available. We decompose the ATE estimand as the difference between a pooled-ATE estimand that integrates RCT and RWD and a bias estimand that captures the conditional effect of RCT enrollment on the outcome. We introduce an adaptive targeted minimum loss-based estimation (A-TMLE) framework to estimate them. We prove that the A-TMLE estimator is root-n-consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, in finite sample, it achieves the super-efficiency one would obtain had one known the oracle model for the conditional effect of the RCT enrollment on the outcome. Consequently, the smaller the working model of the bias induced by the RWD is, the greater our estimator's efficiency, while our estimator will always be at least as efficient as an efficient estimator that uses the RCT data only. A-TMLE outperforms existing methods in simulations by having smaller mean-squared-error and 95% confidence intervals. A-TMLE could help utilize RWD to improve the efficiency of randomized trial results without biasing the estimates of intervention effects. This approach could allow for smaller, faster trials, decreasing the time until patients can receive effective treatments.</description>

      <title>On Discovery of Local Independence over Continuous Variables via Neural Contextual Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional independence provides a way to understand causal relationships among the variables of interest. An underlying system may exhibit more fine-grained causal relationships especially between a variable and its parents, which will be called the local independence relationships. One of the most widely studied local relationships is Context-Specific Independence (CSI), which holds in a specific assignment of conditioned variables. However, its applicability is often limited since it does not allow continuous variables: data conditioned to the specific value of a continuous variable contains few instances, if not none, making it infeasible to test independence. In this work, we define and characterize the local independence relationship that holds in a specific set of joint assignments of parental variables, which we call context-set specific independence (CSSI). We then provide a canonical representation of CSSI and prove its fundamental properties. Based on our theoretical findings, we cast the problem of discovering multiple CSSI relationships in a system as finding a partition of the joint outcome space. Finally, we propose a novel method, coined neural contextual decomposition (NCD), which learns such partition by imposing each set to induce CSSI via modeling a conditional distribution. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method successfully discovers the ground truth local independence relationships in both synthetic dataset and complex system reflecting the real-world physical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Bandits with ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic bandit problem with ReLU neural network structure. We show that a $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantee is achievable by considering bandits with one-layer ReLU neural networks; to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to achieve such a guarantee. In this specific setting, we propose an OFU-ReLU algorithm that can achieve this upper bound. The algorithm first explores randomly until it reaches a linear regime, and then implements a UCB-type linear bandit algorithm to balance exploration and exploitation. Our key insight is that we can exploit the piecewise linear structure of ReLU activations and convert the problem into a linear bandit in a transformed feature space, once we learn the parameters of ReLU relatively accurately during the exploration stage. To remove dependence on model parameters, we design an OFU-ReLU+ algorithm based on a batching strategy, which can provide the same theoretical guarantee.</description>

      <title>Conformalized Survival Distributions: A Generic Post-Process to Increase Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrimination and calibration represent two important properties of survival analysis, with the former assessing the model's ability to accurately rank subjects and the latter evaluating the alignment of predicted outcomes with actual events. With their distinct nature, it is hard for survival models to simultaneously optimize both of them especially as many previous results found improving calibration tends to diminish discrimination performance. This paper introduces a novel approach utilizing conformal regression that can improve a model's calibration without degrading discrimination. We provide theoretical guarantees for the above claim, and rigorously validate the efficiency of our approach across 11 real-world datasets, showcasing its practical applicability and robustness in diverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Rewards for Exploration without Harm from Observational Noise: A Simulation Study Based on the Free Energy Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), artificial agents are trained to maximize numerical rewards by performing tasks. Exploration is essential in RL because agents must discover information before exploiting it. Two rewards encouraging efficient exploration are the entropy of action policy and curiosity for information gain. Entropy is well-established in literature, promoting randomized action selection. Curiosity is defined in a broad variety of ways in literature, promoting discovery of novel experiences. One example, prediction error curiosity, rewards agents for discovering observations they cannot accurately predict. However, such agents may be distracted by unpredictable observational noises known as curiosity traps. Based on the Free Energy Principle (FEP), this paper proposes hidden state curiosity, which rewards agents by the KL divergence between the predictive prior and posterior probabilities of latent variables. We trained six types of agents to navigate mazes: baseline agents without rewards for entropy or curiosity, and agents rewarded for entropy and/or either prediction error curiosity or hidden state curiosity. We find entropy and curiosity result in efficient exploration, especially both employed together. Notably, agents with hidden state curiosity demonstrate resilience against curiosity traps, which hinder agents with prediction error curiosity. This suggests implementing the FEP may enhance the robustness and generalization of RL models, potentially aligning the learning processes of artificial and biological agents.</description>

      <title>Partial information decomposition as information bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The partial information decomposition (PID) aims to quantify the amount of redundant information that a set of sources provide about a target. Here we show that this goal can be formulated as a type of information bottleneck (IB) problem, which we term the "redundancy bottleneck" (RB). The RB formalizes a tradeoff between prediction and compression: it extracts information from the sources that predicts the target, without revealing which source provided the information. It can be understood as a generalization "Blackwell redundancy", which we previously proposed as a principled measure of PID redundancy. The "RB curve" quantifies the prediction/compression tradeoff at multiple scales. This curve can also be quantified for individual sources, allowing subsets of redundant sources to be identified without combinatorial optimization. We provide an efficient iterative algorithm for computing the RB curve.</description>

      <title>CAGES: Cost-Aware Gradient Entropy Search for Efficient Local Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular approach for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box objective functions. An important challenge in BO is its application to high-dimensional search spaces due in large part to the curse of dimensionality. One way to overcome this challenge is to focus on local BO methods that aim to efficiently learn gradients, which have shown strong empirical performance on a variety of high-dimensional problems including policy search in reinforcement learning (RL). However, current local BO methods assume access to only a single high-fidelity information source whereas, in many engineering and control problems, one has access to multiple cheaper approximations of the objective. We propose a novel algorithm, Cost-Aware Gradient Entropy Search (CAGES), for local BO of multi-fidelity black-box functions. CAGES makes no assumption about the relationship between different information sources, making it more flexible than other multi-fidelity methods. It also employs a new type of information-theoretic acquisition function, which enables systematic identification of samples that maximize the information gain about the unknown gradient per cost of the evaluation. We demonstrate CAGES can achieve significant performance improvements compared to other state-of-the-art methods on a variety of synthetic and benchmark RL problems.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Kernel Ridge Regression Based on Data-dependent Random Feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random feature (RF) has been widely used for node consistency in decentralized kernel ridge regression (KRR). Currently, the consistency is guaranteed by imposing constraints on coefficients of features, necessitating that the random features on different nodes are identical. However, in many applications, data on different nodes varies significantly on the number or distribution, which calls for adaptive and data-dependent methods that generate different RFs. To tackle the essential difficulty, we propose a new decentralized KRR algorithm that pursues consensus on decision functions, which allows great flexibility and well adapts data on nodes. The convergence is rigorously given and the effectiveness is numerically verified: by capturing the characteristics of the data on each node, while maintaining the same communication costs as other methods, we achieved an average regression accuracy improvement of 25.5\% across six real-world data sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (reSGLD) is an effective sampler for non-convex learning in large-scale datasets. However, the simulation may encounter stagnation issues when the high-temperature chain delves too deeply into the distribution tails. To tackle this issue, we propose reflected reSGLD (r2SGLD): an algorithm tailored for constrained non-convex exploration by utilizing reflection steps within a bounded domain. Theoretically, we observe that reducing the diameter of the domain enhances mixing rates, exhibiting a \emph{quadratic} behavior. Empirically, we test its performance through extensive experiments, including identifying dynamical systems with physical constraints, simulations of constrained multi-modal distributions, and image classification tasks. The theoretical and empirical findings highlight the crucial role of constrained exploration in improving the simulation efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for constructing a confidence region for the solution to a conditional moment equation. The method is built around a class of algorithms for nonparametric regression based on subsampled kernels. This class includes random forest regression. We bound the error in the confidence region's nominal coverage probability, under the restriction that the conditional moment equation of interest satisfies a local orthogonality condition. The method is applicable to the construction of confidence regions for conditional average treatment effects in randomized experiments, among many other similar problems encountered in applied economics and causal inference. As a by-product, we obtain several new order-explicit results on the concentration and normal approximation of high-dimensional $U$-statistics.</description>

      <title>RLHF Workflow: From Reward Modeling to Online RLHF</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the workflow of Online Iterative Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in this technical report, which is widely reported to outperform its offline counterpart by a large margin in the recent large language model (LLM) literature. However, existing open-source RLHF projects are still largely confined to the offline learning setting. In this technical report, we aim to fill in this gap and provide a detailed recipe that is easy to reproduce for online iterative RLHF. In particular, since online human feedback is usually infeasible for open-source communities with limited resources, we start by constructing preference models using a diverse set of open-source datasets and use the constructed proxy preference model to approximate human feedback. Then, we discuss the theoretical insights and algorithmic principles behind online iterative RLHF, followed by a detailed practical implementation. Our trained LLM, SFR-Iterative-DPO-LLaMA-3-8B-R, achieves impressive performance on LLM chatbot benchmarks, including AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, and MT-Bench, as well as other academic benchmarks such as HumanEval and TruthfulQA. We have shown that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and iterative RLHF can obtain state-of-the-art performance with fully open-source datasets. Further, we have made our models, curated datasets, and comprehensive step-by-step code guidebooks publicly available.

      <description>arXiv:2405.07914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a novel link between the problem of PAC-learning high-dimensional graphical models and the task of (efficient) counting and sampling of graph structures, using an online learning framework.
  We observe that if we apply the exponentially weighted average (EWA) or randomized weighted majority (RWM) forecasters on a sequence of samples from a distribution P using the log loss function, the average regret incurred by the forecaster's predictions can be used to bound the expected KL divergence between P and the predictions. Known regret bounds for EWA and RWM then yield new sample complexity bounds for learning Bayes nets. Moreover, these algorithms can be made computationally efficient for several interesting classes of Bayes nets. Specifically, we give a new sample-optimal and polynomial time learning algorithm with respect to trees of unknown structure and the first polynomial sample and time algorithm for learning with respect to Bayes nets over a given chordal skeleton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.02605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has acquired a prominent position in health-related sequential decision-making problems, gaining traction as a valuable tool for delivering adaptive interventions (AIs). However, in part due to a poor synergy between the methodological and the applied communities, its real-life application is still limited and its potential is still to be realized. To address this gap, our work provides the first unified technical survey on RL methods, complemented with case studies, for constructing various types of AIs in healthcare. In particular, using the common methodological umbrella of RL, we bridge two seemingly different AI domains, dynamic treatment regimes and just-in-time adaptive interventions in mobile health, highlighting similarities and differences between them and discussing the implications of using RL. Open problems and considerations for future research directions are outlined. Finally, we leverage our experience in designing case studies in both areas to showcase the significant collaborative opportunities between statistical, RL, and healthcare researchers in advancing AIs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider optimizing a function network in the noise-free grey-box setting with RKHS function classes, where the exact intermediate results are observable. We assume that the structure of the network is known (but not the underlying functions comprising it), and we study three types of structures: (1) chain: a cascade of scalar-valued functions, (2) multi-output chain: a cascade of vector-valued functions, and (3) feed-forward network: a fully connected feed-forward network of scalar-valued functions. We propose a sequential upper confidence bound based algorithm GPN-UCB along with a general theoretical upper bound on the cumulative regret. In addition, we propose a non-adaptive sampling based method along with its theoretical upper bound on the simple regret for the Mat\'ern kernel. We also provide algorithm-independent lower bounds on the simple regret and cumulative regret. Our regret bounds for GPN-UCB have the same dependence on the time horizon as the best known in the vanilla black-box setting, as well as near-optimal dependencies on other parameters (e.g., RKHS norm and network length).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider estimation and inference using data collected from reinforcement learning algorithms. These algorithms, characterized by their adaptive experimentation, interact with individual units over multiple stages, dynamically adjusting their strategies based on previous interactions. Our goal is to evaluate a counterfactual policy post-data collection and estimate structural parameters, like dynamic treatment effects, which can be used for credit assignment and determining the effect of earlier actions on final outcomes. Such parameters of interest can be framed as solutions to moment equations, but not minimizers of a population loss function, leading to Z-estimation approaches for static data. However, in the adaptive data collection environment of reinforcement learning, where algorithms deploy nonstationary behavior policies, standard estimators do not achieve asymptotic normality due to the fluctuating variance. We propose a weighted Z-estimation approach with carefully designed adaptive weights to stabilize the time-varying estimation variance. We identify proper weighting schemes to restore the consistency and asymptotic normality of the weighted Z-estimators for target parameters, which allows for hypothesis testing and constructing uniform confidence regions. Primary applications include dynamic treatment effect estimation and dynamic off-policy evaluation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their successful application to a variety of tasks, neural networks remain limited, like other machine learning methods, by their sensitivity to shifts in the data: their performance can be severely impacted by differences in distribution between the data on which they were trained and that on which they are deployed. In this article, we propose a new family of representations, called MAGDiff, that we extract from any given neural network classifier and that allows for efficient covariate data shift detection without the need to train a new model dedicated to this task. These representations are computed by comparing the activation graphs of the neural network for samples belonging to the training distribution and to the target distribution, and yield powerful data- and task-adapted statistics for the two-sample tests commonly used for data set shift detection. We demonstrate this empirically by measuring the statistical powers of two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests on several different data sets and shift types, and showing that our novel representations induce significant improvements over a state-of-the-art baseline relying on the network output.</description>

Abstract: The posterior collapse phenomenon in variational autoencoder (VAE), where the variational posterior distribution closely matches the prior distribution, can hinder the quality of the learned latent variables. As a consequence of posterior collapse, the latent variables extracted by the encoder in VAE preserve less information from the input data and thus fail to produce meaningful representations as input to the reconstruction process in the decoder. While this phenomenon has been an actively addressed topic related to VAE performance, the theory for posterior collapse remains underdeveloped, especially beyond the standard VAE. In this work, we advance the theoretical understanding of posterior collapse to two important and prevalent yet less studied classes of VAE: conditional VAE and hierarchical VAE. Specifically, via a non-trivial theoretical analysis of linear conditional VAE and hierarchical VAE with two levels of latent, we prove that the cause of posterior collapses in these models includes the correlation between the input and output of the conditional VAE and the effect of learnable encoder variance in the hierarchical VAE. We empirically validate our theoretical findings for linear conditional and hierarchical VAE and demonstrate that these results are also predictive for non-linear cases with extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Properties of Discrete Sliced Wasserstein Losses</title>

Abstract: The Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance has become a popular alternative to the Wasserstein distance for comparing probability measures. Widespread applications include image processing, domain adaptation and generative modelling, where it is common to optimise some parameters in order to minimise SW, which serves as a loss function between discrete probability measures (since measures admitting densities are numerically unattainable). All these optimisation problems bear the same sub-problem, which is minimising the Sliced Wasserstein energy. In this paper we study the properties of $\mathcal{E}: Y \longmapsto \mathrm{SW}_2^2(\gamma_Y, \gamma_Z)$, i.e. the SW distance between two uniform discrete measures with the same amount of points as a function of the support $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ of one of the measures. We investigate the regularity and optimisation properties of this energy, as well as its Monte-Carlo approximation $\mathcal{E}_p$ (estimating the expectation in SW using only $p$ samples) and show convergence results on the critical points of $\mathcal{E}_p$ to those of $\mathcal{E}$, as well as an almost-sure uniform convergence and a uniform Central Limit result on the process $\mathcal{E}_p(Y)$. Finally, we show that in a certain sense, Stochastic Gradient Descent methods minimising $\mathcal{E}$ and $\mathcal{E}_p$ converge towards (Clarke) critical points of these energies.</description>

      <title>Multi-unit soft sensing permits few-shot learning</title>

Abstract: Recent literature has explored various ways to improve soft sensors by utilizing learning algorithms with transferability. A performance gain is generally attained when knowledge is transferred among strongly related soft sensor learning tasks. A particularly relevant case for transferability is when developing soft sensors of the same type for similar, but physically different processes or units. Then, the data from each unit presents a soft sensor learning task, and it is reasonable to expect strongly related tasks. Applying methods that exploit transferability in this setting leads to what we call multi-unit soft sensing.
  This paper formulates multi-unit soft sensing as a probabilistic, hierarchical model, which we implement using a deep neural network. The learning capabilities of the model are studied empirically on a large-scale industrial case by developing virtual flow meters (a type of soft sensor) for 80 petroleum wells. We investigate how the model generalizes with the number of wells/units. Interestingly, we demonstrate that multi-unit models learned from data from many wells, permit few-shot learning of virtual flow meters for new wells. Surprisingly, regarding the difficulty of the tasks, few-shot learning on 1-3 data points often leads to high performance on new wells.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates for Stochastic Approximation: Biased Noise with Unbounded Variance, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the convergence properties of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method for finding a stationary point of a given objective function $J(\cdot)$. The objective function is not required to be convex. Rather, our results apply to a class of ``invex'' functions, which have the property that every stationary point is also a global minimizer. First, it is assumed that $J(\cdot)$ satisfies a property that is slightly weaker than the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) condition, denoted here as (KL'). It is shown that the iterations $J({\boldsymbol \theta}_t)$ converge almost surely to the global minimum of $J(\cdot)$. Next, the hypothesis on $J(\cdot)$ is strengthened from (KL') to the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition. With this stronger hypothesis, we derive estimates on the rate of convergence of $J({\boldsymbol \theta}_t)$ to its limit. Using these results, we show that for functions satisfying the PL property, the convergence rate of SGD is the same as the best-possible rate for convex functions. While some results along these lines have been published in the past, our contributions contain two distinct improvements. First, the assumptions on the stochastic gradient are more general than elsewhere, and second, our convergence is almost sure, and not in expectation. We also study SGD when only function evaluations are permitted. In this setting, we determine the ``optimal'' increments or the size of the perturbations. Using the same set of ideas, we establish the global convergence of the Stochastic Approximation (SA) algorithm under more general assumptions on the measurement error, compared to the existing literature. We also derive bounds on the rate of convergence of the SA algorithm under appropriate assumptions.</description>

      <title>Physics-constrained polynomial chaos expansion for scientific machine learning and uncertainty quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel physics-constrained polynomial chaos expansion as a surrogate modeling method capable of performing both scientific machine learning (SciML) and uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks. The proposed method possesses a unique capability: it seamlessly integrates SciML into UQ and vice versa, which allows it to quantify the uncertainties in SciML tasks effectively and leverage SciML for improved uncertainty assessment during UQ-related tasks. The proposed surrogate model can effectively incorporate a variety of physical constraints, such as governing partial differential equations (PDEs) with associated initial and boundary conditions constraints, inequality-type constraints (e.g., monotonicity, convexity, non-negativity, among others), and additional a priori information in the training process to supplement limited data. This ensures physically realistic predictions and significantly reduces the need for expensive computational model evaluations to train the surrogate model. Furthermore, the proposed method has a built-in uncertainty quantification (UQ) feature to efficiently estimate output uncertainties. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to a diverse set of problems, including linear/non-linear PDEs with deterministic and stochastic parameters, data-driven surrogate modeling of a complex physical system, and UQ of a stochastic system with parameters modeled as random fields.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Pareto-Smoothed Weighting for High-Dimensional Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in estimating heterogeneous treatment effects across individuals using their high-dimensional feature attributes. Achieving high performance in such high-dimensional heterogeneous treatment effect estimation is challenging because in this setup, it is usual that some features induce sample selection bias while others do not but are predictive of potential outcomes. To avoid losing such predictive feature information, existing methods learn separate feature representations using inverse probability weighting (IPW). However, due to their numerically unstable IPW weights, these methods suffer from estimation bias under a finite sample setup. To develop a numerically robust estimator by weighted representation learning, we propose a differentiable Pareto-smoothed weighting framework that replaces extreme weight values in an end-to-end fashion. Our experimental results show that by effectively correcting the weight values, our proposed method outperforms the existing ones, including traditional weighting schemes.</description>

      <title>Differential Similarity in Higher Dimensional Spaces: Theory and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:1902.03667v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an extension and an elaboration of the theory of differential similarity, which was originally proposed in arXiv:1401.2411 [cs.LG]. The goal is to develop an algorithm for clustering and coding that combines a geometric model with a probabilistic model in a principled way. For simplicity, the geometric model in the earlier paper was restricted to the three-dimensional case. The present paper removes this restriction, and considers the full $n$-dimensional case. Although the mathematical model is the same, the strategies for computing solutions in the $n$-dimensional case are different, and one of the main purposes of this paper is to develop and analyze these strategies. Another main purpose is to devise techniques for estimating the parameters of the model from sample data, again in $n$ dimensions. We evaluate the solution strategies and the estimation techniques by applying them to two familiar real-world examples: the classical MNIST dataset and the CIFAR-10 dataset.</description>

      <title>Rule Generation for Classification: Scalability, Interpretability, and Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.10751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new rule-based optimization method for classification with constraints. The proposed method leverages column generation for linear programming, and hence, is scalable to large datasets. The resulting pricing subproblem is shown to be NP-Hard. We recourse to a decision tree-based heuristic and solve a proxy pricing subproblem for acceleration. The method returns a set of rules along with their optimal weights indicating the importance of each rule for learning. We address interpretability and fairness by assigning cost coefficients to the rules and introducing additional constraints. In particular, we focus on local interpretability and generalize separation criterion in fairness to multiple sensitive attributes and classes. We test the performance of the proposed methodology on a collection of datasets and present a case study to elaborate on its different aspects. The proposed rule-based learning method exhibits a good compromise between local interpretability and fairness on the one side, and accuracy on the other side.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.12004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a computationally tractable method for estimating the optimal map between two distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ with rigorous finite-sample guarantees. Leveraging an entropic version of Brenier's theorem, we show that our estimator -- the \emph{barycentric projection} of the optimal entropic plan -- is easy to compute using Sinkhorn's algorithm. As a result, unlike current approaches for map estimation, which are slow to evaluate when the dimension or number of samples is large, our approach is parallelizable and extremely efficient even for massive data sets. Under smoothness assumptions on the optimal map, we show that our estimator enjoys comparable statistical performance to other estimators in the literature, but with much lower computational cost. We showcase the efficacy of our proposed estimator through numerical examples, even ones not explicitly covered by our assumptions. By virtue of Lepski's method, we propose a modified version of our estimator that is adaptive to the smoothness of the underlying optimal transport map. Our proofs are based on a modified duality principle for entropic optimal transport and on a method for approximating optimal entropic plans due to Pal (2019).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.12770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic approximation procedures for approximately solving a $d$-dimensional linear fixed point equation based on observing a trajectory of length $n$ from an ergodic Markov chain. We first exhibit a non-asymptotic bound of the order $t_{\mathrm{mix}} \tfrac{d}{n}$ on the squared error of the last iterate of a standard scheme, where $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is a mixing time. We then prove a non-asymptotic instance-dependent bound on a suitably averaged sequence of iterates, with a leading term that matches the local asymptotic minimax limit, including sharp dependence on the parameters $(d, t_{\mathrm{mix}})$ in the higher order terms. We complement these upper bounds with a non-asymptotic minimax lower bound that establishes the instance-optimality of the averaged SA estimator. We derive corollaries of these results for policy evaluation with Markov noise -- covering the TD($\lambda$) family of algorithms for all $\lambda \in [0, 1)$ -- and linear autoregressive models. Our instance-dependent characterizations open the door to the design of fine-grained model selection procedures for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., choosing the value of $\lambda$ when running the TD($\lambda$) algorithm).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum neural network architectures that have little-to-no inductive biases are known to face trainability and generalization issues. Inspired by a similar problem, recent breakthroughs in machine learning address this challenge by creating models encoding the symmetries of the learning task. This is materialized through the usage of equivariant neural networks whose action commutes with that of the symmetry. In this work, we import these ideas to the quantum realm by presenting a comprehensive theoretical framework to design equivariant quantum neural networks (EQNN) for essentially any relevant symmetry group. We develop multiple methods to construct equivariant layers for EQNNs and analyze their advantages and drawbacks. Our methods can find unitary or general equivariant quantum channels efficiently even when the symmetry group is exponentially large or continuous. As a special implementation, we show how standard quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNN) can be generalized to group-equivariant QCNNs where both the convolution and pooling layers are equivariant to the symmetry group. We then numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of a SU(2)-equivariant QCNN over symmetry-agnostic QCNN on a classification task of phases of matter in the bond-alternating Heisenberg model. Our framework can be readily applied to virtually all areas of quantum machine learning. Lastly, we discuss about how symmetry-informed models such as EQNNs provide hopes to alleviate central challenges such as barren plateaus, poor local minima, and sample complexity.</description>

Abstract: Generalization is the ability of machine learning models to make accurate predictions on new data by learning from training data. However, understanding generalization of quantum machine learning models has been a major challenge. Here, we introduce the data quantum Fisher information metric (DQFIM). It describes the capacity of variational quantum algorithms depending on variational ansatz, training data and their symmetries. We apply the DQFIM to quantify circuit parameters and training data needed to successfully train and generalize. Using the dynamical Lie algebra, we explain how to generalize using a low number of training states. Counter-intuitively, breaking symmetries of the training data can help to improve generalization. Finally, we find that out-of-distribution generalization, where training and testing data are drawn from different data distributions, can be better than using the same distribution. Our work provides a useful framework to explore the power of quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Learning Active Subspaces and Discovering Important Features with Gaussian Radial Basis Functions Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Providing a model that achieves a strong predictive performance and is simultaneously interpretable by humans is one of the most difficult challenges in machine learning research due to the conflicting nature of these two objectives. To address this challenge, we propose a modification of the radial basis function neural network model by equipping its Gaussian kernel with a learnable precision matrix. We show that precious information is contained in the spectrum of the precision matrix that can be extracted once the training of the model is completed. In particular, the eigenvectors explain the directions of maximum sensitivity of the model revealing the active subspace and suggesting potential applications for supervised dimensionality reduction. At the same time, the eigenvectors highlight the relationship in terms of absolute variation between the input and the latent variables, thereby allowing us to extract a ranking of the input variables based on their importance to the prediction task enhancing the model interpretability. We conducted numerical experiments for regression, classification, and feature selection tasks, comparing our model against popular machine learning models, the state-of-the-art deep learning-based embedding feature selection techniques, and a transformer model for tabular data. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model does not only yield an attractive prediction performance compared to the competitors but also provides meaningful and interpretable results that potentially could assist the decision-making process in real-world applications. A PyTorch implementation of the model is available on GitHub at the following link. https://github.com/dannyzx/Gaussian-RBFNN</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the large research effort devoted to learning dependencies between time series, the state of the art still faces a major limitation: existing methods learn partial correlations but fail to discriminate across distinct frequency bands. Motivated by many applications in which this differentiation is pivotal, we overcome this limitation by learning a block-sparse, frequency-dependent, partial correlation graph, in which layers correspond to different frequency bands, and partial correlations can occur over just a few layers. To this aim, we formulate and solve two nonconvex learning problems: the first has a closed-form solution and is suitable when there is prior knowledge about the number of partial correlations; the second hinges on an iterative solution based on successive convex approximation, and is effective for the general case where no prior knowledge is available. Numerical results on synthetic data show that the proposed methods outperform the current state of the art. Finally, the analysis of financial time series confirms that partial correlations exist only within a few frequency bands, underscoring how our methods enable the gaining of valuable insights that would be undetected without discriminating along the frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Calibrating dimension reduction hyperparameters in the presence of noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02946v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of dimension reduction tools is to construct a low-dimensional representation of high-dimensional data. These tools are employed for a variety of reasons such as noise reduction, visualization, and to lower computational costs. However, there is a fundamental issue that is discussed in other modeling problems that is often overlooked in dimension reduction -- overfitting. In the context of other modeling problems, techniques such as feature-selection, cross-validation, and regularization are employed to combat overfitting, but rarely are such precautions taken when applying dimension reduction. Prior applications of the two most popular non-linear dimension reduction methods, t-SNE and UMAP, fail to acknowledge data as a combination of signal and noise when assessing performance. These methods are typically calibrated to capture the entirety of the data, not just the signal. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of acknowledging noise when calibrating hyperparameters and present a framework that enables users to do so. We use this framework to explore the role hyperparameter calibration plays in overfitting the data when applying t-SNE and UMAP. More specifically, we show previously recommended values for perplexity and n_neighbors are too small and overfit the noise. We also provide a workflow others may use to calibrate hyperparameters in the presence of noise.</description>

      <title>Prospects for AI-Enhanced ECG as a Unified Screening Tool for Cardiac and Non-Cardiac Conditions -- An Explorative Study in Emergency Care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11050</link>

Abstract: Current deep learning algorithms designed for automatic ECG analysis have exhibited notable accuracy. However, akin to traditional electrocardiography, they tend to be narrowly focused and typically address a singular diagnostic condition. In this exploratory study, we specifically investigate the capability of a single model to predict a diverse range of both cardiac and non-cardiac discharge diagnoses based on a sole ECG collected in the emergency department. We find that 253, 81 cardiac, and 172 non-cardiac, ICD codes can be reliably predicted in the sense of exceeding an AUROC score of 0.8 in a statistically significant manner. This underscores the model's proficiency in handling a wide array of cardiac and non-cardiac diagnostic scenarios which demonstrates potential as a screening tool for diverse medical encounters.</description>

      <title>Deeper or Wider: A Perspective from Optimal Generalization Error with Sobolev Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing the architecture of a neural network is a challenging pursuit for the machine learning community, and the dilemma of whether to go deeper or wider remains a persistent question. This paper explores a comparison between deeper neural networks (DeNNs) with a flexible number of layers and wider neural networks (WeNNs) with limited hidden layers, focusing on their optimal generalization error in Sobolev losses. Analytical investigations reveal that the architecture of a neural network can be significantly influenced by various factors, including the number of sample points, parameters within the neural networks, and the regularity of the loss function. Specifically, a higher number of parameters tends to favor WeNNs, while an increased number of sample points and greater regularity in the loss function lean towards the adoption of DeNNs. We ultimately apply this theory to address partial differential equations using deep Ritz and physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods, guiding the design of neural networks.</description>

      <title>HyperAgent: A Simple, Scalable, Efficient and Provable Reinforcement Learning Framework for Complex Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10228v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To solve complex tasks under resource constraints, reinforcement learning (RL) agents need to be simple, efficient, and scalable, addressing (1) large state spaces and (2) the continuous accumulation of interaction data. We propose HyperAgent, an RL framework featuring the hypermodel and index sampling schemes that enable computation-efficient incremental approximation for the posteriors associated with general value functions without the need for conjugacy, and data-efficient action selection. Implementing HyperAgent is straightforward, requiring only one additional module beyond what is necessary for Double-DQN. HyperAgent stands out as the first method to offer robust performance in large-scale deep RL benchmarks while achieving provably scalable per-step computational complexity and attaining sublinear regret under tabular assumptions. HyperAgent can solve Deep Sea hard exploration problems with episodes that optimally scale with problem size and exhibits significant efficiency gains in both data and computation under the Atari benchmark. The core of our theoretical analysis is the sequential posterior approximation argument, enabled by the first analytical tool for sequential random projection -- a non-trivial martingale extension of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss. This work bridges the theoretical and practical realms of RL, establishing a new benchmark for RL algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Probability Tools for Sequential Random Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the first probabilistic framework tailored for sequential random projection, an approach rooted in the challenges of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. The analysis is complicated by the sequential dependence and high-dimensional nature of random variables, a byproduct of the adaptive mechanisms inherent in sequential decision processes. Our work features a novel construction of a stopped process, facilitating the analysis of a sequence of concentration events that are interconnected in a sequential manner. By employing the method of mixtures within a self-normalized process, derived from the stopped process, we achieve a desired non-asymptotic probability bound. This bound represents a non-trivial martingale extension of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, marking a pioneering contribution to the literature on random projection and sequential analysis.</description>

      <title>Learning to Defer to a Population: A Meta-Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The learning to defer (L2D) framework allows autonomous systems to be safe and robust by allocating difficult decisions to a human expert. All existing work on L2D assumes that each expert is well-identified, and if any expert were to change, the system should be re-trained. In this work, we alleviate this constraint, formulating an L2D system that can cope with never-before-seen experts at test-time. We accomplish this by using meta-learning, considering both optimization- and model-based variants. Given a small context set to characterize the currently available expert, our framework can quickly adapt its deferral policy. For the model-based approach, we employ an attention mechanism that is able to look for points in the context set that are similar to a given test point, leading to an even more precise assessment of the expert's abilities. In the experiments, we validate our methods on image recognition, traffic sign detection, and skin lesion diagnosis benchmarks.</description>

      <title>DTOR: Decision Tree Outlier Regressor to explain anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10903v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explaining outliers occurrence and mechanism of their occurrence can be extremely important in a variety of domains. Malfunctions, frauds, threats, in addition to being correctly identified, oftentimes need a valid explanation in order to effectively perform actionable counteracts. The ever more widespread use of sophisticated Machine Learning approach to identify anomalies make such explanations more challenging. We present the Decision Tree Outlier Regressor (DTOR), a technique for producing rule-based explanations for individual data points by estimating anomaly scores generated by an anomaly detection model. This is accomplished by first applying a Decision Tree Regressor, which computes the estimation score, and then extracting the relative path associated with the data point score. Our results demonstrate the robustness of DTOR even in datasets with a large number of features. Additionally, in contrast to other rule-based approaches, the generated rules are consistently satisfied by the points to be explained. Furthermore, our evaluation metrics indicate comparable performance to Anchors in outlier explanation tasks, with reduced execution time.</description>
