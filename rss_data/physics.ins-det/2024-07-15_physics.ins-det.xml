      <title>The Solar eruptioN Integral Field Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar eruptioN Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) is a solar-gazing spectrograph scheduled to fly in the summer of 2025 on a NASA sounding rocket. Its goal is to view the solar chromosphere and transition region at a high cadence (1s) both spatially (0.5") and spectrally (33 m{\AA}) viewing wavelengths around Lyman Alpha (1216 {\AA}), Si iii (1206 {\AA}) and O v (1218 {\AA}) to observe spicules, nanoflares, and possibly a solar flare. This time cadence will provide yet-unobserved detail about fast-changing features of the Sun. The instrument is comprised of a Gregorian-style reflecting telescope combined with a spectrograph via a specialized mirrorlet array that focuses the light from each spatial location in the image so that it may be spectrally dispersed without overlap from neighboring locations. This paper discusses the driving science, detailed instrument and subsystem design, and pre-integration testing of the SNIFS instrument.</description>

      <title>Decay Energy Spectrometry for Improved Nuclear Material Analysis at the IAEA NML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decay energy spectrometry (DES) is a novel radiometric technique for high-precision analysis of nuclear materials. DES employs the unique thermal detection physics of cryogenic microcalorimeters with ultra-high energy resolution and 100$\%$ detection efficiency to accomplish high precision decay energy measurements. Low-activity nuclear samples of 1 Bq or less, and without chemical separation, are used to provide elemental and isotopic compositions in a single measurement. Isotopic ratio precisions of 1 ppm - 1,000 ppm (isotope dependent), which is close to that of the mass spectrometry, have been demonstrated in 12-hour DES measurements of ~5 Bq samples of certified reference materials of uranium (U) and plutonium (Pu). DES has very different systematic biases and uncertainties, as well as different sensitivities to nuclides, compared to mass-spectrometry techniques. Therefore, the accuracy and confidence of nuclear material assays can be improved by combining this new technique with existing mass-spectrometry techniques. Commercial-level DES techniques and equipment are being developed for the implementation of DES at the Nuclear Material Laboratory (NML) of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to provide complementary measurements to the existing technologies. The paper describes details of DES measurement methods, as well as DES precision and accuracy to U and Pu standard sources to discuss its capability in analysis of nuclear safeguards samples.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology of low frequency electromagnetic modes with frequency upconverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the RF Quantum Upconverter (RQU) and describe its application to quantum metrology of electromagnetic modes between dc and the Very High Frequency band (VHF) ($\lesssim$300MHz). The RQU uses a Josephson interferometer made up of superconducting loops and Josephson junctions to implement a parametric interaction between a low-frequency electromagnetic mode (between dc and VHF) and a mode in the microwave C Band ($\sim$ 5GHz), analogous to the radiation pressure interaction between electromagnetic and mechanical modes in cavity optomechanics. We analyze RQU performance with quantum amplifier theory, and show that the RQU can operate as a quantum-limited op-amp in this frequency range. It can also use non-classical measurement protocols equivalent to those used in cavity optomechanics, including back-action evading (BAE) measurements, sideband cooling, and two-mode squeezing. These protocols enable experiments using dc--VHF electromagnetic modes as quantum sensors with sensitivity better than the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). We demonstrate signal upconversion from low frequencies to microwave C band using an RQU and show a phase-sensitive gain (extinction ratio) of $46.9$\;dB, which is a necessary step towards the realization of full BAE.</description>
