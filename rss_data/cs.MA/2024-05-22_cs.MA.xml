      <title>Review on modeling the societal impact of infrastructure disruptions due to disasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrastructure systems play a critical role in providing essential products and services for the functioning of modern society; however, they are vulnerable to disasters and their service disruptions can cause severe societal impacts. To protect infrastructure from disasters and reduce potential impacts, great achievements have been made in modeling interdependent infrastructure systems in past decades. In recent years, scholars have gradually shifted their research focus to understanding and modeling societal impacts of disruptions considering the fact that infrastructure systems are critical because of their role in societal functioning, especially under situations of modern societies. Exploring how infrastructure disruptions impair society to enhance resilient city has become a key field of study. By comprehensively reviewing relevant studies, this paper demonstrated the definition and types of societal impact of infrastructure disruptions, and summarized the modeling approaches into four types: extended infrastructure modeling approaches, empirical approaches, agent-based approaches, and big data-driven approaches. For each approach, this paper organized relevant literature in terms of modeling ideas, advantages, and disadvantages. Furthermore, the four approaches were compared according to several criteria, including the input data, types of societal impact, and application scope. Finally, this paper illustrated the challenges and future research directions in the field.</description>

      <title>Fully Distributed Fog Load Balancing with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time Internet of Things (IoT) applications require real-time support to handle the ever-growing demand for computing resources to process IoT workloads. Fog Computing provides high availability of such resources in a distributed manner. However, these resources must be efficiently managed to distribute unpredictable traffic demands among heterogeneous Fog resources. This paper proposes a fully distributed load-balancing solution with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) that intelligently distributes IoT workloads to optimize the waiting time while providing fair resource utilization in the Fog network. These agents use transfer learning for life-long self-adaptation to dynamic changes in the environment. By leveraging distributed decision-making, MARL agents effectively minimize the waiting time compared to a single centralized agent solution and other baselines, enhancing end-to-end execution delay. Besides performance gain, a fully distributed solution allows for a global-scale implementation where agents can work independently in small collaboration regions, leveraging nearby local resources. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of a realistic frequency to observe the state of the environment, unlike the unrealistic common assumption in the literature of having observations readily available in real-time for every required action. The findings highlight the trade-off between realism and performance using an interval-based Gossip-based multi-casting protocol against assuming real-time observation availability for every generated workload.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Enabled Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading for Dairy Farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Farm businesses are increasingly adopting renewables to enhance energy efficiency and reduce reliance on fossil fuels and the grid. This shift aims to decrease dairy farms' dependence on traditional electricity grids by enabling the sale of surplus renewable energy in Peer-to-Peer markets. However, the dynamic nature of farm communities poses challenges, requiring specialized algorithms for P2P energy trading. To address this, the Multi-Agent Peer-to-Peer Dairy Farm Energy Simulator (MAPDES) has been developed, providing a platform to experiment with Reinforcement Learning techniques. The simulations demonstrate significant cost savings, including a 43% reduction in electricity expenses, a 42% decrease in peak demand, and a 1.91% increase in energy sales compared to baseline scenarios lacking peer-to-peer energy trading or renewable energy sources.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Social Norms in Generative Agent Societies: Principles and Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social norms play a crucial role in guiding agents towards understanding and adhering to standards of behavior, thus reducing social conflicts within multi-agent systems (MASs). However, current LLM-based (or generative) MASs lack the capability to be normative. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, named CRSEC, to empower the emergence of social norms within generative MASs. Our architecture consists of four modules: Creation &amp; Representation, Spreading, Evaluation, and Compliance. This addresses several important aspects of the emergent processes all in one: (i) where social norms come from, (ii) how they are formally represented, (iii) how they spread through agents' communications and observations, (iv) how they are examined with a sanity check and synthesized in the long term, and (v) how they are incorporated into agents' planning and actions. Our experiments deployed in the Smallville sandbox game environment demonstrate the capability of our architecture to establish social norms and reduce social conflicts within generative MASs. The positive outcomes of our human evaluation, conducted with 30 evaluators, further affirm the effectiveness of our approach.
