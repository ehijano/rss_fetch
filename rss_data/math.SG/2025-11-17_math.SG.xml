      <title>A lower bound for the radius of Weinstein's Lagrangian tubular neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an immersed Lagrangian submanifold $L$ in a K\"ahler manifold $(M,\omega)$, there exists a symplectic local diffeomorphism from a tubular neighborhood of the image of the zero section in the normal bundle $T^{\bot}L$ of $L$, equipped with a canonical symplectic form $\tilde{\omega}$, to $(M,\omega)$ whose restriction to $L$ is the identity map by Weinstein's Lagrangian tubular neighborhood theorem, where the image of the zero section in $T^{\bot}L$ is identified with $L$. In this paper, we give a lower bound for the supremum of the radii of tubular neighborhoods that have such a symplectic diffeomorphism into $(M,\omega)$ from below by a constant explicitly given in terms of up to second derivatives of the Riemannian curvature tensor of $M$ and the second fundamental form of $L$. We also give a similar lower bound in the case where $L$ is compact and embedded.</description>

      <title>Persistence of unknottedness of clean Lagrangian intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $Q_0$ and $Q_1$ be two Lagrangian spheres in a $6$-dimensional symplectic manifold. Assume that $Q_0$ and $Q_1$ intersect cleanly along a circle that is unknotted in both $Q_0$ and $Q_1$. We prove that there is no nearby Hamiltonian isotopy of $Q_0$ and $Q_1$ to a pair of Lagrangian spheres meeting cleanly along a circle that is knotted in either component, answering a question of Smith. The proof is based on a classification of the spherical summands in the prime decomposition of an exact Lagrangian in the Stein neighborhood of the union $Q_0\cup Q_1$ and the deep result that lens space rational Dehn surgeries characterize the unknot.</description>

      <title>On functoriality of Baum-Bott residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the functoriality of Baum--Bott residues under certain conditions. As an application, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a holomorphic foliation, of dimension $k\leq n/2$, on a (possibly non-compact) complex manifold $X$ of dimension \(n\), then its singular set $Sing(\mathcal{F})$ has dimension $\dim(Sing(\mathcal{F}))\geq k-1$. This result addresses a longstanding question by Baum and Bott regarding the functoriality of residues. Also, This provides answers to questions posed by Cerveau and Lins Neto concerning foliations of dimension 2 in $\mathbb{C}^4$ and Druel regarding holomorphic foliations on projective manifolds. Furthermore, it confirms the Beauville-Bondal conjecture for the maximal degeneracy locus of Poisson structures. Specifically, if $X$ is a (possibly non-compact) complex Poisson manifold with generic rank $ r \leq n/2$, and the degeneracy locus $X \setminus X_r$ is non-empty, then it contains a component of dimension $ &gt; r - 2 $</description>

      <title>Positivity of Boundary Intersections of Complex Curves and Adjunction Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the goals of this paper is to prove that the index of intersection of two complex curves in a two-dimensional complex manifold tangent to each other at a common boundary point is positive. This is achieved via the construction of a totally real surface such that the curves in question are attached to it by some parts of their boundaries and then defining a certain ``boundary intersection index'' of two complex ``half-disks'' with their edges on a totally real surface. We prove that this index is always positive. This second result holds true, more generally, for complex curves in a two dimensional almost complex manifold with boundaries on totally real submanifold, but to our best knowledge is new even for integrable structures, unless the totally real surface in question is supposed to be real analytic. We also formulate and prove the Adjunction Formula for complex curves with boundaries on totally real submanifolds in an almost complex manifold of dimension four.</description>
