      <title>Placement, Orientation, and Resource Allocation Optimization for Cell-Free OIRS-aided OWC Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS) technologies marks a milestone in optical wireless communication (OWC) systems, enabling enhanced control over light propagation in indoor environments. This capability allows for the customization of channel conditions to achieve specific performance goals. This paper presents an enhancement in downlink cell-free OWC networks through the integration of OIRS. The key focus is on fine-tuning crucial parameters, including transmit power, receiver orientations, OIRS elements allocation, and strategic placement. In particular, a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) aimed at simultaneously improving the network's spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) while adhering to the network's quality of service (QoS) constraints is formulated. The problem is solved by employing the $\epsilon$-constraint method to convert the MOOP into a single-objective optimization problem and solving it through successive convex approximation. Simulation results show the significant impact of OIRS on SE and EE, confirming its effectiveness in improving OWC network performance.</description>

      <title>ProtoBeam: Generalizing Deep Beam Prediction to Unseen Antennas using Prototypical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques have recently emerged to efficiently manage mmWave beam transmissions without requiring time consuming beam sweeping strategies. A fundamental challenge in these methods is their dependency on hardware-specific training data and their limited ability to generalize. Large drops in performance are reported in literature when DL models trained in one antenna environment are applied in another. This paper proposes the application of Prototypical Networks to address this challenge and utilizes the DeepBeam real-world dataset to validate the developed solutions. Prototypical Networks excel in extracting features to establish class-specific prototypes during the training, resulting in precise embeddings that encapsulate the defining features of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PN to enable generalization of deep beam predictors across unseen antennas. Our approach, which integrates data normalization and prototype normalization with the PN, achieves an average beam classification accuracy of 74.11 percent when trained and tested on different antenna datasets. This is an improvement of 398 percent compared to baseline performances reported in literature that do not account for such domain shifts. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of the value of Prototypical Networks for domain adaptation in wireless networks, providing a foundation for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>The generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical phase retrieval problem involves estimating a signal from its Fourier magnitudes (power spectrum) by leveraging prior information about the desired signal. This paper extends the problem to compact groups, addressing the recovery of a set of matrices from their Gram matrices. In this broader context, the missing phases in Fourier space are replaced by missing unitary or orthogonal matrices arising from the action of a compact group on a finite-dimensional vector space. This generalization is driven by applications in multi-reference alignment and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, a pivotal technology in structural biology. We define the generalized phase retrieval problem over compact groups and explore its underlying algebraic structure. We survey recent results on the uniqueness of solutions, focusing on the significant class of semialgebraic priors. Furthermore, we present a family of algorithms inspired by classical phase retrieval techniques. Finally, we propose a conjecture on the stability of the problem based on bi-Lipschitz analysis, supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>SelectiveFinetuning: Enhancing Transfer Learning in Sleep Staging through Selective Domain Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical sleep stage classification, a key challenge is the variability of EEG data across different subjects and environments. Differences in physiology, age, health status, and recording conditions can lead to domain shifts between data. These domain shifts often result in decreased model accuracy and reliability, particularly when the model is applied to new data with characteristics different from those it was originally trained on, which is a typical manifestation of negative transfer. To address this, we propose SelectiveFinetuning in this paper. Our method utilizes a pretrained Multi Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (MRCNN) to extract EEG features, capturing the distinctive characteristics of different sleep stages. To mitigate the effect of domain shifts, we introduce a domain aligning mechanism that employs Earth Mover Distance (EMD) to evaluate and select source domain data closely matching the target domain. By finetuning the model with selective source data, our SelectiveFinetuning enhances the model's performance on target domain that exhibits domain shifts compared to the data used for training. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing baselines, offering greater robustness and adaptability in practical scenarios where data distributions are often unpredictable.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS Aided Dynamic Scatterers Tracking for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has become an attractive technology for future wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided dynamic scatterers tracking scheme for ISAC in high mobility millimeter wave communication systems, where the STAR-RIS is employed to provide communication service for indoor user with the base station (BS) and simultaneously sense and track the interested outdoor dynamic scatterers. Specifically, we resort to an active STAR-RIS to respectively receive and further deal with the impinging signal from its double sides at the same time. Then, we develop a transmission strategy with the activation scheme of the STAR-RIS elements, and construct the signal models within the system. After acquiring the channel parameters related to the BS-RIS channel, the dynamic paths can be identified from all the scattering paths, and the dynamic targets can be classified with respect to their radar cross sections. We further track the outdoor scatterers at STAR-RIS by resorting to the Gaussian mixture-probability hypothesis density filter. With the tracked locations of the outdoor scatterers, a beam prediction strategy for both the precoder of BS and the refraction phase shift vector of STAR-RIS is developed to enhance the communication performance of the indoor user. Besides, a target mismatch detection and path collision prediction mechanism is proposed to reduce the training overhead and improve the transmission performance. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed STAR-RIS aided dynamic scatterers tracking scheme for ISAC are demonstrated and verified via simulation results.</description>

      <title>Use Cases for Terahertz Communications: An Industrial Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the vast amount of available resources and unique propagation properties, terahertz (THz) frequency bands are viewed as a key enabler for achieving ultrahigh communication performance and precise sensing capabilities in future wireless systems. Recently, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) initiated an Industry Specification Group (ISG) on THz which aims at establishing the technical foundation for subsequent standardization of this technology, which is pivotal for its successful integration into future networks. Starting from the work recently finalized within this group, this paper provides an industrial perspective on potential use cases and frequency bands of interest for THz communication systems. We first identify promising frequency bands in the 100 GHz - 1 THz range, offering over 500 GHz of available spectrum that can be exploited to unlock the full potential of THz communications. Then, we present key use cases and application areas for THz communications, emphasizing the role of this technology and its advantages over other frequency bands. We discuss their target requirements and show that some applications demand for multi-Tbps data rates, latency below 0.5 ms, and sensing accuracy down to 0.5 cm. Additionally, we identify the main deployment scenarios and outline other enabling technologies crucial for overcoming the challenges faced by THz system. Finally, we summarize the past and ongoing standardization efforts focusing on THz communications, while also providing an outlook towards the inclusion of this technology as an integral part of the future sixth generation (6G) and beyond communication networks.</description>

      <title>Bridging Auditory Perception and Language Comprehension through MEG-Driven Encoding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms behind auditory and linguistic processing is key to advancing cognitive neuroscience. In this study, we use Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data to analyze brain responses to spoken language stimuli. We develop two distinct encoding models: an audio-to-MEG encoder, which uses time-frequency decompositions (TFD) and wav2vec2 latent space representations, and a text-to-MEG encoder, which leverages CLIP and GPT-2 embeddings. Both models successfully predict neural activity, demonstrating significant correlations between estimated and observed MEG signals. However, the text-to-MEG model outperforms the audio-based model, achieving higher Pearson Correlation (PC) score. Spatially, we identify that auditory-based embeddings (TFD and wav2vec2) predominantly activate lateral temporal regions, which are responsible for primary auditory processing and the integration of auditory signals. In contrast, textual embeddings (CLIP and GPT-2) primarily engage the frontal cortex, particularly Broca's area, which is associated with higher-order language processing, including semantic integration and language production, especially in the 8-30 Hz frequency range. The strong involvement of these regions suggests that auditory stimuli are processed through more direct sensory pathways, while linguistic information is encoded via networks that integrate meaning and cognitive control. Our results reveal distinct neural pathways for auditory and linguistic information processing, with higher encoding accuracy for text representations in the frontal regions. These insights refine our understanding of the brain's functional architecture in processing auditory and textual information, offering quantitative advancements in the modelling of neural responses to complex language stimuli.</description>

      <title>A Soft Sensor Method with Uncertainty-Awareness and Self-Explanation Based on Large Language Models Enhanced by Domain Knowledge Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven soft sensors are crucial in predicting key performance indicators in industrial systems. However, current methods predominantly rely on the supervised learning paradigms of parameter updating, which inherently faces challenges such as high development costs, poor robustness, training instability, and lack of interpretability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential across various domains, notably through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables high-performance task execution with minimal input-label demonstrations and no prior training. This paper aims to replace supervised learning with the emerging ICL paradigm for soft sensor modeling to address existing challenges and explore new avenues for advancement. To achieve this, we propose a novel framework called the Few-shot Uncertainty-aware and self-Explaining Soft Sensor (LLM-FUESS), which includes the Zero-shot Auxiliary Variable Selector (LLM-ZAVS) and the Uncertainty-aware Few-shot Soft Sensor (LLM-UFSS). The LLM-ZAVS retrieves from the Industrial Knowledge Vector Storage to enhance LLMs' domain-specific knowledge, enabling zero-shot auxiliary variable selection. In the LLM-UFSS, we utilize text-based context demonstrations of structured data to prompt LLMs to execute ICL for predicting and propose a context sample retrieval augmentation strategy to improve performance. Additionally, we explored LLMs' AIGC and probabilistic characteristics to propose self-explanation and uncertainty quantification methods for constructing a trustworthy soft sensor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieved state-of-the-art predictive performance, strong robustness, and flexibility, effectively mitigates training instability found in traditional methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to establish soft sensor utilizing LLMs.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of short blocklength Reed-Muller codes for coset coding over real environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of Reed-Muller (RM) codes for Physical-layer security in a real world wiretap channel scenario. Utilizing software-defined radios (SDRs) in a real indoor environment, we implement a coset coding scheme that leverages the hierarchical structure of RM codes to secure data transmission. The generator matrix of the RM code is used to partition codewords into cosets in the usual way, where each message corresponds to a unique coset, and auxiliary bits select specific codewords within each coset. This approach enables the legitimate receiver (Bob) can decode the transmitted message with minimal bit error rate (BER), while an eavesdropper (Eve) experiences a high BER, thus protecting the confidentiality of the communication. Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE) is employed to quantify the information leakage and validate the effectiveness of the scheme. Experimental results indicate that RM codes can achieve robust security even in practical environments affected by real-world channel impairments. These findings demonstrate the potential of RM codes as an efficient solution for physical-layer security, particularly for applications that require low latency and short blocklengths.</description>

      <title>Radar Signal Recognition through Self-Supervised Learning and Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic radar signal recognition (RSR) plays a pivotal role in electronic warfare (EW), as accurately classifying radar signals is critical for informing decision-making processes. Recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential in improving RSR performance in domains with ample annotated data. However, these methods fall short in EW scenarios where annotated RF data are scarce or impractical to obtain. To address these challenges, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) method which utilises masked signal modelling and RF domain adaption to enhance RSR performance in environments with limited RF samples and labels. Specifically, we investigate pre-training masked autoencoders (MAE) on baseband in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) signals from various RF domains and subsequently transfer the learned representation to the radar domain, where annotated data are limited. Empirical results show that our lightweight self-supervised ResNet model with domain adaptation achieves up to a 17.5\% improvement in 1-shot classification accuracy when pre-trained on in-domain signals (i.e., radar signals) and up to a 16.31\% improvement when pre-trained on out-of-domain signals (i.e., comm signals), compared to its baseline without SSL. We also provide reference results for several MAE designs and pre-training strategies, establishing a new benchmark for few-shot radar signal classification.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Lightweight Approach to Fault Diagnosis of Induction Motors in High-Dimensional Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate AI-based diagnostic system for induction motors (IMs) holds the potential to enhance proactive maintenance, mitigating unplanned downtime and curbing overall maintenance costs within an industrial environment. Notably, among the prevalent faults in IMs, a Broken Rotor Bar (BRB) fault is frequently encountered. Researchers have proposed various fault diagnosis approaches using signal processing (SP), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and hybrid architectures for BRB faults. One limitation in the existing literature is the training of these architectures on relatively small datasets, risking overfitting when implementing such systems in industrial environments. This paper addresses this limitation by implementing large-scale data of BRB faults by using a transfer-learning-based lightweight DL model named ShuffleNetV2 for diagnosing one, two, three, and four BRB faults using current and vibration signal data. Spectral images for training and testing are generated using a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The dataset comprises 57,500 images, with 47,500 used for training and 10,000 for testing. Remarkably, the ShuffleNetV2 model exhibited superior performance, in less computational cost as well as accurately classifying 98.856% of spectral images. To further enhance the visualization of harmonic sidebands resulting from broken bars, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to current and vibration data. The paper also provides insights into the training and testing times for each model, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the proposed fault diagnosis methodology. The findings of our research provide valuable insights into the performance and efficiency of different ML and DL models, offering a foundation for the development of robust fault diagnosis systems for induction motors in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Channel Coding based on Skew Polynomials and Multivariate Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation considers new constructions and decoding approaches for error-correcting codes based on non-conventional polynomials, with the objective of providing new coding solutions to the applications mentioned above. With skew polynomials, we construct codes that are dual-containing, which is a desired property of quantum error-correcting codes. By considering evaluation codes based on skew polynomials, a condition on the existence of optimal support-constrained codes is derived and an application of such codes in the distributed multi-source networks is proposed. For a class of multicast networks, the advantage of vector network coding compared to scalar network coding is investigated. Multivariate polynomials have been attracting increasing interest in constructing codes with repair capabilities by accessing only a small amount of available symbols, which is required to build failure-resistant distributed storage systems. A new class of bivariate evaluation codes and their local recovery capability are studied. Interestingly, the well-known Reed-Solomon codes are used in a class of locally recoverable codes with availability (multiple disjoint recovery sets) via subspace design. Aside from new constructions, decoding approaches are considered in order to increase the error correction capability in the case where the code is fixed. In particular, new lower and upper bounds on the success probability of joint decoding interleaved alternant codes by a syndrome-based decoder are derived, where alternant codes are an important class of algebraic codes containing Goppa codes, BCH codes, and Reed-Muller codes as sub-classes.</description>

      <title>Understanding Concepts in Graph Signal Processing for Neurophysiological Signal Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate signals, which are measured simultaneously over time and acquired by sensor networks, are becoming increasingly common. The emerging field of graph signal processing (GSP) promises to analyse spectral characteristics of these multivariate signals, while at the same time taking the spatial structure between the time signals into account. A central idea in GSP is the graph Fourier transform, which projects a multivariate signal onto frequency-ordered graph Fourier modes, and can therefore be regarded as a spatial analog of the temporal Fourier transform. This chapter derives and discusses key concepts in GSP, with a specific focus on how the various concepts relate to one another. The experimental section focuses on the role of graph frequency in data classification, with applications to neuroimaging. To address the limited sample size of neurophysiological datasets, we introduce a minimalist simulation framework that can generate arbitrary amounts of data. Using this artificial data, we find that lower graph frequency signals are less suitable for classifying neurophysiological data as compared to higher graph frequency signals. Finally, we introduce a baseline testing framework for GSP. Employing this framework, our results suggest that GSP applications may attenuate spectral characteristics in the signals, highlighting current limitations of GSP for neuroimaging.</description>

      <title>Achieving Distributed MIMO Performance with Repeater-Assisted Cellular Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In what ways could cellular massive MIMO be improved? This technology has already been shown to bring huge performance gains. However, coverage holes and difficulties to transmit multiple streams to multi-antenna users because of insufficient channel rank remain issues. Distributed MIMO, also known as cell-free massive MIMO, might be the ultimate solution. However, while being a powerful technology, it is expensive to install backhaul, and it is a difficult problem to achieve accurate phase alignment for coherent multi-user beamforming on downlink. Another option is reflective intelligent surfaces - but they have large form factors and require a lot of training and control overhead, and probably, in practice, some form of active filtering to make them sufficiently band-selective.
  We propose a new approach to densification of cellular systems, envisioning repeater-assisted cellular massive MIMO, where a large numbers of physically small and cheap wireless repeaters are deployed. They receive and retransmit signals instantaneously, appearing as active scatterers. Meaning that they appear as ordinary channel scatterers but with amplification. We elaborate on the requirements of such repeaters, show that the performance of these systems could potentially approach that of distributed MIMO, and outline future research directions.</description>

      <title>Fast Structured Orthogonal Dictionary Learning using Householder Reflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and investigate algorithms for the structured orthogonal dictionary learning problem. First, we investigate the case when the dictionary is a Householder matrix. We give sample complexity results and show theoretically guaranteed approximate recovery (in the $l_{\infty}$ sense) with optimal computational complexity. We then attempt to generalize these techniques when the dictionary is a product of a few Householder matrices. We numerically validate these techniques in the sample-limited setting to show performance similar to or better than existing techniques while having much improved computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Constrained Stochastic Recursive Momentum Successive Convex Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic optimization problems with non-convex functional constraints, such as those arising in trajectory generation, sparse approximation, and robust classification. To this end, we put forth a recursive momentum-based accelerated successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. At each iteration, the proposed algorithm entails constructing convex surrogates of the stochastic objective and the constraint functions, and solving the resulting convex optimization problem. A recursive update rule is employed to track the gradient of the stochastic objective function, which contributes to variance reduction and hence accelerates the algorithm convergence. A key ingredient of the proof is a new parameterized version of the standard Mangasarian-Fromowitz Constraints Qualification, that allows us to bound the dual variables and hence obtain problem-dependent bounds on the rate at which the iterates approach an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal stochastic first-order (SFO) complexity with adaptive step sizes and optimal SFO complexity with non-adaptive step sizes at par with that achieved by state-of-the-art stochastic optimization algorithms for solving unconstrained problems. As an example, we detail a obstacle-avoiding trajectory optimization problem that can be solved using the proposed algorithm and show that its performance is superior to that of the existing algorithms used for trajectory optimization. The performance of the proposed algorithm is also shown to be comparable to that of a specialized sparse classification algorithm applied to a binary classification problem.</description>

      <title>Neural Speech and Audio Coding: Modern AI Technology Meets Traditional Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of model-based and data-driven approaches within the realm of neural speech and audio coding systems. It highlights the challenges posed by the subjective evaluation processes of speech and audio codecs and discusses the limitations of purely data-driven approaches, which often require inefficiently large architectures to match the performance of model-based methods. The study presents hybrid systems as a viable solution, offering significant improvements to the performance of conventional codecs through meticulously chosen design enhancements. Specifically, it introduces a neural network-based signal enhancer designed to post-process existing codecs' output, along with the autoencoder-based end-to-end models and LPCNet--hybrid systems that combine linear predictive coding (LPC) with neural networks. Furthermore, the paper delves into predictive models operating within custom feature spaces (TF-Codec) or predefined transform domains (MDCTNet) and examines the use of psychoacoustically calibrated loss functions to train end-to-end neural audio codecs. Through these investigations, the paper demonstrates the potential of hybrid systems to advance the field of speech and audio coding by bridging the gap between traditional model-based approaches and modern data-driven techniques.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent F-Numbers Suppress Grating Lobes and Improve the Lateral Resolution in Line-by-Line Scanning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Line-by-line scanning with linear arrays is a standard image formation method in clinical ultrasound. This method examines progressively a given region of interest by conducting focused pulse-echo measurements with dynamic transmit and receive apertures. Such apertures widen with the focal length as a function of a given F-number and improve the image quality by extending the depth of field (DOF) and suppressing grating lobes. Fixed F-numbers, however, limit the lateral resolution. Herein, frequency dependence of the F-number is incorporated into both the transmit and the receive focusing to widen the apertures for low frequencies and improve the lateral resolution. Frequency-dependent transmit and receive F-numbers are proposed. These F-numbers, which can be expressed in closed form, maximize the lateral resolution under constraints on the DOF and the grating lobes. A phantom experiment showed that the proposed F-numbers eliminate grating lobe artifacts and improve both image uniformity and contrast to a similar extent as fixed F-numbers. These metrics, compared to the usage of the full apertures, improved by up to 14.1 % and 8.3 %, respectively. The proposed F-numbers, however, improved the lateral resolution by up to 24 % compared to the fixed F-numbers.</description>

      <title>KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wireless Sensing via Local Distribution Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of 6G wireless technologies is rapidly advancing, with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) entering the pre-standardization phase and aiming to deliver the first specifications by 2028. This paper explores the OpenAirInterface (OAI) project, an open-source initiative that plays a crucial role in the evolution of 5G and the future 6G networks. OAI provides a comprehensive implementation of 3GPP and O-RAN compliant networks, including Radio Access Network (RAN), Core Network (CN), and software-defined User Equipment (UE) components. The paper details the history and evolution of OAI, its licensing model, and the various projects under its umbrella, such as RAN, the CN, as well as the Operations, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) projects. It also highlights the development methodology, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) processes, and end-to-end systems powered by OAI. Furthermore, the paper discusses the potential of OAI for 6G research, focusing on spectrum, reflective intelligent surfaces, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) integration. The open-source approach of OAI is emphasized as essential for tackling the challenges of 6G, fostering community collaboration, and driving innovation in next-generation wireless technologies.</description>

      <title>Data-driven tool wear prediction in milling, based on a process-integrated single-sensor approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate tool wear prediction is essential for maintaining productivity and minimizing costs in machining. However, the complex nature of the tool wear process poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. This study explores data-driven methods, in particular deep learning, for tool wear prediction. Traditional data-driven approaches often focus on a single process, relying on multi-sensor setups and extensive data generation, which limits generalization to new settings. Moreover, multi-sensor integration is often impractical in industrial environments. To address these limitations, this research investigates the transferability of predictive models using minimal training data, validated across two processes. Furthermore, it uses a simple setup with a single acceleration sensor to establish a low-cost data generation approach that facilitates the generalization of models to other processes via transfer learning. The study evaluates several machine learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees, trained on different input formats such as feature vectors and short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The performance of the models is evaluated on different amounts of training data, including scenarios with significantly reduced datasets, providing insight into their effectiveness under constrained data conditions. The results demonstrate the potential of specific models and configurations for effective tool wear prediction, contributing to the development of more adaptable and efficient predictive maintenance strategies in machining. Notably, the ConvNeXt model has an exceptional performance, achieving an 99.1% accuracy in identifying tool wear using data from only four milling tools operated until they are worn.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) and movable antenna (MA) have recently emerged as promising technologies to exploit new spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), which have attracted growing attention in wireless communication. In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed antennas, the proposed RA system can flexibly alter the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna independently by adjusting its deflection angles to achieve a desired array directional gain pattern. Specifically, we investigate an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs at the base station (BS) are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal deflection angles of RAs are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the BS. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance with an infinite number of antennas based on this solution, which theoretically proves that the RA system can achieve a higher array gain as compared to the fixed-antenna system. In the general multi-user and multi-path channel setup, we first propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of RAs in an iterative manner. Then, a two-stage algorithm that solves the formulated problem without the need for iteration is further proposed to reduce computational complexity. Simulation results are provided to validate our analytical results and demonstrate that the proposed RA system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.</description>
