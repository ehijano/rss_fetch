      <title>Homology and homotopy for arbitrary categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the prime motivation for topology was Homotopy theory, which captures the general idea of a continuous transformation between two entities, which may be spaces or maps. In later decades, an algebraic formulation of topology was discovered with the development of Homology theory. Some of the deepest results in topology are about the connections between Homotopy and Homology. These results are proved using intricate constructions. This paper takes an axiomatic approach that provides a common ground for homotopy and homology in arbitrary categories. The axioms have simple and natural motivations, and lead to the deeper connections between homotopy and homology.</description>

      <title>Straightening for lax transformations and adjunctions of $(\infty,2)$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an unstraightening result for lax transformations between functors from an arbitrary $(\infty,2)$-category to that of $(\infty,2)$-categories. We apply this to study partially (op)lax and weighted (co)limits, giving fibrational descriptions of such (co)limits for diagrams valued in $(\infty,2)$-categories, to characterize adjoints in $(\infty,2)$-categories of functors and (op)lax transformations, and to prove a mate correspondence between lax transformations that are componentwise right adjoints and oplax transformations that are componentwise left adjoints, for such transformations among functors between arbitrary $(\infty,2)$-categories.</description>

      <title>Parametricity via Cohesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametricity is a key metatheoretic property of type systems, which implies strong uniformity &amp; modularity properties of the structure of types within systems possessing it. In recent years, various systems of dependent type theory have emerged with the aim of expressing such parametric reasoning in their internal logic, toward the end of solving various problems arising from the complexity of higher-dimensional coherence conditions in type theory. This paper presents a first step toward the unification, simplification, and extension of these various methods for internalizing parametricity. Specifically, I argue that there is an essentially modal aspect of parametricity, which is intimately connected with the category-theoretic concept of cohesion. On this basis, I describe a general categorical semantics for modal parametricity, develop a corresponding framework of axioms (with computational interpretations) in dependent type theory that can be used to internally represent and reason about such parametricity, and show this in practice by implementing these axioms in Agda and using them to verify parametricity theorems therein. I then demonstrate the utility of these axioms in managing the complexity of higher-dimensional coherence by deriving induction principles for higher inductive types, and in closing, I sketch the outlines of a more general synthetic theory of parametricity, with applications in domains ranging from homotopy type theory to the analysis of program modules.</description>

      <title>Morphisms of pre-Calabi-Yau categories and morphisms of cyclic $A_{\infty}$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13661v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove that there exists a relation between $d$-pre-Calabi-Yau morphisms introduced by M. Kontsevich, A. Takeda and Y. Vlassopoulos and cyclic $A_{\infty}$-morphisms, extending a result proved by D. Fern\'andez and E. Herscovich. This leads to a functor between the category of $d$-pre-Calabi-Yau structures and the partial category of $A_{\infty}$-categories of the form $\mathcal{A}\oplus\mathcal{A}^*[d-1]$ with $\mathcal{A}$ a graded quiver and whose morphisms are the data of an $A_{\infty}$-structure on $\mathcal{A}\oplus\mathcal{B}^*[d-1]$ together with $A_{\infty}$-morphisms $\mathcal{A}[1]\oplus\mathcal{B}^*[d]\rightarrow \mathcal{A}[1]\oplus\mathcal{A}^*[d]$ and $\mathcal{A}[1]\oplus\mathcal{B}^*[d]\rightarrow \mathcal{B}[1]\oplus\mathcal{B}^*[d]$.</description>
