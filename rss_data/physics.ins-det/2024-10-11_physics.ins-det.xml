      <title>Low-Threshold Response of a Scintillating Xenon Bubble Chamber to Nuclear and Electronic Recoils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A device filled with pure xenon first demonstrated the ability to operate simultaneously as a bubble chamber and scintillation detector in 2017. Initial results from data taken at thermodynamic thresholds down to ~4 keV showed sensitivity to ~20 keV nuclear recoils with no observable bubble nucleation by $\gamma$-ray interactions. This paper presents results from further operation of the same device at thermodynamic thresholds as low as 0.50 keV, hardware limited. The bubble chamber has now been shown to have sensitivity to ~1 keV nuclear recoils while remaining insensitive to bubble nucleation by $\gamma$-rays. A robust calibration of the chamber's nuclear recoil nucleation response, as a function of nuclear recoil energy and thermodynamic state, is presented. Stringent upper limits are established for the probability of bubble nucleation by $\gamma$-ray-induced Auger cascades, with a limit of $&lt;1.1\times10^{-6}$ set at 0.50 keV, the lowest thermodynamic threshold explored.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Particle Flow Energy Distribution Using Deep Learning Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, extracting information from complex detector signals is crucial for energy reconstruction. Recent advancements involve using deep learning to process calorimeter images from various sub-detectors in experiments like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for energy map reconstruction. This paper compares classical algorithms\-MLP, CNN, U-Net, and RNN\-with variants that include self-attention and 3D convolution modules to evaluate their effectiveness in reconstructing the initial energy distribution. Additionally, a test dataset of jet events is utilized to analyze and compare models' performance in handling anomalous high-energy events. The analysis highlights the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for energy image reconstruction and explores their potential in this area.</description>

      <title>The muon beam monitor for the FAMU experiment: design, simulation, test and operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FAMU is an INFN-led muonic atom physics experiment based at the RIKEN-RAL muon facility at the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source (United Kingdom). The aim of FAMU is to measure the hyperfine splitting in muonic hydrogen to determine the value of the proton Zemach radius with accuracy better than 1%.The experiment has a scintillating-fibre hodoscope for beam monitoring and data normalisation. In order to carry out muon flux estimation, low-rate measurements were performed to extract the single-muon average deposited charge. Then, detector simulation in Geant4 and FLUKA allowed a thorough understanding of the single-muon response function, crucial for determining the muon flux. This work presents the design features of the FAMU beam monitor, along with the simulation and absolute calibration measurements in order to enable flux determination and enable data normalisation.</description>

      <title>Efficient representation learning of scintillation signal characteristics with spectrum-inspired temporal neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear radiation detectors based on scintillators are widely used in particle and high energy physics experiments, nuclear medicine imaging, industrial and environmental detection, etc. Precisely extracting scintillation signal characteristics at the event level is important for these applications, not only in respect of understanding the scintillator itself, but also kinds and physical property of incident particles. Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks are superior to traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation signal characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. By directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals without data embedding, including the zero-frequency component, adjusting convolution scheme for low-frequency components, and unbiasedly re-weighting features from different frequencies, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea on simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and on experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models without representation learning.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the sensitivity of a temperature sensor based on germanium-vacancy color center (GeV) in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature sensors based on GeV color center in diamond are attracting a lot of attention in both science and industry. The industrial adoption of these sensors nevertheless, requires the simplest and cheapest possible design for the sensing element. The original sensor design was based on the measurement of the spectral characteristics of the zero-phonon line. Recently, a modification of this method has been proposed utilizing splitting the GeV emission with a dichroic mirror and determining on temperature from the ratio of two resulting signals. In this analysis, we compare both methods in detail. For measurements near room temperature, both methods have comparable behavior, slightly depended on quality of components used. However, for optimal parameters of a filter at temperatures of about 300 {\deg}C, the new method already outperforms the original by about a factor of 2. Moreover, the sensitivity of the new method remains approximately consistent with that observed at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Can the THz-TDS detect trace gases?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The THz-TDS is a versatile technique and can be used to probe gas phase molecules. We are pushing the technique to its limit to try and detect trace gases at the sub-ppm levels. The experiments served as a reference for a quantitative approach that permits to extract the concentration of a probed gas. The single-parameter quantification model can be considered as the basis for a wider multispecies detection scheme.</description>

      <title>A tunable dielectric resonator for axion searches at 11 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of axion search with haloscopes, tunable cavity resonators with high quality factor and high effective volume at frequencies above about 8 GHz are central for probing the axion-photon coupling with the required sensitivity to reach the QCD axion models. Higher order modes in dielectrically-loaded cavities allow for higher effective volumes and larger quality factors compared to basic cylindrical cavities, but a proper cavity frequency tuning mechanism to probe broad axion mass ranges is yet not available. In this work, we report about the design and construction of a tunable prototype of a single-shell dielectric resonator with its axion-sensitive pseudo-TM$_{030}$ high-order mode at about 11 GHz frequency. A clamshell tuning method previously tested for empty cylindrical resonators has been perfected for this geometry through simulations and in situ tests conducted at cryogenic temperature. Tuning is accomplished in a range of about 2 $\%$ the central frequency, without significantly impacting the quality factor of about 175000. The experimental results presented in this work demonstrate the tunability of this type of resonator, definitely confirming its applicability to high frequency axion searches.</description>

      <title>Generating a highly uniform magnetic field inside the magnetically shielded room of the n2EDM experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a coil system designed to generate a highly uniform magnetic field for the n2EDM experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute. It consists of a main $B_0$ coil and a set of auxiliary coils mounted on a cubic structure with a side length of 273 cm, inside a large magnetically shielded room (MSR). We have assembled this system and characerized its performances with a mapping robot. The apparatus is able to generate a 1 $\mu$ T vertical field with a relative root mean square deviation $\sigma$ ($B_z$)/$B_z$ = 3 $\times$ $10^{-5}$ over the volume of interest, a cylinder of radius 40 cm and height 30 cm. This level of uniformity overcomes the n2EDM requirements, allowing a measurement of the neutron Electric Dipole Moment with a sensitivity better than 1 $\times$ $10^{-27}$ ecm.</description>

      <title>Room temperature buffer gas beam of metastable state titanium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We produce beams of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in their metastable $3d^{3}(^4F){4}s$ $a^5F_5$ state by laser ablation into He, N$_2$, and Ar buffer gases. The high temperatures realized in the ablation process populate the $a^5F_5$ level without the need for optical pumping. Remarkably, we observe that Ti atoms in the $a^5F_5$ state survive $1000$'s of collisions with He and Ar buffer gas atoms without being quenched to lower-energy states. We study the yield of Ti atoms when ablated into buffer gases of varying species and pressure, quantify quenching rates and diffusion cross sections based on simple models, and provide insight into optimal design parameters for an ablation cell. Using a $3.3\,$cm ablation cell with interchangeable exit apertures, we produce metastable atom beams and quantify their brilliance and velocity distributions as functions of buffer gas pressure.</description>
