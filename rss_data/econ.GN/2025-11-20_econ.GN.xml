      <title>Anthropic Economic Index report: Uneven geographic and enterprise AI adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this report, we document patterns of Claude usage over time, in 150+ countries, across US states, and among businesses deploying Claude through the API. Based on a privacy-preserving analysis of 1 million conversations on Claude.ai and 1 million API transcripts, we have four key findings: (1) Users increasingly entrust Claude with more autonomy, with directive task delegation rising from 27% to 39% in the past eight months. (2) Claude usage is geographically concentrated with high income countries overrepresented in global usage relative to their working age population. (3) Local economic considerations shape patterns of use both in terms of topic and in mode of collaboration with Claude. (4) API customers use Claude to automate tasks with greater specialization among use cases most amenable to programmatic access. To enable researchers and policymakers to further study the impact of AI on the economy, we additionally open-source the underlying data for this report.</description>

      <title>A Millennium of UK Business Cycles: Insights from Structural VAR Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study macroeconomic fluctuations in the United Kingdom over seven centuries (1271--2022) using a time-varying VAR with stochastic volatility. We identify business cycle shocks as innovations explaining the largest share of future output variance. Before 1900, these shocks display a stagflationary, supply-driven pattern, while post-1900 shocks become demand-driven, raising both output and inflation. Output volatility declines over time, peaking in the seventeenth century. Monetisation had large real effects in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, shifting to more inflationary impacts thereafter. Our results highlight how business cycle dynamics evolve with institutional, monetary, and structural transformations.</description>

      <title>Fifty Shades of Greenwashing: The Political Economy of Climate Change Advertising on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a novel measure for greenwashing -- i.e., climate-related misinformation -- that shows how polluting companies can use social media advertising related to climate change to redirect criticism. To do so, we identify greenwashing content in 11 million social-political ads in Meta's Ad Targeting Datset with a measurement technique that combines large language models, human coders, and advances in Bayesian item response theory. We show that what is called greenwashing has diverse actors and components, but we also identify a very pernicious form, which we call political greenwashing, that appears to be promoted by fossil fuel companies and related interest groups. Based on ad targeting data, we show that much of this advertising happens via organizations with undisclosed links to the fossil fuel industry. Furthermore, we show that greenwashing ad content is being micro-targeted at left-leaning communities with fossil fuel assets, though we also find comparatively little evidence of ad targeting aimed at influencing public opinion at the national level.</description>

      <title>The SolarEV City Paradox: A Critical Review of the Fragmented Integration of Rooftop Photovoltaics and Electric Vehicles for Urban Decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban decarbonization is central to meeting global climate goals, yet progress toward integrated low-carbon energy systems remains slow. The SolarEV City Concept, linking rooftop photovoltaics with electric vehicles as mobile storage offers a technically robust pathway for deep CO2 reduction, potentially meeting 60-95 percent of municipal electricity demand when deployed synergistically. Despite rapid global growth of PVs and EVs, integration through bidirectional Vehicle-to-Home and Vehicle-to-Grid systems has lagged, revealing a persistent SolarEV paradox. This review examines that paradox through a socio-technical framework across four dimensions, technology, economics, policy, and society. Cross-national comparison shows that while technical feasibility is well established, large-scale implementation is limited by fragmented charging-protocol standards, immature and often non-profitable V2G business models, regulatory misalignments between energy and transport sectors, and social-equity barriers that restrict participation mainly to high-income homeowners. Emerging national archetypes from Japans resilience-driven model to Europes regulation-first trajectory highlight strong path dependence in current integration strategies. The analysis concludes that advancing SolarEV Cities requires a shift from parallel PV-EV promotion toward coordinated policy frameworks, interoperable digital infrastructure, and inclusive market designs that distribute economic and resilience benefits more equitably. Achieving this integrated energy transition will require strategic collaboration among researchers, governments, industries, and communities to build adaptive, resilient, and socially just urban energy systems.</description>

      <title>Causal Inference in Financial Event Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial event studies, ubiquitous in finance research, typically use linear factor models with known factors to estimate abnormal returns and identify causal effects of information events. This paper demonstrates that when factor models are misspecified -- an almost certain reality -- traditional event study estimators produce inconsistent estimates of treatment effects. The bias is particularly severe during volatile periods, over long horizons, and when event timing correlates with market conditions. We derive precise conditions for identification and expressions for asymptotic bias. As an alternative, we propose synthetic control methods that construct replicating portfolios from control securities without imposing specific factor structures. Revisiting four empirical applications, we show that some established findings may reflect model misspecification rather than true treatment effects. While traditional methods remain reliable for short-horizon studies with random event timing, our results suggest caution when interpreting long-horizon or volatile-period event studies and highlight the importance of quasi-experimental designs when available.</description>

      <title>Modelling reliability under deep decarbonisation of the European electricity grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional feasibility studies of deep decarbonisation are often limited in their temporal scope, and are thus unable to draw conclusions about grid reliability over multi-decadal time periods. To address this problem, we introduce RESCORE, a fast and transparent model that uses 43 years of hourly weather data to evaluate both the cost and reliability characteristics of low-carbon electricity mixes. Applying RESCORE to the European electricity grid, we show that infrequent but extreme weather events play an outsized role in setting the cost for generation mixes without dispatchable backup: reliably meeting the last 1% of demand accounts for about 36% of the entire system cost when the mix contains only solar, onshore wind and storage. We also show that by including small amounts of low-cost, dispatchable generation (e.g., natural gas, hydro, or similar) the cost of a reliable, high-renewables grid can be drastically reduced.</description>
