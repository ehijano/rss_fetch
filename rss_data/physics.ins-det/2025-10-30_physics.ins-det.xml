      <title>Estimation of the Inverse Compton Scattering Background in MeV Gamma-Gamma Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MeV Gamma-Gamma Collider would provide a direct experimental platform for elastic light-by-light scattering ($\gamma\gamma \to \gamma\gamma$) and the Breit-Wheeler process with two real photons ($\gamma\gamma \to e^+e^-$). A Monte Carlo code, the Genie Background Evaluation Tool (GBET), has been developed to fully simulate two successive inverse Compton scatterings in the linear regime, including $e^- + \text{laser} \to e^-+ \gamma$ and $e^- + \gamma \rightarrow e^- + \gamma$. GBET overcomes the inherent information loss in traditional luminosity-spectrum-based chain simulations, preserving full particle-level information and achieving higher physical fidelity. The effectiveness of the code is verified by benchmarking against the simulation results of CAIN. GBET shows that the event rate of background photons generated by the first inverse Compton scattering is $6.24 \times 10^7$/s, with energies below 18 eV; the second inverse Compton scattering generates background electrons at 51.99/s and photons at 0.99/s, both with energies below 11 MeV. In addition, M{\o}ller scattering contributes background electrons at 0.56/s with energies around 200 MeV. The count rates of background electrons and positrons originating from the Breit-Wheeler process are 1312.2/s and 1314.3/s, respectively, with energy distributions ranging from 511 to 720 keV.</description>

      <title>Data sorting modes of phoswich detector array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The different data sorting modes of the phoswich detector array PARIS used for detecting high-energy (4$-$10 MeV) $\gamma$ rays are investigated. The characteristics including time resolution, energy resolution and detection efficiency under various modes are studied. The present study shows that PARIS has capabilities of rejecting escape and pileup events. Compared with the 2"$\times$2"$\times$2" LaBr$_3$(Ce) detector \cite{CIEMALA200976}, even in individual mode, PARIS provides significant suppression of single- and double-escape peaks and reduces background via vetoing function of the outer-volume NaI(Tl) crystals. In contrast to the common approach of adding back the energies in LaBr$_3$(Ce) and NaI(Tl) to increase the detection efficiency of the full-energy peak, using NaI(Tl) as a veto shield provides a superior trade-off for applications where spectral purity is essential. Employing add-back analysis within each cluster of nine phoswiches or between all phoswiches could enhance full-energy peak efficiency and further suppress escape peaks and background. Applying a multiplicity condition provides a further suppression but simultaneously lowers the statistics of full-energy peaks. Notably, the methods presented in this work refer specifically to the $\beta$-decay experiment of $^{80g+m}$Ga conducted with three PARIS clusters comprising 27 phoswich detectors, rather than to a general report on the PARIS array or its overall performance.</description>

      <title>Torque cancellation effect of Intensity noise for Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of sub-Hz gravitational waves is of significant importance for astrophysics. It enables the observation of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, the issuance of early alerts for gravitational-wave events, and the exploration of the stochastic gravitational-wave background. The Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS) is a proposed gravitational-wave detector based on a Sagnac speed-meter topology that uses torsion bars as test masses. Its prototype design aims to achieve a strain sensitivity of $3 \times 10^{-18}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1~Hz and thus enable the detection of $\mathcal{O}(10^4),M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole mergers at 100~Mpc with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. We show that the torsion-bar-based speed meter can suppress noise originating from laser intensity fluctuations by canceling the net torque on the bar and by using a balanced homodyne readout. We further present, for the first time, an analytic intensity-noise model for a gravitational-wave detector employing a torsion-bar Sagnac speed-meter configuration. Using this model, we evaluate the expected performance of a 2.5~m arm-length CHRONOS prototype. The projected laser-intensity noise is $2.9 \times 10^{-20}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1~Hz, which is sufficiently low to allow the detection of binary intermediate-mass black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Optical design and sensitivity optimization of Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the optical design and sensitivity modeling of the 2.5 m Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), a triangular Sagnac speed-meter interferometer incorporating power- and signal-recycling techniques. Using ABCD-matrix analysis and Finesse3 simulations, we show that stable eigenmodes are obtained with optimized mirror curvatures and focal placements, achieving mode-matching efficiencies above 99.5 %. The resulting configuration reaches a quantum-noise-limited strain sensitivity of $h \simeq 3\times10^{-18},\mathrm{Hz^{-1/2}}$ at 1 Hz, with a ring-cavity finesse $\mathcal{F}\simeq3.1\times10^{4}$ and round-trip Gouy phase $\psi_{\mathrm{rt}}\approx153^{\circ}$. The power-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_p=-85^{\circ}$) dominates the low-frequency quantum noise, while the signal-recycling cavity detuning ($\phi_s=0^{\circ}$) mainly introduces a uniform quadrature rotation. The optimal homodyne angle ($\zeta_{\mathrm{opt}}\simeq46^{\circ}$) balances shot-noise and radiation-pressure effects to give the best sensitivity near 1 Hz. Assuming end-mirror reflectivity $R_{\mathrm{ETM}}=99.9999\%$ under cryogenic operation at 10 K, CHRONOS can achieve quantum-noise-limited performance on a laboratory scale and serve as a testbed for future long-baseline, cryogenic interferometers probing sub-hertz gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Accurate Reporting of Ion Time-of-Flight during HiPIMS with Gated Front-End Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) deposited films can often improve through the effective use of metal-ion acceleration, requiring precise measurements of time-of-flight (ToF). These measurements are commonly done using time- and energy-resolved mass spectrometry but require careful consideration of the transit time of ions inside. The transit time is typically calculated by considering the travel length in various parts of the spectrometer (e.g. from orifice to detector), but errors associated with these estimations can lead to nonphysical values in a HiPIMS process (e.g. negative ToFs). Here we report a practical approach to determine ion ToF experimentally, using a bipolar HiPIMS power supply to synchronize a gating pulse to the front-end of a HIDEN Analytical EQP-300 mass spectrometer, placed at the working distance. The ToF is measured by applying a +70 V bias to repel ions, and a 5 us gating pulse of 0 V to accept them. To prevent interference with the HiPIMS plasma, a grounded shield is placed in front of the mass-spec head with a variable slit-opening (0.5-3 mm). The effectiveness of the shielding is verified by Langmuir probe measurements, noting negligible shifts in plasma potential for a DC sputter discharge. The gate is then synchronized to a HiPIMS pulse and data collected at 5 us intervals by adjusting the pulse delay. Measurements of the time-of-flights of Ar+, Al+, Sc+, Y+, and W+ ions are presented; Al+ and Ar+ ions were also compared to ToF calculated using mass spectrometry flight tube equations.</description>

      <title>Sub-microsecond Transformers for Jet Tagging on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first sub-microsecond transformer implementation on an FPGA achieving competitive performance for state-of-the-art high-energy physics benchmarks. Transformers have shown exceptional performance on multiple tasks in modern machine learning applications, including jet tagging at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However, their computational complexity prohibits use in real-time applications, such as the hardware trigger system of the collider experiments up until now. In this work, we demonstrate the first application of transformers for jet tagging on FPGAs, achieving $\mathcal{O}(100)$ nanosecond latency with superior performance compared to alternative baseline models. We leverage high-granularity quantization and distributed arithmetic optimization to fit the entire transformer model on a single FPGA, achieving the required throughput and latency. Furthermore, we add multi-head attention and linear attention support to hls4ml, making our work accessible to the broader fast machine learning community. This work advances the next-generation trigger systems for the High Luminosity LHC, enabling the use of transformers for real-time applications in high-energy physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>DNN-based Signal Processing for Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a deep learning-based signal processing for liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs), a leading detector technology in neutrino physics. Identifying regions of interest (ROIs) in LArTPCs is challenging due to signal cancellation from bipolar responses and various detector effects observed in real data. We approach ROI identification as an image segmentation task, and employ a U-ResNet architecture. The network is trained on samples that incorporate detector geometry information and include a range of detector variations. Our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods while maintaining robustness across diverse detector conditions. This method has been adopted for signal processing in the Short-Baseline Neutrino program and provides a valuable foundation for future experiments such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment.</description>

      <title>Towards a comprehensive study of the 14N(p,g)15O astrophysical key reaction: Description of the experimental technique including novel target preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the 14N(p,g)15O reaction plays a key role in the hydrogen-burning processes in various stellar conditions, its reaction rate is not known with sufficient precision. Therefore, the first scientific project at the recently launched Bellotti Ion Beam Facility of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso was the measurement of the 14N(p,g)15O reaction cross section in the proton energy range between 250 and 1500 keV. In this paper, the experimental techniques are summarized with special emphasis on the description of solid state nitrogen target production and characterization. The first results of the reaction yield measured at 55 deg detection angle are also presented.</description>

      <title>Automated Supervised Identification of Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements (TGEs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements (TGEs) are bursts of high-energy particle fluxes detected at Earth's surface, linked to the Relativistic Runaway Electron Avalanche (RREA) mechanism within thunderclouds. Accurate detection of TGEs is vital for advancing atmospheric physics and radiation safety, but event selection methods heavily rely on expert-defined thresholds. In this study, we use an automated supervised classification approach on a newly curated dataset of 2024 events from the Aragats Space Environment Center (ASEC). By combining a Tabular Prior-data Fitted Network (TabPFN) with SHAP-based interpretability, we attain 94.79% classification accuracy with 96% precision for TGEs. The analysis reveals data-driven thresholds for particle flux increases and environmental parameters that closely match the empirically established criteria used over the last 15 years. Our results demonstrate that modest but concurrent increases across multiple particle detectors, along with strong near-surface electric fields, are reliable indicators of TGEs. The framework we propose offers a scalable method for automated, interpretable TGE detection, with potential uses in real-time radiation hazard monitoring and multi-site atmospheric research.</description>

      <title>Development of a new phase-retrieval algorithm from a single-shot image for X-ray schlieren microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new phase-retrieval algorithm from an X-ray schlieren image is proposed. The schlieren method allows phase-contrast imaging with an objective lens and a knife-edge filter placed at the back focal plane of the objective. This method finds a wide range of applications in the visible-light region for transparent specimen visualization. The schlieren contrast does not directly correspond to the phase shift. However, the phase map can be reconstructed from a single-shot schlieren image of a transparent and weak-phase object using the filtered Fourier transform method. A proof-of-principle experiment was performed in the hard-X-ray region at the AR-NE1A beamline of the Photon Factory facility at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK).</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Li$_2$WO$_4$ crystal as a cryogenic scintillating calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of scintillating bolometers is under investigation for applications in the search for rare events and processes beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we report the first measurement of a natural, non-molybdenum-doped, lithium tungstate (LWO) crystal operated underground as a scintillating cryogenic calorimeter. The detector achieved a baseline energy resolution of 0.5 keV RMS with a low-energy threshold of about 1.5 keV. The simultaneous readout of heat and light enabled particle identification, revealing a clear separation between $\beta/\gamma$, $\alpha$, and nuclear recoil populations above 300 keV, with a light-yield-based particle discrimination better than $6\sigma$. These results, fully comparable with those achieved with other compounds in the field, demonstrate that LWO is a promising candidate for rare-event searches. In particular, the combination of excellent radio-purity (with U/Th levels below 0.5 mBq/kg) and sensitivity to neutron interactions via the $^6$Li(n,$\alpha$)$^3$H reaction makes this material an attractive option for next-generation experiments on dark matter, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, and spin-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>On Improving Nuclear Fuel Imaging Using Position Sensitive Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spent nuclear fuel imaging before disposal is of utmost importance before long term disposal in dedicated storage facilities. Passive Gamma Emission Tomography (PGET) is an approved method by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The present detection system is based on small CZT detectors behind a tungsten-based collimator consisting of a linear array of slits. Small scale CZT crystals limit the detection efficiency of high energetic gamma rays from the fuel rods, mainly the 662 keV emissions from Cs-137. In our study based on full Monte-Carlo simulations as well as on experiments, we explore the capabilities of large pixelated CZT detectors to be used for PGET. We will discuss the theoretical advantages and practical challenges of the larger crystals. We demonstrate that the larger crystals, depending on their orientation, will increase the detection efficiency by a factor of 7 to 13. Due to the pixelated sensor signal readout we also explore the possibility to employ Compton imaging to improve the information on the location of origin of gamma rays. In addition we explore the usefulness of commercial gamma-ray imagers for waste characterisation and decommissioning. In particular we report on the performance of the GeGI imager from PHDS Co and the H420 imager from H3D Inc in measuring nuclear waste drums at Svafo, Sweden.</description>

      <title>Advanced structural characterization of single-walled carbon nanotubes with 4D-STEM</title>

Abstract: Single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) exhibit remarkable optical and electrical properties making them one of the most promising materials for next generation electronic and optoelectronic devices. Their electronic properties strongly depend on their chirality, i.e., their structural configuration, as well as on the presence and nature of atomic defects. Currently, the lack of versatile and efficient structural characterization techniques limits SWCNT applications. Here, we report how four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) can address critical challenges in SWCNT structural analysis. Using modern fast pixelated electron detectors, we were able to acquire rapidly a large number of low noise electron diffraction patterns of SWCNTs. The resulting 4D-STEM data allow to precisely determine the local chirality of multiple nanotubes at once, with limited electron dose (down to 1750 e-/{\AA}^2) and nanometric spatial resolution (down to 3.1 nm). We also show how this approach enables to track the chirality along a single nanotube, while giving access to the strain distribution. Then, we report how 4D-STEM data enable to reconstruct high-resolution images with electron ptychography. With this second approach, structural information can be obtained with atomic scale spatial resolution allowing atomic defect imaging. Finally, we investigate how multi-slice electron ptychography could provide even further insight on nanotube defect structures thanks to its close to 3D imaging capabilities at atomic resolution.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the neutron beam in the n_TOF-EAR2 experimental area at CERN following the spallation target upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The n_TOF facility at CERN has undergone a major upgrade after the installation of a new spallation target, designed to improve the features of both neutron beamlines at the experimental areas 1 and 2 (EAR1 and EAR2) and the commissioning of a new experimental area (NEAR). Due to improved coupling of the spallation target with the EAR2 beamline, the upgrade resulted in a significantly increased neutron flux and improved neutron energy resolution. This paper presents the results of the commissioning phase that followed to characterise the EAR2 neutron beamline and validate the FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations of the facility. The main features of the neutron beam, namely the neutron flux, spatial profile and energy resolution, are evaluated and compared to the previous target. The neutron flux presents a general increase of 20% below 1 eV, 40% between 1 eV and 100 keV and 50% between 100 keV and 10 MeV. The measured width of the beam profile was 3 cm (FWHM) at the reference position for neutron capture measurements. The energy resolution with the new spallation target shows a significant improvement compared to the previous one. Moreover, FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations present a good agreement with the measured neutron flux and profile within uncertainties, and a remarkable reproduction of the energy resolution.</description>

      <title>A New cw-NMR Q-meter for Dynamically Polarized Targets for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarized solid targets produced via Dynamic Nuclear Polarization rely on Continuous-Wave Nuclear Magnetism Resonance measurements to accurately determine the degree of polarization of bulk samples polarized to nearly 100%. Since the late 1970's phase sensitive detection methods have been utilized to observe the magnetization of a sample as a small change in inductance under RF excitation near the Larmor frequency of the nuclear species of interest, using a device known as a Q-meter. Liverpool Q-meters, produced in the UK in the 80's and 90's, have been the workhorse devices for these targets for decades, however their age and scarcity has meant new systems are needed. We describe a Q-meter system designed and built at Jefferson Lab in the Liverpool style to have comparable electronic performance with several improvements to update and adapt the devices for modern use.</description>

      <title>First use of large area SiPM matrices coupled with NaI(Tl) scintillating crystal for low energy dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-standing claim of dark matter detection by the DAMA experiment remains a crucial open question in astroparticle physics. A key step towards its independent verification is the development of NaI(Tl)-based detectors with improved sensitivity at low energies. The majority of NaI(Tl)-based experiments rely on conventional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) as single photon detectors, which present technological limitations in terms of light collection, intrinsic radioactivity and a high noise contribution at keV energies. ASTAROTH is an R&amp;D project developing a NaI(Tl)-based detector where the scintillation light is read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) matrices. SiPMs exhibit high photon detection efficiency, negligible radioactivity, and, most importantly, a dark noise nearly two orders of magnitude lower than PMTs, when operated at cryogenic temperature. To this end, ASTAROTH features a custom-designed cryostat based on a bath of cryogenic fluid, able to safely operate the detector and the read-out electronics down to about 80K. We report the first experimental characterization of 360 g NaI(Tl) detector read out by a large area (5 cm x 5 cm) SiPM matrix. The photoelectron yield obtained with a preliminary configuration is 7.2 photoelectrons/keV, which is rather promising, also in light of several planned developments. The signal-to-noise ratio and the energy threshold attainable with SiPMs is expected to improve the sensitivity for dark matter searches beyond the reach of current-generation PMT-based detectors. This result is the first proof of the viability of this technology and sets a milestone toward the design of future large-scale experiments.</description>

      <title>Design and characterization of a photosensor system for the RELICS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and characterization of a photosensor system developed for the RELICS experiment. A set of dynamic readout bases was designed to mitigate photomultiplier tube (PMT) saturation caused by intense cosmic muon backgrounds in the surface-level RELICS detector. The system employs dual readout from the anode and the seventh dynode to extend the PMT's linear response range. In particular, our characterization and measurements of Hamamatsu R8520-406 PMTs confirm stable operation under positive high-voltage bias, extending the linear response range by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, a model of PMT saturation and recovery was developed to evaluate the influence of cosmic muon signals in the RELICS detector. The results demonstrate the system's capability to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) signals under surface-level cosmic backgrounds, and suggest the potential to extend the scientific reach of RELICS to MeV-scale interactions.</description>

      <title>An efficient high-current circuit for fast radio-frequency spectroscopy in cold atomic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.12730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design and implement a low-impedance, high-current radio-frequency (RF) circuit, enabling fast coherent coupling between magnetic levels in cold alkali atomic samples. It is based on a compact shape-optimized coil that maximizes the RF field coupling with the atomic magnetic dipole, and on coaxial transmission-line transformers that step up the field-generating current flowing in the coil by a factor $\sim\,4$ to about $7.5\,$A for $100\,$W of RF driving. This allows to obtain a RF coupling field of about $0.035\,\text{G}/\sqrt{\text{W}}$ at the atomic sample location. The system is robust and versatile, as it generates a large RF field without compromising on the available optical access, and its central resonant frequency can be adjusted in situ. Our approach provides a cost-effective, reliable solution, featuring a negligible level of interference with surrounding electronic equipment thanks to its symmetric layout. We test the circuit performance using a maximum RF power of $80\,$W at a frequency around $82\,$MHz, which corresponds to a measured Rabi frequency $\Omega_R/2\pi \simeq 18.5\,$kHz, i.e. a $\pi$-pulse duration of about $27\,\mu$s, between two of the lowest states of ${}^6$Li at an offset magnetic field of $770\,$G. Our solution can be readily adapted to other atomic species and vacuum chamber designs, in view of an increasing modularity of cold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>All-fiber microendoscopic polarization sensing at single-photon level aided by deep-learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02172v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polarization of light conveys crucial information about the spatial ordering and optical properties of a specimen. However, precise polarization measurement in challenging conditions, including constrained spaces, low light levels, and high-speed scenarios, remains a severe challenge. Addressing this problem, we introduce a real-time polarization measurement method that is accurate down to a single-photon level and provides complete information about the polarization state. Free of moving components, the polarization sensor utilizes a short rigid piece of few-mode fiber followed by a fiber array and a detector array. The calibration of the sensor relies on a neural network yielding unprecedented accuracy across all polarization states, including partially polarized light. We validate the approach by visualizing the polarization structure of biological specimens and the liquid crystal polymer sample (birefringent USAF test). Our method offers an efficient and reliable solution for real-time polarization sensing and microendoscopy under low-light conditions.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Lunar Corner-Cube Retroreflectors: A Wave-Optics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision corner-cube retroreflectors (CCRs) are critical for advanced lunar laser ranging (LLR) because they enable sub-millimeter-scale measurements of the Earth-Moon distance -- a level of precision essential for rigorous tests of relativistic gravitation and for advancing our understanding of lunar geophysics. In this work, we develop a comprehensive two-dimensional Fourier-optics model for single CCRs with apertures ranging from 80-110 mm. Our model incorporates realistic thermal-mechanical wavefront errors, detailed diffraction effects, and velocity aberration offsets. Our analysis reveals a strong coupling between aperture size and aberration angular offset: while larger CCRs deliver high on-axis flux under near-ideal conditions, their narrow diffraction lobes suffer significant flux loss at moderate aberration offsets, thereby favoring smaller apertures with broader main lobes. Furthermore, comparisons between solid fused-silica and hollow silicon-carbide (SiC) CCRs show that hollow designs not only achieve competitive or superior photon return -- particularly at 1064 nm, where phase errors are relatively reduced -- but also offer nearly an order-of-magnitude mass reduction for the same aperture sizes. These results establish a robust quantitative framework for optimizing CCR designs to perform at the sub-millimeter level under realistic lunar conditions and underscore the advantages of precision hollow SiC CCRs for next-generation LLR operations.</description>

Abstract: The NUCLEUS experiment aims to detect coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering of reactor antineutrinos on CaWO$_4$ targets in the fully coherent regime, using gram-scale cryogenic calorimeters. The experimental apparatus will be installed at the Chooz nuclear power plant in France, in the vicinity of two 4.25 GW$_{\text{th}}$ reactor cores. This work presents results from the commissioning of an essential version of the experiment at the shallow Underground Laboratory of the Technical University of Munich. For the first time, two cryogenic target detectors were tested alongside active and passive shielding systems. Over a period of two months all detector subsystems were operated with stable performance. Background measurements were conducted, providing important benchmarks for the modeling of background sources at the reactor site. Finally, we present ongoing efforts to upgrade the detector systems in preparation for a technical run at Chooz in 2026, and highlight the remaining challenges to achieving neutrino detection.</description>
