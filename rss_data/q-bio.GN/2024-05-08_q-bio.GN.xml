      <title>sc-OTGM: Single-Cell Perturbation Modeling by Solving Optimal Mass Transport on the Manifold of Gaussian Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influenced by breakthroughs in LLMs, single-cell foundation models are emerging. While these models show successful performance in cell type clustering, phenotype classification, and gene perturbation response prediction, it remains to be seen if a simpler model could achieve comparable or better results, especially with limited data. This is important, as the quantity and quality of single-cell data typically fall short of the standards in textual data used for training LLMs. Single-cell sequencing often suffers from technical artifacts, dropout events, and batch effects. These challenges are compounded in a weakly supervised setting, where the labels of cell states can be noisy, further complicating the analysis. To tackle these challenges, we present sc-OTGM, streamlined with less than 500K parameters, making it approximately 100x more compact than the foundation models, offering an efficient alternative. sc-OTGM is an unsupervised model grounded in the inductive bias that the scRNAseq data can be generated from a combination of the finite multivariate Gaussian distributions. The core function of sc-OTGM is to create a probabilistic latent space utilizing a GMM as its prior distribution and distinguish between distinct cell populations by learning their respective marginal PDFs. It uses a Hit-and-Run Markov chain sampler to determine the OT plan across these PDFs within the GMM framework. We evaluated our model against a CRISPR-mediated perturbation dataset, called CROP-seq, consisting of 57 one-gene perturbations. Our results demonstrate that sc-OTGM is effective in cell state classification, aids in the analysis of differential gene expression, and ranks genes for target identification through a recommender system. It also predicts the effects of single-gene perturbations on downstream gene regulation and generates synthetic scRNA-seq data conditioned on specific cell states.</description>

      <title>Scalable Amortized GPLVMs for Single Cell Transcriptomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality reduction is crucial for analyzing large-scale single-cell RNA-seq data. Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) offer an interpretable dimensionality reduction method, but current scalable models lack effectiveness in clustering cell types. We introduce an improved model, the amortized stochastic variational Bayesian GPLVM (BGPLVM), tailored for single-cell RNA-seq with specialized encoder, kernel, and likelihood designs. This model matches the performance of the leading single-cell variational inference (scVI) approach on synthetic and real-world COVID datasets and effectively incorporates cell-cycle and batch information to reveal more interpretable latent structures as we demonstrate on an innate immunity dataset.</description>
