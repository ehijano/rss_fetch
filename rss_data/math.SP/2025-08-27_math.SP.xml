      <title>On a Question of Poltoratski</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study half-line discrete Schr\"odinger operators and their rank-one perturbations. We establish certain continuity and stability properties of the Fourier transform of the associated spectral measures. Using these results, we construct a sparse potential whose essential spectrum contains an open interval, and show that for every rank-one perturbation the corresponding spectral measure is non-Rajchman. This resolves a question posed in [24].</description>

      <title>Hypersurfaces immersed in special Spin$^c$ manifolds by first eigenspinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed orientable hypersurface of dimension $n$, with nonwhere vanishing mean curvature $H$, immersed into a Riemannian Spin$^c$ manifold $\mathcal Z$ carrying a parallel spinor field. The first eigenvalue $\lambda_1(\not\hspace{-0.1cm}D)$ (with the least absolute value) of the induced Dirac operator $\not\hspace{-0.1cm}D$ of $M$ satisfies the Spin$^c$ B\"{a}r inequality \begin{eqnarray*} \lambda_1^2 (\not\hspace{-0.1cm}D) \leq \frac{n^2}{4 \ \mathrm{vol}(M)}\int_M H^2 dV, \end{eqnarray*} where $\mathrm{vol}(M)$ is the volume of $M$ and $dV$ is the volume form of the manifold $M$. In this paper, we classify hypersurfaces $M$ that satisfy the equality case in the Spin$^c$ B\"{a}r inequality when $\mathcal Z = (0,+\infty) \times P$ is the cone over a Riemannian Spin$^c$ manifold $P$ carrying a real Killing spinor, under two conditions: one being a Ricci condition on $\mathcal Z$, and the second one the curvature of the auxiliary line bundle associated with the Spin$^c$ structure on $\mathcal Z$. More precisely, we prove that $M$ are the slices $\{s\} \times P$, where $s \in (0,+\infty)$. In the special case, when $\mathcal Z=\mathbb R^{n+1}$, i.e., the cone over the sphere, which is a Spin manifold with a parallel spinor, the classification result was previously obtained by Hijazi and Montiel.</description>

      <title>The Duistermaat index and eigenvalue interlacing for self-adjoint extensions of a symmetric operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eigenvalue interlacing is a useful tool in linear algebra and spectral analysis. In its simplest form, the interlacing inequality states that a rank-one positive perturbation shifts each eigenvalue up, but not further than the next unperturbed eigenvalue. For different types of perturbations, this idea is known as Weyl interlacing, Cauchy interlacing, Dirichlet--Neumann bracketing and so on.
  We prove a sharp version of the interlacing inequalities for ``finite-dimensional perturbations in boundary conditions'', expressed as bounds on the spectral shift between two self-adjoint extensions of a fixed symmetric operator with finite and equal defect numbers. The bounds are given in terms of the Duistermaat index, a topological invariant describing the relative position of three Lagrangian planes in a symplectic space. Two of the Lagrangian planes describe the self-adjoint extensions being compared, while the third corresponds to the Friedrichs extension, which acts as a reference point.
  Along the way several auxiliary results are established, including one-sided continuity properties of the Duistermaat triple index, smoothness of the (abstract) Cauchy data space without unique continuation-type assumptions, and a formula for the Morse index of an extension of a non-negative symmetric operator.</description>

      <title>A Weyl Matrix Perspective on Unbounded Non-Self-Adjoint Jacobi Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new way of encoding a non-self-adjoint Jacobi matrix $J$ by a spectral measure of $|J|$ together with a phase function was described by Pushnitski--\v Stampach in the bounded case. We present another perspective on this correspondence, based on Weyl functions instead of moments, which simplifies some proofs and generalizes the correspondence to the unbounded case. In particular, we find a bijection between proper Jacobi matrices with positive off-diagonal elements, and a class of spectral data. We prove that this mapping is continuous in a suitable sense. To prove injectivity of the map, we prove a local Borg--Marchenko theorem for unbounded non-self-adjoint Jacobi matrices in this class that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Clusters of resonances for a non-selfadjoint multichannel discrete Schr\"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01352v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of resonances for discrete Hamiltonians of the form $H_0+V$ near the thresholds of the spectrum of $H_0$. Here, the unperturbed operator $H_0$ is a multichannel Laplace type operator on $\ell^2(\mathbb Z; \mathbb C^N) \cong \ell^2(\mathbb Z)\otimes \mathbb C^N$ and $V$ is a non-selfadjoint compact perturbation. We compute the exact number of resonances and give a precise description on their location in clusters around some special points in the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Quantitative multiscale operator-type approximations for asymptotically degenerating spectral problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13151v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an abstract family of asymptotically degenerating variational problems. Those are natural generalisations of families of problems emerging upon application of a rescaled Floquet-Bloch-Gelfand transform to resolvent problems for high-contrast elliptic PDEs with highly oscillatory periodic coefficients. An asymptotic analysis of these models leads us to a hierarchy of approximation results with uniform operator-type error estimates under various assumptions, satisfied by specific examples. We provide approximations for the resolvents in terms of a certain `bivariate' operator which appears an abstract generalisation of the two-scale limit operators for highly oscillatory high-contrast PDEs. The resulting approximating self-adjoint operator, providing tight operator error estimates, is the bivariate operator sandwiched by a connecting operator which for a broad class of periodic problems specialises to a new two-scale version of the classical Whittaker-Shannon interpolation. An explicit description of the limit spectrum in the abstract setting is provided, and new tight error estimates on the distance between the original and limit spectra are established. Our generic approach allows us to readily consider a wide class of asymptotically degenerating problems including but also going beyond high-contrast highly oscillatory PDEs. The obtained results are illustrated by various examples.</description>
