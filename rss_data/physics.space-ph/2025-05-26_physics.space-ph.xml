      <title>Geometric Shape Modelling and Volume Estimation of Dry Bulk Cargo Piles using a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volume estimation of onshore cargo piles is of economic importance for shipping and mining companies as well as public authorities for real-time planning of logistics, business intelligence, transport services by land or sea and governmental oversight. In remote sensing literature, the volume of pile is estimated by relying on the illumination property of object to construct the geometric shape from a single image, alternatively, stereographic imaging for construction of a digital elevation model from pairs of images. In a fresh perspective, we propose a novel approach for estimating volume from a single optical image in this work where we use the material property, which relates the base dimensions of the pile to its height through the critical angle of repose. In materials literature, often this is well-studied for fixed base and their \textit{in situ} volume estimation for different materials. In this work, however, we mathematically model the geometric shape of the pile through a fixed height model. This is appropriate because the unloading crane arm that forms the pile can rise only up to a certain height and generally moved in the horizontal plane during unloading of the material. After mathematically modelling the geometric shape of regular piles for fixed heights under rectilinear motion of unloader, we provide closed form formula to estimate their volume. Apart from laying the mathematical foundations, we also test it on real optical remote sensing data of an open bulk cargo storage facility for silica sand and present the results. We obtain an accuracy of $95\%$ in estimating the total bulk storage volume of the storage facility. This is a first demonstration study and will be integrated with applied machine learning approaches or current state-of-art approaches in the future for more complex scenarios for estimating dry bulk cargo pile volume.</description>

      <title>Searching for extreme mass ratio inspirals in LISA: from identification to parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based observatory designed to detect gravitational waves (GWs) within the millihertz frequency range. LISA is anticipated to observe the inspiral of compact objects into black holes at the centers of galaxies, so called extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). However, the extraction of these long-lived complex signals is challenging due to the large size and multimodality of the search space. In this study, we introduce a new search strategy that allows us to find EMRI signals in noisy data from wide priors all the way to performing parameter estimation. This work is an important step in understanding how to extract EMRIs from future LISA data.</description>

      <title>Radiation Exposure from the Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that exotic forms of dark matter could expose humans on Earth or on prolonged space travel to a significant radiation dose. The radiation exposure from dark matter interacting with nuclei in the human body is generally assumed to be negligible compared to other sources of background radiation. However, as we discuss here, current data allow for dark matter models where this is not necessarily true. In particular, if dark matter is heavier and more strongly interacting than weakly interacting massive particle dark matter, it could act as ionizing radiation and deposit a significant amount of radiation energy in all or part of the human population, similar to or even exceeding the known radiation exposure from other background sources. Conversely, the non-observation of such an exposure can be used to constrain this type of heavier and more strongly interacting dark matter. We first consider the case where dark matter scatters elastically and identify the relevant parameter space in a model-independent way. We also discuss how previous bounds from cosmological probes, as well as atmospheric and space-based detectors, might be avoided, and how a re-analysis of existing radiation data, along with a simple experiment monitoring ionizing radiation in space with a lower detection threshold, could help constrain part of this parameter space. We finally propose a hypothetical dark matter candidate that scatters inelastically and argue that, in principle, one per mille of the Earth's population could attain a significant radiation dose from such a dark matter exposure in their lifetime.</description>
