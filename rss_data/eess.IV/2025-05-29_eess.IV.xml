      <title>High-Fidelity Functional Ultrasound Reconstruction via A Visual Auto-Regressive Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging provides exceptional spatiotemporal resolution for neurovascular mapping, yet its practical application is significantly hampered by critical challenges. Foremost among these are data scarcity, arising from ethical considerations and signal degradation through the cranium, which collectively limit dataset diversity and compromise the fairness of downstream machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Image denoising as a conditional expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All techniques for denoising involve a notion of a true (noise-free) image, and a hypothesis space. The hypothesis space may reconstruct the image directly as a grayscale valued function, or indirectly by its Fourier or wavelet spectrum. Most common techniques estimate the true image as a projection to some subspace. We propose an interpretation of a noisy image as a collection of samples drawn from a certain probability space. Within this interpretation, projection based approaches are not guaranteed to be unbiased and convergent. We present a data-driven denoising method in which the true image is recovered as a conditional expectation. Although the probability space is unknown apriori, integrals on this space can be estimated by kernel integral operators. The true image is reformulated as the least squares solution to a linear equation in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and involving various kernel integral operators as linear transforms. Assuming the true image to be a continuous function on a compact planar domain, the technique is shown to be convergent as the number of pixels goes to infinity. We also show that for a picture with finite number of pixels, the convergence result can be used to choose the various parameters for an optimum denoising result.</description>

      <title>Taylor expansion-based Kolmogorov-Arnold network for blind image quality assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has attracted growing interest for its strong function approximation capability. In our previous work, KAN and its variants were explored in score regression for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). However, these models encounter challenges when processing high-dimensional features, leading to limited performance gains and increased computational cost. To address these issues, we propose TaylorKAN that leverages the Taylor expansions as learnable activation functions to enhance local approximation capability. To improve the computational efficiency, network depth reduction and feature dimensionality compression are integrated into the TaylorKAN-based score regression pipeline. On five databases (BID, CLIVE, KonIQ, SPAQ, and FLIVE) with authentic distortions, extensive experiments demonstrate that TaylorKAN consistently outperforms the other KAN-related models, indicating that the local approximation via Taylor expansions is more effective than global approximation using orthogonal functions. Its generalization capacity is validated through inter-database experiments. The findings highlight the potential of TaylorKAN as an efficient and robust model for high-dimensional score regression.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Deep Learning for Skin Cancer Classification: A Computationally Efficient CNN with Minimal Accuracy Trade-Off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of deep learning in medical image analysis has greatly enhanced the accuracy of skin cancer classification. However, current state-of-the-art models, especially those based on transfer learning like ResNet50, come with significant computational overhead, rendering them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained environments. This study proposes a custom CNN model that achieves a 96.7\% reduction in parameters (from 23.9 million in ResNet50 to 692,000) while maintaining a classification accuracy deviation of less than 0.022\%. Our empirical analysis of the HAM10000 dataset reveals that although transfer learning models provide a marginal accuracy improvement of approximately 0.022\%, they result in a staggering 13,216.76\% increase in FLOPs, considerably raising computational costs and inference latency. In contrast, our lightweight CNN architecture, which encompasses only 30.04 million FLOPs compared to ResNet50's 4.00 billion, significantly reduces energy consumption, memory footprint, and inference time. These findings underscore the trade-off between the complexity of deep models and their real-world feasibility, positioning our optimized CNN as a practical solution for mobile and edge-based skin cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Laparoscopic Image Desmoking Using the U-Net with New Loss Function and Integrated Differentiable Wiener Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laparoscopic surgeries often suffer from reduced visual clarity due to the presence of surgical smoke originated by surgical instruments, which poses significant challenges for both surgeons and vision based computer-assisted technologies. In order to remove the surgical smoke, a novel U-Net deep learning with new loss function and integrated differentiable Wiener filter (ULW) method is presented. Specifically, the new loss function integrates the pixel, structural, and perceptual properties. Thus, the new loss function, which combines the structural similarity index measure loss, the perceptual loss, as well as the mean squared error loss, is able to enhance the quality and realism of the reconstructed images. Furthermore, the learnable Wiener filter is capable of effectively modelling the degradation process caused by the surgical smoke. The effectiveness of the proposed ULW method is evaluated using the publicly available paired laparoscopic smoke and smoke-free image dataset, which provides reliable benchmarking and quantitative comparisons. Experimental results show that the proposed ULW method excels in both visual clarity and metric-based evaluation. As a result, the proposed ULW method offers a promising solution for real-time enhancement of laparoscopic imagery. The code is available at https://github.com/chengyuyang-njit/ImageDesmoke.</description>

      <title>STA-Risk: A Deep Dive of Spatio-Temporal Asymmetries for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the risk of developing breast cancer is an important clinical tool to guide early intervention and tailoring personalized screening strategies. Early risk models have limited performance and recently machine learning-based analysis of mammogram images showed encouraging risk prediction effects. These models however are limited to the use of a single exam or tend to overlook nuanced breast tissue evolvement in spatial and temporal details of longitudinal imaging exams that are indicative of breast cancer risk. In this paper, we propose STA-Risk (Spatial and Temporal Asymmetry-based Risk Prediction), a novel Transformer-based model that captures fine-grained mammographic imaging evolution simultaneously from bilateral and longitudinal asymmetries for breast cancer risk prediction. STA-Risk is innovative by the side encoding and temporal encoding to learn spatial-temporal asymmetries, regulated by a customized asymmetry loss. We performed extensive experiments with two independent mammogram datasets and achieved superior performance than four representative SOTA models for 1- to 5-year future risk prediction. Source codes will be released upon publishing of the paper.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Chest X-ray Report Generation via Multimodal Federated Learning with ViT and GPT-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automated generation of radiology reports from chest X-ray images holds significant promise in enhancing diagnostic workflows while preserving patient privacy. Traditional centralized approaches often require sensitive data transfer, posing privacy concerns. To address this, the study proposes a Multimodal Federated Learning framework for chest X-ray report generation using the IU-Xray dataset. The system utilizes a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the encoder and GPT-2 as the report generator, enabling decentralized training without sharing raw data. Three Federated Learning (FL) aggregation strategies: FedAvg, Krum Aggregation and a novel Loss-aware Federated Averaging (L-FedAvg) were evaluated. Among these, Krum Aggregation demonstrated superior performance across lexical and semantic evaluation metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, BERTScore and RaTEScore. The results show that FL can match or surpass centralized models in generating clinically relevant and semantically rich radiology reports. This lightweight and privacy-preserving framework paves the way for collaborative medical AI development without compromising data confidentiality.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Non-Separable Transforms for Next Generation Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the last few decades, the application of signal-adaptive transform coding to video compression has been stymied by the large computational complexity of matrix-based solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel parametric approach to greatly reduce the complexity without degrading the compression performance. In our approach, instead of following the conventional technique of identifying full transform matrices that yield best compression efficiency, we look for the best transform parameters defining a new class of transforms, called HyGTs, which have low complexity implementations that are easy to parallelize. The proposed HyGTs are implemented as an extension of High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), and our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that proposed HyGTs improve average coding gain by 6% bit rate reduction, while using 6.8 times less memory than KLT matrices.</description>

      <title>Beyond 1D: Vision Transformers and Multichannel Signal Images for PPG-to-ECG Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing ECG from PPG is a promising yet challenging task. While recent advancements in generative models have significantly improved ECG reconstruction, accurately capturing fine-grained waveform features remains a key challenge. To address this, we propose a novel PPG-to-ECG reconstruction method that leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the core network. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on single-channel PPG, our method employs a four-channel signal image representation, incorporating the original PPG, its first-order difference, second-order difference, and area under the curve. This multi-channel design enriches feature extraction by preserving both temporal and physiological variations within the PPG. By leveraging the self-attention mechanism in ViT, our approach effectively captures both inter-beat and intra-beat dependencies, leading to more robust and accurate ECG reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing 1D convolution-based approaches, achieving up to 29% reduction in PRD and 15% reduction in RMSE. The proposed approach also produces improvements in other evaluation metrics, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in reconstructing ECG signals. Furthermore, to ensure a clinically relevant evaluation, we introduce new performance metrics, including QRS area error, PR interval error, RT interval error, and RT amplitude difference error. Our findings suggest that integrating a four-channel signal image representation with the self-attention mechanism of ViT enables more effective extraction of informative PPG features and improved modeling of beat-to-beat variations for PPG-to-ECG mapping. Beyond demonstrating the potential of PPG as a viable alternative for heart activity monitoring, our approach opens new avenues for cyclic signal analysis and prediction.</description>

      <title>Targeted Unlearning Using Perturbed Sign Gradient Methods With Applications On Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples from a trained model without full retraining. While prior work has largely focused on privacy-motivated settings, we recast unlearning as a general-purpose tool for post-deployment model revision. Specifically, we focus on utilizing unlearning in clinical contexts where data shifts, device deprecation, and policy changes are common. To this end, we propose a bilevel optimization formulation of boundary-based unlearning that can be solved using iterative algorithms. We provide convergence guarantees when first-order algorithms are used to unlearn. Our method introduces tunable loss design for controlling the forgetting-retention tradeoff and supports novel model composition strategies that merge the strengths of distinct unlearning runs. Across benchmark and real-world clinical imaging datasets, our approach outperforms baselines on both forgetting and retention metrics, including scenarios involving imaging devices and anatomical outliers. This work establishes machine unlearning as a modular, practical alternative to retraining for real-world model maintenance in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>MAMBO-NET: Multi-Causal Aware Modeling Backdoor-Intervention Optimization for Medical Image Segmentation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation methods generally assume that the process from medical image to segmentation is unbiased, and use neural networks to establish conditional probability models to complete the segmentation task. This assumption does not consider confusion factors, which can affect medical images, such as complex anatomical variations and imaging modality limitations. Confusion factors obfuscate the relevance and causality of medical image segmentation, leading to unsatisfactory segmentation results. To address this issue, we propose a multi-causal aware modeling backdoor-intervention optimization (MAMBO-NET) network for medical image segmentation. Drawing insights from causal inference, MAMBO-NET utilizes self-modeling with multi-Gaussian distributions to fit the confusion factors and introduce causal intervention into the segmentation process. Moreover, we design appropriate posterior probability constraints to effectively train the distributions of confusion factors. For the distributions to effectively guide the segmentation and mitigate and eliminate the Impact of confusion factors on the segmentation, we introduce classical backdoor intervention techniques and analyze their feasibility in the segmentation task. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments on five medical image datasets. The results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the influence of confusion factors, leading to enhanced segmentation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Patch-based Reconstruction for Unsupervised Dynamic MRI using Learnable Tensor Function with Implicit Neural Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic MRI plays a vital role in clinical practice by capturing both spatial details and dynamic motion, but its high spatiotemporal resolution is often limited by long scan times. Deep learning (DL)-based methods have shown promising performance in accelerating dynamic MRI. However, most existing algorithms rely on large fully-sampled datasets for training, which are difficult to acquire. Recently, implicit neural representation (INR) has emerged as a powerful scan-specific paradigm for accelerated MRI, which models signals as a continuous function over spatiotemporal coordinates. Although this approach achieves efficient continuous modeling of dynamic images and robust reconstruction, it faces challenges in recovering fine details and increasing computational demands for high dimensional data representation. To enhance both efficiency and reconstruction quality, we propose TenF-INR, a novel patch-based unsupervised framework that employs INR to model bases of tensor decomposition, enabling efficient and accurate modeling of dynamic MR images with learnable tensor functions. By exploiting strong correlations in similar spatial image patches and in the temporal direction, TenF-INR enforces multidimensional low-rankness and implements patch-based reconstruction with the benefits of continuous modeling. We compare TenF-INR with state-of-the-art methods, including supervised DL methods and unsupervised approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that TenF-INR achieves high acceleration factors up to 21, outperforming all comparison methods in image quality, temporal fidelity, and quantitative metrics, even surpassing the supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Subspecialty-Specific Foundation Model for Intelligent Gastrointestinal Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) diseases represent a clinically significant burden, necessitating precise diagnostic approaches to optimize patient outcomes. Conventional histopathological diagnosis, heavily reliant on the subjective interpretation of pathologists, suffers from limited reproducibility and diagnostic variability. To overcome these limitations and address the lack of pathology-specific foundation models for GI diseases, we develop Digepath, a specialized foundation model for GI pathology. Our framework introduces a dual-phase iterative optimization strategy combining pretraining with fine-screening, specifically designed to address the detection of sparsely distributed lesion areas in whole-slide images. Digepath is pretrained on more than 353 million image patches from over 200,000 hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of GI diseases. It attains state-of-the-art performance on 33 out of 34 tasks related to GI pathology, including pathological diagnosis, molecular prediction, gene mutation prediction, and prognosis evaluation, particularly in diagnostically ambiguous cases and resolution-agnostic tissue classification.We further translate the intelligent screening module for early GI cancer and achieve near-perfect 99.6% sensitivity across 9 independent medical institutions nationwide. The outstanding performance of Digepath highlights its potential to bridge critical gaps in histopathological practice. This work not only advances AI-driven precision pathology for GI diseases but also establishes a transferable paradigm for other pathology subspecialties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The substantial modality-induced variations in radiometric, texture, and structural characteristics pose significant challenges for the accurate registration of multimodal images. While supervised deep learning methods have demonstrated strong performance, they often rely on large-scale annotated datasets, limiting their practical application. Traditional unsupervised methods usually optimize registration by minimizing differences in feature representations, yet often fail to robustly capture geometric discrepancies, particularly under substantial spatial and radiometric variations, thus hindering convergence stability. To address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Learning framework for Unsupervised Multimodal Image Registration, named CoLReg, which reformulates unsupervised registration learning into a collaborative training paradigm comprising three components: (1) a cross-modal image translation network, MIMGCD, which employs a learnable Maximum Index Map (MIM) guided conditional diffusion model to synthesize modality-consistent image pairs; (2) a self-supervised intermediate registration network which learns to estimate geometric transformations using accurate displacement labels derived from MIMGCD outputs; (3) a distilled cross-modal registration network trained with pseudo-label predicted by the intermediate network. The three networks are jointly optimized through an alternating training strategy wherein each network enhances the performance of the others. This mutual collaboration progressively reduces modality discrepancies, enhances the quality of pseudo-labels, and improves registration accuracy. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that our ColReg achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and even surpasses several supervised baselines.</description>

      <title>High Volume Rate 3D Ultrasound Reconstruction with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound enables real-time volumetric visualization of anatomical structures. Unlike traditional 2D ultrasound, 3D imaging reduces the reliance on precise probe orientation, potentially making ultrasound more accessible to clinicians with varying levels of experience and improving automated measurements and post-exam analysis. However, achieving both high volume rates and high image quality remains a significant challenge. While 3D diverging waves can provide high volume rates, they suffer from limited tissue harmonic generation and increased multipath effects, which degrade image quality. One compromise is to retain the focusing in elevation while leveraging unfocused diverging waves in the lateral direction to reduce the number of transmissions per elevation plane. Reaching the volume rates achieved by full 3D diverging waves, however, requires dramatically undersampling the number of elevation planes. Subsequently, to render the full volume, simple interpolation techniques are applied. This paper introduces a novel approach to 3D ultrasound reconstruction from a reduced set of elevation planes by employing diffusion models (DMs) to achieve increased spatial and temporal resolution. We compare both traditional and supervised deep learning-based interpolation methods on a 3D cardiac ultrasound dataset. Our results show that DM-based reconstruction consistently outperforms the baselines in image quality and downstream task performance. Additionally, we accelerate inference by leveraging the temporal consistency inherent to ultrasound sequences. Finally, we explore the robustness of the proposed method by exploiting the probabilistic nature of diffusion posterior sampling to quantify reconstruction uncertainty and demonstrate improved recall on out-of-distribution data with synthetic anomalies under strong subsampling.</description>

      <title>MONSTR: Model-Oriented Neutron Strain Tomographic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residual strain, a tensor quantity, is a critical material property that impacts the overall performance of metal parts. Neutron Bragg edge strain tomography is a technique for imaging residual strain that works by making conventional hyperspectral computed tomography measurements, extracting the average projected strain at each detector pixel, and processing the resulting strain sinogram using a reconstruction algorithm. However, the reconstruction is severely ill-posed as the underlying inverse problem involves inferring a tensor at each voxel from scalar sinogram data.
  In this paper, we introduce the model-oriented neutron strain tomographic reconstruction (MONSTR) algorithm that reconstructs the 2D residual strain tensor from the neutron Bragg edge strain measurements. MONSTR is based on using the multi-agent consensus equilibrium framework for the tensor tomographic reconstruction. Specifically, we formulate the reconstruction as a consensus solution of a collection of agents representing detector physics, the tomographic reconstruction process, and physics-based constraints from continuum mechanics. Using simulated data, we demonstrate high-quality reconstruction of the strain tensor even when using very few measurements.</description>

      <title>Cascaded 3D Diffusion Models for Whole-body 3D 18-F FDG PET/CT synthesis from Demographics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a cascaded 3D diffusion model framework to synthesize high-fidelity 3D PET/CT volumes directly from demographic variables, addressing the growing need for realistic digital twins in oncologic imaging, virtual trials, and AI-driven data augmentation. Unlike deterministic phantoms, which rely on predefined anatomical and metabolic templates, our method employs a two-stage generative process. An initial score-based diffusion model synthesizes low-resolution PET/CT volumes from demographic variables alone, providing global anatomical structures and approximate metabolic activity. This is followed by a super-resolution residual diffusion model that refines spatial resolution. Our framework was trained on 18-F FDG PET/CT scans from the AutoPET dataset and evaluated using organ-wise volume and standardized uptake value (SUV) distributions, comparing synthetic and real data between demographic subgroups. The organ-wise comparison demonstrated strong concordance between synthetic and real images. In particular, most deviations in metabolic uptake values remained within 3-5% of the ground truth in subgroup analysis. These findings highlight the potential of cascaded 3D diffusion models to generate anatomically and metabolically accurate PET/CT images, offering a robust alternative to traditional phantoms and enabling scalable, population-informed synthetic imaging for clinical and research applications.</description>

      <title>Risk-Sensitive Conformal Prediction for Catheter Placement Detection in Chest X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to catheter and line position detection in chest X-rays, combining multi-task learning with risk-sensitive conformal prediction to address critical clinical requirements. Our model simultaneously performs classification, segmentation, and landmark detection, leveraging the synergistic relationship between these tasks to improve overall performance. We further enhance clinical reliability through risk-sensitive conformal prediction, which provides statistically guaranteed prediction sets with higher reliability for clinically critical findings. Experimental results demonstrate excellent performance with 90.68\% overall empirical coverage and 99.29\% coverage for critical conditions, while maintaining remarkable precision in prediction sets. Most importantly, our risk-sensitive approach achieves zero high-risk mispredictions (cases where the system dangerously declares problematic tubes as confidently normal), making the system particularly suitable for clinical deployment. This work offers both accurate predictions and reliably quantified uncertainty -- essential features for life-critical medical applications.</description>

      <title>Surf2CT: Cascaded 3D Flow Matching Models for Torso 3D CT Synthesis from Skin Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22511v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Surf2CT, a novel cascaded flow matching framework that synthesizes full 3D computed tomography (CT) volumes of the human torso from external surface scans and simple demographic data (age, sex, height, weight). This is the first approach capable of generating realistic volumetric internal anatomy images solely based on external body shape and demographics, without any internal imaging. Surf2CT proceeds through three sequential stages: (1) Surface Completion, reconstructing a complete signed distance function (SDF) from partial torso scans using conditional 3D flow matching; (2) Coarse CT Synthesis, generating a low-resolution CT volume from the completed SDF and demographic information; and (3) CT Super-Resolution, refining the coarse volume into a high-resolution CT via a patch-wise conditional flow model. Each stage utilizes a 3D-adapted EDM2 backbone trained via flow matching. We trained our model on a combined dataset of 3,198 torso CT scans (approximately 1.13 million axial slices) sourced from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the AutoPET challenge. Evaluation on 700 paired torso surface-CT cases demonstrated strong anatomical fidelity: organ volumes exhibited small mean percentage differences (range from -11.1% to 4.4%), and muscle/fat body composition metrics matched ground truth with strong correlation (range from 0.67 to 0.96). Lung localization had minimal bias (mean difference -2.5 mm), and surface completion significantly improved metrics (Chamfer distance: from 521.8 mm to 2.7 mm; Intersection-over-Union: from 0.87 to 0.98). Surf2CT establishes a new paradigm for non-invasive internal anatomical imaging using only external data, opening opportunities for home-based healthcare, preventive medicine, and personalized clinical assessments without the risks associated with conventional imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>ConfLUNet: Multiple sclerosis lesion instance segmentation in presence of confluent lesions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate lesion-level segmentation on MRI is critical for multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring. However, current evaluation practices largely rely on semantic segmentation post-processed with connected components (CC), which cannot separate confluent lesions (aggregates of confluent lesion units, CLUs) due to reliance on spatial connectivity. To address this misalignment with clinical needs, we introduce formal definitions of CLUs and associated CLU-aware detection metrics, and include them in an exhaustive instance segmentation evaluation framework. Within this framework, we systematically evaluate CC and post-processing-based Automated Confluent Splitting (ACLS), the only existing methods for lesion instance segmentation in MS. Our analysis reveals that CC consistently underestimates CLU counts, while ACLS tends to oversplit lesions, leading to overestimated lesion counts and reduced precision. To overcome these limitations, we propose ConfLUNet, the first end-to-end instance segmentation framework for MS lesions. ConfLUNet jointly optimizes lesion detection and delineation from a single FLAIR image. Trained on 50 patients, ConfLUNet significantly outperforms CC and ACLS on the held-out test set (n=13) in instance segmentation (Panoptic Quality: 42.0% vs. 37.5%/36.8%; p = 0.017/0.005) and lesion detection (F1: 67.3% vs. 61.6%/59.9%; p = 0.028/0.013). For CLU detection, ConfLUNet achieves the highest F1[CLU] (81.5%), improving recall over CC (+12.5%, p = 0.015) and precision over ACLS (+31.2%, p = 0.003). By combining rigorous definitions, new CLU-aware metrics, a reproducible evaluation framework, and the first dedicated end-to-end model, this work lays the foundation for lesion instance segmentation in MS.</description>

      <title>Multipath cycleGAN for harmonization of paired and unpaired low-dose lung computed tomography reconstruction kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstruction kernels in computed tomography (CT) affect spatial resolution and noise characteristics, introducing systematic variability in quantitative imaging measurements such as emphysema quantification. Choosing an appropriate kernel is therefore essential for consistent quantitative analysis. We propose a multipath cycleGAN model for CT kernel harmonization, trained on a mixture of paired and unpaired data from a low-dose lung cancer screening cohort. The model features domain-specific encoders and decoders with a shared latent space and uses discriminators tailored for each domain.We train the model on 42 kernel combinations using 100 scans each from seven representative kernels in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. To evaluate performance, 240 scans from each kernel are harmonized to a reference soft kernel, and emphysema is quantified before and after harmonization. A general linear model assesses the impact of age, sex, smoking status, and kernel on emphysema. We also evaluate harmonization from soft kernels to a reference hard kernel. To assess anatomical consistency, we compare segmentations of lung vessels, muscle, and subcutaneous adipose tissue generated by TotalSegmentator between harmonized and original images. Our model is benchmarked against traditional and switchable cycleGANs. For paired kernels, our approach reduces bias in emphysema scores, as seen in Bland-Altman plots (p&lt;0.05). For unpaired kernels, harmonization eliminates confounding differences in emphysema (p&gt;0.05). High Dice scores confirm preservation of muscle and fat anatomy, while lung vessel overlap remains reasonable. Overall, our shared latent space multipath cycleGAN enables robust harmonization across paired and unpaired CT kernels, improving emphysema quantification and preserving anatomical fidelity.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Lung Cancer Mutation Detection and Staging Using 3D CT Scans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and non-invasive methods for detecting key mutations and staging are essential for improving patient outcomes. Here, we compare the performance of two machine learning models - FMCIB+XGBoost, a supervised model with domain-specific pretraining, and Dinov2+ABMIL, a self-supervised model with attention-based multiple-instance learning - on 3D lung nodule data from the Stanford Radiogenomics and Lung-CT-PT-Dx cohorts. In the task of KRAS and EGFR mutation detection, FMCIB+XGBoost consistently outperformed Dinov2+ABMIL, achieving accuracies of 0.846 and 0.883 for KRAS and EGFR mutations, respectively. In cancer staging, Dinov2+ABMIL demonstrated competitive generalization, achieving an accuracy of 0.797 for T-stage prediction in the Lung-CT-PT-Dx cohort, suggesting SSL's adaptability across diverse datasets. Our results emphasize the clinical utility of supervised models in mutation detection and highlight the potential of SSL to improve staging generalization, while identifying areas for enhancement in mutation sensitivity.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance across multiple classification models to classify chest X-ray images into four categories of COVID-19, pneumonia, tuberculosis (TB), and normal cases. We leveraged transfer learning techniques with state-of-the-art pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models. We fine-tuned these pre-trained architectures on a labeled medical x-ray images. The initial results are promising with high accuracy and strong performance in key classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. We applied Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for model interpretability to provide visual explanations for classification decisions, improving trust and transparency in clinical applications.</description>

      <title>CIM-NET: A Video Denoising Deep Neural Network Model Optimized for Computing-in-Memory Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep neural network (DNN)-based video denoising has demonstrated significant performance, deploying state-of-the-art models on edge devices remains challenging due to stringent real-time and energy efficiency requirements. Computing-in-Memory (CIM) chips offer a promising solution by integrating computation within memory cells, enabling rapid matrix-vector multiplication (MVM). However, existing DNN models are often designed without considering CIM architectural constraints, thus limiting their acceleration potential during inference. To address this, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-design framework incorporating two innovations: (1) a CIM-Aware Architecture, CIM-NET, optimized for large receptive field operation and CIM's crossbar-based MVM acceleration; and (2) a pseudo-convolutional operator, CIM-CONV, used within CIM-NET to integrate slide-based processing with fully connected transformations for high-quality feature extraction and reconstruction. This framework significantly reduces the number of MVM operations, improving inference speed on CIM chips while maintaining competitive performance. Experimental results indicate that, compared to the conventional lightweight model FastDVDnet, CIM-NET substantially reduces MVM operations with a slight decrease in denoising performance. With a stride value of 8, CIM-NET reduces MVM operations to 1/77th of the original, while maintaining competitive PSNR (35.11 dB vs. 35.56 dB</description>

      <title>Compressive Fourier-Domain Intensity Coupling (C-FOCUS) enables near-millimeter deep imaging in the intact mouse brain in vivo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-photon microscopy is a powerful tool for in vivo imaging, but its imaging depth is typically limited to a few hundred microns due to tissue scattering, even with existing scattering correction techniques. Moreover, most active scattering correction methods are restricted to small regions by the optical memory effect. Here, we introduce compressive Fourier-domain intensity coupling for scattering correction (C-FOCUS), an active scattering correction approach that integrates Fourier-domain intensity modulation with compressive sensing for two-photon microscopy. Using C-FOCUS, we demonstrate high-resolution imaging of YFP-labeled neurons and FITC-labeled blood vessels at depths exceeding 900 um in the intact mouse brain in vivo. Furthermore, we achieve transcranial imaging of YFP-labeled dendritic structures through the intact adult mouse skull. C-FOCUS enables high-contrast fluorescence imaging at depths previously inaccessible using two-photon microscopy with 1035 nm excitation, enhancing fluorescence intensity by over 20-fold compared to uncorrected imaging. C-FOCUS provides a broadly applicable strategy for rapid, deep-tissue optical imaging in vivo.</description>

      <title>Learnable Burst-Encodable Time-of-Flight Imaging for High-Fidelity Long-Distance Depth Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-distance depth imaging holds great promise for applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. Direct time-of-flight (dToF) imaging offers high-precision, long-distance depth sensing, yet demands ultra-short pulse light sources and high-resolution time-to-digital converters. In contrast, indirect time-of-flight (iToF) imaging often suffers from phase wrapping and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the sensing distance increases. In this paper, we introduce a novel ToF imaging paradigm, termed Burst-Encodable Time-of-Flight (BE-ToF), which facilitates high-fidelity, long-distance depth imaging. Specifically, the BE-ToF system emits light pulses in burst mode and estimates the phase delay of the reflected signal over the entire burst period, thereby effectively avoiding the phase wrapping inherent to conventional iToF systems. Moreover, to address the low SNR caused by light attenuation over increasing distances, we propose an end-to-end learnable framework that jointly optimizes the coding functions and the depth reconstruction network. A specialized double well function and first-order difference term are incorporated into the framework to ensure the hardware implementability of the coding functions. The proposed approach is rigorously validated through comprehensive simulations and real-world prototype experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Synonymous Variational Inference for Perceptual Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent contributions of semantic information theory reveal the set-element relationship between semantic and syntactic information, represented as synonymous relationships. In this paper, we propose a synonymous variational inference (SVI) method based on this synonymity viewpoint to re-analyze the perceptual image compression problem. It takes perceptual similarity as a typical synonymous criterion to build an ideal synonymous set (Synset), and approximate the posterior of its latent synonymous representation with a parametric density by minimizing a partial semantic KL divergence. This analysis theoretically proves that the optimization direction of perception image compression follows a triple tradeoff that can cover the existing rate-distortion-perception schemes. Additionally, we introduce synonymous image compression (SIC), a new image compression scheme that corresponds to the analytical process of SVI, and implement a progressive SIC codec to fully leverage the model's capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate comparable rate-distortion-perception performance using a single progressive SIC codec, thus verifying the effectiveness of our proposed analysis method.</description>

      <title>PS4PRO: Pixel-to-pixel Supervision for Photorealistic Rendering and Optimization</title>

Abstract: Neural rendering methods have gained significant attention for their ability to reconstruct 3D scenes from 2D images. The core idea is to take multiple views as input and optimize the reconstructed scene by minimizing the uncertainty in geometry and appearance across the views. However, the reconstruction quality is limited by the number of input views. This limitation is further pronounced in complex and dynamic scenes, where certain angles of objects are never seen. In this paper, we propose to use video frame interpolation as the data augmentation method for neural rendering. Furthermore, we design a lightweight yet high-quality video frame interpolation model, PS4PRO (Pixel-to-pixel Supervision for Photorealistic Rendering and Optimization). PS4PRO is trained on diverse video datasets, implicitly modeling camera movement as well as real-world 3D geometry. Our model performs as an implicit world prior, enriching the photo supervision for 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the proposed method, we effectively augment existing datasets for neural rendering methods. Our experimental results indicate that our method improves the reconstruction performance on both static and dynamic scenes.</description>

      <title>Structurally Different Neural Network Blocks for the Segmentation of Atrial and Aortic Perivascular Adipose Tissue in Multi-centre CT Angiography Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the emergence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and, later, vision transformers (ViTs), deep learning architectures have predominantly relied on identical block types with varying hyperparameters. We propose a novel block alternation strategy to leverage the complementary strengths of different architectural designs, assembling structurally distinct components similar to Lego blocks. We introduce LegoNet, a deep learning framework that alternates CNN-based and SwinViT-based blocks to enhance feature learning for medical image segmentation. We investigate three variations of LegoNet and apply this concept to a previously unexplored clinical problem: the segmentation of the internal mammary artery (IMA), aorta, and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) from computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans. These PVAT regions have been shown to possess prognostic value in assessing cardiovascular risk and primary clinical outcomes. We evaluate LegoNet on large datasets, achieving superior performance to other leading architectures. Furthermore, we assess the model's generalizability on external testing cohorts, where an expert clinician corrects the model's segmentations, achieving DSC &gt; 0.90 across various external, international, and public cohorts. To further validate the model's clinical reliability, we perform intra- and inter-observer variability analysis, demonstrating strong agreement with human annotations. The proposed methodology has significant implications for diagnostic cardiovascular management and early prognosis, offering a robust, automated solution for vascular and perivascular segmentation and risk assessment in clinical practice, paving the way for personalised medicine.</description>

      <title>MOSformer: Momentum encoder-based inter-slice fusion transformer for medical image segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation takes an important position in various clinical applications. 2.5D-based segmentation models bridge the computational efficiency of 2D-based models with the spatial perception capabilities of 3D-based models. However, existing 2.5D-based models primarily adopt a single encoder to extract features of target and neighborhood slices, failing to effectively fuse inter-slice information, resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. In this study, a novel momentum encoder-based inter-slice fusion transformer (MOSformer) is proposed to overcome this issue by leveraging inter-slice information at multi-scale feature maps extracted by different encoders. Specifically, dual encoders are employed to enhance feature distinguishability among different slices. One of the encoders is moving-averaged to maintain consistent slice representations. Moreover, an inter-slice fusion transformer (IF-Trans) module is developed to fuse inter-slice multi-scale features. The MOSformer is evaluated on three benchmark datasets (Synapse, ACDC, and AMOS), achieving a new state-of-the-art with 85.63%, 92.19%, and 85.43% DSC, respectively. These results demonstrate MOSformer's competitiveness in medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>SLoRD: Structural Low-Rank Descriptors for Shape Consistency in Vertebrae Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic and precise multi-class vertebrae segmentation from CT images is crucial for various clinical applications. However, due to similar appearances between adjacent vertebrae and the existence of various pathologies, existing single-stage and multi-stage methods suffer from imprecise vertebrae segmentation. Essentially, these methods fail to explicitly impose both contour precision and intra-vertebrae voxel consistency constraints synchronously, resulting in the intra-vertebrae segmentation inconsistency, which refers to multiple label predictions inside a singular vertebra. In this work, we intend to label complete binary masks with sequential indices to address that challenge. Specifically, a contour generation network is proposed based on Structural Low-Rank Descriptors for shape consistency, termed SLoRD. For a structural representation of vertebral contours, we adopt the spherical coordinate system and devise the spherical centroid to calculate contour descriptors. Due to vertebrae's similar appearances, basic contour descriptors can be acquired offline to restore original contours. Therefore, SLoRD leverages these contour priors and explicit shape constraints to facilitate regressed contour points close to vertebral surfaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on VerSe 2019 and 2020 demonstrate the superior performance of our framework over other single-stage and multi-stage state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Further, SLoRD is a plug-and-play framework to refine the segmentation inconsistency existing in coarse predictions from other approaches. Source codes are available.</description>

      <title>A Plug-and-Play Method for Guided Multi-contrast MRI Reconstruction based on Content/Style Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since multiple MRI contrasts of the same anatomy contain redundant information, one contrast can guide the reconstruction of an undersampled subsequent contrast. To this end, several end-to-end learning-based guided reconstruction methods have been proposed. However, a key challenge is the requirement of large paired training datasets comprising raw data and aligned reference images. We propose a modular two-stage approach addressing this issue, additionally providing an explanatory framework for the multi-contrast problem based on the shared and non-shared generative factors underlying two given contrasts. A content/style model of two-contrast image data is learned from a largely unpaired image-domain dataset and is subsequently applied as a plug-and-play operator in iterative reconstruction. The disentanglement of content and style allows explicit representation of contrast-independent and contrast-specific factors. Consequently, incorporating prior information into the reconstruction reduces to a simple replacement of the aliased content of the reconstruction iterate with high-quality content derived from the reference scan. Combining this component with a data consistency step and introducing a general corrective process for the content yields an iterative scheme. We name this novel approach PnP-CoSMo. Various aspects like interpretability and convergence are explored via simulations. Furthermore, its practicality is demonstrated on the NYU fastMRI DICOM dataset, showing improved generalizability compared to end-to-end methods, and on two in-house multi-coil raw datasets, offering up to 32.6% more acceleration over learning-based non-guided reconstruction for a given SSIM. In a small radiological task, PnP-CoSMo allowed 33.3% more acceleration over clinical reconstruction at diagnostic quality.</description>

      <title>Distribution-aware Fairness Learning in Medical Image Segmentation From A Control-Theoretic Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring fairness in medical image segmentation is critical due to biases in imbalanced clinical data acquisition caused by demographic attributes (e.g., age, sex, race) and clinical factors (e.g., disease severity). To address these challenges, we introduce Distribution-aware Mixture of Experts (dMoE), inspired by optimal control theory. We provide a comprehensive analysis of its underlying mechanisms and clarify dMoE's role in adapting to heterogeneous distributions in medical image segmentation. Furthermore, we integrate dMoE into multiple network architectures, demonstrating its broad applicability across diverse medical image analysis tasks. By incorporating demographic and clinical factors, dMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance on two 2D benchmark datasets and a 3D in-house dataset. Our results highlight the effectiveness of dMoE in mitigating biases from imbalanced distributions, offering a promising approach to bridging control theory and medical image segmentation within fairness learning paradigms. The source code will be made available. The source code is available at https://github.com/tvseg/dMoE.</description>

      <title>Bridging Scales in Map Generation: A scale-aware cascaded generative mapping framework for seamless and consistent multi-scale cartographic representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-scale tile maps are essential for geographic information services, serving as fundamental outcomes of surveying and cartographic workflows. While existing image generation networks can produce map-like outputs from remote sensing imagery, their emphasis on replicating texture rather than preserving geospatial features limits cartographic validity. Current approaches face two fundamental challenges: inadequate integration of cartographic generalization principles with dynamic multi-scale generation and spatial discontinuities arising from tile-wise generation. To address these limitations, we propose a scale-aware cartographic generation framework (SCGM) that leverages conditional guided diffusion and a multi-scale cascade architecture. The framework introduces three key innovations: a scale modality encoding mechanism to formalize map generalization relationships, a scale-driven conditional encoder for robust feature fusion, and a cascade reference mechanism ensuring cross-scale visual consistency. By hierarchically constraining large-scale map synthesis with small-scale structural priors, SCGM effectively mitigates edge artifacts while maintaining geographic fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on cartographic benchmarks confirm the framework's ability to generate seamless multi-scale tile maps with enhanced spatial coherence and generalization-aware representation, demonstrating significant potential for emergency mapping and automated cartography applications.</description>

      <title>SegRet: An Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation with Retentive Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid evolution of autonomous driving technology and intelligent transportation systems, semantic segmentation has become increasingly critical. Precise interpretation and analysis of real-world environments are indispensable for these advanced applications. However, traditional semantic segmentation approaches frequently face challenges in balancing model performance with computational efficiency, especially regarding the volume of model parameters. To address these constraints, we propose SegRet, a novel model employing the Retentive Network (RetNet) architecture coupled with a lightweight residual decoder that integrates zero-initialization. SegRet offers three distinctive advantages: (1) Lightweight Residual Decoder: by embedding a zero-initialization layer within the residual network structure, the decoder remains computationally streamlined without sacrificing essential information propagation; (2) Robust Feature Extraction: adopting RetNet as its backbone enables SegRet to effectively capture hierarchical image features, thereby enriching the representation quality of extracted features; (3) Parameter Efficiency: SegRet attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation performance while markedly decreasing the number of parameters, ensuring high accuracy without imposing additional computational burdens. Comprehensive empirical evaluations on prominent benchmarks, such as ADE20K, Citycapes, and COCO-Stuff, highlight the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>X-GAN: A Generative AI-Powered Unsupervised Model for Main Vessel Segmentation of Glaucoma Screening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural changes in main retinal blood vessels serve as critical biomarkers for the onset and progression of glaucoma. Identifying these vessels is vital for vascular modeling yet highly challenging. This paper proposes X-GAN, a generative AI-powered unsupervised segmentation model designed for extracting main blood vessels from Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images. The process begins with the Space Colonization Algorithm (SCA) to rapidly generate a skeleton of vessels, featuring their radii. By synergistically integrating the generative adversarial network (GAN) with biostatistical modeling of vessel radii, X-GAN enables a fast reconstruction of both 2D and 3D representations of the vessels. Based on this reconstruction, X-GAN achieves nearly 100% segmentation accuracy without relying on labeled data or high-performance computing resources. Experimental results confirm X-GAN's superiority in evaluating main vessel segmentation compared to existing deep learning models. Code is here: https://github.com/VikiXie/SatMar8.</description>

      <title>Complex Wavelet Mutual Information Loss: A Multi-Scale Loss Function for Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep neural networks have significantly enhanced the performance of semantic segmentation. However, class imbalance and instance imbalance remain persistent challenges, where smaller instances and thin boundaries are often overshadowed by larger structures. To address the multiscale nature of segmented objects, various models have incorporated mechanisms such as spatial attention and feature pyramid networks. Despite these advancements, most loss functions are still primarily pixel-wise, while regional and boundary-focused loss functions often incur high computational costs or are restricted to small-scale regions. To address this limitation, we propose the complex wavelet mutual information (CWMI) loss, a novel loss function that leverages mutual information from subband images decomposed by a complex steerable pyramid. The complex steerable pyramid captures features across multiple orientations and preserves structural similarity across scales. Meanwhile, mutual information is well-suited to capturing high-dimensional directional features and offers greater noise robustness. Extensive experiments on diverse segmentation datasets demonstrate that CWMI loss achieves significant improvements in both pixel-wise accuracy and topological metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods, while introducing minimal computational overhead.

      <description>arXiv:2505.20876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a stereo radargrammetry method using deep learning from airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Deep learning-based methods are considered to suffer less from geometric image modulation, while there is no public SAR image dataset used to train such methods. We create a SAR image dataset and perform fine-tuning of a deep learning-based image correspondence method. The proposed method suppresses the degradation of image quality by pixel interpolation without ground projection of the SAR image and divides the SAR image into patches for processing, which makes it possible to apply deep learning. Through a set of experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits a wider range and more accurate elevation measurements compared to conventional methods.
