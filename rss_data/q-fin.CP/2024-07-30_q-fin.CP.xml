      <title>Enhancing Black-Scholes Delta Hedging via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a deep delta hedging framework for options, utilizing neural networks to learn the residuals between the hedging function and the implied Black-Scholes delta. This approach leverages the smoother properties of these residuals, enhancing deep learning performance. Utilizing ten years of daily S&amp;P 500 index option data, our empirical analysis demonstrates that learning the residuals, using the mean squared one-step hedging error as the loss function, significantly improves hedging performance over directly learning the hedging function, often by more than 100%. Adding input features when learning the residuals enhances hedging performance more for puts than calls, with market sentiment being less crucial. Furthermore, learning the residuals with three years of data matches the hedging performance of directly learning with ten years of data, proving that our method demands less data.</description>

      <title>Towards A Post-Quantum Cryptography in Blockchain I: Basic Review on Theoretical Cryptography and Quantum Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the invention of quantum computers was so revolutionary that they bring transformative challenges in a variety of fields, especially for the traditional cryptographic blockchain, and it may become a real thread for most of the cryptocurrencies in the market. That is, it becomes inevitable to consider to implement a post-quantum cryptography, which is also referred to as quantum-resistant cryptography, for attaining quantum resistance in blockchains.</description>

      <title>Generalized Groves of Neural Additive Models: Pursuing transparent and accurate machine learning models in finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While machine learning methods have significantly improved model performance over traditional methods, their black-box structure makes it difficult for researchers to interpret results. For highly regulated financial industries, model transparency is equally important to accuracy. Without understanding how models work, even highly accurate machine learning methods are unlikely to be accepted. We address this issue by introducing a novel class of transparent machine learning models known as generalized groves of neural additive models. The generalized groves of neural additive models separate features into three categories: linear features, individual nonlinear features, and interacted nonlinear features. Additionally, interactions in the last category are only local. A stepwise selection algorithm distinguishes the linear and nonlinear components, and interacted groups are carefully verified by applying additive separation criteria. Through some empirical examples in finance, we demonstrate that generalized grove of neural additive models exhibit high accuracy and transparency with predominantly linear terms and only sparse nonlinear ones.</description>

      <title>The Democratization of Wealth Management: Hedged Mutual Fund Blockchain Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop several innovations to bring the best practices of traditional investment funds to the blockchain landscape. Specifically, we illustrate how: 1) fund prices can be updated regularly like mutual funds; 2) performance fees can be charged like hedge funds; 3) mutually hedged blockchain investment funds can operate with investor protection schemes, such as high water marks; and 4) measures to offset trading related slippage costs when redemptions happen. Using our concepts - and blockchain technology - traditional funds can calculate performance fees in a simplified manner and alleviate several operational issues. Blockchain can solve many problems for traditional finance, while tried and tested wealth management techniques can benefit decentralization, speeding its adoption. We provide detailed steps - including mathematical formulations and instructive pointers - to implement these ideas and discuss how our designs overcome several blockchain bottlenecks, making smart contracts smarter. We provide numerical illustrations of several scenarios related to our mechanisms.</description>
