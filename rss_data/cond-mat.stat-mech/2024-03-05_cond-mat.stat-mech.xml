      <title>Reclaiming the Lost Conformality in a non-Hermitian Quantum 5-state Potts Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformal symmetry, emerging at critical points, can be lost when renormalization group fixed points collide. Recently, it was proposed that after collisions, real fixed points transition into the complex plane, becoming complex fixed points described by complex conformal field theories (CFTs). Although this idea is compelling, directly demonstrating such complex conformal fixed points in microscopic models remains highly demanding. Furthermore, these concrete models are instrumental in unraveling the mysteries of complex CFTs and illuminating a variety of intriguing physical problems, including weakly first-order transitions in statistical mechanics and the conformal window of gauge theories. In this work, we have successfully addressed this complex challenge for the (1+1)-dimensional quantum $5$-state Potts model, whose phase transition has long been known to be weakly first-order. By adding an additional non-Hermitian interaction, we successfully identify two conjugate critical points located in the complex parameter space, where the lost conformality is restored in a complex manner. Specifically, we unambiguously demonstrate the radial quantization of the complex CFTs and compute the operator spectrum, as well as new operator product expansion coefficients that were previously unknown.</description>

      <title>Bethe $M$-layer construction on the Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical physics, one of the standard methods to study second order phase transitions is the renormalization group that usually leads to an expansion around the corresponding fully connected solution. Unfortunately, often in disordered models, some important finite dimensional second-order phase transitions are qualitatively different or absent in the corresponding fully connected model: in such cases the standard expansion fails. Recently, a new method, the $M$-layer one, has been introduced that performs an expansion around a different soluble mean field model: the Bethe lattice one. This new method has been already used to compute the upper critical dimension $D_U$ of different disordered systems such as the Random Field Ising model or the Spin glass model with field. If then one wants to go beyond and construct an expansion around $D_U$ to understand how critical quantities get renormalized, the actual computation of all the numerical factors is needed. This next step has still not been performed, being technically more involved. In this paper we perform this computation for the ferromagnetic Ising model without quenched disorder, in finite dimensions: we show that, at one-loop order inside the $M$-layer approach, we recover the continuum quartic field theory and we are able to identify the coupling constant $g$ and the other parameters of the theory, as a function of macroscopic and microscopic details of the model such as the lattice spacing, the physical lattice dimension and the temperature. This is a fundamental step that will help in applying in the future the same techniques to more complicated systems, for which the standard field theoretical approach is impracticable.</description>

      <title>Inferring potential landscapes: A Schr\"odinger bridge approach to Maximum Caliber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger bridges have emerged as an enabling framework for unveiling the stochastic dynamics of systems based on marginal observations at different points in time. The terminology "bridge'' refers to a probability law that suitably interpolates such marginals. The theory plays a pivotal role in a variety of contemporary developments in machine learning, stochastic control, thermodynamics, and biology, to name a few, impacting disciplines such as single-cell genomics, meteorology, and robotics. In this work, we extend Schr\"odinger's paradigm of bridges to account for integral constraints along paths, in a way akin to Maximum Caliber - a Maximum Entropy principle applied in a dynamic context. The Maximum Caliber principle has proven useful to infer the dynamics of complex systems e.g., that model gene circuits and protein folding. We unify these two problems via a maximum likelihood formulation to reconcile stochastic dynamics with ensemble-path data. A variety of data types can be encompassed, ranging from distribution moments to average currents along paths. The framework enables inference of time-varying potential landscapes that drive the process. The resulting forces can be interpreted as the optimal control that drives the system in a way that abides by specified integral constraints. Analogous results are presented in a discrete-time, discrete-space setting and specialized to steady-state dynamics. We finish by illustrating the practical applicability of the framework through paradigmatic examples, such as that of bit erasure or protein folding. In doing so, we highlight the strengths of the proposed framework, namely, the generality of the theory, the ease of computation, and the ability to interpret results in terms of system dynamics. This is in contrast to Maximum-Caliber problems where the focus is typically on updating a probability law on paths.</description>

      <title>Energy fluctuations of a Brownian particle freely moving in a liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the variation of the kinetic energy of a spherical Brownian particle that freely moves in an incompressible fluid at constant temperature. Based on the underdamped version of the generalized Langevin equation that includes the inertia of both the particle and the displaced fluid, we derive an analytical expression for the probability density function of such a kinetic energy variation during an arbitrary time interval, which exactly amounts to the energy exchanged with the fluid in absence of external forces. We also determine all the moments of this probability distribution, which can be fully expressed in terms of a function that is proportional to the velocity autocorrelation function of the particle. The derived expressions are verified by means of numerical simulations of the stochastic motion of a particle in a viscous liquid with hydrodynamic backflow for representative values of the time-scales of the system. Furthermore, we also investigate the effect of viscoelasticity on the statistics of the kinetic energy variation of the particle, which reveals the existence of three distinct regimes of the energy exchange process depending on the values of the viscoelastic parameters of the fluid.</description>

      <title>Application of the concept of hierarchical subordination to chain reactions in a nuclear reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the theory of hierarchical structures, a correspondence has been established between the dynamics for the number of neutrons obtained from the theory of branching processes, the number of neutrons of the n-th generation, the number of nodes at the n-th level of the hierarchy, the rate of change in the probability of a chain reaction, the type of intensity and strength of the hierarchical connection, the degree reactor criticality, and neutron trajectories in the reactor. A connection has been found between the probabilities of the formation of a certain generation of the number of neutrons and the probability of the occurrence of a self-sustaining chain reaction of nuclear fission. It is shown that the Tsallis and R\'enyi distributions describing these processes are related by relations of deformed algebra, and under certain conditions can be accompanying with respect to each other.</description>

      <title>Discrete Newtonian dynamics with Nos\'{e}-Hoover thermostats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost all Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are discrete dynamics with Newton's algorithm first published in 1687, and much later by L. Verlet in 1967. Discrete Newtonian dynamics has the same qualities as Newton's classical analytic dynamics. Verlet also published a first-order expression for the instant temperature which is inaccurate but presumably used in most MD simulations. One of the motivations for the present article is to correct this unnecessary inaccuracy in $NVT$ MD dynamics. Another motivation is to derive simple algorithms for the Nos\'{e}-Hoover $NVT$ dynamics (NH) with the correct temperature constraint. The simulations with NH discrete Newtonian dynamics show that the NH works excellent for a wide range of the response time $\tau$ of the NH thermostat, but NH simulations favor a choice of a short response time, even shorter than the discrete-time increment $\delta t$ used in MD, to avoid large oscillations of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Induced Anomalous Mobility Enhancement in Confined Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong, scale-free disorder disrupts typical transport properties like the Stokes-Einstein relation and linear response, leading to anomalous, non-diffusive motion observed in amorphous materials, glasses, living cells, and other systems. Our study reveals that the combination of scale-free quenched disorder and geometrical constraints induces unconventional single particle mobility behavior. Specifically, in a $2$-dimensional channel with width $w$, under external drive, tighter geometrical constraints (smaller $w$) enhance mobility. We derive an explicit form of the response to an external force by utilizing the double-subordination approach for the quenched trap model. The observed mobility enhancement occurs in the low-temperature regime where the distribution of localization times is scale-free.</description>

      <title>Transport and integrability-breaking in non-Hermitian many-body quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing open quantum systems in terms of effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians gives rise to non-unitary time evolution. In this paper, we study the impact of non-unitary dynamics on the emergent hydrodynamics in quantum systems with a global conservation law. To this end, we demonstrate how linear-response correlation functions can be generalized and interpreted in the case of non-Hermitian systems. Moreover, we show that dynamical quantum typicality provides an efficient numerical approach to evaluate such correlation functions, even though the non-unitary dynamics leads to subtleties that are absent in the Hermitian case. As a point of reference for our analysis, we consider the Hermitian spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain, whose high-temperature transport properties have been characterized extensively in recent years. Here, we explore the resulting hydrodynamics for different non-Hermitian perturbations of the XXZ chain. We also discuss the role of integrability by studying the complex energy-level statistics of the non-Hermitian quantum models.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of Dynamical System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering dynamical equations from observed noisy data is the central challenge of system identification. We develop a statistical mechanical approach to analyze sparse equation discovery algorithms, which typically balance data fit and parsimony through a trial-and-error selection of hyperparameters. In this framework, statistical mechanics offers tools to analyze the interplay between complexity and fitness, in analogy to that done between entropy and energy. To establish this analogy, we define the optimization procedure as a two-level Bayesian inference problem that separates variable selection from coefficient values and enables the computation of the posterior parameter distribution in closed form. A key advantage of employing statistical mechanical concepts, such as free energy and the partition function, is in the quantification of uncertainty, especially in in the low-data limit; frequently encountered in real-world applications. As the data volume increases, our approach mirrors the thermodynamic limit, leading to distinct sparsity- and noise-induced phase transitions that delineate correct from incorrect identification. This perspective of sparse equation discovery, is versatile and can be adapted to various other equation discovery algorithms.</description>

      <title>Exact steady states in the asymmetric simple exclusion process beyond one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is a paradigmatic nonequilibrium many-body system that describes the asymmetric random walk of particles with exclusion interactions in a lattice. Although the ASEP is recognized as an exactly solvable model, most of the exact results obtained so far are limited to one-dimensional systems. Here, we construct the exact steady states of the ASEP with closed and periodic boundary conditions in arbitrary dimensions. This is achieved through the concept of transition decomposition, which enables the treatment of the multi-dimensional ASEP as a composite of the one-dimensional ASEPs.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Energetics of the Finite-time Driving of Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase transitions for many-body systems have been understood using field theories. A few canonical physical model classes encapsulate the underlying physical properties of a large number of systems. The finite-time driving of such systems and associated optimal energetic costs have not been investigated yet. We consider two universality classes Model A and Model B, that describe the dynamics for the non-conserved and conserved scalar order parameters respectively. Here, using the recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics and optimal transport theory, we analytically compute the optimal driving protocols by minimizing the mean stochastic work required for finite-time driving. Further, we numerically optimize the mean and variance of the stochastic work simultaneously. Such a multi-objective optimization is called a Pareto optimization problem and its optimal solution is a Pareto front. We discover a first-order Pareto phase transition in the Pareto front. Physically, it corresponds to the coexistence of two classes of optimal driving protocols analogous to the liquid-gas coexistence for the equilibrium phase transition. Our framework sheds light on the finite-time optimal driving of the fields and the trade-off between the mean and fluctuations of the optimal work.</description>

      <title>Proof of the nonintegrability of PXP model and general spin-$1/2$ systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for proving non-integrability of the quantum systems. For spin-$1/2$ systems, we show that the presence or absence of the local conserved quantity can be shown using the graph theoretical analysis. This approach helps to systematically classify the number of local conserved quantity, as aiding the proof of non-integrability of the Hamiltonian. Using this approach, we prove for the first time that the PXP model is nonintegrable. We also show that our method is applicable to the well-known proof of the non-integrability of other spin-$1/2$ systems. Our new approach offers a significant simplification of the proof of non-integrability and provides a deeper understanding of quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain problems that lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. Establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. One such problem is the simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics of a magnetic spin system quenched through a quantum phase transition. State-of-the-art classical simulations demand resources that grow exponentially with system size. Here we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench in two-, three- and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for classical approaches. We assess approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks and conclude that no known approach can achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable timeframe. Thus quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that classical computers cannot.</description>

      <title>Quantitatively Connecting Experimental Time-Temperature-Superposition-Breakdown of Polymers near the Glass Transition to Dynamic Heterogeneity via the Heterogeneous Rouse Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers near the glass transition temperature Tg often exhibit a breakdown of time-temperature-superposition (TTS), with chain relaxation times and viscosity exhibiting a weaker temperature dependence than segmental relaxation times. The origin of this onset of thermorheological complexity has remained unsettled and a matter of debate. Here we extend the Heterogeneous Rouse Model (HRM), which generalizes the Rouse model to account for dynamic heterogeneity, to make predictions for the relaxation modulus G(t) and complex modulus G*($\omega$) of unentangled polymers near Tg. The HRM predicts that G(t) and G*($\omega$) exhibit enhanced effective scaling exponents in the Rouse regime in the presence of dynamic heterogeneity, with a more rapid decay from the glassy plateau emerging as the system becomes more dynamically heterogeneous on cooling. This behavior is predicted to emerge from a strand-length dependence of the moment of the segmental mobility distribution probed by chain dynamics. We show that the HRM predictions are in good accord with experimental complex modulus data for polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(2-vinyl pyridine). The HRM also predicts the onset of distinct temperature dependences among chain scale quantities such as terminal relaxation time and viscosity in our experimental systems, apparently resolving one of the most significant standing objections to a heterogeneity-based origin of TTS-breakdown. The HRM thus provides a generalized theory of the chain-scale linear rheological response of unentangled polymers near Tg, accounting for the origin of TTS-breakdown at a molecular mechanistic level. It also points towards a new strategy of inferring the dynamic heterogeneity of glass-forming polymeric systems based on the temperature-evolution of modified scaling in the Rouse regime.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Quantum Annealing: Searching for Deep Low-Energy States in 5000-Qubit Spin Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers promise a qualitative speedup in solving a broad spectrum of real-life optimization problems. The latter can be mapped onto the task of finding low-energy states of spin glasses, which is known to be exceedingly difficult. Using D-Wave's 5000-qubit quantum processor, we demonstrate that a recently proposed iterative cyclic quantum annealing algorithm[1] can find deep low-energy states in record time. We also find intricate structures in a low-energy landscape of spin glasses, such as a power-law distribution of connected clusters with a small surface energy. These observations offer guidance for further improvement of the optimization algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin current model of electric polarization of multiferroics is justified via the quantum hydrodynamic method and the mean-field part of the spin-orbit interaction. The spin current model is applied to derive the electric polarization proportional to the scalar product of the spins of the near by ions, which appears to be caused by the Dzylaoshinskii-Moriya interaction. Symmetric tensor spin structure of the polarization is discussed as well. We start our derivations for the ferromagnetic multiferroic materials and present the further generalization for the antiferromagnetic multiferroic materials. We rederive the operator of the electric dipole moment, which provides the macroscopic polarization obtained via the spin current model. Finally, we use the quantum average of the found electric dipole moment operator in order to derive the polarization evolution equation for the antiferromagnetic multiferroic materials. Possibility of spiral spin structures is analyzed.</description>

      <title>A universal niche geometry governs the response of ecosystems to environmental perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How ecosystems respond to environmental perturbations is a fundamental question in ecology, made especially challenging due to the strong coupling between species and their environment. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for calculating the linear response of ecosystems to environmental perturbations in generalized consumer-resource models. Our construction is applicable to a wide class of systems, including models with non-reciprocal interactions, cross-feeding, and non-linear growth/consumption rates. Within our framework, all ecological variables are embedded into four distinct vector spaces and ecological interactions are represented by geometric transformations between these spaces. We show that near a steady state, such geometric transformations directly map environmental perturbations -- in resource availability and mortality rates -- to shifts in niche structure. We illustrate these ideas in a variety of settings including a minimal model for pH-induced toxicity in bacterial denitrification.</description>

      <title>Negative Temperature in Spin Dynamics Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple and computationally efficient algorithm enables implementing negative temperature values in a spin dynamics simulation. The algorithm uses a Langevin spin dynamics thermostat with a negative damping parameter, enabling the thermalization of an arbitrary interacting spin system to the Gibbs energy distribution with a given negative temperature value. Canonical spin dynamics simulations at a negative temperature are as robust as conventional positive spin temperature simulations, providing a tool for quantitative dynamic studies of the physics of highly excited magnetic states. Two simulation case studies describing spin systems with antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic ground states are explored. The phase transitions occurring in the negative temperature range do not necessarily exhibit similarities with their positive temperature counterparts. The transition temperatures and the character of spin alignment vary depending on the spatial range and strength of spin-spin interactions.</description>

      <title>Self-limiting stacks of curvature-frustrated colloidal plates: Roles of intra-particle versus inter-particle deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In geometrically frustrated assemblies local inter-subunit misfits propagate to intra-assembly strain gradients, giving rise to anomalous self-limiting assembly thermodynamics. Here, we use theory and coarse-grained simulation to study a recently developed class of ``curvamer'' particles, flexible shell-like particles that exhibit self-limiting assembly due to the build up of curvature deformation in cohesive stacks. To address a generic, yet poorly understood aspect of frustrated assembly, we introduce a model of curvamer assembly that incorporates both {\it intra-particle} shape deformation as well as compliance of {\it inter-particle} cohesive gaps, an effect we can attribute to a {\it finite range of attraction} between particles. We show that the ratio of intra-particle (bending elasticity) to inter-particle stiffness not only controls the regimes of self-limitation but also the nature of frustration propagation through curvamer stacks. We find a transition from uniformly-bound, curvature-focusing stacks at small size to gap-opened, uniformly curved stacks at large size is controlled by a dimensionless measure of inter- versus intra-curvamer stiffness. The finite range of inter-particle attraction determines range of cohesion in stacks are self-limiting, a prediction which is in strong agreement with numerical studies of our coarse-grained colloidal model. These predictions provide critical guidance for experimental realizations of frustrated particle systems designed to exhibit self-limitation at especially large multi-particle scales.</description>

      <title>Jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in amorphous materials sheared by cyclic quasistatic deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jamming is an athermal transition between flowing and rigid states in amorphous systems such as granular matter, colloidal suspensions, complex fluids and cells. The jamming transition seems to display mixed aspects of a first-order transition, evidenced by a discontinuity in the coordination number, and a second-order transition, indicated by power-law scalings and diverging lengths. Here we demonstrate that jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in cyclically sheared systems with quasistatic deformations. Particle models are simulated in two and three dimensions, which undergo reversible-irreversible transitions under cyclic shear. The ensemble of configurations, with partially crystallized and fragile states excluded, is generated in the irreversible phase, where the system is stationary and particles are diffusive. Detailed scaling analyses are performed on the distribution of coordination numbers. The fluctuation of the jamming density in finite-sized systems has important consequences on the finite-size effects of various quantities, resulting in a square relationship between disconnected and connected susceptibilities, a key signature of first-order transitions with quenched disorder. This study puts the jamming transition into the category of a broad class of transitions in disordered systems, including the first-order transition in the random-field Ising model, brittle yielding of amorphous materials, and melting of ultra-stable glasses.</description>

      <title>Quantum counterdiabatic driving with local control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppression of diabatic transitions in quantum adiabatic evolution stands as a significant challenge for ground state preparations. Counterdiabatic driving has been proposed to compensate for diabatic losses and achieve shortcut to adiabaticity. However, its implementation necessitates the generation of adiabatic gauge potential, which requires knowledge of the spectral gap of instantaneous Hamiltonians and involves highly non-local drivings in many-body systems. In this work, we consider local counterdiabatic (LCD) driving with approximate adiabatic gauge potential. Using transverse-field Ising model as an example, we present an in-depth study of the performance and optimization of LCD protocols. We then propose a novel two-step protocol based on LCD and simple local single-body control to further improve the performance. The optimization of these LCD-based protocols does not require knowledge of instantaneous Hamiltonians, and only additional local driving is involved. To benchmark the performance of LCD and the proposed local control-enhanced LCD technique, we experimentally implement digitized adiabatic quantum evolution in a trapped-ion system. We characterize the quality of the prepared states and explore the scaling behavior with system size up to 14 qubits. Our demonstration of quantum shortcut to adiabaticity opens a path towards preparing ground states of complex systems with accessible local controls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete time crystalline (DTC) phases have attracted significant theoretical and experimental attention in the last few years. Such systems require a seemingly impossible combination of non-adiabatic driving and a finite-entropy long-time state, which is, however, possible in non-ergodic systems. Previous works have often relied on disorder for the required non-ergodicity; here, we describe the construction of a discrete time crystal (DTC) phase in non-disordered, non-integrable Ising-type systems. After discussing the conditions for interacting and periodically driven systems to display such phases in general, we propose a concrete model and then provide approximate analytical arguments and direct numerical evidence that it satisfies the conditions and displays a DTC phase robust to local periodic perturbations.</description>

Abstract: We study thermodynamic phase transitions between integrable and chaotic dynamics. We do so by analyzing models that interpolate between the chaotic double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) and the integrable $p$-spin systems, in a limit where they are described by chord diagrams. We develop a path integral formalism by coarse graining over the diagrams, which we use to argue that the system has two distinct phases: one is continuously connected to the chaotic system, and the other to the integrable. They are separated by a line of first order transition that ends at a critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the dependence of the critical properties of the Anderson model on the dimension $d$ in the language of $\beta$-function and renormalization group recently introduced in Ref.[arXiv:2306.14965] in the context of Anderson transition on random regular graphs. We show how in the delocalized region, including the transition point, the one-parameter scaling part of the $\beta$-function for the fractal dimension $D_{1}$ evolves smoothly from its $d=2$ form, in which $\beta_2\leq 0$, to its $\beta_\infty\geq 0$ form, which is represented by the regular random graph (RRG) result. We show how the $\epsilon=d-2$ expansion and the $1/d$ expansion around the RRG result can be reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory governed by the irrelevant exponent $y$ depends on dimensionality. We also show how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion in the nonlinear sigma-model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound for the fractal dimension. The framework introduced here may serve as a basis for investigations of disordered many-body systems and of more general non-equilibrium quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the scaling behavior of Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes in the ordered phase of the Vicsek model, introducing a phenomenological equation of motion (EOM) incorporating a previously overlooked non-linear term. This term arises from the interaction between velocity fields and density fluctuations, leading to new scaling behaviors. We derive exact scaling exponents in two dimensions, which reproduce the isotropic scaling behavior reported in a prior numerical simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static or frozen disorder, characterised by spatial heterogeneities, influences diverse complex systems, encompassing many-body systems, equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter, intricate network topologies, biological systems, and wave-matter interactions. While static disorder has been thoroughly examined, delving into evolving disorder brings increased intricacy to the issue. An example of this complexity is the observation of stochastic acceleration of electromagnetic waves in evolving media, where noisy fluctuations in the propagation medium transfer effective momentum to the wave. Here, we investigate elastic wave propagation in a one-dimensional heterogeneous medium with diagonal disorder. We examine two types of complex elastic materials: one with static disorder, where mass density randomly varies in space, and the other with evolving disorder, featuring random variations in both space and time. Our results indicate that evolving disorder enhances the propagation speed of Gaussian pulses compared to static disorder. Additionally, we demonstrate that the acceleration effect also occurs when the medium evolves chaotically rather than randomly over time. The latter establishes that evolving randomness is not a unique prerequisite for observing wavefront acceleration, introducing the concept of chaotic acceleration in complex media.</description>

Abstract: In this work we introduce a method for calculating holographic duals of BCFTs with more than two boundaries. We apply it to calculating the dynamics of entanglement entropy in a 1+1d CFT that is instantaneously split into multiple segments and calculate the entanglement entropy as a function of time for the case of two splits, showing that our approach reproduces earlier results for the double split case. Our manuscript lays the groundwork for future calculations of the entanglement entropy for more than two splits and systems at nonzero temperature.</description>

Abstract: Cavity optomechanical systems are a paradigmatic setting for the conversion of electromagnetic energy into mechanical work. Experiments with atoms coupled to cavity modes are realized in nonequilibrium conditions, described by phenomenological models encoding non-thermal dissipative dynamics and falling outside the framework of weak system-bath couplings. This fact makes their interpretation as quantum engines, e.g., the derivation of a well-defined efficiency, quite challenging. Here, we present a consistent thermodynamic description of open quantum cavity-atom systems. Our approach takes advantage of their nonequilibrium nature and arrives at an energetic balance which is fully interpretable in terms of persistent dissipated heat currents. The interaction between atoms and cavity modes can further give rise to nonequilibrium phase transitions and emergent behavior and allows to assess the impact of collective many-body phenomena on the engine operation. To enable this, we define two thermodynamic limits related to a weak and to a strong optomechanical coupling, respectively. We illustrate our ideas focussing on a time-crystal engine and discuss power generation, energy-conversion efficiency, and emergence of metastable behavior in both limits.</description>

Abstract: As a toy model of chiral interactions in crowded spaces, we consider sphinx tilings in finite regions of the triangular lattice. The sphinx tiles, hexiamonds composed of six equilateral triangles in the shape of a stylized sphinx, come in left and right enantiomorphs. Regions scaled up from the unit sphinx by an integer factor ("Sphinx frames") require tiles of both chiral forms to produce tilings, including crystalline, quasicrystalline, and fully disordered tilings. For frames up to order 13, we describe methods that permit exact enumeration and computation of partition functions using "accelerated backtracking," "seam," and "dangler" algorithms. For larger frames, we introduce a Monte Carlo (MC) method to sample typical tilings. Key to the latter is the identification of fundamental shapes (polyads) that admit multiple tilings and which allow a rejection-free MC simulation.</description>

Abstract: Topology plays a fundamental role in our understanding of many-body physics, from vortices and solitons in classical field theory, to phases and excitations in quantum matter. Topological phenomena are intimately connected to the distribution of information content - that, differently from ordinary matter, is now governed by non-local degrees of freedom. However, a precise characterization of how topological effects govern the complexity of a many-body state - i.e., its partition function - is presently unclear. In this work, we show how topology and complexity are directly intertwined concepts in the context of classical statistical mechanics. In concrete, we present a theory that shows how the Kolmogorov complexity of a classical partition function sampling carries unique, distinctive features depending on the presence of topological excitations in the system. We confront two-dimensional Ising, Heisenberg, and XY models on several topologies and study the corresponding samplings as high-dimensional manifolds in configuration space, quantifying their complexity via the intrinsic dimension. While for the Ising and Heisenberg models the intrinsic dimension is independent of the real-space topology, for the XY model it depends crucially on temperature: across the Berezkinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, complexity becomes topology dependent. In the BKT phase, it displays a characteristic dependence on the homology of the real-space manifold, and, for $g$-torii, it follows a scaling that is solely genus dependent. We argue that this behavior is intimately connected to the emergence of an order parameter in data space, the conditional connectivity, that displays scaling behavior.</description>

Abstract: Central spin systems, in which a {\it central} spin is singled out and interacts nonlocally with several {\it bath} spins, are paradigmatic models for nitrogen-vacancy centers and quantum dots. They show complex emergent dynamics and stationary phenomena which, despite the collective nature of their interaction, are still largely not understood. Here, we derive exact results on the emergent behavior of open quantum central spin systems. The latter crucially depends on the scaling of the interaction strength with the bath size. For scalings with the inverse square root of the bath size (typical of one-to-many interactions), the system behaves, in the thermodynamic limit, as an open quantum Jaynes-Cummings model, whose bosonic mode encodes the quantum fluctuations of the bath spins. In this case, non-Gaussian correlations are dynamically generated and persist at stationarity. For scalings with the inverse bath size, the emergent dynamics is instead of mean-field type. Our work provides a fundamental understanding of the different dynamical regimes of central spin systems and a simple theory for efficiently exploring their nonequilibrium behavior. Our findings may become relevant for developing fully quantum descriptions of many-body solid-state devices and their applications.</description>

Abstract: Balanced neural networks -- in which excitatory and inhibitory inputs compensate each other on average -- give rise to a dynamical phase dominated by fluctuations called asynchronous state, crucial for brain functioning. However, structural disorder -- which is inherent to random networks -- can hinder such an excitation-inhibition balance. Indeed, structural and synaptic heterogeneities can generate extended regions in phase space akin to critical points, called Griffiths phases, with dynamical features very different from those of asynchronous states. Here, we study a simple neural-network model with tunable levels of heterogeneity able to display these two types of dynamical regimes -- i.e., asynchronous states and Griffiths phases -- putting them together within a single phase diagram. Using this simple model, we are able to emphasize the crucial role played by synaptic plasticity and homeostasis to re-establish balance in intrinsically heterogeneous networks. Overall, we shed light onto how diverse dynamical regimes, each with different functional advantages, can emerge from a given network as a result of self-organizing homeostatic mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: The weak correlation between spatiotemporal fluctuations in nonequilibrium complex systems is shown to govern the fluctuation distribution, maximizing the conditional entropy associated with such fluctuations. The result is illustrated in diffusion phenomena observed in living cells. A generic feature of the weak correlation is briefly mentioned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that domain walls formed in a classical Ginzburg-Landau model can exhibit topologically stable but thermodynamically metastable states. This proposal relies on Allen-Cahn's assertion that the velocity of domain wall is proportional to the mean curvature at each point. From this assertion we speculate that domain wall behaves like a rubber band that can winds the background geometry in a nontrivial way and can exist permanently. We numerically verify our proposal in two and three spatial dimensions by using various boundary conditions. It is found that there are possibilities to form topologically stable domain walls in the final equilibrium states. However, these states have higher free energies, thus are thermodynamically metastable. These metastable states that are protected by topology could potentially serve as storage media in the computer and information technology industry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated by molecular dynamics method the influence of a finite number of particles used in computer simulations on fluctuations of thermodynamic properties. As a case study, we used the two-dimensional Lennard-Jones system. 2D Lennard-Jones system, besides being an archetypal one, is a subject of long debate, as to whether it has continuous (infinite-order) or discontinuous (first-order) melting transition. We have found that anomalies on the equation of state (the van-der-Waals or Myer-Wood loops) previously considered a hallmark of the first order phase transition, are at best at the level of noise, since they have the same magnitude as the amplitude of pressure fluctuations. So, they could be regarded as statistically unsignificant effect. Also, we estimated inherent statistical noise, present in computer simulations, and came to conclusion, that it is larger, than predicted by statistical physics, and the difference between them (called algorithmic fluctuations) is possibly due to the computer-related issues. It was demonstrated that these fluctuations in principle could be observed in real-life physical experiments which would lead to practical resolution of The Matrix hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Phase space maximal entropy random walk: Langevin-like ensembles of physical trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As written by statistician George Box "All models are wrong, but some are useful", standard diffusion derivation or Feynman path ensembles use nonphysical infinite velocity/kinetic energy nowhere differentiable trajectories - what seems wrong, might be only our approximation to simplify mathematics. This article introduces some basic tools to investigate this issue. To consider ensembles of more physical finite velocity trajectories, we can work in $(x,v)$ phase space like in Langevin equation with velocity controlling spatial steps, here also controlled with spatial potential $V(x)$. There are derived and compared 4 approaches to predict stationary probability distributions: using Boltzmann ensemble of steps/points in space (GRW - generic random walk) or in phase space (psGRW), and analogously Boltzmann ensemble of paths in space (MERW - maximal entropy random walk) and in phase space (psMERW), also generalized to L{\'e}vy flights. Path ensembles generally have much stronger Anderson-like localization, MERW has stationary distribution exactly as quantum ground state. Proposed novel MERW in phase space has some slight differences, which might be distinguished experimentally. For example for 1D infinite potential well: $\rho=1$ stationary distribution for step ensemble, $\rho\sim \sin^2$ for path ensemble (as in QM), and $\rho\sim \sin$ for proposed smooth path ensembles - more frequently approaching the barriers due to randomly gained velocity.</description>

Abstract: Smith et al discovered an aperiodic monotile of 13-sided shape in 2023. It is called the `Smith hat' and consists of 8 kites. We deal with the statistical physics of the lattice of the kites, which we call the `Smith-kite lattice'. We studied the Ising model on the aperiodic Smith-kite lattice and the dual Smith-kite lattice using Monte Carlo simulations. We combined the Swendsen-Wang multi-cluster algorithm and the replica exchange method. We simulated systems up to the total spin number $939201$. Using the finite-size scaling analysis, we estimated the critical temperature on the Smith-kite lattice as $T_c/J=2.405 \pm 0.0005$ and that of the dual Smith-kite lattice as $T^{*}_{c}/J=2.143 \pm 0.0005$. Moreover, we confirmed the duality relation between the critical temperatures on the dual pair of aperiodic lattices, $\sinh(2J/T_c) \sinh(2J/T^{*}_{c}) = 1.000 \pm 0.001$. We also checked the duality relation for the nearest-neighbor correlation at the critical temperature, essentially the energy, $\epsilon(T_c)/\coth(2J/T_c) + \epsilon(T^{*}_c)/\coth(2J/T^{*}_c) = 1.000 \pm 0.001$.</description>

Abstract: This study addresses a longstanding question regarding the mathematical proof of chaotic behavior in kinetic differential equations. Following the numerous numerical and experimental results in the past 50 years, we introduce two formal chemical reactions that rigorously demonstrate this behavior. Our approach involves transforming chaotic equations into kinetic differential equations and subsequently realizing these equations through formal chemical reactions. The findings present a novel perspective on chaotic dynamics within chemical kinetics, thereby resolving a longstanding open problem.</description>

      <title>Universal features of entanglement entropy in the honeycomb Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy is a unique probe to reveal universal features of strongly interacting many-body systems. In two or more dimensions these features are subtle, and detecting them numerically requires extreme precision, a notoriously difficult task. This is especially challenging in models of interacting fermions, where many such universal features have yet to be observed. In this paper we tackle this challenge by introducing a new method to compute the R\'enyi entanglement entropy in auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations, where we treat the entangling region itself as a stochastic variable. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method by extracting, for the first time, universal subleading logarithmic terms in a two dimensional model of interacting fermions, focusing on the half-filled honeycomb Hubbard model at $T=0$. We detect the universal corner contribution due to gapless fermions throughout the Dirac semi-metal phase and at the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa critical point, where the latter shows a pronounced enhancement depending on the type of entangling cut. Finally, we observe the universal Goldstone mode contribution in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulating phase.</description>

Abstract: We investigate scenarios in which the low-temperature phase of short-range spin glasses comprises thermodynamic states which are nontrivial mixtures of multiple incongruent pure state pairs. We construct a new kind of metastate supported on Gibbs states whose edge overlap values with a reference state fall within a specified range. Using this metastate we show that, in any dimension, the variance of free energy difference fluctuations between pure states within a single mixed Gibbs state with multiple edge overlap values diverges linearly with the volume. We discuss some implications of these results.</description>

      <title>Floquet systems with continuous dynamical symmetries: characterization, time-dependent Noether charge, and integrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum Floquet (periodically-driven) systems having continuous dynamical symmetry (CDS) consisting of a time translation and a unitary transformation on the Hilbert space. Unlike the discrete ones, the CDS strongly constrains the possible Hamiltonians $H(t)$ and allows us to obtain all the Floquet states by solving a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Besides, Noether's theorem leads to a time-dependent conservation charge, whose expectation value is time-independent throughout evolution. We exemplify these consequences of CDS in the seminal Rabi model, an effective model of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds without strain terms, and Heisenberg spin models in rotating fields. Our results provide a systematic way of solving for Floquet states and explain how they avoid hybridization in quasienergy diagrams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of \emph{complexity} has become pivotal in multiple disciplines, including quantum information, where it serves as an alternative metric for gauging the chaotic evolution of a quantum state. This paper focuses on \emph{Krylov complexity}, a specialized form of quantum complexity that offers an unambiguous and intrinsically meaningful assessment of the spread of a quantum state over all possible orthogonal bases. Our study is situated in the context of Gaussian quantum states, which are fundamental to both Bosonic and Fermionic systems and can be fully described by a covariance matrix. We show that while the covariance matrix is essential, it is insufficient alone for calculating Krylov complexity due to its lack of relative phase information. Our findings suggest that the relative covariance matrix can provide an upper bound for Krylov complexity for Gaussian quantum states. We also explore the implications of Krylov complexity for theories proposing complexity as a candidate for holographic duality by computing Krylov complexity for the thermofield double States (TFD) and Dirac field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking is a fundamental concept in understanding quantum phases of matter, studied so far mostly through the lens of local order parameters. Recently, a new entanglement-based probe of symmetry breaking has been introduced under the name of \textit{entanglement asymmetry}, which has been employed to investigate the mechanism of dynamical symmetry restoration. Here, we provide a universal formula for the entanglement asymmetry of matrix product states with finite bond dimension, valid in the large volume limit. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of any compact -- discrete or continuous -- group depends only on the symmetry breaking pattern, and is not related to any other microscopic features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend an operator formalism, developed by Hongler, Kyt\"ol\"a, and Zahabi in 2012 for the Ising model, to the Ashkin-Teller and loop $\mathrm{O} ( n ) $ models. The formalism is primarily dependent upon notions of massive, and massless, s-holomorphicity of the Ising model, which are respectively satisfied at, and below, the critical temperature, hence allowing for rigorous analyses of the transfer matrix, correlation functions, and lattice fermion operators. From results of another paper, by Tanhayi-Ahari and Rouhani in 2012, which demonstrates that parafermionic observables for the staggered eight-vertex model coincide with those of the Ashkin-Teller model, as well as a 2003 paper, by Wu and Kunz, which establishes a correspondence between the staggered eight-vertex and odd eight-vertex models, we establish further associations.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

      <title>Criteria for Davies Irreducibility of Markovian Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems are described by Lindblad master equations, generating a quantum dynamical semigroup. An important concept for such systems is (Davies) irreducibility, i.e., the question whether there exist non-trivial invariant subspaces. Steady states of irreducible systems are unique and faithful, i.e., they have full rank. In the 1970s, Frigerio showed that a system is irreducible if the Lindblad operators span a self-adjoint set with trivial commutant. We discuss a more general and powerful algebraic criterion, showing that a system is irreducible if and only if the multiplicative algebra generated by the Lindblad operators $L_a$ and the operator $K=iH+\sum_a L^\dagger_aL_a$, involving the Hamiltonian $H$, is the entire operator space. Examples for two-level systems, show that a change of Hamiltonian terms as well as the addition or removal of dissipators can render a reducible system irreducible and vice versa. Examples for many-body systems show that a large class of spin chains can be rendered irreducible by dissipators on just one or two sites. Additionally, we discuss the decisive differences between (Davies) reducibility and Evans reducibility for quantum channels and dynamical semigroups which has lead to some confusion in the recent physics literature, especially, in the context of boundary-driven systems. We give a criterion for quantum reducibility in terms of associated classical Markov processes and, lastly, discuss the relation of the main result to the stabilization of pure states and argue that systems with local Lindblad operators cannot stabilize pure Fermi-sea states.</description>

Abstract: The possibility of efficiently converting heat into work at the microscale has triggered an intense research effort to understand quantum heat engines, driven by the hope of quantum superiority over classical counterparts. In this work, we introduce a model featuring an atom-doped optical quantum cavity propelling a classical piston through radiation pressure. The model, based on the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian of quantum electrodynamics, demonstrates the generation of mechanical work through thermal energy injection. We establish the equivalence of the piston expansion work with Alicki's work definition, analytically for quasistatic transformations and numerically for finite time protocols. We further employ the model to construct quantum Otto and Carnot engines, comparing their performance in terms of energetics, work output, efficiency, and power under various conditions. This model thus provides a platform to extract useful work from an open quantum system to generate net motion, and sheds light on the quantum concepts of work and heat.</description>

      <title>Ground-State Phase Diagram of (1/2,1/2,1) Mixed Diamond Chains</title>

Abstract: The ground-state phases of mixed diamond chains with ($S, \tau^{(1)}, \tau^{(2)})=(1/2,1/2,1)$, where $S$ is the magnitude of vertex spins, and $\tau^{(1)}$ and $\tau^{(2)}$ are those of apical spins, are investigated. The two apical spins in each unit cell are coupled by an exchange coupling $\lambda$. The vertex spins are coupled with the top and bottom apical spins by exchange couplings $1+\delta$ and $1-\delta$, respectively. Although this model has an infinite number of local conservation laws for $\delta=0$, they are lost for finite $\delta$. The ground-state phase diagram is determined using the numerical exact diagonalization and DMRG method in addition to the analytical approximations in various limiting cases. The phase diagram consists of a nonmagnetic phase and several kinds of ferrimagnetic phases. We find two different ferrimagnetic phases without spontaneous translational symmetry breakdown. It is also found that the quantized ferrimagnetic phases with large spatial periodicities present for $\delta=0$ are easily destroyed by small $\delta$ and replaced by a partial ferrimagnetic phase. The nonmagnetic phase is considered to be a gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase based on the recently extended Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem to the site-reflection invariant spin chains and numerical diagonalization results.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue and pseudospectrum processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent study of the non-Hermitian matrix-valued Brownian motion, we propose two kinds of dynamical processes of $n \times n$ matrices generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices. As a perturbation $\delta J$ is added at time $m \leq n$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-one matrix. First we report the complicated motions of the ``eigenvalues'' which are numerically calculated. Then we derive the equations which determine the exact-eigenvalue processes. Comparison between the numerical results and the solutions of the equations, coexistence of exact eigenvalues and pseudospectra in the numerical results is clarified. The Catalan numbers play an important role to describe the specified exact eigenvalues. We tried to characterize the numerical results using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without perturbation. Then we report a new phenomenon in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve composed of several closed simple curves osculating each other is reduced in size and embedded as a complicated structure in the pseudospectrum. The asymptotics of the processes in the infinite-matrix limit $n \to \infty$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Universal contributions to charge fluctuations in spin chains at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At finite temperature, conserved charges undergo thermal fluctuations in a quantum many-body system in the grand canonical ensemble. The full structure of the fluctuations of the total U(1) charge $Q$ can be succinctly captured by the generating function $G(\theta)=\left\langle e^{i \theta Q}\right\rangle$. For a 1D translation-invariant spin chain, in the thermodynamic limit the magnitude $|G(\theta)|$ scales with the system size $L$ as $\ln |G(\theta)|=-\alpha(\theta)L+\gamma(\theta)$, where $\gamma(\theta)$ is the scale-invariant contribution and may encode universal information about the underlying system. In this work we investigate the behavior and physical meaning of $\gamma(\theta)$ when the system is periodic. We find that $\gamma(\theta)$ only takes non-zero values at isolated points of $\theta$, which is $\theta=\pi$ for all our examples. In two exemplary lattice systems we show that $\gamma(\pi)$ takes quantized values when the U(1) symmetry exhibits a specific type of 't Hooft anomaly with other symmetries. In other cases, we investigate how $\gamma(\theta)$ depends on microscopic conditions (such as the filling factor) in field theory and exactly solvable lattice models.</description>

      <title>Tensor network simulations for non-orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the geometric construction of the Klein bottle and the real projective plane ($\mathrm{RP}^2$) within the framework of tensor networks, focusing on the implementation of crosscap and rainbow boundaries. Previous investigations have applied boundary matrix product state (BMPS) techniques to study these boundaries. We introduce a novel approach that incorporates such boundaries into the tensor renormalization group (TRG) methodology, facilitated by an efficient representation of a spatial reflection operator. This advancement enables us to compute the crosscap and rainbow free energy terms and the one-point function on $\mathrm{RP}^2$ with enhanced efficiency and for larger system sizes. Additionally, our method is capable of calculating the partition function under isotropic conditions of space and imaginary time. The versatility of this approach is further underscored by its applicability to constructing other (non-)orientable surfaces of higher genus.</description>

      <title>Boundary-induced transitions in M\"obius quenches of holographic BCFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundary effects play an interesting role in finite-size physical systems. In this work, we study the boundary-induced properties of 1+1-dimensional critical systems driven by inhomogeneous M\"obius-like quenches. We focus on the entanglement entropy in BCFTs with a large central charge and a sparse spectrum of low-dimensional operators. We find that the choice of boundary conditions leads to different scenarios of dynamical phase transitions. We also derive these results in a holographic description in terms of intersecting branes in AdS$_3$, and find a precise match.</description>

      <title>On some features of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO or UBQP) is concerned with maximizing/minimizing the quadratic form $H(J, \eta) = W \sum_{i,j} J_{i,j} \eta_{i} \eta_{j}$ with $J$ a matrix of coefficients, $\eta \in \{0, 1\}^N$ and $W$ a normalizing constant. In the statistical mechanics literature, QUBO is a lattice gas counterpart to the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick spin glass model. Finding the optima of $H$ is an NP-hard problem. Several problems in combinatorial optimization and data analysis can be mapped to QUBO in a straightforward manner. In the combinatorial optimization literature, random instances of QUBO are often used to test the effectiveness of heuristic algorithms. Here we consider QUBO with random coefficients and show that if the $J_{i,j}$'s have zero mean, then, after proper normalization, the minimum and maximum \emph{per particle} of $H$ do not depend on the details of the distribution of the couplings and are concentrated around their expected values. Further, with the help of numerical simulations, we give estimates of the minimum and maximum of the objective function and provide some insight into the structure of the minimizer and the maximizer of $H$. We argue that also this structure is rather robust. Our findings hold in the diluted case where each of the $J_{i,j}$'s is allowed to be zero with probability going to $1$ as $N \to \infty$ in a suitable way.</description>

      <title>Broken detailed balance and entropy production in directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of a complex network plays a crucial role in determining its dynamical properties. In this work, we show that the directed, hierarchical organisation of a network causes the system to break detailed balance and dictates the production of entropy through non-equilibrium dynamics. We consider a wide range of dynamical processes and show how different directed network features govern their thermodynamics. Next, we analyse a collection of 97 empirical networks and show that strong directedness and non-equilibrium dynamics are both ubiquitous in real-world systems. Finally, we present a simple method for inferring broken detailed balance and directed network structure from multivariate time-series and apply our method to identify non-equilibrium and hierarchical organisation in both human neuroimaging and financial time-series. Overall, our results shed light on the thermodynamic consequences of directed network structure and indicate the importance and ubiquity of hierarchical organisation and non-equilibrium dynamics in real-world systems.</description>
