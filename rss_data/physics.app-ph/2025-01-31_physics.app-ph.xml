      <title>Thermal performance estimation for cryogenic storage tanks: Application to liquid hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of cryogenic liquid storage solutions requires accurate methods for estimating heat ingress, from the material level to the tank level. For insulation materials, thermal performance is usually measured using ambient conditions and liquid nitrogen at 77 K as boundary temperatures. A key question is how much heat ingress increases when storing liquid hydrogen LH$_2$ at 20 K. We derive theoretical bounds on the increased heat ingress, and show that it remains below 26%. Additionally, we demonstrate that heat ingress is much more sensitive to the warm boundary temperature than the cold boundary temperature. At the tank level, we compare two methods for assessing the steady-state thermal performance of cryogenic tanks: thermal network models and the heat equation solved with the finite element method. The latter offers high accuracy and adaptability for complex geometries, while thermal network models benefit from simplicity, speed and robustness. We apply both approaches to a self-supported LH$_2$ tank concept for maritime transport and analyze sensitivity to structural support thickness, warm boundary temperature, and choice of insulation material. The thermal network model can estimate heat ingress with $\sim$1% error and the cold-spot temperature with error less than 1 K.</description>

      <title>Polarisation conversion and optical meron topologies in anisotropic epsilon-near-zero metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic metamaterials provide a flexible platform for light manipulation and polarisation management, thanks to their engineered optical properties with exotic dispersion regimes. Here, we exploit the enhanced spin-orbit coupling induced by the strong anisotropy of plasmonic nanorod metamaterials to control the polarisation of vector vortex beams and generate complex field structures with meron topology. Modifying the degree of ellipticity of the input polarisation, we show how the observed meron topology can be additionally manipulated. Flexible control of the state of polarisation of vortex beams is important in optical manipulation, communications, metrology and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>A Linear Quantum Coupler for Clean Bosonic Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing with superconducting circuits relies on high-fidelity driven nonlinear processes. An ideal quantum nonlinearity would selectively activate desired coherent processes at high strength, without activating parasitic mixing products or introducing additional decoherence. The wide bandwidth of the Josephson nonlinearity makes this difficult, with undesired drive-induced transitions and decoherence limiting qubit readout, gates, couplers and amplifiers. Significant strides have been recently made into building better `quantum mixers', with promise being shown by Kerr-free three-wave mixers that suppress driven frequency shifts, and balanced quantum mixers that explicitly forbid a significant fraction of parasitic processes. We propose a novel mixer that combines both these strengths, with engineered selection rules that make it essentially linear (not just Kerr-free) when idle, and activate clean parametric processes even when driven at high strength. Further, its ideal Hamiltonian is simple to analyze analytically, and we show that this ideal behavior is first-order insensitive to dominant experimental imperfections. We expect this mixer to allow significant advances in high-Q control, readout, and amplification.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Inverse Design of Electromagnetic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Precomputed Numerical Green Function (PNGF) method, a new approach for rapid inverse design of electromagnetic devices. The static components of the design are incorporated into a numerical Green function obtained from a single fully parallelized precomputation step, reducing the cost of evaluating candidate designs during optimization to only being proportional to the size of the region under modification. When used with the direct binary search optimization algorithm, a low-rank update technique is leveraged to further decrease the iteration time to seconds without approximations or compromises in accuracy. The total runtime for an inverse design is reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to using conventional Maxwell solvers due to the linear time complexity of the method, attaining speedups of up to 700x for the design examples considered and lowering the process from multiple days to weeks down to less than an hour. The performance and flexibility of the approach are highlighted with design studies, including experimental results, on an ultrawideband 30GHz substrate antenna with 50% fractional bandwidth, a 6GHz switched beam antenna steerable between angles 90{\deg} apart, and a broadband, ultra-short-length microstrip to substrate-integrated waveguide transition. The approach stands to reshape inverse design in electromagnetics.</description>

      <title>A Phase Diagram for Crystallization of a Complex Macromolecular Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystallization of biological molecules has high potential to solve some challenges in drug manufacturing. Thus, understanding the process is critical to efficiently adapting crystallization to biopharmaceutical manufacturing. This article describes phase behavior for the solution crystallization of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) capsids of serotypes 5, 8, and 9 as model biological macromolecular assemblies. Hanging-drop vapor diffusion experiments are used to determine the combined effects of pH and polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sodium chloride concentrations in which full and empty capsids nucleate and grow. Full and empty capsids show different crystallization behavior although they possess similar capsid structure and similar outer morphology with icosahedral symmetry and 2-fold, 3-fold, and 5-fold symmetry. The differential charge environment surrounding full and empty capsids is found to influence capsid crystallization. The crystal growth rate is found to be affected by the mass of the macromolecular assembly rather than the structure/shape of the macromolecular assembly. The regions of precipitant concentrations and pH in which crystallization occurs are found to be different for different rAAV serotypes and for full and empty capsids for each serotype. Depending on the precipitant concentrations and the rAAV serotype, a variety of complex crystal morphologies are formed and a variety of non-crystallization outcomes such as unidentified dense solid-phase/opaque crystals and an oil/dense phase is observed. The well-defined dense phase/oil is found to be converted into a solid phase over a long period of time. Trends in the crystallization of full and empty capsids between serotypes is observed to be altered by the extent of post-translational modifications (PTMS) associated with the massive macromolecular proteinaceous assembly.</description>

      <title>Local bifurcation analysis of circular von-K\'arm\'an plate with Kirchhoff rod boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry based reduction is applied to the buckling of a circular von-Karman plate with Kirchhoff rod boundary, where a mismatch between the edge length and the perimeter of plate is treated as the bifurcation parameter. A nonlinear operator formulation describes the equilibrium of the elastic rod plate system. The critical points, as potential bifurcation points, are stated using the linearized operator. The symmetry of null space for each critical point is identified as a subgroup of the complete symmetry group of nonlinear problem, the equivariance associated with the nonlinear operator is used in this process. Sufficient evidence is provided for each critical point to be a bifurcation point for the symmetry reduced problem and post buckling analysis is carried out using Lyapunov Schmidt reduction. Bifurcation curves are obtained till quadratic order in bifurcation parameter away from each critical value. Theoretical results for bifurcation curves are validated against the numerical simulation based on a symmetry reduced finite element method for some illustrative examples of critical points. A numerical study is carried out for the dependence of the coefficient of quadratic term in the bifurcation parameter when structural parameters are varied in a neighborhood of four fixed sets of structural parameters. Numerical results based on a symmetry reduced finite element analysis confirm that the nonlinear solution agrees with the local theoretical behavior close to a critical point but deviates further away from it. Using these tools, two main conclusions are reached. First it is observed that the critical points of the linearized problem are indeed bifurcation points. Second, an alteration in the nature of bifurcation is observed during the parameter sweep study when the plate is in tension.</description>

      <title>Scalable intensity-based photonic matrix-vector multiplication processor using single-wavelength time-division-multiplexed signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits provide a compact platform for ultrafast and energy-efficient matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in the optical domain. Recently, schemes based on time-division multiplexing (TDM) have been proposed as scalable approaches for realizing large-scale photonic MVM processors. However, existing demonstrations rely on coherent detection or multiple wavelengths, both of which complicate their operations. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable TDM-based photonic MVM processor that uses only single-wavelength intensity-modulated optical signals, thereby avoiding coherent detection and enabling simplified operations. A 32-channel processor is fabricated on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform and used to experimentally perform convolution operations in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.47% for 1500 images.</description>

      <title>Enhanced fidelity in nonlinear structured light by virtual light-based apertures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tailoring the degrees of freedom (DoF) of light for a desired purpose, so-called structured light, has delivered numerous advances over the past decade, ranging from communications and quantum cryptography to optical trapping, and microscopy. The shaping toolkit has traditionally been linear in nature, only recently extended to the nonlinear regime, where input beams overlap in a nonlinear crystal to generate a structured output beam. Here we show how to enhance the fidelity of the structured output by aligning light with light. Using orbital angular momentum modes and difference frequency generation as an example, we demonstrate precise control of the spatial overlap in both the transverse and longitudinal directions using the structure of one mode as a virtual structured (in amplitude and phase) light-based aperture for the other. Our technique can easily be translated to other structured light fields as well as alternative nonlinear processes such as second harmonic generation and sum frequency generation, enabling advancements in communication, imaging, and spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Ultra-large mutually synchronized networks of 10 nm spin Hall nano-oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While mutually interacting spin Hall nano-oscillators (SHNOs) hold great promise for wireless communication, neural networks, neuromorphic computing, and Ising machines, the highest number of synchronized SHNOs remains limited to $N$ = 64. Using ultra-narrow 10 and 20-nm nano-constrictions in W-Ta/CoFeB/MgO trilayers, we demonstrate mutually synchronized SHNO networks of up to $N$ = 105,000. The microwave power and quality factor scale as $N$ with new record values of 9 nW and $1.04 \times 10^6$, respectively. An unexpectedly strong array size dependence of the frequency-current tunability is explained by magnon exchange between nano-constrictions and magnon losses at the array edges, further corroborated by micromagnetic simulations and Brillouin light scattering microscopy. Our results represent a significant step towards viable SHNO network applications in wireless communication and unconventional computing.</description>

      <title>Infrared Metaplasmonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic response in metals, defined as the ability to support subwavelength confinement of surface plasmon modes, is typically limited to a narrow frequency range below the metals' plasma frequency. This places severe limitations on the operational wavelengths of plasmonic materials and devices. However, when the volume of a metal film is massively decreased, highly confined quasi-two-dimensional surface plasmon modes can be supported out to wavelengths well beyond the plasma wavelength. While this has, thus far, been achieved using ultra-thin (nm-scale) metals, such films are quite difficult to realize, and suffer from even higher losses than bulk plasmonic films. To extend the plasmonic response to the infrared, here we introduce the concept of metaplasmonics, representing a novel plasmonic modality with a host of appealing properties. By fabricating and characterizing a series of metaplasmonic nanoribbons, we demonstrate large confinement, high quality factors, and large near-field enhancements across a broad wavelength range, extending well beyond the limited bandwidth of traditional plasmonic materials. We demonstrate $35\times$ plasmon wavelength reduction, and our numerical simulations suggest that further wavelength reduction, up to a factor of 150, is achievable using our approach. The demonstration of the metaplasmonics paradigm offers a promising path to fill the near- and mid-infrared technological gap for high quality plasmonic materials, and provides a new material system to study the effects of extreme plasmonic confinement for applications in nonlinear and quantum plasmonics.</description>

      <title>Tightly-confined and long Z-cut lithium niobate waveguide with ultralow-loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) is a promising material for future complex photonic-electronic circuits, with wide applications in fields like data communications, sensing, optical computation, and quantum optics. There was a great step toward LN photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with the development of dry etching for low-loss LN on insulator (LNOI) waveguides. However, the versatility of the LN waveguide platform for applications like $\chi^3$ nonlinear devices and passive phase sensitive components, has not been fully utilized. The main challenges are the difficulty of making highly confined ultralow-loss waveguides and overcoming the strong material birefringence. Here, we developed a fabrication technology for an ultralow-loss, tightly-confined, dispersion-engineered LN waveguide. We demonstrated an ultra-low propagation loss of 5.8 dB/m in a decimeter-long LN spiral waveguide. We focused on Z-cut LN waveguides with TE mode to avoid the material birefringence. Aiming for $\chi^3$ nonlinear applications, we demonstrated the first all normal-dispersion (ANDi) based coherent octave-spanning supercontinuum frequency comb in integrated LN waveguide. Our ultralow-loss Z-cut LN long waveguide might be useful in on-chip narrow linewidth lasers, optical delay lines, and parametric amplifiers.</description>

Abstract: We describe the short-term frequency stability characterization of external-cavity diode lasers stabilized onto the 6S$_{1/2}$-7P$_{1/2}$ transition of Cs atom at 459 nm, using a microfabricated vapor cell. The laser beatnote between two nearly-identical systems, each using saturated absorption spectroscopy in a simple retroreflected configuration, exhibits an instability of $2.5\times10^{-13}$ at 1 s, consistent with phase noise analysis, and $3\times 10^{-14}$ at 200 s. The primary contributors to the stability budget at one second are the FM-AM noise conversion and the intermodulation effect, both emerging from laser frequency noise. These results highlight the potential of microcell-based optical references to achieve stability performances comparable to that of an active hydrogen maser in a remarkably simple architecture.</description>

      <title>Absorption loss and Kerr nonlinearity in barium titanate waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because of its exceptionally large Pockels coefficient, barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$) is a promising material for various photonic applications at both room and cryogenic temperatures, including electro-optic modulation, frequency comb generation, and microwave-optical transduction. These applications rely on devices with low optical loss to achieve high efficiency. Material absorption sets a lower limit to optical loss and is thus a crucial property to determine, particularly for integrated photonic devices. Using cavity-enhanced photothermal spectroscopy, we measure the absorption loss of BaTiO$_3$ ridge waveguides at wavelengths near 1550~nm to be $\alpha_{\mathrm{abs}} = 10.9$~{\raisebox{0.5ex}{\tiny$^{+5.8}_{-0.4}$}} dB~m$^{-1}$, well below the propagation losses due to other sources, such as scattering. We simultaneously determine that BaTiO$_3$ has a large Kerr nonlinear refractive index of $n_{\mathrm{2,BaTiO_3}}$ = 1.8 {\raisebox{0.5ex}{\tiny$^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$}} $\times$ 10$^{-18}$ m$^2$ W$^{-1}$. Considering these results, photonic integrated circuits utilizing BaTiO$_3$ have the potential to achieve significantly higher efficiency than demonstrated to date and are especially interesting for applications exploiting the combination of Pockels and Kerr effects.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium friction and free energy estimates for kinetic coarse-graining -- Driven particles in responsive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the molecular friction and energy landscapes under nonequilibrium conditions is key to coarse-graining the dynamics of selective solute transport through complex, fluctuating and responsive media, e.g., polymeric materials such as hydrogels, cellular membranes or ion channels. The analysis of equilibrium ensembles already allows such a coarse-graining for very mild nonequilibrium conditions. Yet in the presence of stronger external driving and/or inhomogeneous setups, the transport process is governed apart from a potential of mean force also by a nontrivial position- and velocity-dependent friction. It is therefore important to find suitable and efficient methods to estimate the mean force and the friction landscape, which then can be used in a low-dimensional, coarse-grained Langevin framework to predict the system's transport properties and timescales. In this work, we evaluate different coarse-graining approaches based on constant-velocity constraint simulations for generating such estimates using two model systems, which are a 1D responsive barrier as a minimalistic model and a single tracer driven through a 3D bead-spring polymer membrane as a more sophisticated problem. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimates from 3D constant-velocity simulations yield the correct velocity-dependent friction, which can be directly utilized for coarse-grained (1D) Langevin simulations with constant external driving forces.</description>

Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>
