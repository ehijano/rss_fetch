      <title>The Roasting Marshmallows Program with IGRINS on Gemini South II -- WASP-121 b has super-stellar C/O and refractory-to-volatile ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary goal of exoplanet science is to measure the atmospheric composition of gas giants in order to infer their formation and migration histories. Common diagnostics for planet formation are the atmospheric metallicity ([M/H]) and the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio as measured through transit or emission spectroscopy. The C/O ratio in particular can be used to approximately place a planet's initial formation radius from the stellar host, but a given C/O ratio may not be unique to formation location. This degeneracy can be broken by combining measurements of both the C/O ratio and the atmospheric refractory-to-volatile ratio. We report the measurement of both quantities for the atmosphere of the canonical ultra hot Jupiter WASP-121 b using the high resolution (R=45,000) IGRINS instrument on Gemini South. Probing the planet's direct thermal emission in both pre- and post-secondary eclipse orbital phases, we infer that WASP-121 b has a significantly super-stellar C/O ratio of 0.70$^{+0.07}_{-0.10}$ and a moderately super-stellar refractory-to-volatile ratio at 3.83$^{+3.62}_{-1.67} \times$ stellar. This combination is most consistent with formation between the soot line and H$_2$O snow line, but we cannot rule out formation between the H$_2$O and CO snow lines or beyond the CO snow line. We also measure velocity offsets between H$_2$O, CO, and OH, potentially an effect of chemical inhomogeneity on the planet day side. This study highlights the ability to measure both C/O and refractory-to-volatile ratios via high resolution spectroscopy in the near-infrared H and K bands.</description>

      <title>Earth-like exoplanets in spin-orbit resonances: climate dynamics, 3D atmospheric chemistry, and observational signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terrestrial exoplanets around M- and K-type stars are important targets for atmospheric characterisation. Such planets are likely tidally locked with the order of spin-orbit resonances (SORs) depending on eccentricity. We explore the impact of SORs on 3D atmospheric dynamics and chemistry, employing a 3D coupled Climate-Chemistry Model to simulate Proxima Centauri b in 1:1 and 3:2 SOR. For a 1:1 SOR, Proxima Centauri b is in the Rhines rotator circulation regime with dominant zonal gradients (global mean surface temperature 229 K). An eccentric 3:2 SOR warms Proxima Centauri b to 262 K with gradients in the meridional direction. We show how a complex interplay between stellar radiation, orbit, atmospheric circulation, and (photo)chemistry determines the 3D ozone distribution. Spatial variations in ozone column densities align with the temperature distribution and are driven by stratospheric circulation mechanisms. Proxima Centauri b in a 3:2 SOR demonstrates additional atmospheric variability, including daytime-nighttime cycles in water vapour of ${+}$55% to ${-}$34% and ozone ($\pm5.2$%) column densities and periastron-apoastron water vapour cycles of ${+}$17% to ${-}$10%. Synthetic emission spectra for the spectral range of the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets fluctuate by up to 36 ppm with orbital phase angle for a 1:1 SOR due to 3D spatial and temporal asymmetries. The homogeneous atmosphere for the 3:2 SOR results in relatively constant emission spectra and provides an observational discriminant from the 1:1 SOR. Our work emphasizes the importance of understanding the 3D nature of exoplanet atmospheres and associated spectral variations to determine habitability and interpret atmospheric spectra.</description>

      <title>Profiling Near-Surface Winds on Mars Using Attitude Data from Mars 2020 Ingenuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used attitude data from the Mars Ingenuity helicopter with a simple steady-state model to estimate windspeeds and directions at altitudes of 3 meters up to 24 meters, the first time winds at such altitudes have been probed on Mars. We compared our estimates to concurrent wind data at 1.5 m height from the meteorology package MEDA onboard the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover and to predictions from meteorological models. Wind directions inferred from the Ingenuity data agreed to within uncertainties with the directions measured by MEDA, when the latter were available, but deviated from model-predicted directions by as much as 180 deg in some cases. Also, the inferred windspeeds are often much higher than expected. For example, meteorological predictions tailored to the time and location of Ingenuity's 59th flight suggest Ingenuity should not have seen windspeeds above about 15 m/s, but we inferred speeds reaching nearly 25 m/s. By contrast, the 61st flight was at a similar time and season and showed weaker winds then the 59th flight, suggesting winds shaped by transient phenomena. For flights during which we have MEDA data to compare to, inferred windspeeds imply friction velocities exceeding 1 m/s and roughness lengths of more than 10 cm based on a boundary layer model that incorporates convective instability, which seem implausibly large. These results suggest Ingenuity was probing winds sensitive to aerodynamic conditions hundreds of meters upwind instead of the conditions very near Mars 2020, but they may also reflect a need for updated boundary layer wind models. An improved model for Ingenuity's aerodynamic response that includes the effects of transient winds may also modify our results. In any case, the work here provides a foundation for exploration of planetary boundary layers using drones and suggests important future avenues for research and development.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Aerosol Mie Scattering in POSEIDON with Application to the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b's Transmission, Emission, and Reflected Light Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerosols are a ubiquitous feature of planetary atmospheres and leave clear spectral imprints in exoplanet spectra. Pre-JWST, exoplanet retrieval frameworks mostly adopted simple parametric approximations. With JWST, we now have access to mid-infrared wavelengths where aerosols have detectable composition-specific resonance features. Here, we implement new features into the open-source atmospheric retrieval code POSEIDON to account for the complex scattering, reflection, and absorption properties of Mie scattering aerosols. We provide an open-source database of these Mie scattering cross sections and optical properties. We also extend the radiative transfer and retrieval functionality in POSEIDON to include multiple scattering reflection and emission spectroscopy. We demonstrate these new retrieval capabilities on archival Hubble and Spitzer transmission and secondary eclipse spectra of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b. We find that a high-altitude, low-density, thin slab composed of sub-micron particles is necessary to fit HD 189733 b's transmission spectrum, with multiple aerosol species providing a good fit. We additionally retrieve a sub-solar H$_2$O abundance, a sub-solar K abundance, and do not detect CO$_2$. Our joint thermal and reflection retrievals of HD 189733 b's secondary eclipse spectrum, however, finds no evidence of dayside aerosols, a sub-solar dayside H$_2$O abundance, enhanced CO$_2$, and slighty sub-solar alkali abundances. We additionally explore how retrieval model choices, such as cloud parameterization, aerosol species and properties, and thermal structure parameterization affect retrieved atmospheric properties. Upcoming JWST data for hot Jupiters like HD 189733 b will be well suited to enable deeper exploration of aerosol properties, allowing the formulation of a self-consistent, multi-dimensional picture of cloud formation processes.</description>

      <title>Self-Shielding Enhanced Organics Synthesis in an Early Reduced Earth's Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth is expected to have acquired a reduced proto-atmosphere enriched in H2 and CH4 through the accretion of building blocks that contain metallic Fe and/or the gravitational trapping of surrounding nebula gas. Such an early, wet, reduced atmosphere that covers a proto-ocean would then ultimately evolve toward oxidized chemical compositions through photochemical processes that involve reactions with H2O-derived oxidant radicals and the selective escape of hydrogen to space. During this time, atmospheric CH4 could be photochemically reprocessed to generate not only C-bearing oxides but also organics. However, the branching ratio between organic matter formation and oxidation remains unknown despite its significance on the abiotic chemical evolution of early Earth. Here, we show via numerical analyses that UV absorptions by gaseous hydrocarbons such as C2H2 and C3H4 significantly suppress H2O photolysis subsequent CH4 oxidation during the photochemical evolution of a wet proto-atmosphere enriched in H2 and CH4. As a result, nearly half of the initial CH4 converted to heavier organics along with the deposition of prebiotically essential molecules such as HCN and H2CO on the surface of a primordial ocean for a geological timescale order of 10-100 Myr. Our results suggest that the accumulation of organics and prebiotically important molecules in the proto-ocean could produce a soup enriched in various organics, which might have eventually led to the emergence of living organisms.</description>

      <title>Cold day-side winds shape large leading streams in evaporating exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of planetary atmospheres in HAT-P-32 b and HAT-P-67 b reveal extensive outflows reaching up to hundreds of planetary radii. The helium 1083 nm light curves for these planets, captured across their full orbits, show notable asymmetries: both planets display more pronounced pre-transit than post-transit absorptions, with HAT-P-67 b being the more extreme case of that geometry. Using three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamic simulations, we identify key factors influencing the formation of a dense leading outflow stream and characterize its morphology. Our models suggest that such a geometry of escaped material is caused by a relatively cold outflow of high mass-loss rate, launched preferentially from the planet's day side. From the simulations we calculate synthetic He I 1083 nm spectra that show large absorption depths and irregular line profiles due to complex gas kinematics. We find that the measurements of the He I 1083 nm equivalent width and the velocity shift relative to the planet's rest frame, observed over a significant portion of the planet's orbital phase, can provide important constraints on the outflow properties and its interaction with the stellar wind.</description>

      <title>Nutation-orbit resonances: The origin of the chaotic rotation of Hyperion and the barrel instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While numerous planetary and asteroid satellites show evidence for non-trivial rotation states, none are as emblematic as Hyperion, which has long been held as the most striking example of chaotic spin-orbit evolution in the Solar System. Nevertheless, an analytically tractable theory of the full 3D spin-orbit dynamics of Hyperion has not been developed. We derive the Hamiltonian for a spinning axisymmetric satellite in the gravitational potential of a planet without assuming planar or principal axis rotation and without averaging over the spin period. Using this model, we demonstrate the emergence of resonances between the nutation and orbital frequencies that act as the primary drivers of the spin dynamics. This analysis reveals that, contrary to long-held belief, Hyperion is not tumbling chaotically. Instead, it lies near or in a nutation-orbit resonance that is first-order in eccentricity, allowing it to rotate quasi-regularly. The most reliable observations are consistent with either nonchaotic motion or chaos that is orders of magnitude smaller than originally claimed. A separate phenomenon, the so-called barrel instability, is shown to be related to a different set of nutation-orbit resonances that generalize the planar spin-orbit resonances. Finally, we show that changes in spin states over long timescales are best understood by considering chaotic diffusion of quasi-conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>Assessing methods for telluric removal on atmospheric retrievals of high-resolution optical exoplanetary transmission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in ultra-stable ground-based high-resolution spectrographs have propelled ground-based astronomy to the forefront of exoplanet detection and characterisation. Retrieving accurate atmospheric parameters depends on accurate modelling and removal of the telluric contamination while preserving the faint underlying exoplanet signal. There exist many methods to model telluric contamination, whether directly modelling the Earth's transmission spectrum via radiative transfer modelling, or using a principal component analysis (PCA)-like reconstruction to fit the time-invariant features of a spectrum. We aimed to assess the efficacy of these various telluric removal methods in preserving the underlying exoplanetary spectra. We compared two of the most common telluric modelling and removal methods, molecfit and the PCA-like algorithm SysRem, using planetary transmission spectra injected into three high-resolution optical observations taken with ESPRESSO. These planetary signals were injected at orbital periods of P = 2 days and 12 days, resulting in differing changes in radial velocity during transit. We then retrieved various injected atmospheric model parameters in order to determine the efficacy of the telluric removal methods. For the close-in, high velocity injected signal, we found that SysRem performed better for species that are also present in the Earth's atmosphere across each of the datasets. As we moved to slower moving signals at larger orbital separations, for one of the three datasets, SysRem dampened the planetary H$_2$O signal. In contrast, the H$_2$O signal was preserved for the telluric modelling method, molecfit. However, this behaviour was not ubiquitous across all three of the injected datasets, with another dataset showing a more precise H$_2$O/Fe ratio when preprocessed with SysRem.</description>

      <title>Combining REBOUND and MESA: Dynamical Evolution of Planets Orbiting Interacting Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although planets have been found orbiting binary systems, whether they can survive binary interactions is debated. While the tightest-orbit binaries should host the most dynamically stable and long-lived circumbinary planetary systems, they are also the systems that are expected to experience mass transfer, common envelope evolution, or stellar mergers. In this study, we explore the effect of stable non-conservative mass transfer on the dynamical evolution of circumbinary planets. We present a new script that seamlessly integrates binary evolution data from the 1D binary stellar evolution code MESA into the N-body simulation code REBOUND. This integration framework enables a comprehensive examination of the dynamical evolution of circumbinary planets orbiting mass-transferring binaries, while simultaneously accounting for the detailed stellar structure evolution. In addition, we introduce a recalibration method to mitigate numerical errors from updates of binary properties during the system's dynamical evolution. We construct a reference binary model in which a $2.21\, M_\odot$ star loses its hydrogen-rich envelope through non-conservative mass transfer to the $1.76\, M_\odot$ companion star, creating a $0.38\,M_\odot$ subdwarf. We find the tightest stable orbital separation for circumbinary planets to be $\simeq 2.5$ times the binary separation after mass transfer. Accounting for tides by using the interior stellar structure, we find that tidal effects become apparent after the rapid mass transfer phase and start to fade away during the latter stage of the slow mass transfer phase. Our research provides a new framework for exploring circumbinary planet dynamics in interacting binary systems.</description>

      <title>Planet Migration in Windy Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) could be driven by MHD disc winds rather than turbulent viscosity. With a dynamical prescription for angular momentum transport induced by disc winds, we perform 2D simulations of PPDs to systematically investigate the rate and direction of planet migration in a windy disc. We find that the the strength of disc winds influences the corotation region similarly to the "desaturation" effect of viscosity. The magnitude and direction of torque depend sensitively on the hierarchy between the radial advection timescale across the horseshoe due to disc wind $\tau_{\rm dw}$, the horsehoe libration timescale $\tau_{\rm lib}$ and U-turn timescale $\tau_{\rm U-turn}$. Initially, as wind strength increases and the advection timescale shortens, a non-linear horseshoe drag emerges when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm lib}$, which tends to drive strong outward migration. Subsequently, the drag becomes linear and planets typically still migrate inward when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm U-turn} \sim \tau_{\rm lib}h$, where $h$ is the disc aspect ratio. For a planet with mass ratio of $\sim 10^{-5}$, the zone of outward migration sandwiched between inner and outer inward migration zones corresponds to $\sim $ 10-100 au in a PPD with accretion rates between $10^{-8}$ and $10^{-7}$ $M_\odot \text{yr}^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: With the new discoveries enabled thanks to the recent space missions, stellar physics is going through a revolution. However, these discoveries opened the door to many new questions that require more observations. The European Space Agency's Human and Robotic Exploration programme provides an excellent opportunity to push forward the limits of our knowledge and better understand stellar structure and dynamics evolution. Long-term observations, Ultra-Violet observations, and a stellar imager are a few highlights of proposed missions for late-type stars that will enhance the already planned space missions.</description>

      <title>Presolar Grains As Probes of Supernova Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the isotopic signatures of presolar supernova grains, specifically focusing on 44Ti-containing grains with robustly inferred supernova origins and their implications for nucleosynthesis and mixing mechanisms in supernovae. Recent technique advancements have enabled the differentiation between radiogenic (from 44Ti decay) and nonradiogenic 44Ca excesses in presolar grains, made possible by enhanced spatial resolution of Ca-Ti isotope analyses with the Cameca NanoSIMS (Nano-scale Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer) instrument. Within the context of presolar supernova grain data, we discuss (i) the production of 44Ti in supernovae and the impact of interstellar medium heterogeneities on the galactic chemical evolution of 44Ca/40Ca, (ii) the nucleosynthesis processes of neutron bursts and explosive H-burning in Type II supernovae, and (iii) challenges in identifying the progenitor supernovae for 54Cr-rich presolar nanospinel grains. Drawing on constraints and insights derived from presolar supernova grain data, we also provide an overview of our current understanding of the roles played by various supernova types - including Type II, Type Ia, and electron capture supernovae - in accounting for the diverse array of nucleosynthetic isotopic variations identified in bulk meteorites and meteoritic components. We briefly overview the potential mechanisms that have been proposed to explain these nucleosynthetic variations by describing the transport and distribution of presolar dust carriers in the protoplanetary disk. We highlight existing controversies in the interpretation of presolar grain data and meteoritic nucleosynthetic isotopic variations, while also outlining potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Architecture of TOI-561 planetary system</title>

Abstract: We present new observations from CHEOPS and TESS to clarify the architecture of the planetary system hosted by the old Galactic thick disk star TOI-561. Our global analysis, which also includes previously published photometric and radial velocity data, incontrovertibly proves that TOI-561 is hosting at least four transiting planets with periods of 0.44 days (TOI-561 b), 10.8 days (TOI-561 c), 25.7 days (TOI-561 d), and 77.1 days (TOI-561 e) and a fifth non-transiting candidate, TOI-561f with a period of 433 days. The precise characterisation of TOI-561's orbital architecture is interesting since old and metal-poor thick disk stars are less likely to host ultra-short period Super-Earths like TOI-561 b. The new period of planet -e is consistent with the value obtained using radial velocity alone and is now known to be $77.14399\pm0.00025$ days, thanks to the new CHEOPS and TESS transits. The new data allowed us to improve its radius ($R_p = 2.517 \pm 0.045 R_{\oplus}$ from 5$\%$ to 2$\%$ precision) and mass ($M_p = 12.4 \pm 1.4 M_{\oplus}$) estimates, implying a density of $\rho_p = 0.778 \pm 0.097 \rho_{\oplus}$. Thanks to recent TESS observations and the focused CHEOPS visit of the transit of TOI-561 e, a good candidate for exomoon searches, the planet's period is finally constrained, allowing us to predict transit times through 2030 with 20-minute accuracy. We present an updated version of the internal structure of the four transiting planets. We finally performed a detailed stability analysis, which confirmed the long-term stability of the outer planet TOI-561 f.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic boundaries in kinematic and self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic simulations of precession-driven dynamo action in a closed cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically examine dynamo action generated by a flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a precessing cylindrical cavity. We compare a simplified kinematic approach based on the solution of the magnetic induction equation with a prescribed velocity field with the results from a self-consistent three-dimensional simulation of the complete set of magnetohydrodynamic equations. The different kinematic models show a strong influence of the electromagnetic properties of outer layers, which manifests itself in the existence of two different branches with dynamo action. In all cases, we observe a minimum for the onset of dynamo action in a transitional regime, within which the hydrodynamic flow undergoes a change from a large-scale to a more small-scale, turbulent behaviour. However, significant differences in the absolute values for the critical magnetic Reynolds number occur, and they can be explained by the low rotation rate in the MHD simulations achievable for technical reasons. In these models the character of the dynamo solution is small-scale and the magnetic energy remains significantly smaller than the kinetic energy of the flow. In irregular intervals, we observe dynamo bursts with a local concentration of the magnetic field, resulting in a global increase of the magnetic energy by a factor of 3 to 5. However, diffusion of the local patches caused by strong local shear is too rapid, causing these features to exist for only a short period (i.e., shorter than a rotation period) so that their dynamical impact on the dynamo remains small. As the magnetic field is small-scale and weak, the nonlinear feedback on the flow through the Lorentz force remains small and arises essentially in terms of a slight damping of the fast timescales, whereas there is no noticeable change in flow amplitude compared to the hydrodynamic case.</description>
