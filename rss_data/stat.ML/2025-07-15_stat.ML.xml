      <title>TaylorPODA: A Taylor Expansion-Based Method to Improve Post-Hoc Attributions for Opaque Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing post-hoc model-agnostic methods generate external explanations for opaque models, primarily by locally attributing the model output to its input features. However, they often lack an explicit and systematic framework for quantifying the contribution of individual features. Building on the Taylor expansion framework introduced by Deng et al. (2024) to unify existing local attribution methods, we propose a rigorous set of postulates -- "precision", "federation", and "zero-discrepancy" -- to govern Taylor term-specific attribution. Guided by these postulates, we introduce TaylorPODA (Taylor expansion-derived imPortance-Order aDapted Attribution), which incorporates an additional "adaptation" property. This property enables alignment with task-specific goals, especially in post-hoc settings lacking ground-truth explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TaylorPODA achieves competitive results against baseline methods, providing principled and visualization-friendly explanations. This work represents a step toward the trustworthy deployment of opaque models by offering explanations with stronger theoretical grounding.</description>

      <title>Robust Multi-Manifold Clustering via Simplex Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel, geometric approach for multi-manifold clustering (MMC), i.e. for clustering a collection of potentially intersecting, d-dimensional manifolds into the individual manifold components. We first compute a locality graph on d-simplices, using the dihedral angle in between adjacent simplices as the graph weights, and then compute infinity path distances in this simplex graph. This procedure gives a metric on simplices which we refer to as the largest angle path distance (LAPD). We analyze the properties of LAPD under random sampling, and prove that with an appropriate denoising procedure, this metric separates the manifold components with high probability. We validate the proposed methodology with extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets. These experiments demonstrate that the method is robust to noise, curvature, and small intersection angle, and generally out-performs other MMC algorithms. In addition, we provide a highly scalable implementation of the proposed algorithm, which leverages approximation schemes for infinity path distance to achieve quasi-linear computational complexity.</description>

      <title>GOLFS: Feature Selection via Combining Both Global and Local Information for High Dimensional Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is important to identify the discriminative features for high dimensional clustering. However, due to the lack of cluster labels, the regularization methods developed for supervised feature selection can not be directly applied. To learn the pseudo labels and select the discriminative features simultaneously, we propose a new unsupervised feature selection method, named GlObal and Local information combined Feature Selection (GOLFS), for high dimensional clustering problems. The GOLFS algorithm combines both local geometric structure via manifold learning and global correlation structure of samples via regularized self-representation to select the discriminative features. The combination improves the accuracy of both feature selection and clustering by exploiting more comprehensive information. In addition, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem and the convergency is proved. Simulations and two real data applications demonstrate the excellent finite-sample performance of GOLFS on both feature selection and clustering.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Bayesian Tensor Network Kernel Machines with Automatic Rank and Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor Network (TN) Kernel Machines speed up model learning by representing parameters as low-rank TNs, reducing computation and memory use. However, most TN-based Kernel methods are deterministic and ignore parameter uncertainty. Further, they require manual tuning of model complexity hyperparameters like tensor rank and feature dimensions, often through trial-and-error or computationally costly methods like cross-validation. We propose Bayesian Tensor Network Kernel Machines, a fully probabilistic framework that uses sparsity-inducing hierarchical priors on TN factors to automatically infer model complexity. This enables automatic inference of tensor rank and feature dimensions, while also identifying the most relevant features for prediction, thereby enhancing model interpretability. All the model parameters and hyperparameters are treated as latent variables with corresponding priors. Given the Bayesian approach and latent variable dependencies, we apply a mean-field variational inference to approximate their posteriors. We show that applying a mean-field approximation to TN factors yields a Bayesian ALS algorithm with the same computational complexity as its deterministic counterpart, enabling uncertainty quantification at no extra computational cost. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and scalability.</description>

      <title>How does Labeling Error Impact Contrastive Learning? A Perspective from Data Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, contrastive learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance in the territory of self-supervised representation learning. Many previous works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding underlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a default assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold in practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the strength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random resized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling error on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We first reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on downstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality reduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on original data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical and empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a double-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream classification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation graph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion that we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in our experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large graph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance.</description>

      <title>From Observational Data to Clinical Recommendations: A Causal Framework for Estimating Patient-level Treatment Effects and Learning Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for building patient-specific treatment recommendation models, building on the large recent literature on learning patient-level causal models and inspired by the target trial paradigm of Hernan and Robins. We focus on safety and validity, including the crucial issue of causal identification when using observational data. We do not provide a specific model, but rather a way to integrate existing methods and know-how into a practical pipeline. We further provide a real world use-case of treatment optimization for patients with heart failure who develop acute kidney injury during hospitalization. The results suggest our pipeline can improve patient outcomes over the current treatment regime.</description>

      <title>Joint space-time wind field data extrapolation and uncertainty quantification using nonparametric Bayesian dictionary learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A methodology is developed, based on nonparametric Bayesian dictionary learning, for joint space-time wind field data extrapolation and estimation of related statistics by relying on limited/incomplete measurements. Specifically, utilizing sparse/incomplete measured data, a time-dependent optimization problem is formulated for determining the expansion coefficients of an associated low-dimensional representation of the stochastic wind field. Compared to an alternative, standard, compressive sampling treatment of the problem, the developed methodology exhibits the following advantages. First, the Bayesian formulation enables also the quantification of the uncertainty in the estimates. Second, the requirement in standard CS-based applications for an a priori selection of the expansion basis is circumvented. Instead, this is done herein in an adaptive manner based on the acquired data. Overall, the methodology exhibits enhanced extrapolation accuracy, even in cases of high-dimensional data of arbitrary form, and of relatively large extrapolation distances. Thus, it can be used, potentially, in a wide range of wind engineering applications where various constraints dictate the use of a limited number of sensors. The efficacy of the methodology is demonstrated by considering two case studies. The first relates to the extrapolation of simulated wind velocity records consistent with a prescribed joint wavenumber-frequency power spectral density in a three-dimensional domain (2D and time). The second pertains to the extrapolation of four-dimensional (3D and time) boundary layer wind tunnel experimental data that exhibit significant spatial variability and non-Gaussian characteristics.</description>

      <title>Canonical Bayesian Linear System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Bayesian approaches for linear time-invariant (LTI) system identification are hindered by parameter non-identifiability; the resulting complex, multi-modal posteriors make inference inefficient and impractical. We solve this problem by embedding canonical forms of LTI systems within the Bayesian framework. We rigorously establish that inference in these minimal parameterizations fully captures all invariant system dynamics (e.g., transfer functions, eigenvalues, predictive distributions of system outputs) while resolving identifiability. This approach unlocks the use of meaningful, structure-aware priors (e.g., enforcing stability via eigenvalues) and ensures conditions for a Bernstein--von Mises theorem -- a link between Bayesian and frequentist large-sample asymptotics that is broken in standard forms. Extensive simulations with modern MCMC methods highlight advantages over standard parameterizations: canonical forms achieve higher computational efficiency, generate interpretable and well-behaved posteriors, and provide robust uncertainty estimates, particularly from limited data.</description>

      <title>Tool-to-Tool Matching Analysis Based Difference Score Computation Methods for Semiconductor Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of tool-to-tool matching (TTTM), also called, chamber matching in the context of a semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Traditional TTTM approaches utilize static configuration data or depend on a golden reference which are difficult to obtain in a commercial manufacturing line. Further, existing methods do not extend very well to a heterogeneous setting, where equipment are of different make-and-model, sourced from different equipment vendors. We propose novel TTTM analysis pipelines to overcome these issues. We hypothesize that a mismatched equipment would have higher variance and/or higher number of modes in the data. Our best univariate method achieves a correlation coefficient &gt;0.95 and &gt;0.5 with the variance and number of modes, respectively showing that the proposed methods are effective. Also, the best multivariate method achieves a correlation coefficient &gt;0.75 with the top-performing univariate methods, showing its effectiveness. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of the multivariate algorithms to the algorithm hyper-parameters.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation Theorem for a Single-Layer Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning employs multi-layer neural networks trained via the backpropagation algorithm. This approach has achieved success across many domains and relies on adaptive gradient methods such as the Adam optimizer. Sequence modeling evolved from recurrent neural networks to attention-based models, culminating in the Transformer architecture. Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing (for example, BERT and GPT-3) and have been applied in computer vision and computational biology. However, theoretical understanding of these models remains limited. In this paper, we examine the mathematical foundations of deep learning and Transformers and present a novel theoretical result. We review key concepts from linear algebra, probability, and optimization that underpin deep learning, and we analyze the multi-head self-attention mechanism and the backpropagation algorithm in detail. Our main contribution is a universal approximation theorem for Transformers: we prove that a single-layer Transformer, comprising one self-attention layer followed by a position-wise feed-forward network with ReLU activation, can approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence mapping on a compact domain to arbitrary precision. We provide a formal statement and a complete proof. Finally, we present case studies that demonstrate the practical implications of this result. Our findings advance the theoretical understanding of Transformer models and help bridge the gap between theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Learning to Quantize and Precode in Massive MIMO Systems for Energy Reduction: a Graph Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive MIMO systems are moving toward increased numbers of radio frequency chains, higher carrier frequencies and larger bandwidths. As such, digital-to-analog converters (DACs) are becoming a bottleneck in terms of hardware complexity and power consumption. In this work, non-linear precoding for coarsely quantized downlink massive MIMO is studied. Given the NP-hard nature of this problem, a graph neural network (GNN) is proposed that directly outputs the precoded quantized vector based on the channel matrix and the intended transmit symbols. The model is trained in a self-supervised manner, by directly maximizing the achievable rate. To overcome the non-differentiability of the objective function, introduced due to the non-differentiable DAC functions, a straight-through Gumbel-softmax estimation of the gradient is proposed. The proposed method achieves a significant increase in achievable sum rate under coarse quantization. For instance, in the single-user case, the proposed method can achieve the same sum rate as maximum ratio transmission (MRT) by using one-bit DAC's as compared to 3 bits for MRT. This reduces the DAC's power consumption by a factor 4-7 and 3 for baseband and RF DACs respectively. This, however, comes at the cost of increased digital signal processing power consumption. When accounting for this, the reduction in overall power consumption holds for a system bandwidth up to 3.5 MHz for baseband DACs, while the RF DACs can maintain a power reduction of 2.9 for higher bandwidths. Notably, indirect effects, which further reduce the power consumption, such as a reduced fronthaul consumption and reduction in other components, are not considered in this analysis.</description>

      <title>A Simple Approximate Bayesian Inference Neural Surrogate for Stochastic Petri Net Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Petri Nets (SPNs) are an increasingly popular tool of choice for modeling discrete-event dynamics in areas such as epidemiology and systems biology, yet their parameter estimation remains challenging in general and in particular when transition rates depend on external covariates and explicit likelihoods are unavailable. We introduce a neural-surrogate (neural-network--based approximation of the posterior distribution) framework that predicts the coefficients of known covariate-dependent rate functions directly from noisy, partially observed token trajectories. Our model employs a lightweight 1D Convolutional Residual Network trained end-to-end on Gillespie-simulated SPN realizations, learning to invert system dynamics under realistic conditions of event dropout. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout provides calibrated uncertainty bounds together with point estimates. On synthetic SPNs with 20% missing events, our surrogate recovers rate-function coefficients with an RMSE = 0.108 and substantially runs faster than traditional Bayesian approaches. These results demonstrate that data-driven, likelihood-free surrogates can enable accurate, robust, and real-time parameter recovery in complex, partially observed discrete-event systems.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery for Linear Non-Gaussian Models with Disjoint Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paradigm of linear structural equation modeling readily allows one to incorporate causal feedback loops in the model specification. These appear as directed cycles in the common graphical representation of the models. However, the presence of cycles entails difficulties such as the fact that models need no longer be characterized by conditional independence relations. As a result, learning cyclic causal structures remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we offer new insights on this problem in the context of linear non-Gaussian models. First, we precisely characterize when two directed graphs determine the same linear non-Gaussian model. Next, we take up a setting of cycle-disjoint graphs, for which we are able to show that simple quadratic and cubic polynomial relations among low-order moments of a non-Gaussian distribution allow one to locate source cycles. Complementing this with a strategy of decorrelating cycles and multivariate regression allows one to infer a block-topological order among the directed cycles, which leads to a {consistent and computationally efficient algorithm} for learning causal structures with disjoint cycles.</description>

      <title>Multi-Armed Sampling Problem and the End of Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the framework of multi-armed sampling, as the sampling counterpart to the optimization problem of multi-arm bandits. Our primary motivation is to rigorously examine the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the context of sampling. We systematically define plausible notions of regret for this framework and establish corresponding lower bounds. We then propose a simple algorithm that achieves these optimal regret bounds. Our theoretical results demonstrate that in contrast to optimization, sampling does not require exploration. To further connect our findings with those of multi-armed bandits, we define a continuous family of problems and associated regret measures that smoothly interpolates and unifies multi-armed sampling and multi-armed bandit problems using a temperature parameter. We believe the multi-armed sampling framework, and our findings in this setting can have a foundational role in the study of sampling including recent neural samplers, akin to the role of multi-armed bandits in reinforcement learning. In particular, our work sheds light on the need for exploration and the convergence properties of algorithm for entropy-regularized reinforcement learning, fine-tuning of pretrained models and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).</description>

      <title>Urban delineation through the lens of commute networks: Leveraging graph embeddings to distinguish socioeconomic groups in cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delineating areas within metropolitan regions stands as an important focus among urban researchers, shedding light on the urban perimeters shaped by evolving population dynamics. Applications to urban science are numerous, from facilitating comparisons between delineated districts and administrative divisions to informing policymakers of the shifting economic and labor landscapes. In this study, we propose using commute networks sourced from the census for the purpose of urban delineation, by modeling them with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. We derive low-dimensional representations of granular urban areas (nodes) using GNNs. Subsequently, nodes' embeddings are clustered to identify spatially cohesive communities in urban areas. Our experiments across the U.S. demonstrate the effectiveness of network embeddings in capturing significant socioeconomic disparities between communities in various cities, particularly in factors such as median household income. The role of census mobility data in regional delineation is also noted, and we establish the utility of GNNs in urban community detection, as a powerful alternative to existing methods in this domain. The results offer insights into the wider effects of commute networks and their use in building meaningful representations of urban regions.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable AI framework Quantifying Traditional Chinese Medicine Principles Towards Enhancing and Integrating with Modern Biomedicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine diagnosis and treatment principles, established through centuries of trial-and-error clinical practice, directly maps patient-specific symptom patterns to personalised herbal therapies. These empirical holistic mapping principles offer valuable strategies to address remaining challenges of reductionism methodologies in modern biomedicine. However, the lack of a quantitative framework and molecular-level evidence has limited their interpretability and reliability. Here, we present an AI framework trained on ancient and classical TCM formula records to quantify the symptom pattern-herbal therapy mappings. Interestingly, we find that empirical TCM diagnosis and treatment are consistent with the encoding-decoding processes in the AI model. This enables us to construct an interpretable TCM embedding space (TCM-ES) using the model's quantitative representation of TCM principles. Validated through broad and extensive TCM patient data, the TCM-ES offers universal quantification of the TCM practice and therapeutic efficacy. We further map biomedical entities into the TCM-ES through correspondence alignment. We find that the principal directions of the TCM-ES are significantly associated with key biological functions (such as metabolism, immune, and homeostasis), and that the disease and herb embedding proximity aligns with their genetic relationships in the human protein interactome, which demonstrate the biological significance of TCM principles. Moreover, the TCM-ES uncovers latent disease relationships, and provides alternative metric to assess clinical efficacy for modern disease-drug pairs. Finally, we construct a comprehensive and integrative TCM knowledge graph, which predicts potential associations between diseases and targets, drugs, herbal compounds, and herbal therapies, providing TCM-informed opportunities for disease analysis and drug development.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Simulation-based Inference for Gravitational Wave Data Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses. Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Improved sampling algorithms and Poincar\'e inequalities for non-log-concave distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution $\mu$ with density $\propto e^{-V}$ for some potential function $V:\mathbb R^d\to \mathbb R$ with query access to $V$ and $\nabla V$. We start with the following standard assumptions:
  (1) The potential function $V$ is $L$-smooth.
  (2) The second moment $\mathbf{E}_{X\sim \mu}[\|X\|^2]\leq M$.
  Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of sampling from such distributions is at least $\left(\frac{LM}{d\epsilon}\right)^{\Omega(d)}$ where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincar\'e constant can be arbitrarily large.
  Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers (see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23)) strengthens the smoothness condition (1) to the following:
  (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\mu$ is $L$-smooth.
  We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of sampling from $\mu$ can be $\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\cdot \left(\frac{Ld+M}{\epsilon^2}\right)^{\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial in $d$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ when $L=\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $M=\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query complexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the seemly moderate strengthening of the smoothness condition (1) to (1*) can lead to an exponential gap in the query complexity of sampling algorithms.
  Moreover, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger moment assumption that $\|X\|$ is $\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\sim\mu$, the Poincar\'e constant of $\mu$ is at most $\mathcal{O}(\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$. As an application of our technique, we obtain improved estimate of the Poincar\'e constant for mixture of Gaussians with the same covariance.</description>

      <title>Fast Last-Iterate Convergence of SGD in the Smooth Interpolation Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study population convergence guarantees of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for smooth convex objectives in the interpolation regime, where the noise at optimum is zero or near zero. The behavior of the last iterate of SGD in this setting -- particularly with large (constant) stepsizes -- has received growing attention in recent years due to implications for the training of over-parameterized models, as well as to analyzing forgetting in continual learning and to understanding the convergence of the randomized Kaczmarz method for solving linear systems. We establish that after $T$ steps of SGD on $\beta$-smooth convex loss functions with stepsize $\eta \leq 1/\beta$, the last iterate exhibits expected excess risk $\widetilde{O}(1/(\eta T^{1-\beta\eta/2}) + \eta T^{\beta\eta/2} \sigma_\star^2)$, where $\sigma_\star^2$ denotes the variance of the stochastic gradients at the optimum. In particular, for a well-tuned stepsize we obtain a near optimal $\widetilde{O}(1/T + \sigma_\star/\sqrt{T})$ rate for the last iterate, extending the results of Varre et al. (2021) beyond least squares regression; and when $\sigma_\star=0$ we obtain a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ with $\eta=1/\beta$, improving upon the best-known $O(T^{-1/4})$ rate recently established by Evron et al. (2025) in the special case of realizable linear regression.</description>

      <title>Neurosymbolic Reasoning Shortcuts under the Independence Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitous independence assumption among symbolic concepts in neurosymbolic (NeSy) predictors is a convenient simplification: NeSy predictors use it to speed up probabilistic reasoning. Recent works like van Krieken et al. (2024) and Marconato et al. (2024) argued that the independence assumption can hinder learning of NeSy predictors and, more crucially, prevent them from correctly modelling uncertainty. There is, however, scepticism in the NeSy community around the scenarios in which the independence assumption actually limits NeSy systems (Faronius and Dos Martires, 2025). In this work, we settle this question by formally showing that assuming independence among symbolic concepts entails that a model can never represent uncertainty over certain concept combinations. Thus, the model fails to be aware of reasoning shortcuts, i.e., the pathological behaviour of NeSy predictors that predict correct downstream tasks but for the wrong reasons.</description>

      <title>Local Pairwise Distance Matching for Backpropagation-Free Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training neural networks with reinforcement learning (RL) typically relies on backpropagation (BP), necessitating storage of activations from the forward pass for subsequent backward updates. Furthermore, backpropagating error signals through multiple layers often leads to vanishing or exploding gradients, which can degrade learning performance and stability. We propose a novel approach that trains each layer of the neural network using local signals during the forward pass in RL settings. Our approach introduces local, layer-wise losses leveraging the principle of matching pairwise distances from multi-dimensional scaling, enhanced with optional reward-driven guidance. This method allows each hidden layer to be trained using local signals computed during forward propagation, thus eliminating the need for backward passes and storing intermediate activations. Our experiments, conducted with policy gradient methods across common RL benchmarks, demonstrate that this backpropagation-free method achieves competitive performance compared to their classical BP-based counterpart. Additionally, the proposed method enhances stability and consistency within and across runs, and improves performance especially in challenging environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems that "think" in human language offer a unique opportunity for AI safety: we can monitor their chains of thought (CoT) for the intent to misbehave. Like all other known AI oversight methods, CoT monitoring is imperfect and allows some misbehavior to go unnoticed. Nevertheless, it shows promise and we recommend further research into CoT monitorability and investment in CoT monitoring alongside existing safety methods. Because CoT monitorability may be fragile, we recommend that frontier model developers consider the impact of development decisions on CoT monitorability.</description>

      <title>State-Constrained Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods predominantly operate in a batch-constrained setting. This confines the algorithms to a specific state-action distribution present in the dataset, reducing the effects of distributional shift but restricting the policy to seen actions. In this paper, we alleviate this limitation by introducing state-constrained offline RL, a novel framework that focuses solely on the dataset's state distribution. This approach allows the policy to take high-quality out-of-distribution actions that lead to in-distribution states, significantly enhancing learning potential. The proposed setting not only broadens the learning horizon but also improves the ability to combine different trajectories from the dataset effectively, a desirable property inherent in offline RL. Our research is underpinned by theoretical findings that pave the way for subsequent advancements in this area. Additionally, we introduce StaCQ, a deep learning algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the D4RL benchmark datasets and aligns with our theoretical propositions. StaCQ establishes a strong baseline for forthcoming explorations in this domain.</description>

      <title>Forecasting intermittent time series with Gaussian Processes and Tweedie likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19086v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adopt Gaussian Processes (GPs) as latent functions for probabilistic forecasting of intermittent time series. The model is trained in a Bayesian framework that accounts for the uncertainty about the latent function. We couple the latent GP variable with two types of forecast distributions: the negative binomial (NegBinGP) and the Tweedie distribution (TweedieGP). While the negative binomial has already been used in forecasting intermittent time series, this is the first time in which a fully parameterized Tweedie density is used for intermittent time series. We properly evaluate the Tweedie density, which has both a point mass at zero and heavy tails, avoiding simplifying assumptions made in existing models. We test our models on thousands of intermittent count time series. Results show that our models provide consistently better probabilistic forecasts than the competitors. In particular, TweedieGP obtains the best estimates of the highest quantiles, thus showing that it is more flexible than NegBinGP.</description>

      <title>Universal rates of ERM for agnostic learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The universal learning framework has been developed to obtain guarantees on the learning rates that hold for any fixed distribution, which can be much faster than the ones uniformly hold over all the distributions. Given that the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) principle being fundamental in the PAC theory and ubiquitous in practical machine learning, the recent work of arXiv:2412.02810 studied the universal rates of ERM for binary classification under the realizable setting. However, the assumption of realizability is too restrictive to hold in practice. Indeed, the majority of the literature on universal learning has focused on the realizable case, leaving the non-realizable case barely explored.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of universal learning by ERM for binary classification under the agnostic setting, where the ''learning curve" reflects the decay of the excess risk as the sample size increases. We explore the possibilities of agnostic universal rates and reveal a compact trichotomy: there are three possible agnostic universal rates of ERM, being either $e^{-n}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We provide a complete characterization of which concept classes fall into each of these categories. Moreover, we also establish complete characterizations for the target-dependent universal rates as well as the Bayes-dependent universal rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of online multi-group learning, a learning model in which an online learner must simultaneously achieve small prediction regret on a large collection of (possibly overlapping) subsequences corresponding to a family of groups. Groups are subsets of the context space, and in fairness applications, they may correspond to subpopulations defined by expressive functions of demographic attributes. In contrast to previous work on this learning model, we consider scenarios in which the family of groups is too large to explicitly enumerate, and hence we seek algorithms that only access groups via an optimization oracle. In this paper, we design such oracle-efficient algorithms with sublinear regret under a variety of settings, including: (i) the i.i.d. setting, (ii) the adversarial setting with smoothed context distributions, and (iii) the adversarial transductive setting.</description>

      <title>A Review of Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Probabilistic Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16370v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in architectural design, data availability, and compute have driven remarkable progress in semantic segmentation. Yet, these models often rely on relaxed Bayesian assumptions, omitting critical uncertainty information needed for robust decision-making. The resulting reliance on point estimates has fueled interest in probabilistic segmentation, but the literature remains fragmented. In response, this review consolidates and contextualizes foundational concepts in uncertainty modeling, including the non-trivial task of distinguishing between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty and examining their roles across four key downstream segmentation tasks, highlighting Active Learning as particularly promising. By unifying theory, terminology, and applications, we provide a coherent foundation for researchers and identify critical challenges, such as strong assumptions in spatial aggregation, lack of standardized benchmarks, and pitfalls in current uncertainty quantification methods. We identify trends such as the adoption of contemporary generative models, driven by advances in the broader field of generative modeling, with segmentation-specific innovation primarily in the conditioning mechanisms. Moreover, we observe growing interest in distribution- and sampling-free approaches to uncertainty estimation. We further propose directions for advancing uncertainty-aware segmentation in deep learning, including pragmatic strategies for disentangling different sources of uncertainty, novel uncertainty modeling approaches and improved Transformer-based backbones. In this way, we aim to support the development of more reliable, efficient, and interpretable segmentation models that effectively incorporate uncertainty into real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: Rotating the activation and weight matrices to reduce the influence of outliers in large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted significant attention, particularly in the context of model quantization. Prior studies have shown that in low-precision quantization scenarios, such as 4-bit weights and 4-bit activations (W4A4), randomized Hadamard transforms can achieve significantly higher accuracy than randomized orthogonal transforms. Notably, the reason behind this phenomenon remains unknown. In this paper, we find that these transformations show substantial improvement in eliminating outliers for common tokens and achieve similar quantization error. The primary reason for the accuracy difference lies in the fact that randomized Hadamard transforms can slightly reduce the quantization error for tokens with massive activations while randomized orthogonal transforms increase the quantization error. Due to the extreme rarity of these tokens and their critical impact on model accuracy, we consider this a long-tail optimization problem, and therefore construct a simple yet effective method: a weighted loss function. Additionally, we propose an optimization strategy for the rotation matrix that involves alternating optimization of quantization parameters while employing orthogonal Procrustes transforms to refine the rotation matrix. This makes the distribution of the rotated activation values more conducive to quantization, especially for tokens with massive activations. Our method enhances the Rotated LLMs by achieving dual free, Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free, dubbed as DFRot. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DFRot. By tuning the rotation matrix using just a single sample, DFRot achieves a perplexity improvement of 0.98 and 0.95 on W4A4KV4 and W4A4KV16, respectively, for LLaMA3-70B, a model known for its quantization challenges.</description>

      <title>Score-of-Mixture Training: Training One-Step Generative Models Made Simple via Score Estimation of Mixture Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Score-of-Mixture Training (SMT), a novel framework for training one-step generative models by minimizing a class of divergences called the $\alpha$-skew Jensen--Shannon divergence. At its core, SMT estimates the score of mixture distributions between real and fake samples across multiple noise levels. Similar to consistency models, our approach supports both training from scratch (SMT) and distillation using a pretrained diffusion model, which we call Score-of-Mixture Distillation (SMD). It is simple to implement, requires minimal hyperparameter tuning, and ensures stable training. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64x64 show that SMT/SMD are competitive with and can even outperform existing methods.</description>

      <title>Gaussian mixture models as a proxy for interacting language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a powerful tool with the ability to match human capabilities and behavior in many settings. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) further allows LLMs to generate diverse output depending on the contents of their RAG database. This motivates their use in the social sciences to study human behavior between individuals when large-scale experiments are infeasible. However, LLMs depend on complex, computationally expensive algorithms. In this paper, we introduce interacting Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) as an alternative to similar frameworks using LLMs. We compare a simplified model of GMMs to select experimental simulations of LLMs whose updating and response depend on feedback from other LLMs. We find that interacting GMMs capture important features of the dynamics in interacting LLMs, and we investigate key similarities and differences between interacting LLMs and GMMs. We conclude by discussing the benefits of Gaussian mixture models, potential modifications, and future research directions.</description>

      <title>On the Similarities of Embeddings in Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning operates on a simple yet effective principle: Embeddings of positive pairs are pulled together, while those of negative pairs are pushed apart. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for understanding contrastive learning through the lens of cosine similarity, and present two key theoretical insights derived from this framework. First, in full-batch settings, we show that perfect alignment of positive pairs is unattainable when negative-pair similarities fall below a threshold, and this misalignment can be mitigated by incorporating within-view negative pairs into the objective. Second, in mini-batch settings, smaller batch sizes induce stronger separation among negative pairs in the embedding space, i.e., higher variance in their similarities, which in turn degrades the quality of learned representations compared to full-batch settings. To address this, we propose an auxiliary loss that reduces the variance of negative-pair similarities in mini-batch settings. Empirical results show that incorporating the proposed loss improves performance in small-batch settings.</description>

      <title>On Equivariant Model Selection through the Lens of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equivariant models leverage prior knowledge on symmetries to improve predictive performance, but misspecified architectural constraints can harm it instead. While work has explored learning or relaxing constraints, selecting among pretrained models with varying symmetry biases remains challenging. We examine this model selection task from an uncertainty-aware perspective, comparing frequentist (via Conformal Prediction), Bayesian (via the marginal likelihood), and calibration-based measures to naive error-based evaluation. We find that uncertainty metrics generally align with predictive performance, but Bayesian model evidence does so inconsistently. We attribute this to a mismatch in Bayesian and geometric notions of model complexity for the employed last-layer Laplace approximation, and discuss possible remedies. Our findings point towards the potential of uncertainty in guiding symmetry-aware model selection.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Action Chunking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Q-chunking, a simple yet effective recipe for improving reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks. Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1) leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Entity-Specific Cyber Risk Assessment using InsurTech Empowered Risk Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lack of high-quality public cyber incident data limits empirical research and predictive modeling for cyber risk assessment. This challenge persists due to the reluctance of companies to disclose incidents that could damage their reputation or investor confidence. Therefore, from an actuarial perspective, potential resolutions conclude two aspects: the enhancement of existing cyber incident datasets and the implementation of advanced modeling techniques to optimize the use of the available data. A review of existing data-driven methods highlights a significant lack of entity-specific organizational features in publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we propose a novel InsurTech framework that enriches cyber incident data with entity-specific attributes. We develop various machine learning (ML) models: a multilabel classification model to predict the occurrence of cyber incident types (e.g., Privacy Violation, Data Breach, Fraud and Extortion, IT Error, and Others) and a multioutput regression model to estimate their annual frequencies. While classifier and regressor chains are implemented to explore dependencies among cyber incident types as well, no significant correlations are observed in our datasets. Besides, we apply multiple interpretable ML techniques to identify and cross-validate potential risk factors developed by InsurTech across ML models. We find that InsurTech empowered features enhance prediction occurrence and frequency estimation robustness compared to only using conventional risk factors. The framework generates transparent, entity-specific cyber risk profiles, supporting customized underwriting and proactive cyber risk mitigation. It provides insurers and organizations with data-driven insights to support decision-making and compliance planning.</description>
