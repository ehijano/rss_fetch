      <title>Insulating charge transfer ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for insulating ferromagnetism in the honeycomb Hubbard model of semiconductor moir\'e superlattices. The ferromagnetism emerges at critical charge transfer regime, stabilizing the quantum anomalous Hall state without Hund's coupling. We further note the ferromagnetic exchange applies to general charge transfer systems when breaking particle-hole symmetry.</description>

      <title>Developing fractional quantum Hall states at $\nu$ = 1/7 and 2/11 in the presence of significant Landau level mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Termination of the fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) and the emergence of Wigner crystal phases at very small Landau level filling factors ($\nu$) have been of continued interest for decades. Recently, in ultra-high-quality, dilute GaAs 2D electron systems (2DESs), strong evidence was reported for FQHSs at $\nu=1/7, 2/13$ and 2/11 which fall in the $\nu = p/(6p\pm1)$ Jain series of FQHSs, interpreted as integer ($p = 1$, 2) QHSs of 6-flux composite fermions ($^6$CFs). These states are surrounded by strongly-insulating phases which are generally believed to be Wigner crystals. Here, we study an ultra-high-quality 2DES confined to an AlAs quantum well where the 2D electrons have a much larger effective mass ($m^*\simeq 0.45 m_e$) and a smaller dielectric constant ($\epsilon\simeq10\epsilon_0$) compared to GaAs 2D electrons ($m^*\simeq 0.067 m_e$ and $\epsilon\simeq13\epsilon_0$). This combination of $m^*$ and $\epsilon$ renders the Landau level mixing parameter $\kappa$, defined as the ratio of the Coulomb and cyclotron energies, $\simeq 9$ times larger in AlAs 2DESs ($\kappa\propto m^*/\epsilon$). Qualitatively similar to the GaAs 2DESs, we observe an insulating behavior reentrant around a strong $\nu=1/5$ FQHS, and extending to $\nu&lt;1/5$. Additionally, we observe a clear minimum in magnetoresistance at $\nu=2/11$, and an inflection point at $\nu=1/7$ which is very reminiscent of the first report of an emerging FQHS at $\nu=1/7$ in GaAs 2DESs. The data provide evidence for developing QHSs of $^6$CFs at very small fillings. This is very surprising because $\kappa$ near $\nu \simeq 1/6$ in our sample is very large ($\simeq4$), and larger $\kappa$ has the tendency to favor Wigner crystal states over FQHSs at small fillings. Our data should inspire calculations that accurately incorporate $\kappa$ in competing many-body phases of $^6$CFs at extremely small fillings near $\nu=1/6$.</description>

      <title>Coulomb interactions in systems of generalized semi-Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions have strong effects in systems with flat bands. We examine the role of Coulomb interactions in two dimensional chiral anisotropic quasiparticles that disperse linearly in one direction and have relatively flat bands near the neutrality point in the other direction, dispersing with an arbitrary positive even power law $2n\geq 2$. As in the conventional semi-Dirac case ($n = 1$), we show using renormalization group that strong logarithmic divergences in the self-energy of generalized semi-Dirac fermions resum and lead to a restoration of the linearity of the spectrum for arbitrary n over a sizable energy window in the perturbative regime. We discuss those results in light of previous non-perturbative large $N_f$ results and address the implications for physical observables.</description>

      <title>CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$: A topochemically prepared 3$d^7$ honeycomb Kitaev magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetic properties of CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ as a Kitaev candidate. CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ was synthesized through a topochemical process, wherein all Na$^+$ ions in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ were replaced with half the amount of Ca$^{2+}$ ions. This substitution brings the CoO$_6$ octahedra closer to an approximate cubic symmetry. CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N \sim 13$ K, which is lower than $\sim$ 27 K observed for Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. Notably, its magnetic order is suppressed in a relatively low magnetic field of approximately 4 T, indicating that non-Kitaev interactions can be restrained by reducing trigonal distortion. Our findings highlight the potential of CaCo$_2$TeO$_6$ as a viable platform for exploring Kitaev quantum spin liquids and pave the way for a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms in Kitaev physics.</description>

      <title>Bosonization and correlators of the one-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simple derivation of the Luttinger liquid relation for the 1D Hubbard model both for finite $U$ and in the $U=\infty$ limit. We describe the simple solution of the Hubbard model in the infinite repulsion limit and use it to calculate the correlators of the model in this limit in a simple and a physical way using the Bosonization technique. We then calculate the asymptotics of the correlators of the model at arbitrary $U$ through the single parameter, which can be calculated from the Bethe Ansatz solution. Our derivation of the critical exponents is simple and allows one to express different physical operators of the Hubbard model through the charge and spin Bose fields in a direct and a physically transparent way.</description>

      <title>Colossal magnetoresistance from spin-polarized polarons in an Ising system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments suggest a new paradigm towards novel colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) in a family of materials EuM$_2$X$_2$(M=Cd, In, Zn; X=P, As), distinct from the traditional avenues involving Kondo-RKKY crossovers, magnetic phase transitions with structural distortions, or topological phase transitions. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore their origin, particularly focusing on EuCd$_2$P$_2$. While the low-energy spectral weight royally tracks that of the resistivity anomaly near the temperature with maximum magnetoresistance (T$_{MR}$) as expected from transport-spectroscopy correspondence, the spectra are completely incoherent and strongly suppressed with no hint of a Landau quasiparticle. Using systematic material and temperature dependence investigation complemented by theory, we attribute this non-quasiparticle caricature to the strong presence of entangled magnetic and lattice interactions, a characteristic enabled by the $p$-$f$ mixing. Given the known presence of ferromagnetic clusters, this naturally points to the origin of CMR being the scattering of spin-polarized polarons at the boundaries of ferromagnetic clusters. These results are not only illuminating to investigate the strong correlations and topology in EuCd$_2$X$_2$ family, but, in a broader view, exemplify how multiple cooperative interactions can give rise to extraordinary behaviors in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations in the noncentrosymmetric magnet Sr2MnSi2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic excitations in the noncentrosymmetric magnet Sr$_2$MnSi$_2$O$_7$ were investigated through inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Major magnetic excitations are limited up to the energy transfer of 0.5 meV, and two magnon branches under zero magnetic field were well explained in the framework of linear spin-wave theory. The magnitudes of the square-lattice in-plane and inter-plane nearest-neighbor interactions, spin anisotropy term, and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction are respectively estimated to be $J_1=45.54(5)$ $\mu$eV, $J_2=0.52(1)$ $\mu$eV, $\Lambda=4.98(11)$ $\mu$eV, $D_{xy}=0.02(9)$ $\mu$eV, and $D_z=4.10(1)$ $\mu$eV, and calculations using these parameters reproduce experimental data quite well. Sr$_2$MnSi$_2$O$_7$ appears to have the smallest energy scale among the melilite-type compounds, and the small $J_2/J_1=0.0114(2)$ indicates the sufficient two-dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Exact volume-law entangled eigenstates in a large class of spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact solutions for excited states in non-integrable quantum Hamiltonians have revealed novel dynamical phenomena that can occur in quantum many-body systems. This work proposes a method to analytically construct a specific set of volume-law-entangled exact excited eigenstates in a large class of spin Hamiltonians. In particular, we show that all spin chains that satisfy a simple set of conditions host exact volume-law eigenstates in the middle of their spectra. Examples of physically relevant spin chains of this type include the transverse-field Ising model, PXP model, spin-$S$ $XY$ model, and spin-$S$ Kitaev chain. Although these eigenstates are highly atypical in their structure, they are thermal with respect to local observables. Our framework also unifies many recent constructions of volume-law entangled eigenstates in the literature. Finally, we show that a similar construction also generalizes to spin models on graphs in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Pomeranchuk instability from electronic correlations in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among many-body instabilities in correlated quantum systems, electronic nematicity, defined by the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry, has emerged as a critical phenomenon, particularly within high-temperature superconductors. Recently, this behavior has been identified in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, a member of the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) kagome family, recognized for its intricate and unconventional quantum phases. Despite accumulating indirect evidence, the fundamental mechanisms driving nematicity in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ remain inadequately understood, sparking ongoing debates. In this study, we employ polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to reveal definitive signatures of an orbital-selective nematic deformation in the electronic structure of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. This direct experimental evidence underscores the pivotal role of orbital degrees of freedom in symmetry breaking, providing new insights into the complex electronic environment. By applying the functional renormalization group technique to a fully interacting ab initio model, we demonstrate the emergence of a finite angular momentum ($d$-wave) Pomeranchuk instability in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$, driven by the concomitant action of electronic correlations within specific orbital channels and chemical potential detuning away from Van Hove singularities. By elucidating the connection between orbital correlations and symmetry-breaking instabilities, this work lays a crucial foundation for future investigations into the broader role of orbital selectivity in quantum materials, with far-reaching implications for the design and manipulation of novel electronic phases.</description>

      <title>Two-particle calculations with quantics tensor trains -- solving the parquet equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first application of quantics tensor trains (QTTs) and tensor cross interpolation (TCI) to the solution of a full set of self-consistent equations for multivariate functions, the so-called parquet equations. We show that the steps needed to evaluate the equations (Bethe-Salpeter equations, parquet equation and Schwinger-Dyson equation) can be decomposed into basic operations on the QTT-TCI (QTCI) compressed objects. The repeated application of these operations does not lead to the loss of accuracy beyond a specified tolerance and the iterative scheme converges even for numerically demanding parameters. As examples we take the Hubbard model in the atomic limit and the single impurity Anderson model, where the basic objects in parquet equations, the two-particle vertices, depend on three frequencies, but not on momenta. The results show that this approach is able to overcome major computational bottlenecks of standard numerical methods. The applied methods allow for an exponential increase of the number of grid points included in the calculations leading to an exponentially improving computational error for a linear increase in computational cost.</description>

      <title>Magnetic precursor to the structural phase transition in V$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between structural, electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom across the metal-insulator transition in V2O3 makes it hard to determine the main driving mechanism behind the transition. Specifically, the role of magnetism has been debated and its interplay with the other transitions has not been established. To address this issue, we use a combination of muon spin relaxation/rotation, electrical transport and reciprocal space mapping which allows to correlate magnetic, electronic and structural degrees of freedom in strain-engineered V2O3 thin films. Evidence is found for a magnetic instability in the vicinity of the structural transition. This is manifested as a decrease in the antiferromagnetic moment with temperature leading to a virtual N\'eel transition temperature which coincides with that of the structural and electronic transitions. Moreover, we find evidence for an onset of antiferromagnetic (AF) fluctuations in the rhombohedral phase even without a structural transition to the monoclinic phase. The non-congruence of the structural and magnetic transitions increases as the transition temperature is reduced by strain. In samples where the transition is most strongly suppressed by strain, a depth-dependent magnetic state is observed. These results reveal the importance of an AF instability in the paramagnetic phase in triggering the metal-insulator transition and the crucial role of the structural transition in allowing for the formation of an ordered AF state.</description>

      <title>Dispersion kinks from electronic correlations in an unconventional iron-based superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attractive interaction in conventional BCS superconductors is provided by a bosonic mode. However, the pairing glue of most unconventional superconductors is unknown. The effect of electron-boson coupling is therefore extensively studied in these materials. A key signature are dispersion kinks that can be observed in the spectral function as abrupt changes in velocity and lifetime of quasiparticles. Here, we show the existence of two kinks in the unconventional iron-based superconductor RbFe$_2$As$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). In addition, we observe the formation of a Hubbard band multiplet due to the combination of Coulomb interaction and Hund's rule coupling in this multiorbital systems. We demonstrate that the two dispersion kinks are a consequence of these strong many-body interactions. This interpretation is in line with a growing number of theoretical predictions for kinks in various general models of correlated materials. Our results provide a unifying link between iron-based superconductors and different classes of correlated, unconventional superconductors such as cuprates and heavy-fermion materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetic and electronic inhomogeneity in Sm$_{1-x}$Eu$_x$B$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While SmB$_6$ attracts attention as a possible topological Kondo insulator, EuB$_6$ is known to host magnetic polarons that give rise to large magnetoresistive effects above its ferromagnetic order transition. Here we investigate single crystals of Sm$_{1-x}$Eu$_x$B$_6$ by magnetic and magnetotransport measurements to explore a possible interplay of these two intriguing phenomena, with focus on the Eu-rich substitutions. Sm$_{0.01}$Eu$_{0.99}$B$_6$ exhibits generally similar behavior as EuB$_6$. Interestingly, Sm$_{0.05}$Eu$_{0.95}$B$_6$ combines global antiferromagnetic order with local polaron formation. A pronounced hysteresis is found in the magnetoresistance of Sm$_{0.1}$Eu$_{0.9}$B$_6$ at low temperature ($T=$ 1.9 K) and applied magnetic fields between 2.3 $-$ 3.6 T. The latter is in agreement with a phenomenological model that predicts the stabilization of ferromagnetic polarons with increasing magnetic field within materials with global antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiment on MoTe$_2$-WTe$_2$ twisted bi-layer demonstrated physics of Kane-Mele (KM) as well as Haldane models. Although topological properties of KM model has been studied extensively, effects of interaction are still less explored beyond half filling. In this work we study the effect of Hubbard interaction in KM model at small hole doping around half filling. We use density matrix renormalization group method to characterize different phase of cylinders with width of $L_y=3$ unit cells. We identify {a possible} superconducting (SC) phase and transition at different strength of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and show the strong dependence of critical interaction for SC transition. We also calculate the single-particle Green's function, spin-spin and density-density correlations and compare with SC correlation to establish the dominance of SC correlations. Our result highlights striking behaviour of SC transition and its dependence on SOC which could be useful in understanding different ways to achieve unconventional SC.</description>

      <title>Symmetry controlled single spin cycloid switching in multiferroic BiFeO3</title>

Abstract: The single variant spin cycloid and associated antiferromagnetic order in multiferroic BiFeO3 can provide a direct and predictable magnetoelectric coupling to ferroelectric order for deterministic switching, and also a key to fundamental understanding of spin transport and magnon-based applications in the system. (111) oriented BiFeO3 supplies an easy magnetic plane for the spin cycloid, but despite previous efforts, achieving deterministic switching of the single spin cycloid over multiple cycles remains challenging due to the presence of multiple spin cycloid domains in the (111) plane. Here we show that anisotropic in-plane strain engineering can stabilize a single antiferromagnetic domain and provide robust, deterministic switching. We grow BiFeO3 on orthorhombic NdGaO3 (011)o [(111)pc] substrates, breaking the spin cycloid degeneracy and by imposing a uniaxial strain in the (111) plane. This stabilization is confirmed through direct imaging with scanning NV microscopy and non-resonant X-ray diffraction. Remarkably, we achieved deterministic and non-volatile 180{\deg} switching of ferroelectric and associated antiferromagnetic domains over 1,000 cycles, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Our findings underscore that anisotropic strain engineering opens up exciting possibilities for (111)pc monodomain BiFeO3 in potential magnetoelectric and emerging magnonic applications.</description>

      <title>Morphogenesis of Spin Cycloids in a Non-collinear Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pattern formation in spin systems with continuous-rotational symmetry (CRS) provides a powerful platform to study emergent complex magnetic phases and topological defects in condensed-matter physics. However, its understanding and correlation with unconventional magnetic order along with high-resolution nanoscale imaging is challenging. Here, we employ scanning NV magnetometry to unveil the morphogenesis of spin cycloids at both the local and global scales within a single ferroelectric domain of (111)-oriented BiFeO$_3$ (which is a non-collinear antiferromagnet), resulting in formation of a glassy labyrinthine pattern. We find that the domains of locally oriented cycloids are interconnected by an array of topological defects and exhibit isotropic energy landscape predicted by first-principles calculations. We propose that the CRS of spin-cycloid propagation directions within the (111) drives the formation of the labyrinthine pattern and the associated topological defects such as antiferromagnetic skyrmions. Unexpectedly, reversing the as-grown ferroelectric polarization from [$\bar{1}$$\bar{1}$$\bar{1}$] to [111] induces a magnetic phase transition, destroying the labyrinthine pattern and producing a deterministic non-volatile non cycloidal, uniformly magnetized state. These findings highlight that (111)-oriented BiFeO$_3$ is not only important for studying the fascinating subject of pattern formation but could also be utilized as an ideal platform for integrating novel topological defects in the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Scaling of diffusion constants in perturbed easy-axis Heisenberg spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of the integrable spin-1/2 XXZ chain has witnessed substantial progress, due to the development and application of sophisticated analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, infinite-temperature magnetization transport has turned out to range from ballistic, over superdiffusive, to diffusive behavior in different parameter regimes of the anisotropy. Since integrability is rather the exception than the rule, a crucial question is the change of transport under integrability-breaking perturbations. This question includes the stability of superdiffusion at the isotropic point and the change of diffusion constants in the easy-axis regime. In our work, we study this change of diffusion constants by a variety of methods and cover both, linear response theory in the closed system and the Lindblad equation in the open system, where we throughout focus on periodic boundary conditions. In the closed system, we compare results from the recursion method to calculations for finite systems and find evidence for a continuous change of diffusion constants over the full range of perturbation strengths. In the open system weakly coupled to baths, we find diffusion constants in quantitative agreement with the ones in the closed system in a range of nonweak perturbations, but disagreement in the limit of weak perturbations. Using a simple model in this limit, we point out the possibility of a diverging diffusion constant in such an open system.</description>

      <title>Universal crossover in surface superconductivity: Impact of varying Debye energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, interference-induced surface superconductivity (SC) has been predicted within an attractive Hubbard model with $s$-wave pairing, prompting intensive studies of its properties. The most notable finding is that the surface critical temperature $T_{cs}$ can be significantly enhanced relative to the bulk critical temperature $T_{cb}$. In this work, considering a $1D$ attractive Hubbard model for the half-filling level, we investigate how this enhancement is affected by variations in the Debye energy $\hbar\omega_D$, which controls the number of states contributing to the pair potential and, in turn, influences the critical temperature. Our study reveals a universal crossover of the surface SC from the weak- to strong-coupling regime, regardless of the specific value of the Debye energy. The location of this crossover is marked by the maximum of $\tau = (T_{cs} - T_{cb})/T_{cb}$, which depends strongly on $\hbar\omega_D$. At its maximum, $\tau$ can increase up to nearly $70\%$. Additionally, we examine the evolution of the ratio $\Delta_{s0}/k_B T_{cs}$ along the crossover, where $\Delta_{s0}$ is the zero-temperature pair potential near the surface (the chain ends), and demonstrate that this ratio can significantly deviate from $\Delta_{b0}/k_B T_{cb}$, where $\Delta_{b0}$ is the zero-temperature bulk pair potential (in the chain center). Our findings may offer valuable insights into the search for higher critical temperatures in narrow-band superconductors.</description>

      <title>Exact renormalization group flow for matrix product density operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix product density operator (MPDO) provides an efficient tensor network representation of mixed states on one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. We study a real-space renormalization group transformation of MPDOs represented by a circuit of local quantum channels. We require that the renormalization group flow is exact, in the sense that it exactly preserves the correlation between the coarse-grained sites and is therefore invertible by another circuit of local quantum channels. Unlike matrix product states (MPS), which always have a well-defined isometric renormalization transformation, we show that general MPDOs do not necessarily admit a converging exact renormalization group flow. We then introduce a subclass of MPDOs with a well-defined renormalization group flow, and show the structure of the MPDOs in the subclass as a representation of a pre-bialgebra structure. As a result, such MPDOs obey generalized symmetry represented by matrix product operator algebras associated with the pre-bialgebra. We also discuss implications with the classification of mixed-state quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of superconductivity and sliding polar metal state in HgPSe3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simultaneous presence of polarity and metallicity in a material signifies an exotic polar metal state, but such materials are extremely rare, especially in bulk form, due to mutually exclusive nature of the fundamental defining properties. Here, we report experimental findings that HgPSe3 is a robust bulk polar metal at room temperature with a chiral structure stabilized by pressure and, remarkably, this polar metal hosts superconductivity with critical temperature Tc up to 11 K. Theoretical analysis reveals a two-step interlayer sliding-then-compressing mechanism for coexistence of polarity and metallicity in HgPSe3. This work unveils a new paradigm for creating the bulk polar metal state and simultaneous presence of coexisting quantum orders, raising the prospect of discovering novel emergent physics using pressure as a tuning knob.</description>

Abstract: The development of future quantum devices requires understanding the dynamics of driven many-body systems, in which the Floquet-induced interactions play a central role. This understanding is crucial for coherently controlling quantum states, minimising errors, and benchmarking the performance of these devices. In this thesis, we analyse the enhancement on the Floquet-induced interactions by many-body correlations, and develop an advanced Floquet method to understand the Floquet-induced interactions relevant for future quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation of dynamical electronic response functions in Bethe-Salpeter, (screened) Hartree-Fock, Hybrid-DFT approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the large class of systems described via a time-dependent self-consistent mean field Hamiltonian including (screened) Hartree-Fock exchange, we demonstrate that any electronic linear response function allows for a formulation which is variational in the electronic density matrix. To achieve our goal, we consider the usual form of a response function, written in terms of a screened and a bare electronic vertices (`bare-screen'), and perform an exact rewriting in terms of purely screened electronic vertices (`screen-screen'). Within the `screen-screen' formulation, the response function can be written as a stationary point of a functional of the exact density matrix. Further, we show that the imaginary part of any electronic response can be written in the form of a generalized Fermi Golden Rule, by introducing an exact complementary rewriting in terms of vertices related by complex conjugation (`screen*-screen'). The proposed approach encompasses different levels of linear response theory, such as time-dependent DFT with hybrid functionals, time-dipendent Hartree-Fock, and the Bethe-Salpeter Equation with the frequency independent approximation of the screened interaction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our formalism by calculating the optical conductivity of graphene, which exhibits strong excitonic effects, using a tight-binding model including exchange effects in the response. Our findings show the advantages of the variationality of the screen-screen formulation over the others both in convergence properties and robustness with density-matrix approximations.</description>

      <title>Generalized many-body perturbation theory for the electron correlation energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) using a quadratic zeroth-order Hamiltonian is a cornerstone of many \emph{ab initio} computational methods for molecules and materials. However, this perturbation expansion can break down in the presence of strong electron correlation, which occurs in many scenarios such as the bond dissociation of molecules in chemical reactions. In this work, we developed a generalized (time-dependent) MBPT for computing electron correlation energies, in which the zeroth-order Hamiltonian can be interacting and hence the zeroth-order reference state is a multi-determinant wavefunction instead of a single Slater determinant in general. This allows us to take strong correlation into account from the outset and treat the residual weak interaction by diagrammatic perturbation expansion. Using this framework, we formulated a multi-reference (MR) generalization of the standard single-reference (SR) random phase approximation (RPA) for the electron correlation energy by resumming generalized ring diagrams including cumulant contributions, which naturally leads to a set of unified equations that work in both SR and MR cases. To further include exchange effects, we also derived a multi-reference second-order screened exchange (SOSEX) correction from a coupled-cluster perspective of the resulting MR-RPA. Applications to prototypical molecules demonstrate that MR-RPA/SOSEX successfully resolves the well-known failure of the conventional SR-RPA/SOSEX for molecular dissociation. Our work bridges MBPT in condensed matter physics and multi-reference perturbation theory in quantum chemistry, opening up new possibilities for advancing computational methods for the electron correlation energy via diagrammatic resummation.</description>

      <title>When can classical neural networks represent quantum states?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A naive classical representation of an n-qubit state requires specifying exponentially many amplitudes in the computational basis. Past works have demonstrated that classical neural networks can succinctly express these amplitudes for many physically relevant states, leading to computationally powerful representations known as neural quantum states. What underpins the efficacy of such representations? We show that conditional correlations present in the measurement distribution of quantum states control the performance of their neural representations. Such conditional correlations are basis dependent, arise due to measurement-induced entanglement, and reveal features not accessible through conventional few-body correlations often examined in studies of phases of matter. By combining theoretical and numerical analysis, we demonstrate how the state's entanglement and sign structure, along with the choice of measurement basis, give rise to distinct patterns of short- or long-range conditional correlations. Our findings provide a rigorous framework for exploring the expressive power of neural quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unusual magnetoelectric transport present in Weyl semimetals can be compactly understood as manifestations of an underlying axion field, which itself is determined by the microscopic band structure. The axion couples nonlinearly to electric and magnetic fields and possesses a signature topological magnetoelectric response, leading to a modified form of Maxwell's equations known as axion electrodynamics. Axions are naturally present in Weyl semimetals relating to the separation of the Weyl nodes in energy and in crystal momentum. In the presence of strong interactions, charge density-wave (CDW) order may develop which serves to gap the Weyl nodes and introduces corresponding collective excitations. When the inherent chiral symmetry of Weyl semimetals is spontaneously broken by the formation of CDW order, the resultant chiral condensate is endowed with intrinsic dynamics which yields a dynamical contribution to the axion field. However, unambiguous identification of this dynamical axion mode is challenging due to its inherent nonlinear coupling to electromagnetic fields. Therefore, we propose an all-optical protocol for verifying and characterizing dynamical axion collective modes in Weyl semimetals with CDW order. First, we show that axion collective mode can be excited using two-photon excitation schemes. Following excitation, the collective axion oscillations are then diagnosed by measuring the time-resolved Kerr rotation. Our results demonstrate a pathway towards utilizing multi-photon and entangled pair spectroscopies to identify new correlated phases in quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation of a two-magnon bound state in a spin-one triangular lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ordered magnets, the elementary excitations are spin waves (magnons), which obey Bose-Einstein statistics. Similarly to Cooper pairs in superconductors, magnons can be paired into bound states under attractive interactions. The Zeeman coupling to a magnetic field is able to tune the particle density through a quantum critical point (QCP), beyond which a "hidden order" is predicted to exist. Here we report direct observation of the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of the two-magnon bound state in Na$_2$BaNi(PO$_4$)$_2$. Comprehensive thermodynamic measurements confirmed the two-dimensional BEC-QCP at the saturation field. Inelastic neutron scattering experiments were performed to establish the microscopic model. An exact solution revealed stable 2-magnon bound states that were further confirmed by electron spin resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, demonstrating that the QCP is due to the pair condensation and the phase below saturation field is likely the long-sought-after spin nematic phase.</description>

      <title>Entropy and de Haas-van Alphen oscillations of a three-dimensional marginal Fermi liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study de Haas-van Alphen oscillations in a marginal Fermi liquid resulting from a three-dimensional metal tuned to a quantum-critical point (QCP). We show that the conventional approach based on extensions of the Lifshitz-Kosevich formula for the oscillation amplitudes becomes inapplicable when the correlation length exceeds the cyclotron radius. This breakdown is due to (i) non-analytic finite-temperature contributions to the fermion self-energy (ii) an enhancement of the oscillatory part of the self-energy by quantum fluctuations, and (iii) non-trivial dynamical scaling laws associated with the quantum critical point. We properly incorporate these effects within the Luttinger-Ward-Eliashberg framework for the thermodynamic potential by treating the fermionic and bosonic contributions on equal footing. As a result, we obtain the modified expressions for the oscillations of entropy and magnetization that remain valid in the non-Fermi liquid regime.</description>

      <title>Magnetic response and antiferromagnetic correlations in strained kagome ribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the physics of the strong-coupling Hubbard model in a kagome lattice ribbon under mechanical tension and half-filling. It is known that in the absence of strain, the lattice symmetry of the system and strong electronic interactions induce magnetic frustration. As uniaxial strain is applied, the ribbon exhibits various configurations with energy oscillations that depend on the direction of the strain axis. The ground states are obtained by density-matrix renormalization-group calculations. We find that the system is characterized by strong antiferromagnetic bonds distributed throughout the lattice in directions and patterns that depend on strain directions and may coexist with easily polarizable sites that are only weakly correlated to their neighbors. We identify frustration and correlation measures that follow the strain and interaction dependence of the system well. These results illustrate that strain-dependent magnetic susceptibility could be explored experimentally to help probe the role of symmetry and interactions in these systems.</description>

      <title>Vortex structure in a $d$-wave superconductor obtained by a confinement transition from the pseudogap metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the structure of flux $h/(2e)$ vortices in a d-wave superconductor which emerges from a higher temperature pseudogap metal. Such a transition is described by a continuum theory of the Higgs condensation of 2 flavors of charge $e$ bosons which are fundamentals of an emergent SU(2) gauge field. Period-2 charge order is present near the vortex center. Upon coupling the electrons to the superconducting and charge order parameters, we find that the electronic local density of states does not have a zero-bias peak, in contrast to BCS theory. But there are sub-gap peaks at positive and negative bias, and these exhibit anti-phase periodic spatial modulations, similar to observations in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments in the underdoped cuprates (K. Matsuba et al., J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 76, 063704 (2007)).</description>

      <title>Entanglement renormalization of fractonic anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gapped fracton phases constitute a new class of quantum states of matter which connects to topological orders but does not fit easily into existing paradigms. They host unconventional features such as sub-extensive and robust ground state degeneracies as well as sensitivity to lattice geometry. We investigate the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian model [1] which can describe a family of fracton phases defined on arbitrary graphs. Focusing on representative geometries where the 3D lattices are extensions of 2D square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices into the third dimension, we study their ground state degeneracies and mobility of excitations, and examine their entanglement renormalization group (ERG) flows. All models show bifurcating behaviors under ERG but have distinct ERG flows sensitive to both $N$ and lattice geometry. In particular, we show that the anisotropic $\mathbb{Z}_N$ Laplacian models defined on the extensions of triangular and honeycomb lattices are equivalent when $N$ is coprime to $3$. We also point out that, in contrast to previous expectations, the model defined on the extension of Kagome lattice is robust against local perturbations if and only if $N$ is coprime to $6$.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a semidefinite relaxation method called Hamiltonian bootstrap which finds lower bounds to the ground state energy of a quantum Hamiltonian subject to Hermitian linear constraints, along with approximations of the corresponding ground state correlation functions. We show that symmetry can be used to significantly reduce both the memory and time requirements, and we include unitary, antiunitary, discrete, and continuous symmetries in our analysis. We demonstrate Hamiltonian bootstrap using the 1D Hubbard model and find quantitative agreement with both exact diagonalization and the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Reweight-annealing method for evaluating the partition function via quantum Monte Carlo calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08642v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate algorithm for partition function, free energy and thermal entropy calculations is of great significance in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics. Here we present an unbiased but low-technical-barrier algorithm within the quantum Monte Carlo framework, which has exceptionally high accuracy and no systemic error. Compared with the conventional specific heat integral method and Wang-Landau sampling algorithm, our method can obtain a much more accurate result of the sub-leading coefficient of the entropy. This method can be widely used in both classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations and is easy to be parallelized on computer.</description>

      <title>Quest for nuclear quadrupole relaxation in HgCa$_{2}$Ba$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derived a simple reduced form from the exact solution of the mixed magnetic and quadrupolar nuclear spin--lattice relaxation function at the central transition line of a quadrupole-split NMR spectrum for the nuclear spin $I$ = 3/2. The reduced form of the exact solution could be extended to include inhomogeneous relaxation effects. From the application of the reduced form to the $^{63}$Cu nuclear spin--lattice relaxation curves in the high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductors of $^{63}$Cu-enriched triple-layer HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$, we estimated the predominant magnetic relaxation rate $^{63}W_M$ and the upper limit of a weak nuclear electric quadrupole spin--lattice relaxation rate $^{63}W_Q$.</description>
