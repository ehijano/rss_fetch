      <title>The Unitarity Flow Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the broad architecture of the renormalization group flow in quantum field theories is, at least in part, fixed by unitarity. The precise statement is summarized in the Unitarity Flow Conjecture, which states that the non-linear $S$-matrix identities obtained by imposing unitarity imply those needed to derive the renormalization group equations. As a proof of principle, we verify this conjecture to all loops at the leading and subleading logarithmic order in the four-dimensional massless $\lambda\phi^4$ theory using on-shell techniques, without reference to any counterterms or Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>$\lambda\phi^4$ as an Effective Theory in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theories (EFTs) provide a powerful framework to parametrise unknown aspects of possible ultraviolet (UV) physics. For scalar fields in de Sitter space, however, new emergent phenomena can arise when the cut-off scale of the theory lies below the horizon scale $H$, as seen in the stochastic formalism of inflation. In this work, we study EFTs that, at leading order, reproduce the standard quartic theory in de Sitter, but with a variable cut-off identified with the mass of an integrated-out hidden sector. We perform the complete analytic computation for the tree- and loop-level matching between the effective $\lambda\phi^4$ theory and two possible UV realisations. We find that when the cut-off is much larger than the horizon, the theory admits a unitary description, up to exponentially suppressed corrections. In contrast, when the cut-off is lowered below $H$, the system evolves into a mixed state and diffusive effects emerge. Nevertheless, at leading order, the EFT remains local and reproduces the same effective quartic coefficient as in the unitary regime. Furthermore, for the EFT matching at the loop-level, the effective quartic coupling changes sign and becomes negative as the cut-off decreases, in agreement with the result obtained from the stochastic formalism. In general, for cosmological EFTs, our findings highlight the role of non-unitary effects and illustrate their regimes of validity, within and beyond perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Hadamard tails from flat-space perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The short-distance singular structure of the two-point function of a free scalar field in curved spacetime has a universal behavior that characterizes well-behaved states (called Hadamard states). This includes a non-analytic term proportional to the Ricci scalar curvature known as the Hadamard tail. This is usually derived by solving a differential equation for the Green's function of a Klein-Gordon field in curved spacetime. We present an alternative derivation which leverages the equivalence principles and makes use of perturbative field theory methods. This allows for the computation of the short-distance singular behavior of correlators of QFTs in curved space, including for interacting field theories, where the traditional Green's function strategy cannot be easily generalized. As an example, we apply these ideas to the two-point function of two scalar primary operators of an arbitrary Conformal Field Theory placed in an arbitrary curved background.</description>

      <title>The dark dimension, proton decay, and the length of the M-theory interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a large extra dimension in which only gravity propagates would have spectacular consequences for cosmology and laboratory experiments. In the strong coupling limit of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string theory, the gauge and matter fields live at the end of the eleventh dimension, which becomes a natural candidate for a micron-size \textit{dark dimension}. In this work, however, we show that the length of the M-theory interval is severely constrained by proton decay searches. Our results indicate that in such constructions the size of the eleventh dimension is $R\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-28})$ meters.</description>

      <title>The Semi-Classical Limit of Quantum Gravity on Corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum and classical systems defined by the quantum corner symmetry group $QCS = \widetilde{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \ltimes H_3$, which arises in the context of quantum gravity. In particular, we relate the quantum observables, defined by representation-theoretic data, to their classical counterparts through generalized Perelomov coherent states and the framework of Berezin quantization. The resulting procedure provides a mathematically well-defined notion of the semi-classical limit of quantum gravity, viewed as the representation theory of the corner symmetry group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we introduce some concepts of Species Quantum Mechanics. Specifically, we consider quantum operators that correspond to the species number $N_s$ and the tower mass scale $m_t$ in the context of the swampland distance conjecture. We discuss the commutation relations, a possible wave function, and symplectic duality transformations on the conjugate variables. Furthermore, we argue that the Castellano-Ruiz-Valenzuela (CRV) pattern is a consequence of the canonical commutation rules of moduli space quantum mechanics. We also connect the canonical quantization to the periods of ${\cal N}=2$ Calabi-Yau compactifications to explore other aspects of the CRV pattern, including its possible connection to the Ooguri-Vafa-Verlinde black hole quantization procedure.</description>

      <title>From the Corner Proposal to the Area Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an explicit realization of the Corner Proposal for Quantum Gravity in the case of spherically symmetric spacetimes in four dimensions, or equivalently, two-dimensional dilaton gravity. We construct coherent states of the Quantum Corner Symmetry group and compute the entanglement entropy relative to these states. We derive the classical corner charges and relate them to operator expectation values in coherent states. For a subset of coherent states that we call classical states, we find that the entanglement entropy exhibits a leading term proportional to the area, recovering the Bekenstein-Hawking area law in the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation from the double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity and gauge theory are concretely linked by the double copy. Although well-studied at the level of perturbative scattering in vacuum, far less is known about non-perturbative aspects or extensions of the double copy beyond trivial backgrounds. We show here how Hawking radiation in a collapse metric, its associated thermal spectrum, and horizon-dependence, emerges from the double copy of particle production in a background gauge field, where there is no global horizon, nor a thermal spectrum. Our approach combines worldline and amplitudes methods, and allows the unification of several classical and quantum double copy prescriptions for black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an electromagnetic system which is related to black hole production with Hawking radiation through the double copy. We consider the scattering of a massless scalar particle through a collapsing electromagnetic background -- the single copy of Vaidya -- and identify the Feynman diagrams that exponentiate in the geometric-optics limit. The Bogoliubov coefficients obtained from the diagrammatic approach are reproduced by a semiclassical ray-tracing computation of null rays in this same background. We discuss the thermodynamic interpretation of the resulting number distribution in light of the double copy.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the resolution of spacetime singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What happens at spacetime singularities is poorly understood. The Penrose-Wall singularity theorem constrains possible scenarios, but until recently its key assumption--the generalized second law (GSL)--had only been proven perturbatively, severely limiting this application. We highlight that recent progress enables a proof of the GSL in holographic brane-world models, valid non-perturbatively at the species scale $cG$ (with $c$ the number of matter fields and $G$ Newton's constant). This enables genuine constraints: an outer-trapped surface in the Einstein gravity regime implies geodesic incompleteness non-perturbatively at the species scale. Conversely, any genuine resolution must evade Penrose's criteria. We illustrate both possibilities with explicit examples: the classical BTZ black hole evolves to a more severe singularity, while a null singularity on the Rindler horizon is resolved, both by species-scale effects. Subject to the GSL, these constraints on singularity resolution apply beyond brane-worlds: namely, in any theory with a geometric UV scale--roughly, where the metric remains well-defined but classical Einstein gravity breaks down.</description>

      <title>Equivalent class of Emergent Single Weyl Fermion in 3d Topological States: gapless superconductors and superfluids Vs chiral fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we put forward a practical but generic approach towards constructing a large family of $(3+1)$ dimension lattice models which can naturally lead to a single Weyl cone in the infrared (IR) limit. Our proposal relies on spontaneous charge $U(1)$ symmetry breaking to evade the usual no-go theorem of a single Weyl cone in a 3d lattice. We have explored three concrete paths in this approach, all involving fermionic topological symmetry protected states (SPTs). Path a) is to push a gapped SPT in a 3d lattice with time-reversal symmetry (or $T$-symmetry) to a gapless topological quantum critical point (tQCP) which involves a minimum change of topologies,i.e. $\delta N_w=2$ where $\delta N_w$ is the change of winding numbers across the tQCP. Path b) is to peal off excessive degrees of freedom in the gapped SPT via applying $T$-symmetry breaking fields which naturally result in a pair of gapless nodal points of real fermions. Path c) is a hybrid of a) and b) where tQCPs, with $\delta N_w \geq 2$, are further subject to time-reversal-symmetry breaking actions. In the infrared limit, all the lattice models with single Weyl fermions studied here are isomorphic to either a tQCP in a DIII class topological superconductor with a protecting $T$-symmetry, or its dual, a $T$-symmetry breaking superconducting nodal point phase, and therefore form an equivalent class. For a generic $T$-symmetric tQCP along Path a), the conserved-charge operators span a six-dimensional linear space while for a $T$-symmetry breaking gapless state along Path b), c), charge operators typically span a two-dimensional linear space instead. Finally, we pinpoint connections between three spatial dimensional lattice chiral fermion models and gapless real fermions that can naturally appear in superfluids or superconductors studied previously.</description>

      <title>Josephson's effect in the Schwarzschild background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fully covariant, analytic framework for Josephson phenomena in static curved spacetimes and specialize it to the Schwarzschild exterior. The formulation rests on two invariant elements: the gauge-invariant condensate momentum that governs phase dynamics and the conserved current whose hypersurface flux encodes transport for an observer at infinity. Using the timelike Killing field to relate proper and asymptotic quantities, we derive a redshifted AC Josephson law in which the asymptotic phase-evolution rate is proportional to the difference of redshifted voltage drops, i.e. to $V_i^\infty \equiv \alpha_i V_i^{\rm proper}$; equivalently, it depends on $\alpha_i V_i^{\rm proper}$ for local control. Under RF drive specified at infinity, the Shapiro-step loci are invariant (expressed in asymptotic voltages) while propagation phases set any apparent lobe translation. For DC transport, a short-junction solution on a static slice yields the proper current-phase relation; mapping to asymptotic observables gives a single-power redshift scaling of critical currents, $I_{c,\infty}\propto \alpha I_c^{\rm proper}$, whereas power scales as $P_\infty\propto \alpha^2 P_{\rm proper}$. In a "vertical" dc-SQUID with junctions at different radii, gravity does not shift the DC interference pattern at linear order; it produces a small envelope deformation and an amplitude rescaling. Gravity does not alter the local Josephson microphysics; it reshapes the clocks and energy accounting that define measurements at infinity. The resulting predictions are gauge- and coordinate-invariant, operationally stated in terms of an experimenter who can control (proper vs. asymptotic bias), and remain analytic from the weak-field regime to the near-horizon limit.</description>

      <title>Curious QNEIs from QNEC: New Bounds on Null Energy in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive new families of quantum null energy inequalities (QNEIs), i.e. bounds on integrated null energy, in quantum field theories in two and higher dimensions. These are universal, state-independent lower bounds on semi-local integrals of $\langle T_{vv} \rangle$, the energy-momentum flux in a null direction, and the first of this kind for interacting theories in higher dimensions. Our ingredients include the quantum null energy condition (QNEC), strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropies, defect operator expansions, and the vacuum modular Hamiltonians of null intervals and strips. These results are fundamental constraints on null energy in quantum field theories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the cancellation of the ultraviolet cutoff scale $\Lambda_{\rm cut}$ in the calculation of the expectation value of the five-dimensional (5D) energy-momentum tensor $\langle T_{MN}\rangle$ ($M,N=0,1,\cdots,4$). Since 5D fields feel the background geometry differently depending on their spins, the bosonic and the fermionic contributions to the $\Lambda_{\rm cut}$-dependent part $\langle T_{MN}\rangle^{\rm UV}$ may have different profiles in the extra dimension. In that case, there is no chance for them to be cancelled with each other. We consider arbitrary numbers of scalar and spinor fields with arbitrary bulk masses, calculate $\langle T_{MN}\rangle$ using the 5D propagators, and clarify the dependence of $\langle T_{MN}\rangle^{\rm UV}$ on the extra-dimensional coordinate $y$ for a general background geometry of the extra dimension. We find that if the geometry is not flat nor (a slice of) anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, it is impossible to cancel $\langle T_{MN}\rangle^{\rm UV}$ between the bosonic and the fermionic contributions. This may suggest that the flat (or AdS) space is energetically favored over the other geometries, and thus the dynamics forces the compact space to be flat (or AdS).</description>

      <title>Double-soft limit and celestial shadow OPE from charge bracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dual formulations of an infinite tower of tree-level soft theorems in asymptotically flat spacetimes for scattering amplitudes in the standard energy-momentum basis and for correlators of a 2D celestial conformal field theory imply a correspondence between the celestial operator product expansion (OPE) and the higher spin charge bracket. We apply such correspondence to provide first a prescription to solve the double-soft limit ambiguity in the mixed-helicity sector of celestial OPEs. Furthermore, demanding the charge OPE/bracket correspondence to remain valid when operators are shadow transformed, we construct an algorithm to compute shadow celestial OPEs. We first test the algorithm by recovering results in the previous literature involving the celestial energy-momentum tensor; we then apply it to both gravity and Yang-Mills theory and generalize the OPE derivation to arbitrary spins.</description>

Abstract: This brief review surveys recent progress driven by the gauge/Yang-Baxter equation (YBE) correspondence. This connection has proven to be a powerful tool for discovering novel integrable lattice spin models in statistical mechanics by exploiting dualities in supersymmetric gauge theories. In recent years, research has demonstrated the use of dual gauge theories to construct new lattice spin models that are dual to Ising-like models.</description>

      <title>Localization and anomalous reference frames in gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the classical phase space for the gravitational degrees of freedom along a null ray. We construct gauge-invariant observables localized on a null ray segment that commute with those localized on the complement; thus, the phase space describes a genuine gravitational subsystem compatible with both locality and diffeomorphism invariance. Our construction employs 'dressing time' (a null time coordinate built from spin 0 gravitational degrees of freedom) as a dynamical reference frame. The existence of such a frame depends on the use of edge mode variables, which we argue are generally required to upgrade a local gauge-fixing condition to a global 'frame-fixing'. To analyze the effects of quantum diffeomorphism anomalies on these structures, we then establish an 'effective' classical description in which the Raychaudhuri equation, symplectic form, and edge mode variables all acquire Virasoro-type deformations. Within this framework, we identify three distinct diffeomorphism actions: reparametrizations (gauge transformations), reorientations (physical symmetries of the reference frame), and dressed reparametrizations. Each acquires its own central extension and plays a different crucial role in the effective theory. The resulting structures provide a foundation for quantizing gravitational null ray segments, including promoting dressing time to a genuine quantum reference frame.</description>

      <title>Close encounters with attractors of the third kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the existence of a hydrodynamic attractor in the Mueller-Israel-Stewart framework of a fluid living in the novel geometry discovered recently by Grozdanov. This geometry, corresponding to a hyperbolic slicing of dS$_3\times\mathbb{R}$, complements previous analyses of attractors in Bjorken (flat slicing) and Gubser (spherical slicing) flows. The fluid behaves like a sharply localized droplet propagating rapidly along the lightcone, reminiscent of wounded nuclei in the CGC picture. Typical solutions approach the hydrodynamic attractor rapidly at late times despite a Knudsen number exceeding unity, suggesting that the inverse Reynolds number captures hydrodynamization more faithfully since the shear stress vanishes at late times. This is in stark contrast to Gubser flow, which has both the Knudsen and inverse Reynolds number becoming small for intermediate times. We close with a comparison to Weyl-transformed Bjorken flow and discuss possible phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>On the degrees of freedom of spatially covariant vector field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of spatially covariant vector field theories on a flat background, where the Lagrangians are constructed as polynomials of first-order derivatives of the vector field. Because Lorentz and $\mathrm{U}(1)$ invariances are broken, such theories generally propagate three degrees of freedom (DOFs): two transverse modes and one longitudinal mode. We examine the conditions under which the additional longitudinal mode is eliminated so that only two DOFs remain. To this end, we perform a Hamiltonian constraint analysis and identify two necessary and sufficient degeneracy conditions that reduce the number of DOFs from three to two. We find three classes of solutions satisfying these degeneracy conditions, corresponding to distinct types of theories. Type-I theories possess one first-class and two second-class constraints, type-II theories have four second-class constraints, and type-III theories contain two first-class constraints. The Maxwell theory is recovered as a special case of the type-III theories, where Lorentz symmetry is restored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the ladder operators for static tidal perturbations to higher-dimensional black holes. These operators map between solutions of the relevant equation of motion at different multipole orders. We focus on spin 0, 1 and 2 perturbations to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole and on spin 0 perturbations to the 5D Myers-Perry black hole. The ladder structure, used in conjunction with the existence of special ground state solutions, explains why the Love numbers of these higher-dimensional black holes vanish for specific combinations of the multipole moment and number of spacetime dimensions. This generalizes previous work on a ladder symmetry explanation for the vanishing of 4D black hole static Love numbers to higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we show that the one-loop QCD $\beta$-function can be obtained from an index theorem on twistor space. This is achieved by recalling that the $\theta$-angle of self-dual gauge theory flows according the one-loop $\beta$-function. Rewriting self-dual gauge theory as a holomorphic theory on twistor space this flow can be computed as the anomaly to scale invariance. The one-loop Weyl anomaly coefficient $a-c$ can be recovered similarly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Group theoretic quantization of punctured plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantize punctured plane, $X=\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$, employing Isham's group theoretic quantization procedure. After sketching out a brief review of group theoretic quantization procedure, we apply the quantization scheme to the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$, corresponding to the punctured plane, $X$. Particularly, we find the canonical Lie group, $\mathscr{G}$, corresponding to the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$, to be $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$. We establish an algebra homomorphism between the Lie algebra corresponding to the canonical group, $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$, and the smooth functions, $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, in the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$. Making use of this homomorphism and unitary representation of the canonical group, $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$, we deduce a quantization map that maps a subspace of classical observables, $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, to self-adjoint operators on the Hilbert space, $\mathscr{H}$, which is the space of all square integrable functions on $X=\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$ with respect to the measure $\dd \mu = \dd \phi\dd\rho/(2\pi\rho)$.</description>

      <title>Birkhoff implies Quasi-topological</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-topological gravities (QTGs) are higher-curvature extensions of Einstein gravity in $D\geq 5$ spacetime dimensions. Throughout the years, different notions of QTGs constructed from analytic functions of polynomial curvature invariants have been introduced in the literature. In this paper, we show that all such definitions may be reduced to three distinct inequivalent notions: type I QTGs, for which the field equations evaluated on a single-function static and spherically symmetric ansatz are second order; type II QTGs, whose field equations on general static and spherically symmetric backgrounds are second order; and type III QTGs, for which the trace of the field equations on a general background is second order. We show that type II QTGs are a subset of type I QTGs and that type III QTGs are a subset of type II QTGs modulo pure Weyl invariants. Moreover, we prove that type II QTGs possess second-order equations on general spherical backgrounds. This allows us to prove that any theory satisfying a Birkhoff theorem is a type II QTG, and that the reverse implication also holds up to a zero-measure set of theories. For every theory satisfying Birkhoff's theorem, the most general spherically symmetric solution is a generalization of the Schwarzschild spacetime characterized by a single function which satisfies an algebraic equation.</description>

      <title>Deriving a parton shower for jet thermalization in QCD plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet quenching - the modification of high-energy jets in the quark-gluon plasma - has been extensively studied through weakly coupled scattering amplitudes embedded in parton-shower frameworks. These models, often combined with bulk hydrodynamic evolution, successfully describe a wide range of observables, though they typically rely on assumptions of rapid thermalization and simplified treatments of medium response. Parallel to these developments, jet thermalization has been investigated within the finite-temperature QCD effective kinetic theory, which provides our best microscopic understanding of equilibration in heavy-ion collisions. Early studies of linearized perturbations have highlighted both the promise and the limitations of current approaches, as existing MC implementations face challenges - particularly in the treatment of recoils and particle merging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a new parton-shower algorithm that exactly reproduces the dynamics of the linearized EKT, enabling a first-principles description of jet thermalization with proper inclusion of recoils, holes, quantum statistics, and merging processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) Skyrme model within the framework of semi-classical quantization to compute both electromagnetic and neutral current form factors for heavy nuclei. Our results show excellent agreement with the experimental data for low- to moderate momentum transfer. Further, we present an analytic expression of the neutral current form factor for generic nuclei, expressed as a power series in the momentum transfer. Our method provides an alternative to existing phenomenological approaches, and is particularly relevant for precision neutrino experiments where control over model-dependent systematics is essential for probing physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Spatially Structured Entanglement from Nonequilibrium Thermal Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum quench dynamics in (1+1)-dimensional critical systems, starting from thermal pure states called crosscap states, and evolving them under spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians. The spatial inhomogeneity is introduced through a deformation of the Hamiltonian, expressed as linear combinations of the generators of the $SL^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra. We analyze the free massless Dirac fermion theory and holographic conformal field theory as prototypical examples of integrable and non-integrable dynamics. Consistent with general expectations, "M\"obius-type" deformations lead to thermalization in the non-integrable case, and to periodic revivals in the integrable one. In contrast, "sine-square-type" and "displacement-type" deformations prevent both thermalization and scrambling, instead producing late-time, graph-like entanglement patterns. These patterns emerge from the interplay between the deformed Hamiltonian and the crosscap initial state and appear to be universal: they are determined solely by the deformation profile while remaining largely insensitive to microscopic details. Finally, we perform a holographic calculation in three-dimensional gravity using AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, which reproduces the main features of our (1+1)-dimensional study.</description>

      <title>Beyond general relativity: gravitational waves in non-minimally coupled theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-minimal couplings between matter and curvature tensors arise in many different contexts. Such couplings modify solutions of general relativity (GR) and therefore can be probed in various astrophysical systems. A particularly interesting scenario arises if dark matter experiences non-minimal couplings, as dark matter densities are expected to spike in the vicinity of binary black hole mergers. This gives a novel setting for simultaneously studying dark matter and (beyond) GR physics via observations of gravitational waves (GWs). In this work, we explore effects of various non-minimal couplings on GWs by working with a model-independent parameterization for left- and right-handed GW strains. We extend the parameterization proposed in \cite{Jenks:2023pmk,Daniel:2024lev} to include early-universe effects, and we write down the generic solution assuming slowly-varying matter fields. We then systematically apply our results to three models: Kalb-Ramond dark matter with dimension-four operators, axion-dilaton-Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet dimension-five operators, and dimension-six couplings to a (dark) vector field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze perturbative expansions of the quantum metric tensor (QMT) in anharmonic oscillators, focusing on quartic, sextic, and $d$-dimensional models. Using high-order perturbation theory, we show that the divergent QMT series exhibit factorial growth. Our analysis identifies universal non-perturbative scales, with coefficients displaying large-order behavior consistent with resurgence theory. Then, we apply resurgence and Borel--Pad\'e resummation to the QMT. Comparisons with exact diagonalization confirm that Borel--Pad\'e resummations yield accurate results, especially for the ground state. For completeness, we also present the analysis of the energy eigenvalues in the examples. Our findings extend resurgent techniques from energies to the QMT, highlighting the interplay between quantum geometry and non-perturbative physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study how the spin of particle modes influences particle creation, greybody factors, absorption, and evaporation of a black hole within the framework of modified electrodynamics in $f(R,T)$ gravity, recently proposed in Ref. [1]. All spin sectors -- scalar, vector, tensor, and spinorial -- are analyzed to obtain the corresponding features. For particle creation, we consider massless bosonic and fermionic perturbations to determine the respective particle densities. Analytical expressions for the greybody factors are derived, with suitable approximations for the tensor and spinorial cases. The absorption cross section is computed numerically, and using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we estimate the black hole evaporation lifetime. The associated energy and particle emission rates are also discussed, along with the correspondence between quasinormal modes and greybody factors.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Fracton Model, Subsystem Symmetry and Holography III: Extension to Generic Tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Hyperbolic Fracton Model from the $\{5,4\}$ tessellation to generic tessellations, and investigate its core properties: subsystem symmetries, fracton mobility, and holographic correspondence. While the model on the original tessellation has features reminiscent of the flat-space lattice cases, the generalized tessellations exhibit a far richer and more intricate structure. The ground-state degeneracy and subsystem symmetries are generated recursively layer-by-layer, through the inflation rule, but without a simple, uniform pattern. The fracton excitations follow exponential-in-distance and algebraic-in-lattice-size growing patterns when moving outward, and depend sensitively to the tessellation geometry, differing qualitatively from both type-I or type-II fracton model on flat lattices. Despite this increased complexity, the hallmark holographic features -- subregion duality via Rindler reconstruction, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for mutual information, and effective black hole entropy scaling with horizon area -- remain valid. These results demonstrate that the holographic correspondence in fracton models persists in generic tessellations, and provide a natural platform to explore more intricate subsystem symmetries and fracton physics.</description>

      <title>Invariants for (2+1)D bosonic crystalline topological insulators for all 17 wallpaper groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (2+1) dimensions with symmetry $G = G_{\text{space}}\times K$, where $G_{\text{space}}$ is a general wallpaper group and $K=\text{U}(1),\mathbb{Z}_N, \text{SO}(3)$ is an internal symmetry. In each case we propose a set of many-body invariants that can detect all the different phases predicted from real space constructions and group cohomology classifications. They are obtained by applying partial rotations and reflections to a given ground state, combined with suitable operations in $K$. The reflection symmetry invariants that we introduce include `double partial reflections', `weak partial reflections' and their `relative' or `twisted' versions which also depend on $K$. We verify our proposal through exact calculations on ground states constructed using real space constructions. We demonstrate our method in detail for the groups p4m and p4g, and in the case of p4m also derive a topological effective action involving gauge fields for orientation-reversing symmetries. Our results provide a concrete method to fully characterize (2+1)D crystalline topological invariants in bosonic SPT ground states.</description>

      <title>The signals of doomsday II: Cosmological signatures of late time $SU(3)_c$ symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The only two gauge symmetries which remain unbroken today are $SU(3)_c$ and $U(1)_{EM}$. Both of them are crucial for our universe to appear the way it does, and for our form of life to exist. Unless we are very special observers living at the very end of the cosmological symmetry breaking chain, there is no reason to believe that these two symmetries will remain unbroken in the future. In this paper, we discuss cosmological observational signatures of the $SU(3)_c$ symmetry breaking. We introduce a model with a new colored scalar field whose potential supports the first order phase transition through creation of the true vacuum bubbles. We then calculate particle production due to vacuum mismatch and use the event generators to study the decays of the new scalar field and massive gluons. We then use Pythia to hadronize the decay products and get the distributions of produced photons and neutrinos as the final result. They represent a long range signature which, if ever observed, might be interpreted as the signals of the doomsday.</description>

Abstract: In addition to the well-known quantum chromodynamical theta angle, we show that the Standard Model has another theta angle which is invariant under arbitrary chiral rotations of quarks and leptons. The new theta angle coincides with the quantum electrodynamical theta angle which may be observable in a nontrivial spacetime topology.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces: Cayley trees, hyperbolic continuum, and BCS theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $s$-wave superconductivity in negatively curved geometries, focusing on Cayley trees and the hyperbolic plane. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach for trees and a BCS treatment of the hyperbolic continuum, we establish a unified mean-field framework that captures the role of boundaries in hyperbolic spaces. For finite Cayley trees with open boundaries, the superconducting order parameter localizes at the edge while the interior can remain normal, leading to two distinct critical temperatures: $T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{edge} &gt; T_\textrm{c}^\textrm{bulk}$. A corresponding boundary-dominated phase also emerges in hyperbolic annuli and horodisc regions, where radial variations of the local density of states enhance edge pairing. We also demonstrate that the enhancement of the density of states at the boundary is significantly more pronounced for the discrete tree geometry. Our results show that, owing to the macroscopic extent of the boundary, negative curvature can stabilize boundary superconductivity as a phase that persists in the thermodynamic limit on par with the bulk superconductivity. These results highlight fundamental differences between bulk and boundary ordering in hyperbolic matter, and provide a theoretical framework for future studies of correlated phases in negatively curved systems.</description>

      <title>One-pion exchange potential in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the one-pion exchange potential (OPEP) in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field using chiral perturbation theory with nonrelativistic nucleons. Our approach is applicable not only to weak magnetic fields but also to strong ones up to around the pion-mass scale. The Green's function of charged pions is modified by the magnetic field, leading to changes in the nuclear force. By numerically evaluating the modified OPEP incorporating its spin and isospin dependencies, we show that the range of the potential decreases in both directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field as the field strength increases. We also compute the resulting energy shift of the deuteron due to the modified OPEP, which can reach the order of 1 MeV around $|eB| = m_\pi^2$, which is comparable to the deuteron binding energy.</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum error correction, eigenstate thermalization and the chaos bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction, thermalization, and quantum chaos are fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics that have each developed largely independently, despite their deep conceptual overlap. In this work, we establish a precise link between all three in systems that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and exhibit a well-defined hierarchy of time scales between dissipation and scrambling. Building on the ETH matrix ansatz and the structure of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), we show that the chaos bound directly constrains the error of an approximate quantum error-correcting code. This establishes a quantitative relation between information scrambling, thermalization, and correctability. Furthermore, we derive bounds on dynamical fluctuations around the infinite-time average and on fluctuation-dissipation relations, expressed in terms of both the code error and the Lyapunov exponent. Our results reveal how the limits of quantum chaos constrain information preservation in thermalizing quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Searching for strongly coupled AdS matter with multi-trace deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15141v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic CFTs admit a dual emergent description in terms of semiclassical general relativity minimally coupled to matter fields. While the gravitational interactions are required to be suppressed by the Planck scale, the matter sector is allowed to interact strongly at the AdS scale. From the perspective of the dual CFT, this requires breaking large-$N$ factorization in certain sectors of the theory. Exactly marginal multi-trace deformations are capable of achieving this while still preserving a consistent large-$N$ limit. We probe the effect of these deformations on the bulk theory by computing the relevant four-point functions in conformal perturbation theory. We find a simple answer in terms of a finite sum of conformal blocks, indicating that the correlators display no bulk-point singularities. This implies that the matter of the bulk theory is made strongly coupled by boundary terms rather than local bulk interactions. Our results suggest that holographic CFTs that describe strongly coupled AdS matter must be isolated points on the CFT landscape or sit infinitely far away on the conformal manifold from conventional holographic CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently discovered by Arkani-Hamed et al and Cao et al that the colour-ordered scattering amplitudes of Tr$(\Phi^3)$, the non-linear sigma model and Yang-Mills-scalar vanish at specific loci. We build on this observation and demonstrate that, beyond colour ordering, scattering amplitudes can display higher-order hidden zeros. A first example are the flavour-paired amplitudes of gravity-coupled scalars, as a double copy of Yang-Mills-scalar. The other two cases are Dirac-Born-Infeld and the special Galileon, which are the natural generalisations of the non-linear sigma model with higher orders of the Adler zero. We demonstrate that the amplitudes of these theories all factorize into lower-point objects in the near-zero limit, and discuss their interpretation. Finally, we comment on the general picture of hidden zeros and prove their relation under the double copy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine the theory of Cartan-Tanaka prolongations with the Molien-Weyl integral formula and Hilbert-Poincar\'e series to compute the Spencer cohomology groups of the $D=11$ Poincar\'e superalgebra $\mathfrak p$, relevant for superspace formulations of $11$-dimensional supergravity in terms of nonholonomic superstructures. This includes novel fermionic Spencer groups, providing with new cohomology classes of $\mathbb Z$-grading $1$ and form number $2$. Using the Hilbert-Poincar\'e series and the Euler characteristic, we also explore Spencer cohomology contributions in higher form numbers. We then propose a new general definition of filtered deformations of graded Lie superalgebras along first-order fermionic directions and investigate such deformations of $\mathfrak p$ that are maximally supersymmetric. In particular, we establish a no-go type theorem for maximally supersymmetric filtered subdeformations of $\mathfrak p$ along timelike (i.e., generic) first-order fermionic directions.</description>

Abstract: Pion scattering amplitudes were recently found to vanish on specific kinematic loci, and to factorise close to these loci into a product of two lower-point amplitudes of an extended theory. We propose a diagrammatic representation of pion amplitudes that makes their vanishing on the loci manifest diagram by diagram. Moreover, we provide evidence that there is a closed-form expression for the amplitudes that generalises the near-zero factorisation in an exact manner, not only close to the loci but for all kinematic configurations. Our approach crucially relies on a novel formulation of the effective field theory of pions, in which tree-level scattering amplitudes are extracted from classical field equations for a set of covariantly conserved currents and emergent composite gauge fields.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies generic surface defects for multiscalar critical models using a perturbative $\epsilon$ expansion in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions. The beta functions of the defect couplings for a generic multiscalar bulk with quartic interactions are computed at first non-trivial order in $\epsilon$. Specific bulks of interest are then considered: $O(N)$, hypercubic, hypertetrahdral, and biconical $O(m)\times O(n)$. In each case, we compute fixed points for the defect couplings and determine the remaining bulk symmetry. Expanding beyond the $O(N)$ model, we find a greater variety of patterns of symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a scalar field theory with quartic self interaction, Yukawa coupled to fermions in the inflationary de Sitter spacetime background. The scalar has a classical background plus quantum fluctuations, whereas the fermions are taken to be quantum. We derive for this system the effective action and the effective potential via the two particle irreducible (2PI) formalism. This formalism provides an opportunity to find out resummed or non-perturbative expressions for some series of diagrams. We have considered the two loop vacuum graphs and have computed the local part of the effective action. The various resummed counterterms corresponding to self energies, vertex functions and the tadpole have been explicitly found out. The variation of the renormalised effective potential for massless fields has been investigated numerically. We show that for the potential to be bounded from below, we must have $\lambda \gtrsim 16 g^2$, where $\lambda$ and $g$ are respectively the quartic and Yukawa couplings. We emphasise the qualitative differences of this non-perturbative calculation with that of the standard 1PI perturbative ones in de Sitter. The qualitative differences of our result with that of the flat spacetime has also been pointed out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate tree-level scattering processes involving quarks ($q$) and gluons ($g$) mediated by graviton exchange in the framework of Agravity, a dimensionless and renormalizable theory of quadratic quantum gravity. Focusing on the ultra-Planckian regime, characterized by the Mandelstam variable $s = (p_1 + p_2)^2$, which corresponds to the total energy squared in the center-of-momentum frame, being much larger than any particle mass scale, we compute the squared amplitudes and analyze the differential cross sections for the processes $gg \to gg$, $gg \to q\bar{q}$, $gq \to gq$, and $qq \to qq$. We demonstrate that all amplitudes scale as $1/s$ at high energies, in agreement with expectations for a UV-complete theory of gravity. In addition, we explore the issue of unitarity in the presence of higher-derivative ghost modes by analyzing the positivity properties of the squared amplitudes. While IR divergences appear in the forward scattering of massless particles, we show that these are regularized by finite quark masses. Our findings support the viability of Agravity as a perturbatively unitary and UV-complete extension of general relativity, capable of consistently describing gravitational interactions among elementary matter fields at trans-Planckian energies.</description>

Abstract: Compact formulas (1), (28) presented in this paper permit to formulate the Kallen-Lehmann harmonic decompositions of the products of two spinor and of spinor and scalar harmonic functions on AdS and Wightman functions on dS spaces; the correct flat space limits of the corresponding Kallen-Lehmann densities is demonstrated, the connection between poles of the Kallen-Lehmann density and the late-time divergence of the spinor-scalar loop is traced in the Yukawa model with light scalar field. Also in Sec. 4 the relatively simple, suitable for calculations Kallen-Lehmann representations of the real parts of spinor and scalar one-loop self-energies on dS space-time are proposed, and corresponding spectral equations for conformal dimensions in the chain approximation are written down.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the harmonic superspace formulation of $\mathcal{N}=2$ hypermultiplet in AdS$_4$ background, starting from the proper realization of $4D, \mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal group $SU(2,2|2)$ on the analytic subspace coordinates. The key observation is that $\mathcal{N}=2$ AdS$_4$ supergroup $OSp(2|4)$ can be embedded as a subgroup in the superconformal group through introducing a constant symmetric matrix $c^{(ij)}$ and identifying the AdS supercharge as $\Psi^i_\alpha = Q^i_\alpha + c^{ik} S_{k\alpha}$, with $Q$ and $S$ being generators of the standard and conformal $4D, {\cal N}=2$ supersymmetries. Respectively, the AdS cosmological constant is given by the square of $c^{(ij)}$, $\Lambda = -12 c^{ij}c_{ij}$. We construct the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant hypermultiplet mass term by adding, to the coordinate AdS transformations, a piece realized as an extra $SO(2)$ rotation of the hypermultiplet superfield. It is analogous to the central charge $x^5$ transformation of flat $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry and turns into the latter in the super Minkowski limit. As another new result, we explicitly construct the superfield Weyl transformation to the $OSp(2|4)$ invariant AdS integration measure over the analytic superspace, which provides, in particular, a basis for unconstrained superfield formulations of the AdS$_4$-deformed $\mathcal{N}=2$ hyper K\"ahler sigma models. We find the proper redefinition of $\theta$ coordinates ensuring the AdS-covariant form of the analytic superfield component expansions.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of nonlocal conformal field theories in two dimensions which are obtained as deformations of the Virasoro minimal models. The construction proceeds by coupling a relevant primary operator $\phi_{r,s}$ of the $m$-th minimal model to a generalized free field, in such a way that the interaction term has scaling dimension $2-\delta$. Flowing to the infrared, we reach a new class of CFTs that we call long-range minimal models. In the case $r=s=2$, the resulting line of fixed points, parametrized by $\delta$, can be studied using two perturbative expansions with different regimes of validity, one near the mean-field theory end, and one close to the long-range to short-range crossover. This is due to a straightforward generalization of an infrared duality which was proposed for the long-range Ising model ($m = 3$) in 2017. We find that the large-$m$ limit is problematic in both perturbative regimes, hence nonperturbative methods will be required in the intermediate range for all values of $m$. For the models based on $\phi_{1,2}$, the situation is rather different. In this case, only one perturbative expansion is known but it is well behaved at large $m$. We confirm this with a computation of infinitely many anomalous dimensions at two loops. Their large-$m$ limits are obtained from both numerical extrapolations and a method we develop which carries out conformal perturbation theory using Mellin amplitudes. For minimal models, these can be accessed from the Coulomb gas representations of the correlators. This method reveals analytic expressions for some integrals in conformal perturbation theory which were previously only known numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we compute the one-loop four-graviton amplitudes with a massive abelian vector field (Proca) circulating in the loop. Instead of the conventional Einstein-Hilbert formulation, we employ the Landau-Lifshitz metric density approach, coupling gravity to the Proca field. Within this framework, we found that the resulting contact-terms-free $n$-gon numerators exhibit a manifest double-copy structure, provided the external gravitational trees satisfy this property. This structure enables the direct construction of the corresponding amplitudes with a scalar in the loop. We further show that these numerators can be consistently used to evaluate pure gravity amplitudes in the sectors where contact terms vanish, offering a simplified setting to explore double-copy relations at one loop level.</description>

      <title>Fermionic fields of higher spin in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider fermionic fields of higher spin on a four-dimensional de Sitter background. A particular emphasis is placed on the Rarita-Schwinger spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ case. Both massive fields and gauge fields are considered, and their relation to the representation theory of $SO(4,1)$ is discussed. In Lorentzian signature, we study properties of the Bunch-Davies mode functions, and the late time structure of their two-point functions. For the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field, we consider a quantisation procedure based on the Minkowskian limit of the field operator. In Euclidean signature, the fields are placed on a four-sphere and the Euclidean path integral is computed at one-loop. The resulting Euclidean partition function is expressed in terms of unitary Lorentzian group characters with edge corrections. The unitary nature of the characters contrasts the lack of a conventional real action for the Rarita-Schwinger gauge field in de Sitter space. We speculate on the microscopic properties of a theory comprised of an infinite tower of interacting integer and half-integer gauge fields in de Sitter space. Along the way, we discuss a potentially interesting expression for the higher-spin path integral on the four-sphere.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Points of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Modular Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity theories with modular symmetry, where the modulus $\tau$ is the upper half-plane modulo $SL(2,\mathbf{Z})$ action. We focus on enhanced discrete gauge symmetry points $\tau=i, \exp(2\pi i/3)$, and argue that, if there are no new additional massless fields at these points, they will always be critical points of the scalar potential. Moreover, we show that whether these correspond to dS, AdS, or Minkowski vacua can be generically determined simply by the weight of the superpotential under modular transformations. We also analyze the asymptotics of the scalar potential and find that compatibility with the Swampland principles implies that, if nonvanishing, the scalar potential decays either exponentially or double-exponentially, and that the asymptotic slope is bounded. The slope is governed by the superpotential weight as well as by real-analytic modular contributions to the K\"ahler potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1310.1061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We will analyze through a first order perturbative formulation the local loss of symmetry when a source of non-Abelian Yang-Mills and gravitational fields interacts with an external agent that perturbes the original geometry associated to the source. Then, as the symmetry in Abelian and non-Abelian field structures in four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes is displayed through the existence of local planes of symmetry that we previously called blades one and two. These orthogonal local planes diagonalize the stress-energy tensor and every vector in these planes is an eigenvector of the stress-energy tensor. The loss of symmetry will be manifested by the tilting of these planes under the influence of the external agent. It was also found already that there is an algorithm to block diagonalize the Yang-Mills field strength in a local gauge invariant way. The loss of symmetry will also be manifested by the tilting of these planes that block diagonalize the Yang-Mills field strength under the influence of the external agent. As the interaction proceeds, the planes will tilt perturbatively, and in this strict sense the original local symmetry will be lost. But we will prove that the new orthogonal planes or blades at the same point will correspond after the tilting generated by perturbation to a new symmetry, with associated new local currents, both on each new local planes of symmetry. Old symmetries will be broken, new symmetries will arise. There will be a local symmetry evolution in the non-Abelian case as well. This result will produce a new theorem on dynamic symmetry evolution. This new classical model will be useful in order to better understand anomalies in quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Origin of the quantum group symmetry in 3d quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.10105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that quantum groups are relevant to describe the quantum regime of 3d gravity. They encode a deformation of the gauge symmetries parametrized by the value of the cosmological constant. They appear as a form of regularization either through the quantization of the Chern-Simons formulation or the state sum approach of Turaev-Viro. Such deformations are perplexing from a continuum and classical picture since the action is defined in terms of undeformed gauge invariance. We present here a novel way to derive from first principle and from the classical action such quantum group deformation. The argument relies on two main steps. First we perform a canonical transformation, which deformed the gauge invariance and the boundary symmetries, and makes them depend on the cosmological constant. Second we implement a discretization procedure relying on a truncation of the degrees of freedom from the continuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11350v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Origin of Electroweak Scale via Higgs-portal: Dyson-Schwinger in Conformally Invariant Scalar Sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate conformally extended Standard Model with a hidden scalar $\phi$. It is shown that due to non-perturbative dynamics in the hidden sector, $\phi$ develops a vacuum expectation value (vev) in the form of a mass gap which triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and dynamically generates the SM Higgs boson mass. For estimating the non-perturbatively generated mass scale, we solve the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger Equations in form of partial differential equations using the exact solution known via a novel technique developed by Bender, Milton and Savage. We employ Jacobi Elliptic function as exact background solution and show that the mass gap that arises in the hidden sector can be transmuted to the EW sector, expressed in terms of Higgs-portal mixed quartic coupling $\beta$ and self interaction quartic coupling $\lambda_{\phi}$ of $\phi$. We identify the suitable parameter space where the observed SM Higgs boson can be successfully generated . Finally, we discuss how this idea of non-perturbative EW scale generation can serve as a new starting point for better realistic model building in the context of resolving the hierarchy problem in the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept of instanton liquid model to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of pseudoparticles. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations. Thereby, the nonperturbative physics can be well-controlled by only a few parameters: instanton size $\rho$ and instanton density $n_{I+A}$, and current quark mass $m$.</description>

      <title>Equatorial periodic orbits and gravitational waveforms in a black hole free of Cauchy horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the periodic orbits and gravitational wave radiation in an extreme mass ratio inspiral system, where a stellar-mass object orbits a supermassive black hole without Cauchy horizons. Firstly, by using the effective potential, the marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits are investigated. It is found that the radius, orbital angular momentum, and energy increase with the hair parameter for both orbits. Based on these results, we examine one special type of orbit, the periodic orbit, around the black hole without the Cauchy horizon. The results show that, for a fixed rational number, the energy and angular momentum of the periodic orbit increase with the hair parameter. In particular, we observe a significant deviation from the Schwarzschild case for small hair parameter with a large amount of external mass outside the black hole horizon. Moreover, we examine the waveforms in the extreme mass ratio inspiral system to explore the orbital information of the periodic orbits and the constraints on the parameters of the black holes. The results reveal that the gravitational waveforms can fully capture the zoom-whirl behavior of periodic orbits. Moreover, the phase of the gravitational waves imposes constraints on the parameters of the black hole solutions. As the system evolves, the phase shift of the waveforms becomes increasingly significant, with cumulative deviations becoming more pronounced over time. Compared to the Schwarzschild black hole background, the waveform phase will advance for the central supermassive black hole without a Cauchy horizon.</description>

      <title>Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic strings with next-generation detector networks: Component separation based on a multi-source astrophysical foreground noise model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from cosmic strings is crucial for unveiling the evolutionary laws of the early universe and validating non-standard cosmological models. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of the detection capabilities of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector networks for cosmic strings. By constructing a hybrid signal model incorporating multi-source astrophysical foreground noise, including compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and compact binary hyperbolic encounters (CBHEs), we propose an innovative parameter estimation methodology based on multi-component signal separation. Numerical simulations using one-year observational data reveal three key findings: (1) The CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude improvement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\mu$ compared to individual detectors, reaching a relative uncertainty $\Delta G\mu / G\mu &lt; 0.5$ for $G\mu &gt; 3.5 \times 10^{-15}$ under standard cosmological framework; (2) The network demonstrates enhanced parameter resolution in non-standard cosmological scenarios, providing a novel approach to probe pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis cosmic evolution; (3) Enhanced detector sensitivity amplifies CBHE foreground interference in parameter estimation, while precise modeling of such signals could further refine $G\mu$ constraints by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. This research not only quantifies the detection potential of third-generation detector networks for cosmic string models but also elucidates the intrinsic connection between foreground modeling precision and cosmological parameter estimation accuracy, offering theoretical foundations for optimizing scientific objectives of next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We entertain the constraints that the absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation of ultrahigh-energy electrons inferred from LHAASO observations of the Crab Nebula can impose on generic models in which Lorentz symmetry of the particle vacuum is violated, as established by some recent studies in \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137034}{\emph{Phys. Lett. B} {\bf 829} (2022) 137034}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137536}{{\bf 835} (2022) 137536}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063006}{\emph{Phys. Rev. D} {\bf108} (2023) 063006}. We demonstrate in the present paper, that implementing a phenomenological approach to the Lorentz violation, the rates of this vacuum process are substantial such that one is justified in deriving bounds on the violation scales from simple threshold analysis just as these works did. Albeit such results are likely effective then, they do not apply in the same form among scenarios. Specifically, we show that these Cherenkov constraints are naturally evaded in models of space-time foam inspired from~(supercritical) string theory, involving D-branes as space-time defects in a brane-world scenario, in which subluminous energy-dependent refractive indices of light have been suggested. We examine here two specific foam situations and find for both cases~(though, for different reasons) the potentiality that charged quanta such as electrons do \emph{not} radiate as they pass through the gravitational vacuum `medium' despite moving faster than photons.</description>

Abstract: For ageing systems, quenched onto a critical temperature $T=T_c$ such that the dominant noise comes from the thermal bath, with a non-conserved order-parameter and in addition with dynamical exponent ${z}=2$, the form of the two-time auto-correlator as well as the time-space form of the single-time correlator are derived from Schr\"odinger-invariance, generalised to non-equilibrium ageing. These findings reproduce the exact results in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model at $T=0$ and the critical spherical model in $d&gt;2$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Complex wave functions, CPT and quantum field theory for classical generalized Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum or quantum field theory concept of a complex wave function is useful for understanding the information transport in classical statistical generalized Ising models.
  We relate complex conjugation to the discrete transformations charge conjugation ($C$), parity ($P$) and time reversal ($T$).
  A subclass of generalized Ising models are probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) with deterministic updating and probabilistic initial conditions.
  Simple two-dimensional PCA correspond to discretized quantum field theories for Majorana--Weyl, Weyl or Dirac fermions.
  Momentum and energy are conserved statistical observables.
  For PCA describing free massless fermions we investigate the vacuum and field operators for particle excitations.
  For the correlation function one finds the Lorentz-invariant Feynman propagator of quantum field theory.
  Furthermore, these automata admit probabilistic boundary conditions that correspond to thermal equilibrium with the quantum Fermi--Dirac distribution.
  PCA with updating sequences of propagation and interaction steps can realize a rich variety of discrete quantum field theories for fermions with interactions.
  For information theory the quantum formalism for PCA sheds new light on deterministic computing or signal processing with probabilistic input.</description>

      <title>Note on identifying four-dimensional vacuum solutions from Weyl invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffeomorphism covariance is a fundamental property of General Relativity which leads to the fact that the same solution of Einstein equation can be given in completely distinct forms in different coordinate systems. Distinguishing or identifying two metrics as solutions of Einstein equation is particularly challenging. In a recent paper arXiv:2503.14586 [hep-th], it is proposed to apply the relations of different Weyl invariants to distinguish solutions. In this note, we present a complementary application of the Weyl invariants. We verify from Weyl invariants that two metrics with completely different forms are the same solution. We also present the coordinates transformation that connects the two metrics.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Preference for a Positive Neutrino Mass at 2.7$\sigma$: A Joint Analysis of DESI DR2, DESY5, and DESY1 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. {In this work, we obtain a high-confidence measurement of the neutrino mass within a dynamical DE framework. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a measurement for a non-zero, positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This high-confidence measurement is driven mainly by these factors: (i) the DESI's preference for a dynamical DE with its equation of state evolving from $w&lt; -1$ at early times to $w&gt; -1$ at late times, thus leading to a larger neutrino mass; (ii) treating $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a free parameter together with the inclusion of weak lensing data, which likewise allows for an increased neutrino mass.} In future, even higher-confidence measurements of neutrino mass are expected with stronger preferences for dynamical DE in light of more complete DESI data releases.</description>

      <title>Precision gravity constraints on large dark sectors</title>

Abstract: General relativity, treated as a low energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newtons law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are negligible for the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newtons law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa type deviations and inverse square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and forthcoming experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. For truly massless hidden states, present data still permit multiplicities as large as 1e61, with modest spin dependence; for finite masses the constraints reduce to the familiar short range Yukawa parameterization. Our results provide a model independent framework for confronting dark sector scenarios with precision gravity data and clarify how non minimal scalar couplings, potential higher derivative poles at large species number, and Kaluza Klein towers fit within this picture. The approach is complementary to cosmological probes: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background constrain relic abundances under specified production histories, whereas laboratory tests constrain the spectrum of light states irrespective of their cosmological population.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor from a horizontal symmetry in a slice of AdS$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build a model of lepton flavor in a slice of AdS$_5$. We add to the 5D SM fields a set of neutrino fields, as well as a horizontal U(1) symmetry and a flavon field, all propagating in the bulk. The electroweak and U(1) symmetries are spontaneously broken by a potential localized on the infrared boundary. We show that in a flavor anarchic scenario, by suitable choice of the 5D masses and the U(1) charges, the masses of the SM leptons and the PMNS matrix can be naturally generated. The neutrino masses are Dirac like, with a normal ordered hierarchical spectrum, $\Delta m_{32}^2\approx m_3^2$, $\Delta m_{21}^2\approx m_2^2\gg m_1^2$, and a suppressed $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle. We find configurations where the charged lepton mixing angles are suppressed by powers of the Cabibbo angle ($\lambda_C$) relative to vanilla anarchic partial compositeness, consequently reducing CP and lepton flavor violation. Specifically, the Wilson coefficient for the electron electromagnetic dipole moment exhibits $\lambda_C^2$ suppression, while those governing $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu-e$ vector operators are suppressed by $\lambda_C^{3/2}$ compared to the anarchic scenario without U(1) horizontal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Interacting Random Graph Models</title>

Abstract: Random graphs offer a useful mathematical representation of a variety of real world complex networks. Exponential random graphs, for example, are particularly suited towards generating random graphs constrained to have specified statistical moments. In this investigation, we elaborate on a generalization of the former where link probabilities are conditioned on the appearance of other links, corresponding to the introduction of interactions in an effective generalized statistical mechanical formalism. When restricted to the simplest non-trivial case of pairwise interactions, one can derive a closed form renormalization group transformation for maximum coordination number two on the corresponding line graph. Higher coordination numbers do not admit exact closed form renormalization group transformations, a feature that paraphrases the usual absence of exact transformations in two or more dimensional lattice systems. We introduce disorder and study the induced renormalization group flow on its probability assignments, highlighting its formal equivalence to time reversed anisotropic drift-diffusion on the statistical manifold associated with the effective Hamiltonian. We discuss the implications of our findings, stressing the long wavelength irrelevance of certain classes of pair-wise conditioning on random graphs, and conclude with possible applications. These include modeling the scaling behavior of preferential effects on social networks, opinion dynamics, and reinforcement effects on neural networks, as well as how our findings offer a systematic framework to deal with data limitations in inference and reconstruction problems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional criticality in $O(D)$-invariant loop-constrained Landau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an unconventional phase transition in ferroelectrics where the polarization field is constrained to be divergence-free, allowing only loop-like configurations. This local constraint fundamentally alters the critical behavior, driving the system beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. A renormalization group analysis shows that the polarization acquires an unusually large anomalous dimension, $\eta\approx 0.239$ in three dimensions, far exceeding the typical values in $O(3)$-invariant systems. We attribute this effect to an emergent gauge symmetry originating from the zero divergence constraint. Such gauge-field behavior is reminiscent of fractionalized phases, revealing a fundamental connection between constrained ferroelectrics and emergent gauge phenomena in correlated matter.</description>

      <title>QCD chiral phase diagram from weak functional renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the QCD chiral phase transition at finite temperature and finite baryon density using the functional Renormalization Group (fRG). While conventional fRG studies often employ techniques such as dynamical bosonization to regularize divergences, we instead pursue the weak solution of the fRG equations which allows for non-analytic behavior in the flow to compute the pure fermionic potential $V_k(\psi,\bar{\psi})$ within the local potential approximation. This approach enables us to explore the effects of purely quark-level fluctuations on dynamical chiral symmetry breaking without introducing any auxiliary bosonic fields. Based on this framework, we present the resulting chiral phase diagram as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential.</description>
