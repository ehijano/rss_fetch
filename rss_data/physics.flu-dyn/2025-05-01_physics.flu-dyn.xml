      <title>Dynamical stability and flow regimes in a stably stratified valley-shaped cavity heated from below</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the three-dimensional stability of a stably stratified fluid in a valley-shaped cavity heated from below using linear stability analysis and direct numerical simulations. We first describe the pure-conduction flow state and derive a dimensionless criterion that provides a lower bound for the onset of instability, valid for any slope angle. We then examine the sequence of flow regimes for a slope angle of $\alpha = 30^{\circ}$ and Prandtl number $Pr = 7$, including two-dimensional steady states, the emergence of a Hopf bifurcation, and the formation of steady and oscillatory three-dimensional structures preceding the transition to fully unsteady, chaotic flow. Although the nonlinear governing equations depend on two dimensionless parameters, we find that the flow dynamics across a wide parameter range collapse to depend on a single parameter--the composite stratification parameter $\Pi_c$. However, as the system becomes more unstable, sensitivity to the second parameter, $\Pi_h$, increases. We construct a regime map of all observed flow states as a function of $\Pi_c$ and $\Pi_h$, and confirm the onset of chaos using Lyapunov exponents. Across all regimes, asymmetric circulation remains the dominant flow structure, persisting even in time-averaged fields of chaotic states. Finally, we characterize heat transfer in the cavity using the Nusselt number, which scales as $Nu \sim \Pi_c^{0.43}$ or equivalently $Nu \sim Ra^{0.275}$. This result further establishes $\Pi_c$ as a key dimensionless parameter governing the flow dynamics preceding the chaotic regime.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov Cascade as the Governing Mechanism for Intervortex Spacing in Quantum Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate inertially forced isothermal quantum turbulence (coflow of normal and superfluid components) at temperatures of 1.6 and 2 K. The experiments are carried out in a large optical cryostat, where quasi-isotropic, homogeneous turbulence is generated using a double oscillating grid. Turbulence intensity is tuned by varying the grid stroke and frequency. The flow is probed via 2D and 3D reconstructions of quasi-isodense microsphere trajectories, from which we extract the large-scale properties of the flow in the fully turbulent regime for different Reynolds numbers: the turbulent velocity fluctuations, the energy transfer rate, and the integral length scale. Additionally, we determine the mean vortex line density $\mathcal{L}$ via attenuation of a second sound standing wave across the entire measurement volume. Our results confirm with an improved accuracy that the intervortex spacing $\ell =1/\sqrt{\mathcal{L}}$ scales with the Reynolds number $\text{Re}_\kappa$ (based on the quantum of circulation $\kappa$) as $\ell\propto \text{Re}_\kappa^{-3/4}$, with a well-defined numerical prefactor and no observed temperature dependence. This scaling recalls that of the dissipative length scale in classical Kolmogorov (K41) turbulence and it lead previous authors to interpret $\ell$ as an effective dissipation length scale. However, in our temperature range, this interpretation is not consistent with the apparent temperature independence of the prefactor. Based on those arguments, we propose an alternative interpretation that suggests that the inter-vortex distance in coflow turbulence is the consequence of the quantum restricted depth of the superfluid component energy cascade.</description>

      <title>Area rule of velocity circulation in two-dimensional instability-driven turbulence beyond the inertial range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Kolmogorov's theory, scaling properties in the inertial range have been a key topic in turbulence research. However, the velocity statistics show non-universality in three- and two-dimensional turbulence. Migdal (1995) proved the velocity circulation area rule which states the probability density function (PDF) of circulation is only a function of the minimal surface area enclosed by the loop but not the shape of the loop, and later a bifractal universal behavior is found for circulation in three- and two-dimensional turbulence and quantum turbulence (Iyer et al. 2019; M\"uller et al. 2021; Zhu et al. 2023). This paper finds that the velocity circulation area rule can be generalized in two-dimensional instability-driven turbulence to all scales that are not limited to the inertial range. However, similar to the three-dimensional case, the variance of circulation is size-dependent, and compared with the circulation PDFs, the variance-normalized PDFs have a significantly weaker dependence on the shape of the loop. We also discussed the area rule for 8-loops and double loops. We found that the normalized PDF depends only on the scalar area of the 8-loop. However, the area rule for other complex loops, such as double loops, remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Internal solitary and cnoidal waves of moderate amplitude in a two-layer fluid: the extended KdV equation approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider travelling internal waves in a two-layer fluid with linear shear currents from the viewpoint of the extended Korteweg-de Vries (eKdV) equation derived from a strongly-nonlinear long-wave model. Using an asymptotic Kodama-Fokas-Liu near-identity transformation, we map the eKdV equation to the Gardner equation. This improved Gardner equation has a different cubic nonlinearity coefficient and an additional transport term compared to the frequently used truncated Gardner equation. We then construct approximate solitary and cnoidal wave solutions of the eKdV equation using this mapping and test validity and performance of these approximations, as well as performance of the truncated and improved Gardner and eKdV equations, by comparison with direct numerical simulations of the strongly-nonlinear two-layer long-wave parent system in the absence of currents.</description>

      <title>The U2H map explains the effect of (sub)mesoscale turbulence on significant wave height statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currents modulate the energy of surface gravity waves, leading to spatial inhomogeneities in significant wave height (SWH). Previous work indicates that the overall scale of the inhomogeneities is set by the scale of the currents, that the inhomogeneities are strongly anisotropic even for isotropic currents, and that the rotational and divergent components of the currents have sharply distinct effects. We explain these and other features of current-induced SWH inhomogeneities using the U2H map, a linear relation between SWH and currents deduced from wave-action conservation by making simplifying assumptions. We obtain a linear law relating the spectrum of SWH to the spectra of rotational and divergent kinetic energy of the current. This makes it possible to relate SWH statistics (such as variance and anisotropy) to the current statistics and wave properties including directional spreading.</description>

      <title>Induced Diffusion of Internal Gravity Waves: Directionality and Role in Ocean Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Induced diffusion (ID), an important mechanism of spectral energy transfer in the internal gravity wave (IGW) field, plays a significant role in driving turbulent dissipation in the ocean interior. In this study, we revisit the ID mechanism to elucidate its directionality and role in ocean mixing under varying IGW spectral forms, with particular attention to deviations from the standard Garrett-Munk (GM) spectrum. The original interpretation of ID as an action diffusion process, as proposed by McComas et al., suggests that ID is inherently bidirectional, with its direction governed by the vertical-wavenumber spectral slope $\sigma$ of the IGW action spectrum, $n \propto m^\sigma$. In contrast, by evaluating the wave kinetic equation, we reveal a more complete depiction of ID, comprising both diffusive and scale-separated transfers that are rooted in energy conservation within wave triads. Although the action diffusion may reverse direction depending on the sign of $\sigma$ (i.e., between red and blue spectral cases), the combined ID transfer consistently leads to a forward energy cascade at the dissipation scale, thereby contributing positively to turbulent dissipation. This supports the viewpoint of ID as a dissipative mechanism in physical oceanography. This study presents a physically grounded overview of ID and offers insights into the specific types of wave-wave interactions responsible for turbulent dissipation.</description>

      <title>Multi-level datasets training method in Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks have emerged as a promising methodology for solving PDEs, gaining significant attention in computer science and various physics-related fields. Despite being demonstrated the ability to incorporate the physics of laws for versatile applications, PINNs still struggle with the challenging problems which are stiff to be solved and/or have high-frequency components in the solutions, resulting in accuracy and convergence issues. It may not only increase computational costs, but also lead to accuracy loss or solution divergence. In this study, an alternative approach is proposed to mitigate the above-mentioned problems. Inspired by the multi-grid method in CFD community, the underlying idea of the current approach is to efficiently remove different frequency errors via training with different levels of training samples, resulting in a simpler way to improve the training accuracy without spending time in fine-tuning of neural network structures, loss weights as well as hyperparameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of current approach, we first investigate canonical 1D ODE with high-frequency component and 2D convection-diffusion equation with V-cycle training strategy. Finally, the current method is employed for the classical benchmark problem of steady Lid-driven cavity flows at different Reynolds numbers, to investigate the applicability and efficacy for the problem involved multiple modes of high and low frequency. By virtue of various training sequence modes, improvement through predictions lead to 30% to 60% accuracy improvement. We also investigate the synergies between current method and transfer learning techniques for more challenging problems (i.e., higher Re). From the present results, it also revealed that the current framework can produce good predictions even for the case of Re=5000, demonstrating the ability to solve complex high-frequency PDEs.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Computational Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes are an introduction to fluctuating hydrodynamics (FHD) and the formulation of numerical schemes for the resulting stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs). Fluctuating hydrodynamics was originally introduced by Landau and Lifshitz as a way to put thermal fluctuations into a continuum framework by including a stochastic forcing to each dissipative transport process (e.g., heat flux). While FHD has been useful in modeling transport and fluid dynamics at the mesoscopic scale, theoretical calculations have been feasible only with simplifying assumptions. As such there is great interest in numerical schemes for Computational Fluctuating Hydrodynamics (CFHD). There are a variety of algorithms (e.g., spectral, finite element, lattice Boltzmann) but in this introduction we focus on finite volume schemes. Accompanying these notes is a demonstration program in Python available on GitHub (https://github.com/AlejGarcia/IntroFHD).</description>

      <title>Analytic adjoint solution for incompressible potential flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the analytic adjoint solution for two-dimensional (2D) incompressible potential flow for a cost function measuring aerodynamic force using the connection of the adjoint approach to Green's functions and also by establishing and exploiting its relation to the adjoint incompressible Euler equations. By comparison with the analytic solution, it is shown that the naive approach based on solving Laplace's equation for the adjoint variables can be ill-defined. The analysis of the boundary behavior of the analytic solution is used to discuss the proper formulation of the adjoint problem as well as the mechanism for incorporating the Kutta condition in the adjoint formulation</description>

Abstract: Albeit the past intensive research, the governing equation of anomalous diffusion which is observed for the transport of particles underground is still an open problem. In this paper, as a governing equation, the advection-diffusion equation with a time-fractional derivative term is derived from the radiative transport equation with an integral term for waiting time.</description>
