      <title>FLARE: A New Federated Learning Framework with Adjustable Learning Rates over Resource-Constrained Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless federated learning (WFL) suffers from heterogeneity prevailing in the data distributions, computing powers, and channel conditions of participating devices. This paper presents a new Federated Learning with Adjusted leaRning ratE (FLARE) framework to mitigate the impact of the heterogeneity. The key idea is to allow the participating devices to adjust their individual learning rates and local training iterations, adapting to their instantaneous computing powers. The convergence upper bound of FLARE is established rigorously under a general setting with non-convex models in the presence of non-i.i.d. datasets and imbalanced computing powers. By minimizing the upper bound, we further optimize the scheduling of FLARE to exploit the channel heterogeneity. A nested problem structure is revealed to facilitate iteratively allocating the bandwidth with binary search and selecting devices with a new greedy method. A linear problem structure is also identified and a low-complexity linear programming scheduling policy is designed when training models have large Lipschitz constants. Experiments demonstrate that FLARE consistently outperforms the baselines in test accuracy, and converges much faster with the proposed scheduling policy.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Multi-Node ISAC 4D Environmental Reconstruction with Uplink- Downlink Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing widely distributed communication nodes to achieve environmental reconstruction is one of the significant scenarios for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) and a crucial technology for 6G. To achieve this crucial functionality, we propose a deep learning based multi-node ISAC 4D environment reconstruction method with Uplink-Downlink (UL-DL) cooperation, which employs virtual aperture technology, Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detection, and Mutiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm to maximize the sensing capabilities of single sensing nodes. Simultaneously, it introduces a cooperative environmental reconstruction scheme involving multi-node cooperation and Uplink-Downlink (UL-DL) cooperation to overcome the limitations of single-node sensing caused by occlusion and limited viewpoints. Furthermore, the deep learning models Attention Gate Gridding Residual Neural Network (AGGRNN) and Multi-View Sensing Fusion Network (MVSFNet) to enhance the density of sparsely reconstructed point clouds are proposed, aiming to restore as many original environmental details as possible while preserving the spatial structure of the point cloud. Additionally, we propose a multi-level fusion strategy incorporating both data-level and feature-level fusion to fully leverage the advantages of multi-node cooperation. Experimental results demonstrate that the environmental reconstruction performance of this method significantly outperforms other comparative method, enabling high-precision environmental reconstruction using ISAC system.</description>

      <title>Device-Free 3D Drone Localization in RIS-Assisted mmWave MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the potential of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in facilitating passive/device-free three-dimensional (3D) drone localization within existing cellular infrastructure operating at millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies and employing multiple antennas at the transceivers. The developed localization system operates in the bi-static mode without requiring direct communication between the drone and the base station. We analyze the theoretical performance limits via Fisher information analysis and Cram\'er Rao lower bounds (CRLBs). Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity yet effective drone localization algorithm based on coordinate gradient descent and examine the impact of factors such as radar cross section (RCS) of the drone and training overhead on system performance. It is demonstrated that integrating RIS yields significant benefits over its RIS-free counterpart, as evidenced by both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning for 5G Base Station Placement to Support Localisation for Future Sustainable Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) is a key enabler for next-generation transportation systems. However, in an urban city scenario, mmWave is highly susceptible to blockages and shadowing. Therefore, base station (BS) placement is a crucial task in the infrastructure design where coverage requirements need to be met while simultaneously supporting localisation. This work assumes a pre-deployed BS and another BS is required to be added to support both localisation accuracy and coverage rate in an urban city scenario. To solve this complex multi-objective optimisation problem, we utilise deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Concretely, this work proposes: 1) a three-layered grid for state representation as the input of the DRL, which enables it to adapt to the changes in the wireless environment represented by changing the position of the pre-deployed BS, and 2) the design of a suitable reward function for the DRL agent to solve the multi-objective problem. Numerical analysis shows that the proposed deep Q-network (DQN) model can learn/adapt from the complex radio environment represented by the terrain map and provides the same/similar solution to the exhaustive search, which is used as a benchmark. In addition, we show that an exclusive optimisation of coverage rate does not result in improved localisation accuracy, and thus there is a trade-off between the two solutions.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin of Industrial Networked Control System based on Value of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper examines a scenario wherein sensors are deployed within an Industrial Networked Control System, aiming to construct a digital twin (DT) model for a remotely operated Autonomous Guided Vehicle (AGV). The DT model, situated on a cloud platform, estimates and predicts the system's state, subsequently formulating the optimal scheduling strategy for execution in the physical world. However, acquiring data crucial for efficient state estimation and control computation poses a significant challenge, primarily due to constraints such as limited network resources, partial observation, and the necessity to maintain a certain confidence level for DT estimation. We propose an algorithm based on Value of Information (VoI), seamlessly integrated with the Extended Kalman Filter to deliver a polynomial-time solution, selecting the most informative subset of sensing agents for data. Additionally, we put forth an alternative solution leveraging a Graph Neural Network to precisely ascertain the AGV's position with a remarkable accuracy of up to 5 cm. Our experimental validation in an industrial robotic laboratory environment yields promising results, underscoring the potential of high-accuracy DT models in practice.</description>

      <title>A Realisation of Channel Emulation in a Reverberation Chamber method for Over-the-Air Compliance Testing in Support of 3GPP Standardisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent long decay power delay profile (PDP) in the reverberation chamber (RC) is a major challenge for accurate channel emulation of 3GPP channel model, which is widely used in performance test of the physical layer. To tackle this challenge, we propose in this paper a novel two-step "closed-loop" approach consisting of (i) a channel measuring step and (ii) a channel model synthesis step. The channel measurement step is used to capture the wireless channel of the RC. In the channel model synthesis step, an additional IQ signal convolution process is introduced prior the IQ signal passes through the channel emulator (CE). This process filters the IQ signal by an equalizer filter derived from the measured channel impulse response (CIR) of the RC obtained in channel measurement step. From the measurement results, the proposed approach is proven that able to effectively emulate typical 3GPP 5G channel model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By counting the number of pass/fail occurrences of a DUT (Device under Test) in the stirring process in a reverberation chamber (RC), the threshold electric field (E-field) level can be well estimated without tuning the input power and repeating the whole testing many times. The Monte-Carlo method is used to verify the results. Estimated values and uncertainties are given for Rayleigh distributed fields and for Rice distributed fields with different K-factors.</description>

      <title>Mapping Wireless Networks into Digital Reality through Joint Vertical and Horizontal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the complexity of 5G and beyond wireless networks has escalated, prompting a need for innovative frameworks to facilitate flexible management and efficient deployment. The concept of digital twins (DTs) has emerged as a solution to enable real-time monitoring, predictive configurations, and decision-making processes. While existing works primarily focus on leveraging DTs to optimize wireless networks, a detailed mapping methodology for creating virtual representations of network infrastructure and properties is still lacking. In this context, we introduce VH-Twin, a novel time-series data-driven framework that effectively maps wireless networks into digital reality. VH-Twin distinguishes itself through complementary vertical twinning (V-twinning) and horizontal twinning (H-twinning) stages, followed by a periodic clustering mechanism used to virtualize network regions based on their distinct geological and wireless characteristics. Specifically, V-twinning exploits distributed learning techniques to initialize a global twin model collaboratively from virtualized network clusters. H-twinning, on the other hand, is implemented with an asynchronous mapping scheme that dynamically updates twin models in response to network or environmental changes. Leveraging real-world wireless traffic data within a cellular wireless network, comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify that VH-Twin can effectively construct, deploy, and maintain network DTs. Parametric analysis also offers insights into how to strike a balance between twinning efficiency and model accuracy at scale.</description>

      <title>Cooperative ISAC Networks: Performance Analysis, Scaling Laws and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks are investigated with the objective of effectively balancing the sensing and communication (S&amp;C) performance at the network level. Through the simultaneous utilization of multi-point (CoMP) coordinated joint transmission and distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar techniques, we propose an innovative networked ISAC scheme, where multiple transceivers are employed for collaboratively enhancing the S&amp;C services. Then, the potent tool of stochastic geometry is exploited for characterizing the S&amp;C performance, which allows us to illuminate the key cooperative dependencies in the ISAC network and optimize salient network-level parameters. Remarkably, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) expression of the localization accuracy derived unveils a significant finding: Deploying N ISAC transceivers yields an enhanced average cooperative sensing performance across the entire network, in accordance with the ln^2N scaling law. Crucially, this scaling law is less pronounced in comparison to the performance enhancement of N^2 achieved when the transceivers are equidistant from the target, which is primarily due to the substantial path loss from the distant base stations (BSs) and leads to reduced contributions to sensing performance gain. Moreover, we derive a tight expression of the communication rate, and present a low-complexity algorithm to determine the optimal cooperative cluster size. Based on our expression derived for the S&amp;C performance, we formulate the optimization problem of maximizing the network performance in terms of two joint S&amp;C metrics. To this end, we jointly optimize the cooperative BS cluster sizes and the transmit power to strike a flexible tradeoff between the S&amp;C performance.</description>

      <title>Neural Compress-and-Forward for the Relay Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relay channel, consisting of a source-destination pair and a relay, is a fundamental component of cooperative communications. While the capacity of a general relay channel remains unknown, various relaying strategies, including compress-and-forward (CF), have been proposed. For CF, given the correlated signals at the relay and destination, distributed compression techniques, such as Wyner-Ziv coding, can be harnessed to utilize the relay-to-destination link more efficiently. In light of the recent advancements in neural network-based distributed compression, we revisit the relay channel problem, where we integrate a learned one-shot Wyner--Ziv compressor into a primitive relay channel with a finite-capacity and orthogonal (or out-of-band) relay-to-destination link. The resulting neural CF scheme demonstrates that our task-oriented compressor recovers "binning" of the quantized indices at the relay, mimicking the optimal asymptotic CF strategy, although no structure exploiting the knowledge of source statistics was imposed into the design. We show that the proposed neural CF scheme, employing finite order modulation, operates closely to the capacity of a primitive relay channel that assumes a Gaussian codebook. Our learned compressor provides the first proof-of-concept work toward a practical neural CF relaying scheme.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Optical IRS-Assisted VLC System via Spatial Coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS) has been considered a promising technology for visible light communication (VLC) by constructing visual line-of-sight propagation paths to address the signal blockage issue. However, the existing works on OIRSs are mostly based on perfect channel state information (CSI), whose acquisition appears to be challenging due to the passive nature of the OIRS. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a customized channel estimation algorithm for OIRSs. Specifically, we first unveil the OIRS spatial coherence characteristics and derive the coherence distance in closed form. Based on this property, a spatial sampling-based algorithm is proposed to estimate the OIRS-reflected channel, by dividing the OIRS into multiple subarrays based on the coherence distance and sequentially estimating their associated CSI, followed by an interpolation to retrieve the full CSI. Simulation results validate the derived OIRS spatial coherence and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed OIRS channel estimation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Optical Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted VLC System: A Joint Space-Time Sampling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS) has attracted increasing attention due to its capability of overcoming signal blockages in visible light communication (VLC), an emerging technology for the next-generation advanced transceivers. However, current works on OIRS predominantly assume known channel state information (CSI), which is essential to practical OIRS configuration. To bridge such a gap, this paper proposes a new and customized channel estimation protocol for OIRSs under the alignment-based channel model. Specifically, we first unveil OIRS spatial and temporal coherence characteristics and derive the coherence distance and the coherence time in closed form. Next, to achieve fast beam alignment over different coherence time, we propose to dynamically tune the rotational angles of the OIRS reflecting elements following a geometric optics-based non-uniform codebook. Given the above beam alignment, we propose an efficient joint space-time sampling-based algorithm to estimate the OIRS channel. In particular, we divide the OIRS into multiple subarrays based on the coherence distance and sequentially estimate their associated CSI, followed by a spacetime interpolation to retrieve full CSI for other non-aligned transceiver antennas. Numerical results validate our theoretical analyses and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed OIRS channel estimation scheme as compared to other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Scalability and Implementation Aspects of Cell-Free Massive MIMO for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of scalability for a cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) system performing Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC). Specifically, the case in which a large number of access points (APs) are deployed to perform simultaneous communication with mobile users and surveillance of the surrounding environment in the same time-frequency slot is considered, and a target-centric approach on top of the user-centric approach used for communication services is introduced. Consideration of other practical aspects such as the fronthaul load and scanning protocol issues are also treated in the paper. The proposed scalable ISAC-enabled system has lower levels of system complexity, permits to manage the case in which multiple targets are to be tracked/sensed, and achieves performance levels superior or in some cases close to those of the non-scalable solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers the notion of random tensors and reviews some fundamental concepts in statistics when applied to a tensor based data or signal. In several engineering fields such as Communications, Signal Processing, Machine learning, and Control systems, the concepts of linear algebra combined with random variables have been indispensable tools. With the evolution of these subjects to multi-domain communication systems, multi-way signal processing, high dimensional data analysis, and multi-linear systems theory, there is a need to bring in multi-linear algebra equipped with the notion of random tensors. Also, since several such application areas deal with complex-valued entities, it is imperative to study this subject from a complex random tensor perspective, which is the focus of this paper. Using tools from multi-linear algebra, we characterize statistical properties of complex random tensors, both proper and improper, study various correlation structures, and fundamentals of tensor valued random processes. Furthermore, the asymptotic distribution of various tensor eigenvalue and singular value definitions is also considered, which is used for the study of spiked real tensor models that deals with recovery of low rank tensor signals perturbed by noise. This paper aims to provide an overview of the state of the art in random tensor theory of both complex and real valued tensors, for the purpose of enabling its application in engineering and applied science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate decoding of Uplink Control Information (UCI) on the Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH) is essential for enabling 5G wireless links. This paper explores an AI/ML-based receiver design for PUCCH Format 0. Format 0 signaling encodes the UCI content within the phase of a known base waveform and even supports multiplexing of up to 12 users within the same time-frequency resources. Our first-of-a-kind neural network classifier, which we term UCINet0, is capable of predicting when no user is transmitting on the PUCCH, as well as decoding the UCI content of any number of multiplexed users, up to 12. Inference results with both simulated and hardware-captured field datasets show that the UCINet0 model outperforms conventional DFT-based decoders across all SNR ranges.</description>

      <title>3GPP-Like GBSM THz Channel Modeling for Indoor Office and Urban Microcellular Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14997</link>

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication is envisioned as one of the possible technologies for the sixth-generation (6G) communication system due to its rich spectrum. To evaluate the performance of THz communication, it is essential to propose THz channel models within the common framework of the geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). This paper focuses on 3GPP-like GBSM THz channel modeling based on channel measurements. We first present channel measurements at 100 GHz in an indoor office scenario and at 132 GHz in an urban microcellular scenario. Subsequently, channel characteristics such as PL, delay spread, angle spread, K-factor, cluster characteristic, cross-correlations, and correlation distance are obtained and analyzed using the measurement data. Additionally, statistical values of the channel characteristics are extracted based on the statistical distribution of 3GPP channel models, which can be used to reconstruct the channel impulse response (CIR). Furthermore, these obtained values are compared with the default values in the 3GPP channel model, revealing discrepancies that indicate the default values cannot accurately characterize the THz channel. For instance, for the case of line-of-sight links in the indoor office, the measured cluster number is 4 while the default value is 15. Finally, the channel capacity at THz frequency band is evaluated by the reconstructed CIRs generated by the GBSM using the measured statistical values and the 3GPP default values. It is observed that the 3GPP default values overestimate the THz channel capacity, equivalent to more than 10 bps/Hz larger at a signal-to-noise ratio of 30 dB. Overall, these findings are helpful in understanding and modeling the THz channel, facilitating the application of THz communication techniques for 6G.</description>

      <title>Masked Transformer for Electrocardiogram Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in clinical applications. With the advent of advanced algorithms, various deep learning models have been adopted for ECG tasks. However, the potential of Transformer for ECG data has not been fully realized, despite their widespread success in computer vision and natural language processing. In this work, we present Masked Transformer for ECG classification (MTECG), a simple yet effective method which significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art algorithms in ECG classification. Our approach adapts the image-based masked autoencoders to self-supervised representation learning from ECG time series. We utilize a lightweight Transformer for the encoder and a 1-layer Transformer for the decoder. The ECG signal is split into a sequence of non-overlapping segments along the time dimension, and learnable positional embeddings are added to preserve the sequential information. We construct the Fuwai dataset comprising 220,251 ECG recordings with a broad range of diagnoses, annotated by medical experts, to explore the potential of Transformer. A strong pre-training and fine-tuning recipe is proposed from the empirical study. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method increases the macro F1 scores by 3.4%-27.5% on the Fuwai dataset, 9.9%-32.0% on the PTB-XL dataset, and 9.4%-39.1% on a multicenter dataset, compared to the alternative methods. We hope that this study could direct future research on the application of Transformer to more ECG tasks.</description>

      <title>Reliable Majority Vote Computation with Complementary Sequences for UAV Waypoint Flight Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a non-coherent over-the-air computation scheme to calculate the majority vote (MV) reliably in fading channels. The proposed approach relies on modulating the amplitude of the elements of complementary sequences based on the sign of the parameters to be aggregated. Since it does not use channel state information at the nodes, it is compatible with time-varying channels. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we employ it in a scenario where an unmanned aerial vehicle is guided by distributed sensors, relying on the MV computed using our proposed scheme. We show that the proposed scheme notably reduces the computation error rate with a longer sequence length in fading channels while maintaining the peak-to-mean-envelope power ratio of the transmitted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals to be less than or equal to 3 dB.</description>

      <title>An Invitation to Hypercomplex Phase Retrieval: Theory and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypercomplex signal processing (HSP) provides state-of-the-art tools to handle multidimensional signals by harnessing intrinsic correlation of the signal dimensions through Clifford algebra. Recently, the hypercomplex representation of the phase retrieval (PR) problem, wherein a complex-valued signal is estimated through its intensity-only projections, has attracted significant interest. The hypercomplex PR (HPR) arises in many optical imaging and computational sensing applications that usually comprise quaternion and octonion-valued signals. Analogous to the traditional PR, measurements in HPR may involve complex, hypercomplex, Fourier, and other sensing matrices. This set of problems opens opportunities for developing novel HSP tools and algorithms. This article provides a synopsis of the emerging areas and applications of HPR with a focus on optical imaging.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Target Localization: Benchmarking Gradient Descent Using the Cramer-Rao Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern radar systems, precise target localization using azimuth and velocity estimation is paramount. Traditional unbiased estimation methods have utilized gradient descent algorithms to reach the theoretical limits of the Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) for the error of the parameter estimates. As an extension, we demonstrate on a realistic simulated example scenario that our earlier presented data-driven neural network model outperforms these traditional methods, yielding improved accuracies in target azimuth and velocity estimation. We emphasize, however, that this improvement does not imply that the neural network outperforms the CRB itself. Rather, the enhanced performance is attributed to the biased nature of the neural network approach. Our findings underscore the potential of employing deep learning methods in radar systems to achieve more accurate localization in cluttered and dynamic environments.</description>

Abstract: We propose and demonstrate numerically a measurement scheme for complete reconstruction of the 2D quantum wave function of a Bose-Einstein condensate, amplitude and phase, from a time-of-flight measurement. We identify a fundamental ambiguity present in the measurement of phase structures of high-symmetry excitations (e.g., vortices) and show how to overcome it by allowing for different expansion durations in different directions. We demonstrate this approach with the reconstruction of matter-wave vortices and arrays of vortices.</description>

      <title>Multichannel Orthogonal Transform-Based Perceptron Layers for Efficient ResNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a set of transform-based neural network layers as an alternative to the $3\times3$ Conv2D layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed layers can be implemented based on orthogonal transforms such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Hadamard transform (HT), and biorthogonal Block Wavelet Transform (BWT). Furthermore, by taking advantage of the convolution theorems, convolutional filtering operations are performed in the transform domain using element-wise multiplications. Trainable soft-thresholding layers, that remove noise in the transform domain, bring nonlinearity to the transform domain layers. Compared to the Conv2D layer, which is spatial-agnostic and channel-specific, the proposed layers are location-specific and channel-specific. Moreover, these proposed layers reduce the number of parameters and multiplications significantly while improving the accuracy results of regular ResNets on the ImageNet-1K classification task. Furthermore, they can be inserted with a batch normalization layer before the global average pooling layer in the conventional ResNets as an additional layer to improve classification accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07686v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A primary objective of the forthcoming sixth generation (6G) of wireless networking is to support demanding applications, while ensuring energy efficiency. Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) have emerged as a promising solution, leveraging reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), to control wireless propagation and deliver exceptional quality-ofservice. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a network supported by zero-energy RISs (zeRISs), which harvest energy for their operation and contribute to the realization of PWEs. Specifically, we investigate joint energy-data rate outage probability and the energy efficiency of a zeRIS-assisted communication system by employing three harvest-and-reflect (HaR) methods, i) power splitting, ii) time switching, and iii) element splitting. Furthermore, we consider two zeRIS deployment strategies, namely BS-side zeRIS and UE-side zeRIS. Simulation results validate the provided analysis and examine which HaR method performs better depending on the zeRIS placement. Finally, valuable insights and conclusions for the performance of zeRISassisted wireless networks are drawn from the presented results.</description>

      <title>CLEANing Cygnus A deep and fast with R2D2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel deep learning paradigm for synthesis imaging by radio interferometry in astronomy was recently proposed, dubbed "Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic range imaging" (R2D2). In this work, we start by shedding light on R2D2's algorithmic structure, interpreting it as a learned version of CLEAN with minor cycles substituted with a deep neural network (DNN) whose training is iteration-specific. We then proceed with R2D2's first demonstration on real data, for monochromatic intensity imaging of the radio galaxy Cygnus A from S band observations with the Very Large Array (VLA). We show that the modeling power of R2D2's learning approach enables delivering high-precision imaging, superseding the resolution of CLEAN, and matching the precision of modern optimization and plug-and-play algorithms, respectively uSARA and AIRI. Requiring few major-cycle iterations only, R2D2 provides a much faster reconstruction than uSARA and AIRI, known to be highly iterative, and is at least as fast as CLEAN.</description>

      <title>On the View-and-Channel Aggregation Gain in Integrated Sensing and Edge AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) are two key features of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. Their natural integration, termed Integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), is envisioned to automate wide-ranging Internet-of-Tings (IoT) applications. To achieve a high sensing accuracy, multi-view features are uploaded to an edge server for aggregation and inference using an AI model. The view aggregation is realized efficiently using over-the-air computing (AirComp), which also aggregates channels to suppress channel noise. At its nascent stage, ISEA still lacks a characterization of the fundamental performance gains from view-and-channel aggregation, which motivates this work. Our framework leverages a well-established distribution model of multi-view sensing data where the classic Gaussian-mixture model is modified by adding sub-spaces matrices to represent individual sensor observation perspectives. Based on the model, we study the End-to-End sensing (inference) uncertainty, a popular measure of inference accuracy, of the said ISEA system by a novel approach involving designing a scaling-tight uncertainty surrogate function, global discriminant gain, distribution of receive Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and channel induced discriminant loss. We prove that the E2E sensing uncertainty diminishes at an exponential rate as the number of views/sensors grows, where the rate is proportional to global discriminant gain. Given channel distortion, we further show that the exponential scaling remains with a reduced decay rate related to the channel induced discriminant loss. Furthermore, we benchmark AirComp against equally fast, traditional analog orthogonal access, which reveals a sensing-accuracy crossing point between the schemes, leading to the proposal of adaptive access-mode switching. Last, the insights from our framework are validated by experiments using real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>The ESPRIT algorithm under high noise: Optimal error scaling and noisy super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subspace-based signal processing techniques, such as the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm, are popular methods for spectral estimation. These algorithms can achieve the so-called super-resolution scaling under low noise conditions, surpassing the well-known Nyquist limit. However, the performance of these algorithms under high-noise conditions is not as well understood. Existing state-of-the-art analysis indicates that ESPRIT and related algorithms can be resilient even for signals where each observation is corrupted by statistically independent, mean-zero noise of size $\mathcal{O}(1)$, but these analyses only show that the error $\epsilon$ decays at a slow rate $\epsilon=\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{-1/2})$ with respect to the cutoff frequency $n$. In this work, we prove that under certain assumptions of bias and high noise, the ESPRIT algorithm can attain a significantly improved error scaling $\epsilon = \mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{-3/2})$, exhibiting noisy super-resolution scaling beyond the Nyquist limit. We further establish a theoretical lower bound and show that this scaling is optimal. Our analysis introduces novel matrix perturbation results, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel communication-assisted sensing (CAS) framework that explores the potential coordination gains offered by the integrated sensing and communication technique. The CAS system endows users with beyond-line-of-the-sight sensing capabilities, supported by a dual-functional base station that enables simultaneous sensing and communication. To delve into the system's fundamental limits, we characterize the information-theoretic framework of the CAS system in terms of rate-distortion theory. We reveal the achievable overall distortion between the target's state and the reconstructions at the end-user, referred to as the sensing quality of service, within a special case where the distortion metric is separable for sensing and communication processes. As a case study, we employ a typical application to demonstrate distortion minimization under the ISAC signaling strategy, showcasing the potential of CAS in enhancing sensing capabilities.</description>
