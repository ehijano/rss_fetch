      <title>Observing structural disorder induced interacting topological phase in an atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases of matter can appear in noninteracting systems, as in band topology, or interacting systems, such as in spin models, with their defining features typically robust against weak disorder. Intriguingly, disorder itself can also induce topological phases--exemplified by the Anderson topological insulator in noninteracting systems. Experimental studies on disorder induced topology have so far been limited to band topology. Here we report direct observations of structural disorder induced many-body interacting topological phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, causing fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to a regular lattice. The induced topological phase is also vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin one, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices. Our experiments open a new direction for studying the interplay between structural disorder and strongly interacting topological matter in Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Supersonic Flow Past an Obstacle in a Quasi-Two-Dimensional Lee-Huang-Yang Quantum Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A supersonic flow past an obstacle can generate a rich variety of wave excitations. This paper investigates, both analytically and numerically, two types of excitations generated by the flow of a Lee-Huang-Yang quantum fluid past an obstacle: linear radiation and oblique dark solitons. We show that wave crests of linear radiation can be accurately described by the proper modification of the Kelvin original theory, while the oblique dark soliton solution is obtained analytically by transformation of the 1D soliton solution to the obstacle's reference frame. A comparison between analytical predictions and numerical simulations demonstrates good agreement, validating our theoretical approach.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum phase transition in a staggered Bosonic Kitaev chain via layer-resolved localization-delocalization transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bosonic statistics, which allow for macroscopic multi-occupancy of single-particle states, pose significant challenges for analyzing quantum phase transitions in interacting bosonic systems, both analytically and numerically. In this work, we systematically investigate the non-Hermitian Bloch core matrix of a Hermitian staggered bosonic Kitaev chain, formulated within the Nambu framework. We derive explicit analytic conditions for the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the $4\times 4$ Bloch core matrix, with each EP marking the onset of complex-conjugate eigenvalue pairs. By mapping the full many-body Hamiltonian onto an effective tight-binding network in Fock-space and introducing layer-resolved inverse participation ratio, we demonstrate that these EPs coincide precisely with sharp localization--delocalization transitions of collective eigenstates. Comprehensive numerical analyses across hopping amplitudes, pairing strengths, and on-site potentials confirm that the EP of effective Hamiltonian universally capture the global many-body phase boundaries. Our results establish an analytically tractable, EP-based criterion for detecting critical behavior in interacting bosonic lattices, with direct relevance to photonic and cold-atom experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Test of Quantum Gravity in Optical Magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, quantum gravity effects, which can potentially be measured in magnetometers through the Larmor frequency of atoms in an external magnetic field, are estimated. It is shown that the thermal motion of atoms can, in principle, produce measurable quantum gravity effects, given the precision of modern magnetometers. If the particle velocities are caused by some other mechanism, such as convection, it is shown that the quantum gravity effects may be observed with the magnetometer's proposed detection threshold. An actual state-of-the-art optical magnetometer experiment is being designed to search for these effects and is described in a companion paper by Maldaner et al. (2023) [1].</description>

      <title>Single-atom imaging of ${}^{173}$Yb in optical tweezers loaded by a five-beam magneto-optical trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the trapping and imaging of individual ytterbium atoms in arrays of optical tweezers, loaded from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) formed by only five beams in an orthogonal configuration. In our five-beam MOT, operating on the narrow ${}^1$S${}_0 \rightarrow {}^3$P${}_1$ intercombination transition, gravity balances the radiation pressure of a single upward-directed beam. This approach enables efficient trapping and cooling of the most common ytterbium isotopes (${}^{171}$Yb, ${}^{173}$Yb and ${}^{174}$Yb) to $\lesssim 20\,\mu$K at densities $\sim 10^{11}$ atoms/cm$^3$ within less than one second. This configuration allows for significantly reducing the complexity of the optical setup, potentially benefiting any ytterbium-atom based quantum science platform leveraging single-atom microscopy, from quantum processors to novel optical clocks. We then demonstrate the first single-atom-resolved imaging of the fermionic, large-spin isotope ${}^{173}$Yb ($I=5/2$), employing a two-color imaging scheme that does not rely on magic-wavelength trapping. We achieve a high single-atom imaging fidelity of $99.96(1)\%$ and a large survival probability of $98.5(2)\%$, despite large differential light shifts affecting all nuclear spin sublevels of the excited ${}^3$P${}_1$ state involved in the cooling transition. The demonstrated capabilities will play a key role in future quantum simulations and computing applications with ${}^{173}$Yb arrays.</description>

      <title>Interaction Effects on the Electronic Floquet Spectra: Excitonic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES) and ultrafast optical experiments.</description>

      <title>Interplay of localization and topology in disordered dimerized array of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a platform for realizing spin-1/2 Hamiltonians with long-range tunnelings decaying according to power-law with the distance. We numerically investigate the effects of positional disorder and dimerization on the properties of excited states in such a one-dimensional system. Our model allows for the continuous tuning of dimerization patterns and disorder strength. We identify different distinct ergodicity-breaking regimes within the parameter space constrained by our geometry. Notably, one of these regimes exhibits a unique feature in which non-trivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) properties of the ground state extend to a noticeable fraction of states across the entire spectrum. This interplay between localization and SPT makes the system particularly interesting, as localization should help with stabilization of topological excitations, while SPT states contribute to an additional delocalization. Other regions of parameters correspond to more standard nonergodic dynamics resembling many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Observation of Nagaoka Polarons in a Fermi-Hubbard Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum interference can deeply alter the nature of many-body phases of matter. In the paradigmatic case of the Hubbard model, Nagaoka famously proved that introducing a single itinerant charge can transform a paramagnetic insulator into a ferromagnet through path interference. However, a microscopic observation of such kinetic magnetism induced by individually imaged dopants has been so far elusive. Here we demonstrate the emergence of Nagaoka polarons in a Hubbard system realized with strongly interacting fermions in a triangular optical lattice. Using quantum gas microscopy, we reveal these polarons as extended ferromagnetic bubbles around particle dopants arising from the local interplay of coherent dopant motion and spin exchange. In contrast, kinetic frustration due to the triangular geometry promotes antiferromagnetic polarons around hole dopants, as proposed by Haerter and Shastry. Our work augurs the exploration of exotic quantum phases driven by charge motion in strongly correlated systems and over sizes that are challenging for numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Ferrimagnetism of ultracold fermions in a multi-band Hubbard system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials feature multiple electronic orbitals which are crucial to accurately understand their many-body properties, from cuprate materials to twisted bilayer graphene. In such multi-band models, quantum interference can lead to dispersionless bands whose large degeneracy gives rise to itinerant magnetism even with weak interactions. Here, we report on signatures of a ferrimagnetic state realized in a Lieb lattice at half-filling, characterized by antialigned magnetic moments with antiferromagnetic correlations, concomitant with a finite spin polarization. We demonstrate their robustness when increasing repulsive interactions from the non-interacting to the Heisenberg regime, and study their emergence when continuously tuning the lattice unit cell from a square to a Lieb geometry. Our work paves the way towards exploring exotic phases in related multi-orbital models such as quantum spin liquids in kagome lattices and heavy fermion behavior in Kondo models.</description>

      <title>Timescales and necessary conditions for hydrodynamization in one-dimensional Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum evolution of one-dimensional Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both theoretically and experimentally. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behaviors of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. We show that the hydrodynamization epoch is itself characterized by two independent timescales, an oscillation period and an observable-dependent damping time. We also show how the existence of a hydrodynamization epoch depends on the exact nature of the high-energy quench. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unveil the signature of many-body interference across dynamical regimes of the Bose-Hubbard model. Increasing the particles' indistinguishability enhances the temporal fluctuations of few-body observables, with a dramatic amplification at the onset of quantum chaos. By resolving the exchange symmetries of partially distinguishable particles, we explain this amplification as the fingerprint of the initial state's coherences in the eigenbasis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a direct one-to-one correspondence between nonlinear optical fields in defocusing Kerr media and wave functions in weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates or quantum fluids. Based on this correspondence, we propose the existence of excitations in an optical vortex beam characterized by a helical deformation of its phase singularity core. These excitations are direct analogues of Kelvin waves known in quantum and classical fluid dynamics. We further show that the excitations exhibit two distinct branches, one of which includes a stationary solution. A feasible experimental scheme for generating these excitations is also discussed.</description>

      <title>General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.</description>
