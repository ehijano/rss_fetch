      <title>Differentially Private Multi-Sampling from Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many algorithms have been developed to estimate probability distributions subject to differential privacy (DP): such an algorithm takes as input independent samples from a distribution and estimates the density function in a way that is insensitive to any one sample. A recent line of work, initiated by Raskhodnikova et al. (Neurips '21), explores a weaker objective: a differentially private algorithm that approximates a single sample from the distribution. Raskhodnikova et al. studied the sample complexity of DP \emph{single-sampling} i.e., the minimum number of samples needed to perform this task. They showed that the sample complexity of DP single-sampling is less than the sample complexity of DP learning for certain distribution classes. We define two variants of \emph{multi-sampling}, where the goal is to privately approximate $m&gt;1$ samples. This better models the realistic scenario where synthetic data is needed for exploratory data analysis.
  A baseline solution to \emph{multi-sampling} is to invoke a single-sampling algorithm $m$ times on independently drawn datasets of samples. When the data comes from a finite domain, we improve over the baseline by a factor of $m$ in the sample complexity. When the data comes from a Gaussian, Ghazi et al. (Neurips '23) show that \emph{single-sampling} can be performed under approximate differential privacy; we show it is possible to \emph{single- and multi-sample Gaussians with known covariance subject to pure DP}. Our solution uses a variant of the Laplace mechanism that is of independent interest.
  We also give sample complexity lower bounds, one for strong multi-sampling of finite distributions and another for weak multi-sampling of bounded-covariance Gaussians.</description>

      <title>ExclaveFL: Providing Transparency to Federated Learning using Exclaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), data providers jointly train a model without disclosing their training data. Despite its privacy benefits, a malicious data provider can simply deviate from the correct training protocol without being detected, thus attacking the trained model. While current solutions have explored the use of trusted execution environment (TEEs) to combat such attacks, there is a mismatch with the security needs of FL: TEEs offer confidentiality guarantees, which are unnecessary for FL and make them vulnerable to side-channel attacks, and focus on coarse-grained attestation, which does not capture the execution of FL training.
  We describe ExclaveFL, an FL platform that achieves end-to-end transparency and integrity for detecting attacks. ExclaveFL achieves this by employing a new hardware security abstraction, exclaves, which focus on integrity-only guarantees. ExclaveFL uses exclaves to protect the execution of FL tasks, while generating signed statements containing fine-grained, hardware-based attestation reports of task execution at runtime. ExclaveFL then enables auditing using these statements to construct an attested dataflow graph and then check that the FL training jobs satisfies claims, such as the absence of attacks. Our experiments show that ExclaveFL introduces a less than 9% overhead while detecting a wide-range of attacks.</description>

      <title>Client-Side Patching against Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning is a versatile framework for training models in decentralized environments. However, the trust placed in clients makes federated learning vulnerable to backdoor attacks launched by malicious participants. While many defenses have been proposed, they often fail short when facing heterogeneous data distributions among participating clients. In this paper, we propose a novel defense mechanism for federated learning systems designed to mitigate backdoor attacks on the clients-side. Our approach leverages adversarial learning techniques and model patching to neutralize the impact of backdoor attacks. Through extensive experiments on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our defense effectively reduces backdoor accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art defenses, such as LFighter, FLAME, and RoseAgg, in i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. scenarios, while maintaining competitive or superior accuracy on clean data.</description>

      <title>A Trust-Centric Approach To Quantifying Maturity and Security in Internet Voting Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voting is a cornerstone of collective participatory decision-making in contexts ranging from political elections to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Despite the proliferation of internet voting protocols promising enhanced accessibility and efficiency, their evaluation and comparison are complicated by a lack of standardized criteria and unified definitions of security and maturity. Furthermore, socio-technical requirements by decision makers are not structurally taken into consideration when comparing internet voting systems. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a trust-centric maturity scoring framework to quantify the security and maturity of sixteen internet voting systems. A comprehensive trust model analysis is conducted for selected internet voting protocols, examining their security properties, trust assumptions, technical complexity, and practical usability. In this paper we propose the electronic voting maturity framework (EVMF) which supports nuanced assessment that reflects real-world deployment concerns and aids decision-makers in selecting appropriate systems tailored to their specific use-case requirements. The framework is general enough to be applied to other systems, where the aspects of decentralization, trust, and security are crucial, such as digital identity, Ethereum layer-two scaling solutions, and federated data infrastructures. Its objective is to provide an extendable toolkit for policy makers and technology experts alike that normalizes technical and non-technical requirements on a univariate scale.</description>

      <title>Meeting Utility Constraints in Differential Privacy: A Privacy-Boosting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data engineering often requires accuracy (utility) constraints on results, posing significant challenges in designing differentially private (DP) mechanisms, particularly under stringent privacy parameter $\epsilon$. In this paper, we propose a privacy-boosting framework that is compatible with most noise-adding DP mechanisms. Our framework enhances the likelihood of outputs falling within a preferred subset of the support to meet utility requirements while enlarging the overall variance to reduce privacy leakage. We characterize the privacy loss distribution of our framework and present the privacy profile formulation for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and R\'enyi DP (RDP) guarantees. We study special cases involving data-dependent and data-independent utility formulations. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework achieves lower privacy loss than standard DP mechanisms under utility constraints. Notably, our approach is particularly effective in reducing privacy loss with large query sensitivity relative to the true answer, offering a more practical and flexible approach to designing differentially private mechanisms that meet specific utility constraints.</description>

      <title>BinarySelect to Improve Accessibility of Black-Box Attack Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial text attack research is useful for testing the robustness of NLP models, however, the rise of transformers has greatly increased the time required to test attacks. Especially when researchers do not have access to adequate resources (e.g. GPUs). This can hinder attack research, as modifying one example for an attack can require hundreds of queries to a model, especially for black-box attacks. Often these attacks remove one token at a time to find the ideal one to change, requiring $n$ queries (the length of the text) right away. We propose a more efficient selection method called BinarySelect which combines binary search and attack selection methods to greatly reduce the number of queries needed to find a token. We find that BinarySelect only needs $\text{log}_2(n) * 2$ queries to find the first token compared to $n$ queries. We also test BinarySelect in an attack setting against 5 classifiers across 3 datasets and find a viable tradeoff between number of queries saved and attack effectiveness. For example, on the Yelp dataset, the number of queries is reduced by 32% (72 less) with a drop in attack effectiveness of only 5 points. We believe that BinarySelect can help future researchers study adversarial attacks and black-box problems more efficiently and opens the door for researchers with access to less resources.</description>

      <title>On the Cyber-Physical Security of Commercial Indoor Delivery Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor Delivery Robots (IDRs) play a vital role in the upcoming fourth industrial revolution, autonomously navigating and transporting items within indoor environments. In this work, we thus aim to conduct the first security analysis of the IDR systems considering both cyber- and physical-layer attack surface and domain-specific attack goals across security, safety, and privacy. As initial results, we formulated a general IDR system architecture from 40 commercial IDR models and then performed an initial cyber-physical attack entry point identification. We also performed an experimental analysis of a real commercial IDR robot-side software and identified several vulnerabilities. We then discuss future steps.</description>

      <title>A technical solution for the rule of law, peace, security, and evolvability of global cyberspace -- solve the three genetic defects of IP network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its inception in the 1960s, the internet has profoundly transformed human life. However, its original design now struggles to meet the evolving demands of modern society. Three primary defects have emerged: First, the concentration of power among a few dominant entities has intensified international conflicts and widened the technological divide. Second, the Internet Protocol (IP)-based system lacks inherent security, leading to frequent global cybersecurity incidents. Third, the rigidity of the IP protocol has hindered the sustainable development of cyberspace, as it resists necessary adaptations and innovations. Addressing these issues is crucial for the future resilience and security of the global digital landscape.
  To address these challenges, we propose the Co-governed Multi-Identifier Network (CoG-MIN briefly as MIN), a novel network architecture that leverages blockchain technology to ensure equal participation of countries worldwide in cyberspace governance and the rule of law. As a next-generation network system, CoG-MIN integrates mechanisms such as user authentication, data signatures, and encryption to significantly enhance network security. In testing environments, CoG-MIN has consistently withstood extensive attacks during various international cybersecurity competitions. Additionally, CoG-MIN supports the evolution and interoperability of different identifier systems, remains IP-compatible, and facilitates a gradual transition away from IP, providing an adaptable ecosystem for diverse network architectures. This adaptability fosters the development and evolution of diverse network architectures within CoG-MIN, making it a natural progression for the internet's future development.
  We further introduce a trilogy of cyberspace security theorems... (Due to character limitations, the full abstract is available in the paper PDF.)</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Unknown Attacks in Smart Homes Using Abductive Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security attacks are rising, as evidenced by the number of reported vulnerabilities. Among them, unknown attacks, including new variants of existing attacks, technical blind spots or previously undiscovered attacks, challenge enduring security. This is due to the limited number of techniques that diagnose these attacks and enable the selection of adequate security controls. In this paper, we propose an automated technique that detects and diagnoses unknown attacks by identifying the class of attack and the violated security requirements, enabling the selection of adequate security controls. Our technique combines anomaly detection to detect unknown attacks with abductive reasoning to diagnose them. We first model the behaviour of the smart home and its requirements as a logic program in Answer Set Programming (ASP). We then apply Z-Score thresholding to the anomaly scores of an Isolation Forest trained using unlabeled data to simulate unknown attack scenarios. Finally, we encode the network anomaly in the logic program and perform abduction by refutation to identify the class of attack and the security requirements that this anomaly may violate. We demonstrate our technique using a smart home scenario, where we detect and diagnose anomalies in network traffic. We evaluate the precision, recall and F1-score of the anomaly detector and the diagnosis technique against 18 attacks from the ground truth labels provided by two datasets, CICIoT2023 and IoT-23. Our experiments show that the anomaly detector effectively identifies anomalies when the network traces are strong indicators of an attack. When provided with sufficient contextual data, the diagnosis logic effectively identifies true anomalies, and reduces the number of false positives reported by anomaly detectors. Finally, we discuss how our technique can support the selection of adequate security controls.</description>

      <title>IoT-Enabled Smart Car Parking System through Integrated Sensors and Mobile Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to more population congestion and car ownership, the provision of parking spaces for vehicles is becoming a crucial factor. This paper aims to present a novel Internet of Things (IoT)--based smart car parking system that can effectively manage these problems with the help of sensor technology and automation. Infrared (IR) sensors, DHT22 sensors, MQ-2 gas sensors, and servo motors are used in the parking space. An OLED display shows the status of parking slots in real-time. Communicating with a mobile application through the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol enables the efficient exchange of data. As a result, this innovative solution optimizes parking space, increases efficiency, and makes the parking lot more comfortable. This IoT system allows real-time monitoring and automation of parked cars as well as fast response to dynamic changes in environmental conditions, setting a new standard for smart parking systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Action Hijacking of Large Language Model-based Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past few years, intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in performing complex tasks. These LLM-based agents receive queries as tasks and decompose them into various subtasks via the equipped LLMs to guide the action of external entities (\eg{}, tools, AI-agents) to answer the questions from users. Empowered by their exceptional capabilities of understanding and problem-solving, they are widely adopted in labor-intensive sectors including healthcare, finance, code completion, \etc{} At the same time, there are also concerns about the potential misuse of these agents, prompting the built-in safety guards from service providers. To circumvent the built-in guidelines, the prior studies proposed a multitude of attacks including memory poisoning, jailbreak, and prompt injection. These studies often fail to maintain effectiveness across safety filters employed by agents due to the restricted privileges and the harmful semantics in queries. In this paper, we introduce \Name, a novel hijacking attack to manipulate the action plans of black-box agent system. \Name first collects the action-aware memory through prompt theft from long-term memory. It then leverages the internal memory retrieval mechanism of the agent to provide an erroneous context. The huge gap between the latent spaces of the retriever and safety filters allows our method to bypass the detection easily. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our apporach (\eg{}, 99.67\% ASR). Besides, our approach achieved an average bypass rate of 92.7\% for safety filters.</description>

      <title>CEKER: A Generalizable LLM Framework for Literature Analysis with a Case Study in Unikernel Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Literature reviews are a critical component of formulating and justifying new research, but are a manual and often time-consuming process. This research introduces a novel, generalizable approach to literature analysis called CEKER which uses a three-step process to streamline the collection of literature, the extraction of key insights, and the summarized analysis of key trends and gaps. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), this methodology represents a significant shift from traditional manual literature reviews, offering a scalable, flexible, and repeatable approach that can be applied across diverse research domains.
  A case study on unikernel security illustrates CEKER's ability to generate novel insights validated against previous manual methods. CEKER's analysis highlighted reduced attack surface as the most prominent theme. Key security gaps included the absence of Address Space Layout Randomization, missing debugging tools, and limited entropy generation, all of which represent important challenges to unikernel security. The study also revealed a reliance on hypervisors as a potential attack vector and emphasized the need for dynamic security adjustments to address real-time threats.</description>

      <title>Automatically Detecting Checked-In Secrets in Android Apps: How Far Are We?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile apps are predominantly integrated with cloud services to benefit from enhanced functionalities. Adopting authentication using secrets such as API keys is crucial to ensure secure mobile-cloud interactions. However, developers often overlook the proper storage of such secrets, opting to put them directly into their projects. These secrets are checked into the projects and can be easily extracted and exploited by malicious adversaries. While many researchers investigated the issue of checked-in secret in open-source projects, there is a notable research gap concerning checked-in secrets in Android apps deployed on platforms such as Google Play Store. Unlike open-source projects, the lack of direct access to the source code and the presence of obfuscation complicates the checked-in secret detection for Android apps. This motivates us to conduct an empirical analysis to measure and compare the performance of different checked-in secret detection tools on Android apps. We first conducted a literature review to find all the checked-in secret detection tools that can be applied to Android apps. Then, we evaluate three representative tools on 5,135 Android apps, comparing their performance and analyzing their limitations. Our experiment reveals 2,142 checked-in secrets affecting 2,115 Android apps. We also disclose that the current checked-in secret detection techniques suffer from key limitations. All of the evaluated tools can miss a significant number of checked-in secrets in Android apps. Nevertheless, we observed that the tools are complimentary, suggesting the possibility of developing a more effective checked-in secret detection tool by combining their insights. Additionally, we propose that analyzing string groups within methods containing checked-in secrets may provide a more effective strategy to overcome obfuscation challenges.</description>

      <title>Labeling NIDS Rules with MITRE ATT&amp;CK Techniques: Machine Learning vs. Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysts in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are often occupied with time-consuming investigations of alerts from Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Many NIDS rules lack clear explanations and associations with attack techniques, complicating the alert triage and the generation of attack hypotheses. Large Language Models (LLMs) may be a promising technology to reduce the alert explainability gap by associating rules with attack techniques. In this paper, we investigate the ability of three prominent LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini) to reason about NIDS rules while labeling them with MITRE ATT&amp;CK tactics and techniques. We discuss prompt design and present experiments performed with 973 Snort rules. Our results indicate that while LLMs provide explainable, scalable, and efficient initial mappings, traditional Machine Learning (ML) models consistently outperform them in accuracy, achieving higher precision, recall, and F1-scores. These results highlight the potential for hybrid LLM-ML approaches to enhance SOC operations and better address the evolving threat landscape.</description>

      <title>Serial Scammers and Attack of the Clones: How Scammers Coordinate Multiple Rug Pulls on Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explored in this work the ubiquitous phenomenon of serial scammers, who deploy thousands of addresses to conduct a series of similar Rug Pulls on popular decentralized exchanges (DEXs). We first constructed a list of about 384,000 scammer addresses behind all 1-day Rug Pulls on the two most popular DEXs, Uniswap (Ethereum) and Pancakeswap (BSC), and identified many distinctive scam patterns including star-shaped, chain-shaped, and majority-flow scam clusters. We then proposed an algorithm to build a complete scam network from given scammer addresses, which consists of not only scammer addresses but also supporting addresses including depositors, withdrawers, transferrers, coordinators, and most importantly, wash traders. We note that profit estimations in existing works on Rug Pulls failed to capture the cost of wash trading, leading to inflated figures. Knowing who the wash traders are, we established a more accurate estimate for the true profit of individual scam pools as well as of the entire (serial) scam network by taking into account the wash-trading expenses.</description>

      <title>Semantic Steganography: A Framework for Robust and High-Capacity Information Hiding using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), generative linguistic steganography has become a prevalent technique for hiding information within model-generated texts. However, traditional steganography methods struggle to effectively align steganographic texts with original model-generated texts due to the lower entropy of the predicted probability distribution of LLMs. This results in a decrease in embedding capacity and poses challenges for decoding stegos in real-world communication channels. To address these challenges, we propose a semantic steganography framework based on LLMs, which construct a semantic space and map secret messages onto this space using ontology-entity trees. This framework offers robustness and reliability for transmission in complex channels, as well as resistance to text rendering and word blocking. Additionally, the stegos generated by our framework are indistinguishable from the covers and achieve a higher embedding capacity compared to state-of-the-art steganography methods, while producing higher quality stegos.</description>

      <title>SpearBot: Leveraging Large Language Models in a Generative-Critique Framework for Spear-Phishing Email Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable, aiding in tasks such as content generation, yet they also pose risks, particularly in generating harmful spear-phishing emails. These emails, crafted to entice clicks on malicious URLs, threaten personal information security. This paper proposes an adversarial framework, SpearBot, which utilizes LLMs to generate spear-phishing emails with various phishing strategies. Through specifically crafted jailbreak prompts, SpearBot circumvents security policies and introduces other LLM instances as critics. When a phishing email is identified by the critic, SpearBot refines the generated email based on the critique feedback until it can no longer be recognized as phishing, thereby enhancing its deceptive quality. To evaluate the effectiveness of SpearBot, we implement various machine-based defenders and assess how well the phishing emails generated could deceive them. Results show these emails often evade detection to a large extent, underscoring their deceptive quality. Additionally, human evaluations of the emails' readability and deception are conducted through questionnaires, confirming their convincing nature and the significant potential harm of the generated phishing emails.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Migration Framework for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a cornerstone of blockchain technology in the 3.0 era, smart contracts play a pivotal role in the evolution of blockchain systems. In order to address the limitations of existing smart contract vulnerability detection models with regard to their generalisation capability, an AF-STip smart contract vulnerability detection framework incorporating efficient knowledge migration is proposed. AF-STip employs the teacher network as the main model and migrates the knowledge processed by the smart contract to the student model using a data-free knowledge distillation method. The student model utilises this knowledge to enhance its vulnerability detection capabilities. The approach markedly enhances the model's capacity for feature extraction and cross-class adaptation, while concurrently reducing computational overhead.In order to further enhance the extraction of vulnerability features, an adaptive fusion module is proposed in this paper, which aims to strengthen the interaction and fusion of feature information.The experimental results demonstrate that the STip model attains an average F1 value detection score of 91.16% for the four vulnerabilities without disclosing the original smart contract data. To validate the viability of the proposed lightweight migration approach, the student model is deployed in a migration learning task targeting a novel vulnerability type, resulting in an accuracy of 91.02% and an F1 score of 90.46%. To the best of our knowledge, AF-STip is the inaugural model to apply data-free knowledge migration to smart contract vulnerability detection. While markedly reducing the computational overhead, the method still demonstrates exceptional performance in detecting novel vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>PSGraph: Differentially Private Streaming Graph Synthesis by Considering Temporal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streaming graphs are ubiquitous in daily life, such as evolving social networks and dynamic communication systems. Due to the sensitive information contained in the graph, directly sharing the streaming graphs poses significant privacy risks. Differential privacy, offering strict theoretical guarantees, has emerged as a standard approach for private graph data synthesis. However, existing methods predominantly focus on static graph publishing, neglecting the intrinsic relationship between adjacent graphs, thereby resulting in limited performance in streaming data publishing scenarios. To address this gap, we propose PSGraph, the first differentially private streaming graph synthesis framework that integrates temporal dynamics. PSGraph adaptively adjusts the privacy budget allocation mechanism by analyzing the variations in the current graph compared to the previous one for conserving the privacy budget. Moreover, PSGraph aggregates information across various timestamps and adopts crucial post-processing techniques to enhance the synthetic streaming graphs. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets under five commonly used metrics. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of PSGraph.</description>

      <title>UIBDiffusion: Universal Imperceptible Backdoor Attack for Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies show that diffusion models (DMs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks impose unconcealed triggers (e.g., a gray box and eyeglasses) that contain evident patterns, rendering remarkable attack effects yet easy detection upon human inspection and defensive algorithms. While it is possible to improve stealthiness by reducing the strength of the backdoor, doing so can significantly compromise its generality and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose UIBDiffusion, the universal imperceptible backdoor attack for diffusion models, which allows us to achieve superior attack and generation performance while evading state-of-the-art defenses. We propose a novel trigger generation approach based on universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) and reveal that such perturbations, which are initially devised for fooling pre-trained discriminative models, can be adapted as potent imperceptible backdoor triggers for DMs. We evaluate UIBDiffusion on multiple types of DMs with different kinds of samplers across various datasets and targets. Experimental results demonstrate that UIBDiffusion brings three advantages: 1) Universality, the imperceptible trigger is universal (i.e., image and model agnostic) where a single trigger is effective to any images and all diffusion models with different samplers; 2) Utility, it achieves comparable generation quality (e.g., FID) and even better attack success rate (i.e., ASR) at low poison rates compared to the prior works; and 3) Undetectability, UIBDiffusion is plausible to human perception and can bypass Elijah and TERD, the SOTA defenses against backdoors for DMs. We will release our backdoor triggers and code.</description>

      <title>Red Pill and Blue Pill: Controllable Website Fingerprinting Defense via Dynamic Backdoor Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Website fingerprint (WF) attacks, which covertly monitor user communications to identify the web pages they visit, pose a serious threat to user privacy. Existing WF defenses attempt to reduce the attacker's accuracy by disrupting unique traffic patterns; however, they often suffer from the trade-off between overhead and effectiveness, resulting in less usefulness in practice. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Controllable Website Fingerprint Defense (CWFD), a novel defense perspective based on backdoor learning. CWFD exploits backdoor vulnerabilities in neural networks to directly control the attacker's model by designing trigger patterns based on network traffic. Specifically, CWFD injects only incoming packets on the server side into the target web page's traffic, keeping overhead low while effectively poisoning the attacker's model during training. During inference, the defender can influence the attacker's model through a 'red pill, blue pill' choice: traces with the trigger (red pill) lead to misclassification as the target web page, while normal traces (blue pill) are classified correctly, achieving directed control over the defense outcome. We use the Fast Levenshtein-like distance as the optimization objective to compute trigger patterns that can be effectively associated with our target page. Experiments show that CWFD significantly reduces RF's accuracy from 99% to 6% with 74% data overhead. In comparison, FRONT reduces accuracy to only 97% at similar overhead, while Palette achieves 32% accuracy with 48% more overhead. We further validate the practicality of our method in a real Tor network environment.</description>

      <title>Noise-Resilient Homomorphic Encryption: A Framework for Secure Data Processing in Health care Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Fully Homomorphic Integrity Model (HIM), a novel approach designed to enhance security, efficiency, and reliability in encrypted data processing, primarily within the health care industry. HIM addresses the key challenges that noise accumulation, computational overheads, and data integrity pose during homomorphic operations. Our contribution of HIM: advances in noise management through the rational number adjustment; key generation based on personalized prime numbers; and time complexity analysis details for key operations. In HIM, some additional mechanisms were introduced, including robust mechanisms of decryption. Indeed, the decryption mechanism ensures that the data recovered upon doing complex homomorphic computation will be valid and reliable. The healthcare id model is tested, and it supports real-time processing of data with privacy maintained concerning patients. It supports analytics and decision-making processes without any compromise on the integrity of information concerning patients. Output HIM promotes the efficiency of encryption to a greater extent as it reduces the encryption time up to 35ms and decryption time up to 140ms, which is better when compared to other models in the existence. Ciphertext size also becomes the smallest one, which is 4KB. Our experiments confirm that HIM is indeed a very efficient and secure privacy-preserving solution for healthcare applications</description>

      <title>WFCAT: Augmenting Website Fingerprinting with Channel-wise Attention on Timing Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Website Fingerprinting (WF) aims to deanonymize users on the Tor network by analyzing encrypted network traffic. Recent deep-learning-based attacks show high accuracy on undefended traces. However, they struggle against modern defenses that use tactics like injecting dummy packets and delaying real packets, which significantly degrade classification performance. Our analysis reveals that current attacks inadequately leverage the timing information inherent in traffic traces, which persists as a source of leakage even under robust defenses. Addressing this shortfall, we introduce a novel feature representation named the Inter-Arrival Time (IAT) histogram, which quantifies the frequencies of packet inter-arrival times across predetermined time slots. Complementing this feature, we propose a new CNN-based attack, WFCAT, enhanced with two innovative architectural blocks designed to optimally extract and utilize timing information. Our approach uses kernels of varying sizes to capture multi-scale features, which are then integrated using a weighted sum across all feature channels to enhance the model's efficacy in identifying temporal patterns. Our experiments validate that WFCAT substantially outperforms existing methods on defended traces in both closed- and open-world scenarios. Notably, WFCAT achieves over 59% accuracy against Surakav, a recently developed robust defense, marking an improvement of over 28% and 48% against the state-of-the-art attacks RF and Tik-Tok, respectively, in the closed-world scenario.</description>

Abstract: This paper reviews work published between 2002 and 2022 in the fields of Android malware, clone, and similarity detection. It examines the data sources, tools, and features used in existing research and identifies the need for a comprehensive, cross-domain dataset to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and the exploitation of synergies between different research areas. Furthermore, it shows that many research papers do not publish the dataset or a description of how it was created, making it difficult to reproduce or compare the results. The paper highlights the necessity for a dataset that is accessible, well-documented, and suitable for a range of applications. Guidelines are provided for this purpose, along with a schematic method for creating the dataset.</description>

      <title>OTA-Key: Over the Air Key Management for Flexible and Reliable IoT Device Provision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the Internet of Things (IoT) industry advances, the imperative to secure IoT devices has become increasingly critical. Current practices in both industry and academia advocate for the enhancement of device security through key installation. However, it has been observed that, in practice, IoT vendors frequently assign shared keys to batches of devices. This practice can expose devices to risks, such as data theft by attackers or large-scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. To address this issue, our intuition is to assign a unique key to each device. Unfortunately, this strategy proves to be highly complex within the IoT context, as existing keys are typically hardcoded into the firmware, necessitating the creation of bespoke firmware for each device. Furthermore, correct pairing of device keys with their respective devices is crucial. Errors in this pairing process would incur substantial human and temporal resources to rectify and require extensive communication between IoT vendors, device manufacturers, and cloud platforms, leading to significant communication overhead. To overcome these challenges, we propose the OTA-Key scheme. This approach fundamentally decouples device keys from the firmware features stored in flash memory, utilizing an intermediary server to allocate unique device keys in two distinct stages and update keys. We conducted a formal security verification of our scheme using ProVerif and assessed its performance through a series of evaluations. The results demonstrate that our scheme is secure and effectively manages the large-scale distribution and updating of unique device keys. Additionally, it achieves significantly lower update times and data transfer volumes compared to other schemes.</description>

      <title>DB-PAISA: Discovery-Based Privacy-Agile IoT Sensing+Actuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming increasingly commonplace in numerous public and semi-private settings. Currently, most such devices lack mechanisms to facilitate their discovery by casual (nearby) users who are not owners or operators. However, these users are potentially being sensed, and/or actuated upon, by these devices, without their knowledge or consent. This naturally triggers privacy, security, and safety issues.
  To address this problem, some recent work explored device transparency in the IoT ecosystem. The intuitive approach is for each device to periodically and securely broadcast (announce) its presence and capabilities to all nearby users. While effective, when no new users are present, this push-based approach generates a substantial amount of unnecessary network traffic and needlessly interferes with normal device operation.
  In this work, we construct DB-PAISA which addresses these issues via a pull-based method, whereby devices reveal their presence and capabilities only upon explicit user request. Each device guarantees a secure timely response (even if fully compromised by malware) based on a small active Root-of-Trust (RoT). DB-PAISA requires no hardware modifications and is suitable for a range of current IoT devices. To demonstrate its feasibility and practicality, we built a fully functional and publicly available prototype. It is implemented atop a commodity MCU (NXP LCP55S69) and operates in tandem with a smartphone-based app. Using this prototype, we evaluate energy consumption and other performance factors.</description>

Abstract: Model inference systems are essential for implementing end-to-end data analytics pipelines that deliver the benefits of machine learning models to users. Existing cloud-based model inference systems are costly, not easy to scale, and must be trusted in handling the models and user request data. Serverless computing presents a new opportunity, as it provides elasticity and fine-grained pricing. Our goal is to design a serverless model inference system that protects models and user request data from untrusted cloud providers. It offers high performance and low cost, while requiring no intrusive changes to the current serverless platforms. To realize our goal, we leverage trusted hardware. We identify and address three challenges in using trusted hardware for serverless model inference. These challenges arise from the high-level abstraction of serverless computing, the performance overhead of trusted hardware, and the characteristics of model inference workloads. We present SeSeMI, a secure, efficient, and cost-effective serverless model inference system. It adds three novel features non-intrusively to the existing serverless infrastructure and nothing else.The first feature is a key service that establishes secure channels between the user and the serverless instances, which also provides access control to models and users' data. The second is an enclave runtime that allows one enclave to process multiple concurrent requests. The final feature is a model packer that allows multiple models to be executed by one serverless instance. We build SeSeMI on top of Apache OpenWhisk, and conduct extensive experiments with three popular machine learning models. The results show that SeSeMI achieves low latency and low cost at scale for realistic workloads.</description>

      <title>On Large Language Models in Mission-Critical IT Governance: Are We Ready Yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The security of critical infrastructure has been a fundamental concern since the advent of computers, and this concern has only intensified in today's cyber warfare landscape. Protecting mission-critical systems (MCSs), including essential assets like healthcare, telecommunications, and military coordination, is vital for national security. These systems require prompt and comprehensive governance to ensure their resilience, yet recent events have shown that meeting these demands is increasingly challenging. Aim. Building on prior research that demonstrated the potential of GAI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in improving risk analysis tasks, we aim to explore practitioners' perspectives, specifically developers and security personnel, on using generative AI (GAI) in the governance of IT MCSs seeking to provide insights and recommendations for various stakeholders, including researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. Method. We designed a survey to collect practical experiences, concerns, and expectations of practitioners who develop and implement security solutions in the context of MCSs. Analyzing this data will help identify key trends, challenges, and opportunities for introducing GAIs in this niche domain. Conclusions and Future Works. Our findings highlight that the safe use of LLMs in MCS governance requires interdisciplinary collaboration. Researchers should focus on designing regulation-oriented models and focus on accountability; practitioners emphasize data protection and transparency, while policymakers must establish a unified AI framework with global benchmarks to ensure ethical and secure LLMs-based MCS governance.</description>

      <title>Efficient Layered New Bit-Flipping QC-MDPC Decoder for BIKE Post-Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The medium-density parity-check (MDPC) code-based Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE) mechanism remains a candidate of post-quantum cryptography standardization. The latest version utilizes a new bit-flipping (BF) decoding algorithm, which decides the BF threshold by an affine function with high-precision coefficients. Previous BF decoder implementations can be extended to the new algorithm. However, they suffer from large memories that dominate the overall complexity. This paper proposes a column-layered decoder for the new BIKE BF decoding algorithm to substantially reduce the memory requirement, and optimizes the affine BF threshold function coefficients to reduce the code length needed for the same security level. For the first time, our work also investigates the impact of finite precision representation of the threshold coefficients on the decoding performance. For an example MDPC code considered for the standard, the proposed layered BF decoder achieves 20% complexity reduction compared to the best prior effort with a very small latency overhead.</description>

      <title>Can LLM Prompting Serve as a Proxy for Static Analysis in Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their remarkable success, large language models (LLMs) have shown limited ability on applied tasks such as vulnerability detection. We investigate various prompting strategies for vulnerability detection and, as part of this exploration, propose a prompting strategy that integrates natural language descriptions of vulnerabilities with a contrastive chain-of-thought reasoning approach, augmented using contrastive samples from a synthetic dataset. Our study highlights the potential of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities by integrating natural language descriptions, contrastive reasoning, and synthetic examples into a comprehensive prompting framework. Our results show that this approach can enhance LLM understanding of vulnerabilities. On a high-quality vulnerability detection dataset such as SVEN, our prompting strategies can improve accuracies, F1-scores, and pairwise accuracies by 23%, 11%, and 14%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Imitate Before Detect: Aligning Machine Stylistic Preference for Machine-Revised Text Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized text generation, making detecting machine-generated text increasingly challenging. Although past methods have achieved good performance on detecting pure machine-generated text, those detectors have poor performance on distinguishing machine-revised text (rewriting, expansion, and polishing), which can have only minor changes from its original human prompt. As the content of text may originate from human prompts, detecting machine-revised text often involves identifying distinctive machine styles, e.g., worded favored by LLMs. However, existing methods struggle to detect machine-style phrasing hidden within the content contributed by humans. We propose the "Imitate Before Detect" (ImBD) approach, which first imitates the machine-style token distribution, and then compares the distribution of the text to be tested with the machine-style distribution to determine whether the text has been machine-revised. To this end, we introduce style preference optimization (SPO), which aligns a scoring LLM model to the preference of text styles generated by machines. The aligned scoring model is then used to calculate the style-conditional probability curvature (Style-CPC), quantifying the log probability difference between the original and conditionally sampled texts for effective detection. We conduct extensive comparisons across various scenarios, encompassing text revisions by six LLMs, four distinct text domains, and three machine revision types. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, our method yields a 13% increase in AUC for detecting text revised by open-source LLMs, and improves performance by 5% and 19% for detecting GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o revised text, respectively. Notably, our method surpasses the commercially trained GPT-Zero with just $1,000$ samples and five minutes of SPO, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Steganography in Game Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of subliminal communication has been addressed in various forms of steganography, primarily relying on visual, auditory and linguistic media. However, the field faces a fundamental paradox: as the art of concealment advances, so too does the science of revelation, leading to an ongoing evolutionary interplay. This study seeks to extend the boundaries of what is considered a viable steganographic medium. We explore a steganographic paradigm, where hidden information is communicated through the episodes of multiple agents interacting with an environment. Each agent, acting as an encoder, learns a policy to disguise the very existence of hidden messages within actions seemingly directed toward innocent objectives. Meanwhile, an observer, serving as a decoder, learns to associate behavioural patterns with their respective agents despite their dynamic nature, thereby unveiling the hidden messages. The interactions of agents are governed by the framework of multi-agent reinforcement learning and shaped by feedback from the observer. This framework encapsulates a game-theoretic dilemma, wherein agents face decisions between cooperating to create distinguishable behavioural patterns or defecting to pursue individually optimal yet potentially overlapping episodic actions. As a proof of concept, we exemplify action steganography through the game of labyrinth, a navigation task where subliminal communication is concealed within the act of steering toward a destination. The stego-system has been systematically validated through experimental evaluations, assessing its distortion and capacity alongside its secrecy and robustness when subjected to simulated passive and active adversaries.</description>

      <title>Identifying Predictions That Influence the Future: Detecting Performative Concept Drift in Data Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concept Drift has been extensively studied within the context of Stream Learning. However, it is often assumed that the deployed model's predictions play no role in the concept drift the system experiences. Closer inspection reveals that this is not always the case. Automated trading might be prone to self-fulfilling feedback loops. Likewise, malicious entities might adapt to evade detectors in the adversarial setting resulting in a self-negating feedback loop that requires the deployed models to constantly retrain. Such settings where a model may induce concept drift are called performative. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon. Our contributions are as follows: First, we define performative drift within a stream learning setting and distinguish it from other causes of drift. We introduce a novel type of drift detection task, aimed at identifying potential performative concept drift in data streams. We propose a first such performative drift detection approach, called CheckerBoard Performative Drift Detection (CB-PDD). We apply CB-PDD to both synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets that exhibit varying degrees of self-fulfilling feedback loops. Results are positive with CB-PDD showing high efficacy, low false detection rates, resilience to intrinsic drift, comparability to other drift detection techniques, and an ability to effectively detect performative drift in semi-synthetic datasets. Secondly, we highlight the role intrinsic (traditional) drift plays in obfuscating performative drift and discuss the implications of these findings as well as the limitations of CB-PDD.</description>

      <title>Edge AI-based Radio Frequency Fingerprinting for IoT Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart cities and critical infrastructure has enhanced connectivity and real-time data exchange but introduced significant security challenges. While effective, cryptography can often be resource-intensive for small-footprint resource-constrained (i.e., IoT) devices. Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) offers a promising authentication alternative by using unique RF signal characteristics for device identification at the Physical (PHY)-layer, without resorting to cryptographic solutions. The challenge is two-fold: how to deploy such RFF in a large scale and for resource-constrained environments. Edge computing, processing data closer to its source, i.e., the wireless device, enables faster decision-making, reducing reliance on centralized cloud servers. Considering a modest edge device, we introduce two truly lightweight Edge AI-based RFF schemes tailored for resource-constrained devices. We implement two Deep Learning models, namely a Convolution Neural Network and a Transformer-Encoder, to extract complex features from the IQ samples, forming device-specific RF fingerprints. We convert the models to TensorFlow Lite and evaluate them on a Raspberry Pi, demonstrating the practicality of Edge deployment. Evaluations demonstrate the Transformer-Encoder outperforms the CNN in identifying unique transmitter features, achieving high accuracy (&gt; 0.95) and ROC-AUC scores (&gt; 0.90) while maintaining a compact model size of 73KB, appropriate for resource-constrained devices.</description>

      <title>Err on the Side of Texture: Texture Bias on Real Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bias significantly undermines both the accuracy and trustworthiness of machine learning models. To date, one of the strongest biases observed in image classification models is texture bias-where models overly rely on texture information rather than shape information. Yet, existing approaches for measuring and mitigating texture bias have not been able to capture how textures impact model robustness in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce the Texture Association Value (TAV), a novel metric that quantifies how strongly models rely on the presence of specific textures when classifying objects. Leveraging TAV, we demonstrate that model accuracy and robustness are heavily influenced by texture. Our results show that texture bias explains the existence of natural adversarial examples, where over 90% of these samples contain textures that are misaligned with the learned texture of their true label, resulting in confident mispredictions.</description>

      <title>Centaur: Bridging the Impossible Trinity of Privacy, Efficiency, and Performance in Privacy-Preserving Transformer Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As pre-trained models, like Transformers, are increasingly deployed on cloud platforms for inference services, the privacy concerns surrounding model parameters and inference data are becoming more acute. Current Privacy-Preserving Transformer Inference (PPTI) frameworks struggle with the "impossible trinity" of privacy, efficiency, and performance. For instance, Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)-based solutions offer strong privacy guarantees but come with significant inference overhead and performance trade-offs. On the other hand, PPTI frameworks that use random permutations achieve inference efficiency close to that of plaintext and maintain accurate results but require exposing some model parameters and intermediate results, thereby risking substantial privacy breaches. Addressing this "impossible trinity" with a single technique proves challenging. To overcome this challenge, we propose Centaur, a novel hybrid PPTI framework. Unlike existing methods, Centaur protects model parameters with random permutations and inference data with SMPC, leveraging the structure of Transformer models. By designing a series of efficient privacy-preserving algorithms, Centaur leverages the strengths of both techniques to achieve a better balance between privacy, efficiency, and performance in PPTI. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of Centaur on various types of Transformer models and datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the privacy protection capabilities offered by Centaur can withstand various existing model inversion attack methods. In terms of performance and efficiency, Centaur not only maintains the same performance as plaintext inference but also improves inference speed by $5.0-30.4$ times.</description>

      <title>RAT: Adversarial Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Agents for Targeted Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents against targeted behavior attacks is critical for assessing their robustness. These attacks aim to manipulate the victim into specific behaviors that align with the attacker's objectives, often bypassing traditional reward-based defenses. Prior methods have primarily focused on reducing cumulative rewards; however, rewards are typically too generic to capture complex safety requirements effectively. As a result, focusing solely on reward reduction can lead to suboptimal attack strategies, particularly in safety-critical scenarios where more precise behavior manipulation is needed. To address these challenges, we propose RAT, a method designed for universal, targeted behavior attacks. RAT trains an intention policy that is explicitly aligned with human preferences, serving as a precise behavioral target for the adversary. Concurrently, an adversary manipulates the victim's policy to follow this target behavior. To enhance the effectiveness of these attacks, RAT dynamically adjusts the state occupancy measure within the replay buffer, allowing for more controlled and effective behavior manipulation. Our empirical results on robotic simulation tasks demonstrate that RAT outperforms existing adversarial attack algorithms in inducing specific behaviors. Additionally, RAT shows promise in improving agent robustness, leading to more resilient policies. We further validate RAT by guiding Decision Transformer agents to adopt behaviors aligned with human preferences in various MuJoCo tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing has profound implications for current technologies, offering advancements in optimization while posing significant threats to cryptographic algorithms. Public-key cryptosystems relying on prime factorization or discrete logarithms are particularly vulnerable, whereas block ciphers (BCs) remain secure through increased key lengths. In this study, we introduce a novel quantum implementation of SLIM, a lightweight block cipher optimized for 32-bit plaintext and an 80-bit key, based on a Feistel structure. This implementation distinguishes itself from other BC quantum implementations in its class (64-128-bit) by utilizing a minimal number of qubits while maintaining robust cryptographic strength and efficiency. By employing an innovative design that minimizes qubit usage, this work highlights SLIM's potential as a resource-efficient and secure candidate for quantum-resistant encryption protocols.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning models are vulnerable to both security attacks (e.g., adversarial examples) and privacy attacks (e.g., private attribute inference). We take the first step to mitigate both the security and privacy attacks, and maintain task utility as well. Particularly, we propose an information-theoretic framework to achieve the goals through the lens of representation learning, i.e., learning representations that are robust to both adversarial examples and attribute inference adversaries. We also derive novel theoretical results under our framework, e.g., the inherent trade-off between adversarial robustness/utility and attribute privacy, and guaranteed attribute privacy leakage against attribute inference adversaries.</description>

      <title>PGD-Imp: Rethinking and Unleashing Potential of Classic PGD with Dual Strategies for Imperceptible Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imperceptible adversarial attacks have recently attracted increasing research interests. Existing methods typically incorporate external modules or loss terms other than a simple $l_p$-norm into the attack process to achieve imperceptibility, while we argue that such additional designs may not be necessary. In this paper, we rethink the essence of imperceptible attacks and propose two simple yet effective strategies to unleash the potential of PGD, the common and classical attack, for imperceptibility from an optimization perspective. Specifically, the Dynamic Step Size is introduced to find the optimal solution with minimal attack cost towards the decision boundary of the attacked model, and the Adaptive Early Stop strategy is adopted to reduce the redundant strength of adversarial perturbations to the minimum level. The proposed PGD-Imperceptible (PGD-Imp) attack achieves state-of-the-art results in imperceptible adversarial attacks for both untargeted and targeted scenarios. When performing untargeted attacks against ResNet-50, PGD-Imp attains 100$\%$ (+0.3$\%$) ASR, 0.89 (-1.76) $l_2$ distance, and 52.93 (+9.2) PSNR with 57s (-371s) running time, significantly outperforming existing methods.</description>

      <title>Just a Simple Transformation is Enough for Data Protection in Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11689</link>

Abstract: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) aims to enable collaborative training of deep learning models while maintaining privacy protection. However, the VFL procedure still has components that are vulnerable to attacks by malicious parties. In our work, we consider feature reconstruction attacks, a common risk targeting input data compromise. We theoretically claim that feature reconstruction attacks cannot succeed without knowledge of the prior distribution on data. Consequently, we demonstrate that even simple model architecture transformations can significantly impact the protection of input data during VFL. Confirming these findings with experimental results, we show that MLP-based models are resistant to state-of-the-art feature reconstruction attacks.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Achieving Secure Model Training and Secure Aggregation to Ensure Bidirectional Privacy-Preservation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bidirectional privacy-preservation federated learning is crucial as both local gradients and the global model may leak privacy. However, only a few works attempt to achieve it, and they often face challenges such as excessive communication and computational overheads, or significant degradation of model accuracy, which hinders their practical applications. In this paper, we design an efficient and high-accuracy bidirectional privacy-preserving scheme for federated learning to complete secure model training and secure aggregation. To efficiently achieve bidirectional privacy, we design an efficient and accuracy-lossless model perturbation method on the server side (called $\mathbf{MP\_Server}$) that can be combined with local differential privacy (LDP) to prevent clients from accessing the model, while ensuring that the local gradients obtained on the server side satisfy LDP. Furthermore, to ensure model accuracy, we customize a distributed differential privacy mechanism on the client side (called $\mathbf{DDP\_Client}$). When combined with $\mathbf{MP\_Server}$, it ensures LDP of the local gradients, while ensuring that the aggregated result matches the accuracy of central differential privacy (CDP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme significantly outperforms state-of-the-art bidirectional privacy-preservation baselines (SOTAs) in terms of computational cost, model accuracy, and defense ability against privacy attacks. Particularly, given target accuracy, the training time of SOTAs is approximately $200$ times, or even over $1000$ times, longer than that of our scheme. When the privacy budget is set relatively small, our scheme incurs less than $6\%$ accuracy loss compared to the privacy-ignoring method, while SOTAs suffer up to $20\%$ accuracy loss. Experimental results also show that the defense capability of our scheme outperforms than SOTAs.</description>

      <title>But Can You Use It? Design Recommendations for Differentially Private Interactive Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accessing data collected by federal statistical agencies is essential for public policy research and improving evidence-based decision making, such as evaluating the effectiveness of social programs, understanding demographic shifts, or addressing public health challenges. Differentially private interactive systems, or validation servers, can form a crucial part of the data-sharing infrastructure. They may allow researchers to query targeted statistics, providing flexible, efficient access to specific insights, reducing the need for broad data releases and supporting timely, focused research. However, they have not yet been practically implemented. While substantial theoretical work has been conducted on the privacy and accuracy guarantees of differentially private mechanisms, prior efforts have not considered usability as an explicit goal of interactive systems. This work outlines and considers the barriers to developing differentially private interactive systems for informing public policy and offers an alternative way forward. We propose balancing three design considerations: privacy assurance, statistical utility, and system usability, we develop recommendations for making differentially private interactive systems work in practice, we present an example architecture based on these recommendations, and we provide an outline of how to conduct the necessary user-testing. Our work seeks to move the practical development of differentially private interactive systems forward to better aid public policy making and spark future research.</description>

      <title>Explaining Provenance-Based GNN Detectors with Graph Structural Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00934v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced cyber threats (e.g., Fileless Malware and Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)) have driven the adoption of provenance-based security solutions. These solutions employ Machine Learning (ML) models for behavioral modeling and critical security tasks such as malware and anomaly detection. However, the opacity of ML-based security models limits their broader adoption, as the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes restricts explainability and verifiability. We tailored our solution towards Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based security solutions since recent studies employ GNNs to comprehensively digest system provenance graphs for security critical tasks.
  To enhance the explainability of GNN-based security models, we introduce PROVEXPLAINER, a framework offering instance-level security-aware explanations using an interpretable surrogate model. PROVEXPLAINER's interpretable feature space consists of discriminant subgraph patterns and graph structural features, which can be directly mapped to the system provenance problem space, making the explanations human understandable. By considering prominent GNN architectures (e.g., GAT and GraphSAGE) for anomaly detection tasks, we show how PROVEXPLAINER synergizes with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN explainers to deliver domain and instance-specific explanations. We measure the explanation quality using the fidelity+/fidelity- metric as used by traditional GNN explanation literature, and we incorporate the precision/recall metric where we consider the accuracy of the explanation against the ground truth. On malware and APT datasets, PROVEXPLAINER achieves up to 29%/27%/25% higher fidelity+, precision and recall, and 12% lower fidelity- respectively, compared to SOTA GNN explainers.</description>

      <title>DP-BREM: Differentially-Private and Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning with Client Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12608v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple participating clients to train machine learning models collaboratively while keeping their datasets local and only exchanging the gradient or model updates with a coordinating server. Existing FL protocols are vulnerable to attacks that aim to compromise data privacy and/or model robustness. Recently proposed defenses focused on ensuring either privacy or robustness, but not both. In this paper, we focus on simultaneously achieving differential privacy (DP) and Byzantine robustness for cross-silo FL, based on the idea of learning from history. The robustness is achieved via client momentum, which averages the updates of each client over time, thus reducing the variance of the honest clients and exposing the small malicious perturbations of Byzantine clients that are undetectable in a single round but accumulate over time. In our initial solution DP-BREM, DP is achieved by adding noise to the aggregated momentum, and we account for the privacy cost from the momentum, which is different from the conventional DP-SGD that accounts for the privacy cost from the gradient. Since DP-BREM assumes a trusted server (who can obtain clients' local models or updates), we further develop the final solution called DP-BREM+, which achieves the same DP and robustness properties as DP-BREM without a trusted server by utilizing secure aggregation techniques, where DP noise is securely and jointly generated by the clients. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed protocols achieve better privacy-utility tradeoff and stronger Byzantine robustness than several baseline methods, under different DP budgets and attack settings.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Dynamic Intrusion Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) monitors network traffic for malicious activities, forming the frontline defense against increasing attacks over information infrastructures. Although promising, our quantitative analysis shows that existing methods perform inconsistently in declaring various attacks, and perform poorly in few-shot intrusion detections. We reveal that the underlying cause is entangled distributions of flow features. This motivates us to propose DIDS-MFL, a disentangled intrusion detection method to handle various intrusion detection scenarios. DIDS-MFL involves two key components, respectively: a double Disentanglementbased Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) and a plug-and-play Multi-scale Few-shot Learning-based (MFL) intrusion detection module. Specifically, the proposed DIDS first disentangles traffic features by a non-parameterized optimization, automatically differentiating tens and hundreds of complex features of various attacks. Such differentiated features will be further disentangled to highlight the attack-specific features. Our DIDS additionally uses a novel graph diffusion method that dynamically fuses the network topology in evolving data streams. Furthermore, the proposed MFL involves an alternating optimization framework to address the entangled representations in few-shot traffic threats with rigorous derivation. MFL first captures multiscale information in latent space to distinguish attack-specific information and then optimizes the disentanglement term to highlight the attack-specific information. Finally, MFL fuses and alternately solves them in an end-to-end way. Experiments show the superiority of our proposed DIDS-MFL.

      <title>Slice it up: Unmasking User Identities in Smartwatch Health Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wearables are widely used for health data collection due to their availability and advanced sensors, enabling smart health applications like stress detection. However, the sensitivity of personal health data raises significant privacy concerns. While user de-identification by removing direct identifiers such as names and addresses is commonly employed to protect privacy, the data itself can still be exploited to re-identify individuals. We introduce a novel framework for similarity-based Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) re-identification attacks on time series health data. Using the WESAD dataset and two larger synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that even short segments of sensor data can achieve perfect re-identification with our Slicing-DTW-Attack. Our attack is independent of training data and computes similarity rankings in about 2 minutes for 10,000 subjects on a single CPU core. These findings highlight that de-identification alone is insufficient to protect privacy. As a defense, we show that adding random noise to the signals significantly reduces re-identification risk while only moderately affecting usability in stress detection tasks, offering a promising approach to balancing privacy and utility.</description>

      <title>Fuzz on the Beach: Fuzzing Solana Smart Contracts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solana has quickly emerged as a popular platform for building decentralized applications (DApps), such as marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). A key reason for its success are Solana's low transaction fees and high performance, which is achieved in part due to its stateless programming model. Although the literature features extensive tooling support for smart contract security, current solutions are largely tailored for the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Unfortunately, the very stateless nature of Solana's execution environment introduces novel attack patterns specific to Solana requiring a rethinking for building vulnerability analysis methods.
  In this paper, we address this gap and propose FuzzDelSol, the first binary-only coverage-guided fuzzing architecture for Solana smart contracts. FuzzDelSol faithfully models runtime specifics such as smart contract interactions. Moreover, since source code is not available for the large majority of Solana contracts, FuzzDelSol operates on the contract's binary code. Hence, due to the lack of semantic information, we carefully extracted low-level program and state information to develop a diverse set of bug oracles covering all major bug classes in Solana. Our extensive evaluation on 6049 smart contracts shows that FuzzDelSol's bug oracles find bugs with a high precision and recall. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest evaluation of the security landscape on the Solana mainnet.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Power of LLM to Support Binary Taint Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes LATTE, the first static binary taint analysis that is powered by a large language model (LLM). LATTE is superior to the state of the art (e.g., Emtaint, Arbiter, Karonte) in three aspects. First, LATTE is fully automated while prior static binary taint analyzers need rely on human expertise to manually customize taint propagation rules and vulnerability inspection rules. Second, LATTE is significantly effective in vulnerability detection, demonstrated by our comprehensive evaluations. For example, LATTE has found 37 new bugs in real-world firmware which the baselines failed to find, and 7 of them have been assigned CVE numbers. Lastly, LATTE incurs remarkably low engineering cost, making it a cost-efficient and scalable solution for security researchers and practitioners. We strongly believe that LATTE opens up a new direction to harness the recent advance in LLMs to improve vulnerability analysis for binary programs.</description>

      <title>Attacking Byzantine Robust Aggregation in High Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training modern neural networks or models typically requires averaging over a sample of high-dimensional vectors. Poisoning attacks can skew or bias the average vectors used to train the model, forcing the model to learn specific patterns or avoid learning anything useful. Byzantine robust aggregation is a principled algorithmic defense against such biasing. Robust aggregators can bound the maximum bias in computing centrality statistics, such as mean, even when some fraction of inputs are arbitrarily corrupted. Designing such aggregators is challenging when dealing with high dimensions. However, the first polynomial-time algorithms with strong theoretical bounds on the bias have recently been proposed. Their bounds are independent of the number of dimensions, promising a conceptual limit on the power of poisoning attacks in their ongoing arms race against defenses.
  In this paper, we show a new attack called HIDRA on practical realization of strong defenses which subverts their claim of dimension-independent bias. HIDRA highlights a novel computational bottleneck that has not been a concern of prior information-theoretic analysis. Our experimental evaluation shows that our attacks almost completely destroy the model performance, whereas existing attacks with the same goal fail to have much effect. Our findings leave the arms race between poisoning attacks and provable defenses wide open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jailbreak attacks aim to bypass the safeguards of LLMs. While researchers have studied different jailbreak attacks in depth, they have done so in isolation -- either with unaligned experiment settings or comparing a limited range of methods. To fill this gap, we present the first large-scale measurement of various jailbreak attack methods. We collect 17 cutting-edge jailbreak methods, summarize their features, and establish a novel jailbreak attack taxonomy. Based on eight popular censored LLMs and 160 questions from 16 violation categories, we conduct a unified and impartial assessment of attack effectiveness as well as a comprehensive ablation study. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that all the jailbreak attacks have a powerful effect on the LLMs. This indicates that all LLMs fail to cover all the violation categories, and they are susceptible to significant jailbreak risks, with even the well-aligned Llama3 facing a maximum attack success rate of 0.88. Additionally, we test jailbreak attacks under eight advanced external defenses and find none of the defenses could mitigate the jailbreak attacks entirely. Our study offers valuable insights for future research on jailbreak attacks and defenses and serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and practitioners to evaluate them effectively.</description>

Abstract: Living-off-the-land (LOTL) techniques pose a significant challenge to security operations, exploiting legitimate tools to execute malicious commands that evade traditional detection methods. To address this, we present a robust augmentation framework for cyber defense systems as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions, enabling the detection of LOTL attacks such as reverse shells through machine learning. Leveraging real-world threat intelligence and adversarial training, our framework synthesizes diverse malicious datasets while preserving the variability of legitimate activity, ensuring high accuracy and low false-positive rates. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on enterprise-scale datasets, achieving a 90\% improvement in detection rates over non-augmented baselines at an industry-grade False Positive Rate (FPR) of $10^{-5}$. We define black-box data-driven attacks that successfully evade unprotected models, and develop defenses to mitigate them, producing adversarially robust variants of ML models. Ethical considerations are central to this work; we discuss safeguards for synthetic data generation and the responsible release of pre-trained models across four best performing architectures, including both adversarially and regularly trained variants: https://huggingface.co/dtrizna/quasarnix. Furthermore, we provide a malicious LOTL dataset containing over 1 million augmented attack variants to enable reproducible research and community collaboration: https://huggingface.co/datasets/dtrizna/QuasarNix. This work offers a reproducible, scalable, and production-ready defense against evolving LOTL threats.</description>

      <title>Secure Information Embedding in Forensic 3D Fingerprinting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04918v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prevalence of 3D printing poses a significant risk to public safety, as any individual with internet access and a commodity printer is able to produce untraceable firearms, keys, counterfeit products, etc. To aid government authorities in combating these new security threats, several approaches have been taken to tag 3D-prints with identifying information. Known as fingerprints, this information is written into the object using various bit embedding techniques; examples include varying the height of the molten thermoplastic layers, and depositing metallic powder with different magnetic properties. Yet, the practicality of theses techniques in real-world forensic settings is hindered by the adversarial nature of this problem. That is, the 3D-printing process is out of reach of any law enforcement agencies; it is the adversary who controls all aspects of printing and possesses the printed object. To combat these threats, law enforcement agencies can regulate the manufacturing of 3D printers, on which they may enforce a fingerprinting scheme, and collect adversarially tampered remains (e.g., fragments of a broken 3D-printed firearm) during forensic investigation. Therefore, it is important to devise fingerprinting techniques so that the fingerprint could be extracted even if printing is carried out by the adversary. To this end, we present SIDE (Secure Information Embedding and Extraction), a fingerprinting framework that tackles the adversarial nature of forensic fingerprinting in 3D prints by offering both secure information embedding and secure information extraction.</description>

      <title>Provably Secure Disambiguating Neural Linguistic Steganography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research in provably secure neural linguistic steganography has overlooked a crucial aspect: the sender must detokenize stegotexts to avoid raising suspicion from the eavesdropper. The segmentation ambiguity problem, which arises when using language models based on subwords, leads to occasional decoding failures in all neural language steganography implementations based on these models. Current solutions to this issue involve altering the probability distribution of candidate words, rendering them incompatible with provably secure steganography. We propose a novel secure disambiguation method named SyncPool, which effectively addresses the segmentation ambiguity problem. We group all tokens with prefix relationships in the candidate pool before the steganographic embedding algorithm runs to eliminate uncertainty among ambiguous tokens. To enable the receiver to synchronize the sampling process of the sender, a shared cryptographically-secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) is deployed to select a token from the ambiguity pool. SyncPool does not change the size of the candidate pool or the distribution of tokens and thus is applicable to provably secure language steganography methods. We provide theoretical proofs and experimentally demonstrate the applicability of our solution to various languages and models, showing its potential to significantly improve the reliability and security of neural linguistic steganography systems.</description>

      <title>Simulate and Eliminate: Revoke Backdoors for Generative Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: With rapid advances, generative large language models (LLMs) dominate various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks from understanding to reasoning. Yet, language models' inherent vulnerabilities may be exacerbated due to increased accessibility and unrestricted model training on massive data. A malicious adversary may publish poisoned data online and conduct backdoor attacks on the victim LLMs pre-trained on the poisoned data. Backdoored LLMs behave innocuously for normal queries and generate harmful responses when the backdoor trigger is activated. Despite significant efforts paid to LLMs' safety issues, LLMs are still struggling against backdoor attacks. As Anthropic recently revealed, existing safety training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), fail to revoke the backdoors once the LLM is backdoored during the pre-training stage. In this paper, we present Simulate and Eliminate (SANDE) to erase the undesired backdoored mappings for generative LLMs. We initially propose Overwrite Supervised Fine-tuning (OSFT) for effective backdoor removal when the trigger is known. Then, to handle scenarios where trigger patterns are unknown, we integrate OSFT into our two-stage framework, SANDE. Unlike other works that assume access to cleanly trained models, our safety-enhanced LLMs are able to revoke backdoors without any reference. Consequently, our safety-enhanced LLMs no longer produce targeted responses when the backdoor triggers are activated. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that our proposed SANDE is effective against backdoor attacks while bringing minimal harm to LLMs' powerful capability.</description>

      <title>GENIE: Watermarking Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become invaluable intellectual property in graph-based machine learning. However, their vulnerability to model stealing attacks when deployed within Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) necessitates robust Ownership Demonstration (OD) techniques. Watermarking is a promising OD framework for Deep Neural Networks, but existing methods fail to generalize to GNNs due to the non-Euclidean nature of graph data. Previous works on GNN watermarking have primarily focused on node and graph classification, overlooking Link Prediction (LP).
  In this paper, we propose GENIE (watermarking Graph nEural Networks for lInk prEdiction), the first-ever scheme to watermark GNNs for LP. GENIE creates a novel backdoor for both node-representation and subgraph-based LP methods, utilizing a unique trigger set and a secret watermark vector. Our OD scheme is equipped with Dynamic Watermark Thresholding (DWT), ensuring high verification probability (&gt;99.99%) while addressing practical issues in existing watermarking schemes. We extensively evaluate GENIE across 4 model architectures (i.e., SEAL, GCN, GraphSAGE and NeoGNN) and 7 real-world datasets. Furthermore, we validate the robustness of GENIE against 11 state-of-the-art watermark removal techniques and 3 model extraction attacks. We also show GENIE's resilience against ownership piracy attacks. Finally, we discuss a defense strategy to counter adaptive attacks against GENIE.</description>

      <title>Time-Efficient Locally Relevant Geo-Location Privacy Protection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13725v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geo-obfuscation serves as a location privacy protection mechanism (LPPM), enabling mobile users to share obfuscated locations with servers, rather than their exact locations. This method can protect users' location privacy when data breaches occur on the server side since the obfuscation process is irreversible. To reduce the utility loss caused by data obfuscation, linear programming (LP) is widely employed, which, however, might suffer from a polynomial explosion of decision variables, rendering it impractical in largescale geo-obfuscation applications.
  In this paper, we propose a new LPPM, called Locally Relevant Geo-obfuscation (LR-Geo), to optimize geo-obfuscation using LP in a time-efficient manner. This is achieved by confining the geo-obfuscation calculation for each user exclusively to the locally relevant (LR) locations to the user's actual location. Given the potential risk of LR locations disclosing a user's actual whereabouts, we enable users to compute the LP coefficients locally and upload them only to the server, rather than the LR locations. The server then solves the LP problem based on the received coefficients. Furthermore, we refine the LP framework by incorporating an exponential obfuscation mechanism to guarantee the indistinguishability of obfuscation distribution across multiple users. Based on the constraint structure of the LP formulation, we apply Benders' decomposition to further enhance computational efficiency. Our theoretical analysis confirms that, despite the geo-obfuscation being calculated independently for each user, it still meets geo-indistinguishability constraints across multiple users with high probability. Finally, the experimental results based on a real-world dataset demonstrate that LR-Geo outperforms existing geo-obfuscation methods in computational time, data utility, and privacy preservation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Digital Twin Technologies for Public Space Protection and Vulnerability Assessment</title>

Abstract: Over the recent years, the protection of the so-called `soft-targets', i.e. locations easily accessible by the general public with relatively low, though, security measures, has emerged as a rather challenging and increasingly important issue. The complexity and seriousness of this security threat growths nowadays exponentially, due to the emergence of new advanced technologies (e.g. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), 3D printing, etc.); especially when it comes to large-scale, popular and diverse public spaces. In this paper, a novel Digital Twin-as-a-Security-Service (DTaaSS) architecture is introduced for holistically and significantly enhancing the protection of public spaces (e.g. metro stations, leisure sites, urban squares, etc.). The proposed framework combines a Digital Twin (DT) conceptualization with additional cutting-edge technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Big Data analytics and AI. In particular, DTaaSS comprises a holistic, real-time, large-scale, comprehensive and data-driven security solution for the efficient/robust protection of public spaces, supporting: a) data collection and analytics, b) area monitoring/control and proactive threat detection, c) incident/attack prediction, and d) quantitative and data-driven vulnerability assessment. Overall, the designed architecture exhibits increased potential in handling complex, hybrid and combined threats over large, critical and popular soft-targets. The applicability and robustness of DTaaSS is discussed in detail against representative and diverse real-world application scenarios, including complex attacks to: a) a metro station, b) a leisure site, and c) a cathedral square.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Challenges in Ethereum's Proof-of-Stake Consensus: Evaluating the Impact of EigenLayer and Lido</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition of Ethereum from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism introduces a transformative approach to blockchain validation, offering enhanced scalability, energy efficiency, and security. However, this shift also presents significant challenges, including high barriers to becoming a validator, restrictions on the liquidity of staked Ether (ETH), and the risk of centralization due to staking pool dynamics. This paper addresses these challenges by exploring two innovative solutions: EigenLayer and Lido.
  EigenLayer is a middleware solution enabling restaking, allowing validators to secure multiple protocols and thereby increasing decentralization and profitability. Lido, a liquid staking protocol, simplifies participation by issuing stETH tokens that retain liquidity, allowing users to earn rewards without long-term lock-up constraints. This paper provides a detailed analysis of how these technologies mitigate key PoS challenges, reduce validator entry barriers, unlock staked capital, and improve decentralization. We conclude with an evaluation of the combined potential of EigenLayer and Lido to foster a more resilient and inclusive Ethereum ecosystem, setting the stage for further advancements in decentralized finance.</description>

      <title>When Backdoors Speak: Understanding LLM Backdoor Attacks Through Model-Generated Explanations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where triggers embedded in poisoned samples can maliciously alter LLMs' behaviors. In this paper, we move beyond attacking LLMs and instead examine backdoor attacks through the novel lens of natural language explanations. Specifically, we leverage LLMs' generative capabilities to produce human-readable explanations for their decisions, enabling direct comparisons between explanations for clean and poisoned samples. Our results show that backdoored models produce coherent explanations for clean inputs but diverse and logically flawed explanations for poisoned data, a pattern consistent across classification and generation tasks for different backdoor attacks. Further analysis reveals key insights into the explanation generation process. At the token level, explanation tokens associated with poisoned samples only appear in the final few transformer layers. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that poisoned inputs shift attention away from the original input context during explanation generation. These findings enhance our understanding of backdoor mechanisms in LLMs and present a promising framework for detecting vulnerabilities through explainability.</description>

      <title>Flow-based Detection of Botnets through Bio-inspired Optimisation of Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Botnets could autonomously infect, propagate, communicate and coordinate with other members in the botnet, enabling cybercriminals to exploit the cumulative computing and bandwidth of its bots to facilitate cybercrime. Traditional detection methods are becoming increasingly unsuitable against various network-based detection evasion methods. These techniques ultimately render signature-based fingerprinting detection infeasible and thus this research explores the application of network flow-based behavioural modelling to facilitate the binary classification of bot network activity, whereby the detection is independent of underlying communications architectures, ports, protocols and payload-based detection evasion mechanisms. A comparative evaluation of various machine learning classification methods is conducted, to precisely determine the average accuracy of each classifier on bot datasets like CTU-13, ISOT 2010 and ISCX 2014. Additionally, hyperparameter tuning using Genetic Algorithm (GA), aiming to efficiently converge to the fittest hyperparameter set for each dataset was done. The bioinspired optimisation of Random Forest (RF) with GA achieved an average accuracy of 99.85% when it was tested against the three datasets. The model was then developed into a software product.

      <title>PBI-Attack: Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for Toxicity Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the vulnerabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to jailbreak attacks is essential for their responsible real-world deployment. Most previous work requires access to model gradients, or is based on human knowledge (prompt engineering) to complete jailbreak, and they hardly consider the interaction of images and text, resulting in inability to jailbreak in black box scenarios or poor performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for toxicity maximization, referred to as PBI-Attack. Our method begins by extracting malicious features from a harmful corpus using an alternative LVLM and embedding these features into a benign image as prior information. Subsequently, we enhance these features through bidirectional cross-modal interaction optimization, which iteratively optimizes the bimodal perturbations in an alternating manner through greedy search, aiming to maximize the toxicity of the generated response. The toxicity level is quantified using a well-trained evaluation model. Experiments demonstrate that PBI-Attack outperforms previous state-of-the-art jailbreak methods, achieving an average attack success rate of 92.5% across three open-source LVLMs and around 67.3% on three closed-source LVLMs. Disclaimer: This paper contains potentially disturbing and offensive content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hardware security community relies on databases of known vulnerabilities and open-source designs to develop formal verification methods for identifying hardware security flaws. While there are plenty of open-source designs and verification tools, there is a gap in open-source properties addressing these flaws, making it difficult to reproduce prior work and slowing research. This paper aims to bridge that gap.
  We provide SystemVerilog Assertions for four common designs: OR1200, Hack@DAC 2018's buggy PULPissimo SoC, Hack@DAC 2019's CVA6, and Hack@DAC 2021's buggy OpenPiton SoCs. The properties are organized by design and tagged with details about the security flaws and the implicated CWE. To encourage more property reporting, we describe the methodology we use when crafting properties.</description>

      <title>BA-ORABE: Blockchain-Based Auditable Registered Attribute-Based Encryption With Reliable Outsourced Decryption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a generalization of public-key encryption that enables fine-grained access control in cloud services. Recently, Hohenberger et al. (Eurocrypt 2023) introduced the notion of registered ABE, which is an ABE scheme without a trusted central authority. Instead, users generate their own public/secret keys and then register their keys and attributes with a key curator. The key curator is a transparent and untrusted entity and its behavior needs to be audited for malicious registration. In addition, pairing-based registered ABE still suffers the heavy decryption overhead like ABE. A general approach to address this issue is to outsource decryption to a decryption cloud service (DCS).In this work, we propose BA-ORABE, the first fully auditable registered ABE with reliable outsourced decryption scheme based on blockchain. First, we utilize a verifiable tag mechanism to achieve verifiability of ciphertext transformation, and the exemptibility which enables the honest DCS to escape from wrong claims is guaranteed by zero knowledge fraud proof under optimistic assumption. Additionally, our system achieves fairness and decentralized outsourcing to protect the interests of all parties and the registration and outsourcing process are transparent and fully auditable through blockchain. Finally, we give security analysis, implement and evaluate our scheme on Ethereum to demonstrate its feasibility and efficiency, and show its advantages in real application of decentralized finance.</description>

      <title>Backdoor Learning Curves: Explaining Backdoor Poisoning Beyond Influence Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.07214v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks inject poisoning samples during training, with the goal of forcing a machine learning model to output an attacker-chosen class when presented a specific trigger at test time. Although backdoor attacks have been demonstrated in a variety of settings and against different models, the factors affecting their effectiveness are still not well understood. In this work, we provide a unifying framework to study the process of backdoor learning under the lens of incremental learning and influence functions. We show that the effectiveness of backdoor attacks depends on: (i) the complexity of the learning algorithm, controlled by its hyperparameters; (ii) the fraction of backdoor samples injected into the training set; and (iii) the size and visibility of the backdoor trigger. These factors affect how fast a model learns to correlate the presence of the backdoor trigger with the target class. Our analysis unveils the intriguing existence of a region in the hyperparameter space in which the accuracy on clean test samples is still high while backdoor attacks are ineffective, thereby suggesting novel criteria to improve existing defenses.</description>

      <title>SecFormer: Fast and Accurate Privacy-Preserving Inference for Transformer Models via SMPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00793v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing use of Transformer models hosted on cloud platforms to offer inference services, privacy concerns are escalating, especially concerning sensitive data like investment plans and bank account details. Secure Multi-Party Computing (SMPC) emerges as a promising solution to protect the privacy of inference data and model parameters. However, the application of SMPC in Privacy-Preserving Inference (PPI) for Transformer models often leads to considerable slowdowns or declines in performance. This is largely due to the multitude of nonlinear operations in the Transformer architecture, which are not well-suited to SMPC and difficult to circumvent or optimize effectively. To address this concern, we introduce a comprehensive PPI framework called SecFormer to achieve fast and accurate PPI for Transformer models. We successfully eliminate the high-cost exponential and maximum operations in PPI without sacrificing model performance and develop a suite of efficient SMPC protocols by employing suitable numerical computation methods to boost other complex nonlinear functions in PPI, including GeLU, LayerNorm, and a redesigned Softmax. Our extensive experiments reveal that SecFormer outperforms MPCFormer in performance, showing improvements of $3.4\%$ and $24.7\%$ for BERT$_{\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\text{LARGE}}$, respectively. In terms of efficiency, SecFormer is 3.57 and 3.58 times faster than PUMA for BERT$_{\text{BASE}}$ and BERT$_{\text{LARGE}}$, demonstrating its effectiveness and speed.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation against Membership Inference Attacks for Latent Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is an efficient strategy for adapting latent diffusion models (LDMs) on a private dataset to generate specific images by minimizing the adaptation loss. However, the LoRA-adapted LDMs are vulnerable to membership inference (MI) attacks that can judge whether a particular data point belongs to the private dataset, thus leading to the privacy leakage. To defend against MI attacks, we first propose a straightforward solution: Membership-Privacy-preserving LoRA (MP-LoRA). MP-LoRA is formulated as a min-max optimization problem where a proxy attack model is trained by maximizing its MI gain while the LDM is adapted by minimizing the sum of the adaptation loss and the MI gain of the proxy attack model. However, we empirically find that MP-LoRA has the issue of unstable optimization, and theoretically analyze that the potential reason is the unconstrained local smoothness, which impedes the privacy-preserving adaptation. To mitigate this issue, we further propose a Stable Membership-Privacy-preserving LoRA (SMP-LoRA) that adapts the LDM by minimizing the ratio of the adaptation loss to the MI gain. Besides, we theoretically prove that the local smoothness of SMP-LoRA can be constrained by the gradient norm, leading to improved convergence. Our experimental results corroborate that SMP-LoRA can indeed defend against MI attacks and generate high-quality images.

      <title>Red Teaming GPT-4V: Are GPT-4V Safe Against Uni/Multi-Modal Jailbreak Attacks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various jailbreak attacks have been proposed to red-team Large Language Models (LLMs) and revealed the vulnerable safeguards of LLMs. Besides, some methods are not limited to the textual modality and extend the jailbreak attack to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by perturbing the visual input. However, the absence of a universal evaluation benchmark complicates the performance reproduction and fair comparison. Besides, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation of closed-source state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, especially MLLMs, such as GPT-4V. To address these issues, this work first builds a comprehensive jailbreak evaluation dataset with 1445 harmful questions covering 11 different safety policies. Based on this dataset, extensive red-teaming experiments are conducted on 11 different LLMs and MLLMs, including both SOTA proprietary models and open-source models. We then conduct a deep analysis of the evaluated results and find that (1) GPT4 and GPT-4V demonstrate better robustness against jailbreak attacks compared to open-source LLMs and MLLMs. (2) Llama2 and Qwen-VL-Chat are more robust compared to other open-source models. (3) The transferability of visual jailbreak methods is relatively limited compared to textual jailbreak methods.

      <title>Do Chase Your Tail! Missing Key Aspects Augmentation in Textual Vulnerability Descriptions of Long-tail Software through Feature Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Augmenting missing key aspects in Textual Vulnerability Descriptions (TVDs) is crucial for effective vulnerability analysis. For instance, in TVDs, key aspects include Attack Vector, Vulnerability Type, among others. These key aspects help security engineers understand and address the vulnerability in a timely manner. For software with a large user base (non-long-tail software), augmenting these missing key aspects has significantly advanced vulnerability analysis and software security research. However, software instances with a limited user base (long-tail software) often get overlooked due to inconsistency software names, TVD limited avaliability, and domain-specific jargon, which complicates vulnerability analysis and software repairs. In this paper, we introduce a novel software feature inference framework designed to augment the missing key aspects of TVDs for long-tail software. Firstly, we tackle the issue of non-standard software names found in community-maintained vulnerability databases by cross-referencing government databases with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Next, we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the missing key aspects. However, the limited availability of historical TVDs restricts the variety of examples. To overcome this limitation, we utilize the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) to classify all TVDs and select cluster centers as representative examples. To ensure accuracy, we present Natural Language Inference (NLI) models specifically designed for long-tail software. These models identify and eliminate incorrect responses. Additionally, we use a wiki repository to provide explanations for proprietary terms.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Prototypes for Imbalanced Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have been shown to leak private information from their training datasets. Differential Privacy (DP), typically implemented through the differential private stochastic gradient descent algorithm (DP-SGD), has become the standard solution to bound leakage from the models. Despite recent improvements, DP-SGD-based approaches for private learning still usually struggle in the high privacy ($\varepsilon\le1)$ and low data regimes, and when the private training datasets are imbalanced. To overcome these limitations, we propose Differentially Private Prototype Learning (DPPL) as a new paradigm for private transfer learning. DPPL leverages publicly pre-trained encoders to extract features from private data and generates DP prototypes that represent each private class in the embedding space and can be publicly released for inference. Since our DP prototypes can be obtained from only a few private training data points and without iterative noise addition, they offer high-utility predictions and strong privacy guarantees even under the notion of \textit{pure DP}. We additionally show that privacy-utility trade-offs can be further improved when leveraging the public data beyond pre-training of the encoder: in particular, we can privately sample our DP prototypes from the publicly available data points used to train the encoder. Our experimental evaluation with four state-of-the-art encoders, four vision datasets, and under different data and imbalancedness regimes demonstrate DPPL's high performance under strong privacy guarantees in challenging private learning setups</description>

      <title>Block Circulant Codes with Application to Decentralized Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a family of $[n,k,d]$ block circulant codes that consist of many $[n_0 \ll n,k_0 \ll k,d_0]$ local codes and that satisfy three properties: (1) the code supports distributed erasure decoding, (2) $d$ can be scaled above $d_0$ by a given parameter, and (3) it is amenable to low complexity verification of code symbols using a cryptographic commitment scheme. These properties make the code ideal for use in protocols that address the data availability problem in blockchain networks. Moreover, the code outperforms the currently used 2D Reed-Solomon (RS) code with a larger relative minimum distance $(d/n)$, as desired in the protocol, for a given rate $(k/n)$ in the high-rate regime.
  The code is designed in two steps. First, we develop the topology, i.e., the structure of linear dependence relations among code symbols, and define it as the block circulant topology $T_{[\mu,\lambda,\omega]}(\rho)$. In this topology, there are $\mu$ local codes, each constrained by $\rho$ parity checks. The set of symbols of a local code intersects with another in a uniform pattern, determined by two parameters, namely the overlap factor $\lambda$ and the overlap width $\omega$. Next, we instantiate the topology, i.e., to specify the coefficients of linear dependence relations, to construct the block circulant codes ${\cal C}_{\text{BC}}[\mu,\lambda,\omega,\rho]$. Every local code is a $[\lambda\omega+\rho,\lambda\omega,\rho+1]$ generalized RS code. The block circulant code has $n=\mu(\rho+\omega)$, $k=\mu\omega$ and we show that $d=\lambda\rho+1$ under certain conditions. For $\lambda=2$, we prove that $d=2\rho+1$ always, and provide an efficient, parallelizable erasure-correcting decoder that fully recovers the codeword when there are $\leq 2\rho$ erasures. The decoder uses a novel decoding mechanism that iteratively recovers erasures from pairs of local codes.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Adversarial Robustness of Multimodal LM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As language models (LMs) are used to build autonomous agents in real environments, ensuring their adversarial robustness becomes a critical challenge. Unlike chatbots, agents are compound systems with multiple components, which existing LM safety evaluations do not adequately address. To bridge this gap, we manually create 200 targeted adversarial tasks and evaluation functions in a realistic threat model on top of VisualWebArena, a real environment for web-based agents. In order to systematically examine the robustness of various multimodal we agents, we propose the Agent Robustness Evaluation (ARE) framework. ARE views the agent as a graph showing the flow of intermediate outputs between components and decomposes robustness as the flow of adversarial information on the graph. First, we find that we can successfully break a range of the latest agents that use black-box frontier LLMs, including those that perform reflection and tree-search. With imperceptible perturbations to a single product image (less than 5% of total web page pixels), an attacker can hijack these agents to execute targeted adversarial goals with success rates up to 67%. We also use ARE to rigorously evaluate how the robustness changes as new components are added. We find that new components that typically improve benign performance can open up new vulnerabilities and harm robustness. An attacker can compromise the evaluator used by the reflexion agent and the value function of the tree search agent, which increases the attack success relatively by 15% and 20%. Our data and code for attacks, defenses, and evaluation are available at https://github.com/ChenWu98/agent-attack</description>

      <title>Defending Against Sophisticated Poisoning Attacks with RL-based Aggregation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is highly susceptible to model poisoning attacks, especially those meticulously crafted for servers. Traditional defense methods mainly focus on updating assessments or robust aggregation against manually crafted myopic attacks. When facing advanced attacks, their defense stability is notably insufficient. Therefore, it is imperative to develop adaptive defenses against such advanced poisoning attacks. We find that benign clients exhibit significantly higher data distribution stability than malicious clients in federated learning in both CV and NLP tasks. Therefore, the malicious clients can be recognized by observing the stability of their data distribution. In this paper, we propose AdaAggRL, an RL-based Adaptive Aggregation method, to defend against sophisticated poisoning attacks. Specifically, we first utilize distribution learning to simulate the clients' data distributions. Then, we use the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to calculate the pairwise similarity of the current local model data distribution, its historical data distribution, and global model data distribution. Finally, we use policy learning to adaptively determine the aggregation weights based on the above similarities. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed defense model significantly outperforms widely adopted defense models for sophisticated attacks.</description>

      <title>Failures to Find Transferable Image Jailbreaks Between Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of new modalities into frontier AI systems offers exciting capabilities, but also increases the possibility such systems can be adversarially manipulated in undesirable ways. In this work, we focus on a popular class of vision-language models (VLMs) that generate text outputs conditioned on visual and textual inputs. We conducted a large-scale empirical study to assess the transferability of gradient-based universal image ``jailbreaks" using a diverse set of over 40 open-parameter VLMs, including 18 new VLMs that we publicly release. Overall, we find that transferable gradient-based image jailbreaks are extremely difficult to obtain. When an image jailbreak is optimized against a single VLM or against an ensemble of VLMs, the jailbreak successfully jailbreaks the attacked VLM(s), but exhibits little-to-no transfer to any other VLMs; transfer is not affected by whether the attacked and target VLMs possess matching vision backbones or language models, whether the language model underwent instruction-following and/or safety-alignment training, or many other factors. Only two settings display partially successful transfer: between identically-pretrained and identically-initialized VLMs with slightly different VLM training data, and between different training checkpoints of a single VLM. Leveraging these results, we then demonstrate that transfer can be significantly improved against a specific target VLM by attacking larger ensembles of ``highly-similar" VLMs. These results stand in stark contrast to existing evidence of universal and transferable text jailbreaks against language models and transferable adversarial attacks against image classifiers, suggesting that VLMs may be more robust to gradient-based transfer attacks.</description>

      <title>PriPHiT: Privacy-Preserving Hierarchical Training of Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The training phase of deep neural networks requires substantial resources and as such is often performed on cloud servers. However, this raises privacy concerns when the training dataset contains sensitive content, e.g., facial or medical images. In this work, we propose a method to perform the training phase of a deep learning model on both an edge device and a cloud server that prevents sensitive content being transmitted to the cloud while retaining the desired information. The proposed privacy-preserving method uses adversarial early exits to suppress the sensitive content at the edge and transmits the task-relevant information to the cloud. This approach incorporates noise addition during the training phase to provide a differential privacy guarantee. We extensively test our method on different facial and medical datasets with diverse attributes using various deep learning architectures, showcasing its outstanding performance. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of privacy preservation through successful defenses against different white-box, deep and GAN-based reconstruction attacks. This approach is designed for resource-constrained edge devices, ensuring minimal memory usage and computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Against All Odds: Overcoming Typology, Script, and Language Confusion in Multilingual Embedding Inversion Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are susceptible to malicious influence by cyber attackers through intrusions such as adversarial, backdoor, and embedding inversion attacks. In response, the burgeoning field of LLM Security aims to study and defend against such threats. Thus far, the majority of works in this area have focused on monolingual English models, however, emerging research suggests that multilingual LLMs may be more vulnerable to various attacks than their monolingual counterparts. While previous work has investigated embedding inversion over a small subset of European languages, it is challenging to extrapolate these findings to languages from different linguistic families and with differing scripts. To this end, we explore the security of multilingual LLMs in the context of embedding inversion attacks and investigate cross-lingual and cross-script inversion across 20 languages, spanning over 8 language families and 12 scripts. Our findings indicate that languages written in Arabic script and Cyrillic script are particularly vulnerable to embedding inversion, as are languages within the Indo-Aryan language family. We further observe that inversion models tend to suffer from language confusion, sometimes greatly reducing the efficacy of an attack. Accordingly, we systematically explore this bottleneck for inversion models, uncovering predictable patterns which could be leveraged by attackers. Ultimately, this study aims to further the field's understanding of the outstanding security vulnerabilities facing multilingual LLMs and raise awareness for the languages most at risk of negative impact from these attacks.</description>

      <title>HTS-Attack: Heuristic Token Search for Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Image(T2I) models have achieved remarkable success in image generation and editing, yet these models still have many potential issues, particularly in generating inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work(NSFW) content. Strengthening attacks and uncovering such vulnerabilities can advance the development of reliable and practical T2I models. Most of the previous works treat T2I models as white-box systems, using gradient optimization to generate adversarial prompts. However, accessing the model's gradient is often impossible in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing defense methods, those using gradient masking, are designed to prevent attackers from obtaining accurate gradient information. While several black-box jailbreak attacks have been explored, they achieve the limited performance of jailbreaking T2I models due to difficulties associated with optimization in discrete spaces. To address this, we propose HTS-Attack, a heuristic token search attack method. HTS-Attack begins with an initialization that removes sensitive tokens, followed by a heuristic search where high-performing candidates are recombined and mutated. This process generates a new pool of candidates, and the optimal adversarial prompt is updated based on their effectiveness. By incorporating both optimal and suboptimal candidates, HTS-Attack avoids local optima and improves robustness in bypassing defenses. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in attacking the latest prompt checkers, post-hoc image checkers, securely trained T2I models, and online commercial models.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective User Attribution for Latent Diffusion Models via Watermark-Informed Blending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in multimodal large language models have enabled the creation of hyper-realistic images from textual descriptions. However, these advancements also raise significant concerns about unauthorized use, which hinders their broader distribution. Traditional watermarking methods often require complex integration or degrade image quality. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework Towards Effective user Attribution for latent diffusion models via Watermark-Informed Blending (TEAWIB). TEAWIB incorporates a unique ready-to-use configuration approach that allows seamless integration of user-specific watermarks into generative models. This approach ensures that each user can directly apply a pre-configured set of parameters to the model without altering the original model parameters or compromising image quality. Additionally, noise and augmentation operations are embedded at the pixel level to further secure and stabilize watermarked images. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of TEAWIB, showcasing the state-of-the-art performance in perceptual quality and attribution accuracy.</description>

      <title>Fully Dynamic Graph Algorithms with Edge Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study differentially private algorithms for analyzing graphs in the challenging setting of continual release with fully dynamic updates, where edges are inserted and deleted over time, and the algorithm is required to update the solution at every time step. Previous work has presented differentially private algorithms for many graph problems that can handle insertions only or deletions only (called partially dynamic algorithms) and obtained some hardness results for the fully dynamic setting. The only algorithms in the latter setting were for the edge count, given by Fichtenberger, Henzinger, and Ost (ESA 21), and for releasing the values of all graph cuts, given by Fichtenberger, Henzinger, and Upadhyay (ICML 23). We provide the first differentially private and fully dynamic graph algorithms for several other fundamental graph statistics (including the triangle count, the number of connected components, the size of the maximum matching, and the degree histogram), analyze their error and show strong lower bounds on the error for all algorithms in this setting. We study two variants of edge differential privacy for fully dynamic graph algorithms: event-level and item-level. We give upper and lower bounds on the error of both event-level and item-level fully dynamic algorithms for several fundamental graph problems. No fully dynamic algorithms that are private at the item-level (the more stringent of the two notions) were known before. In the case of item-level privacy, for several problems, our algorithms match our lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Downstream Model Risks via Model Provenance</title>

Abstract: Research and industry are rapidly advancing the innovation and adoption of foundation model-based systems, yet the tools for managing these models have not kept pace. Understanding the provenance and lineage of models is critical for researchers, industry, regulators, and public trust. While model cards and system cards were designed to provide transparency, they fall short in key areas: tracing model genealogy, enabling machine readability, offering reliable centralized management systems, and fostering consistent creation incentives. This challenge mirrors issues in software supply chain security, but AI/ML remains at an earlier stage of maturity. Addressing these gaps requires industry-standard tooling that can be adopted by foundation model publishers, open-source model innovators, and major distribution platforms. We propose a machine-readable model specification format to simplify the creation of model records, thereby reducing error-prone human effort, notably when a new model inherits most of its design from a foundation model. Our solution explicitly traces relationships between upstream and downstream models, enhancing transparency and traceability across the model lifecycle. To facilitate the adoption, we introduce the unified model record (UMR) repository , a semantically versioned system that automates the publication of model records to multiple formats (PDF, HTML, LaTeX) and provides a hosted web interface (https://modelrecord.com/). This proof of concept aims to set a new standard for managing foundation models, bridging the gap between innovation and responsible model management.</description>

      <title>SciSafeEval: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Safety Alignment of Large Language Models in Scientific Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have a transformative impact on a variety of scientific tasks across disciplines including biology, chemistry, medicine, and physics. However, ensuring the safety alignment of these models in scientific research remains an underexplored area, with existing benchmarks primarily focusing on textual content and overlooking key scientific representations such as molecular, protein, and genomic languages. Moreover, the safety mechanisms of LLMs in scientific tasks are insufficiently studied. To address these limitations, we introduce SciSafeEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety alignment of LLMs across a range of scientific tasks. SciSafeEval spans multiple scientific languages-including textual, molecular, protein, and genomic-and covers a wide range of scientific domains. We evaluate LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought settings, and introduce a "jailbreak" enhancement feature that challenges LLMs equipped with safety guardrails, rigorously testing their defenses against malicious intention. Our benchmark surpasses existing safety datasets in both scale and scope, providing a robust platform for assessing the safety and performance of LLMs in scientific contexts. This work aims to facilitate the responsible development and deployment of LLMs, promoting alignment with safety and ethical standards in scientific research.</description>
