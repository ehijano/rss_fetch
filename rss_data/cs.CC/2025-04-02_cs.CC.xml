      <title>SAT problem and Limit of Solomonoff's inductive reasoning theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT) in the context of Kolmogorov complexity theory. We present three versions of the distinguishability problem-Boolean formulas, Turing machines, and quantum systems-each focused on distinguishing between two Bernoulli distributions induced by these computational models. A reduction is provided that establishes the equivalence between the Boolean formula version of the program output statistical prediction problem and the #SAT problem. Furthermore, we apply Solomonoff's inductive reasoning theory, revealing its limitations: the only "algorithm" capable of determining the output of any shortest program is the program itself, and any other algorithms are computationally indistinguishable from a universal computer, based on the coding theorem. The quantum version of this problem introduces a unique algorithm based on statistical distance and distinguishability, reflecting a fundamental limit in quantum mechanics. Finally, the potential equivalence of Kolmogorov complexity between circuit models and Turing machines may have significant implications for the NP vs P problem. We also investigate the nature of short programs corresponding to exponentially long bit sequences that can be compressed, revealing that these programs inherently contain loops that grow exponentially.</description>

      <title>Improved Round-by-round Soundness IOPs via Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an IOPP (interactive oracle proof of proximity) for trivariate Reed-Muller codes that achieves the best known query complexity in some range of security parameters. Specifically, for degree $d$ and security parameter $\lambda\leq \frac{\log^2 d}{\log\log d}$ , our IOPP has $2^{-\lambda}$ round-by-round soundness, $O(\lambda)$ queries, $O(\log\log d)$ rounds and $O(d)$ length. This improves upon the FRI [Ben-Sasson, Bentov, Horesh, Riabzev, ICALP 2018] and the STIR [Arnon, Chiesa, Fenzi, Yogev, Crypto 2024] IOPPs for Reed-Solomon codes, that have larger query and round complexity standing at $O(\lambda \log d)$ and $O(\log d+\lambda\log\log d)$ respectively. We use our IOPP to give an IOP for the NP-complete language Rank-1-Constraint-Satisfaction with the same parameters. Our construction is based on the line versus point test in the low-soundness regime. Compared to the axis parallel test (which is used in all prior works), the general affine lines test has improved soundness, which is the main source of our improved soundness. Using this test involves several complications, most significantly that projection to affine lines does not preserve individual degrees, and we show how to overcome these difficulties. En route, we extend some existing machinery to more general settings. Specifically, we give proximity generators for Reed-Muller codes, show a more systematic way of handling ``side conditions'' in IOP constructions, and generalize the compiling procedure of [Arnon, Chiesa, Fenzi, Yogev, Crypto 2024] to general codes.</description>

      <title>Lattice Based Crypto breaks in a Superposition of Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the computational implications of a superposition of spacetimes, a phenomenon hypothesized in quantum gravity theories. This was initiated by Shmueli (2024) where the author introduced the complexity class $\mathbf{BQP^{OI}}$ consisting of promise problems decidable by quantum polynomial time algorithms with access to an oracle for computing order interference. In this work, it was shown that the Graph Isomorphism problem and the Gap Closest Vector Problem (with approximation factor $\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2})$) are in $\mathbf{BQP^{OI}}$. We extend this result by showing that the entire complexity class $\mathbf{SZK}$ (Statistical Zero Knowledge) is contained within $\mathbf{BQP^{OI}}$. This immediately implies that the security of numerous lattice based cryptography schemes will be compromised in a computational model based on superposition of spacetimes, since these often rely on the hardness of the Learning with Errors problem, which is in $\mathbf{SZK}$.</description>

      <title>Twisted conjugacy in dihedral Artin groups I: Torus Knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16671v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an alternative solution to a result by Juh\'{a}sz that the twisted conjugacy problem for odd dihedral Artin groups is solvable, that is, groups with presentation $G(m) = \langle a,b \; | \; _{m}(a,b) = {}_{m}(b,a) \rangle$, where $m\geq 3$ is odd, and $_{m}(a,b)$ is the word $abab \dots$ of length $m$, is solvable. Our solution provides an implementable linear time algorithm, by considering an alternative group presentation to that of a torus knot group, and working with geodesic normal forms. An application of this result is that the conjugacy problem is solvable in extensions of odd dihedral Artin groups.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Circuit Discovery for Inner Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many proposed applications of neural networks in machine learning, cognitive/brain science, and society hinge on the feasibility of inner interpretability via circuit discovery. This calls for empirical and theoretical explorations of viable algorithmic options. Despite advances in the design and testing of heuristics, there are concerns about their scalability and faithfulness at a time when we lack understanding of the complexity properties of the problems they are deployed to solve. To address this, we study circuit discovery with classical and parameterized computational complexity theory: (1) we describe a conceptual scaffolding to reason about circuit finding queries in terms of affordances for description, explanation, prediction and control; (2) we formalize a comprehensive set of queries for mechanistic explanation, and propose a formal framework for their analysis; (3) we use it to settle the complexity of many query variants and relaxations of practical interest on multi-layer perceptrons. Our findings reveal a challenging complexity landscape. Many queries are intractable, remain fixed-parameter intractable relative to model/circuit features, and inapproximable under additive, multiplicative, and probabilistic approximation schemes. To navigate this landscape, we prove there exist transformations to tackle some of these hard problems with better-understood heuristics, and prove the tractability or fixed-parameter tractability of more modest queries which retain useful affordances. This framework allows us to understand the scope and limits of interpretability queries, explore viable options, and compare their resource demands on existing and future architectures.</description>

      <title>Matrix Chaos Inequalities and Chaos of Combinatorial Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix concentration inequalities and their recently discovered sharp counterparts provide powerful tools to bound the spectrum of random matrices whose entries are linear functions of independent random variables. However, in many applications in theoretical computer science and in other areas one encounters more general random matrix models, called matrix chaoses, whose entries are polynomials of independent random variables. Such models have often been studied on a case-by-case basis using ad-hoc methods that can yield suboptimal dimensional factors.
  In this paper we provide general matrix concentration inequalities for matrix chaoses, which enable the treatment of such models in a systematic manner. These inequalities are expressed in terms of flattenings of the coefficients of the matrix chaos. We further identify a special family of matrix chaoses of combinatorial type for which the flattening parameters can be computed mechanically by a simple rule. This allows us to provide a unified treatment of and improved bounds for matrix chaoses that arise in a variety of applications, including graph matrices, Khatri-Rao matrices, and matrices that arise in average case analysis of the sum-of-squares hierarchy.</description>
