      <title>Minimal grid diagrams of the prime alternating knots with 13 crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A knot is a closed loop in space without self-intersection. Two knots are equivalent if there is a self homeomorphism of space bringing one onto the other. An arc presentation is an embedding of a knot in the union of finitely many half planes with a common boundary line such that each half plane contains a simple arc of the knot. The minimal number of such half planes among all arc presentations of a given knot is called the arc index of the knot. A knot is usually presented as a planar diagram with finitely many crossings of two strands where one of the strands goes over the other. A grid diagram is a planar diagram which is a non-simple rectilinear polygon such that vertical edges always cross over horizontal edges at all crossings. It is easily seen that an arc presentation gives rise to a grid diagram and vice versa. It is known that the arc index of an alternating knot is two plus its minimal crossing number. There are 4878 prime alternating knots with minimal crossing number 13. We obtained minimal arc presentations of them in the form of grid diagrams having 15 vertical segments. This is a continuation of the works on prime alternating knots of 11 crossings and 12 crossings.</description>

      <title>The band connected sum and the second Kirby move for higher-dimensional links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f:S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ be a link (i.e. an embedding).
  How does (the isotopy class of) the knot $S^q\to S^m$ obtained by embedded connected sum of the components of $f$ depend on $f$?
  Define a link $\sigma f:S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ as follows. The first component of $\sigma f$ is the `standardly shifted' first component of $f$. The second component of $\sigma f$ is the embedded connected sum of the components of $f$. How does (the isotopy class of) $\sigma f$ depend on $f$?
  How does (the isotopy class of) the link $S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ obtained by embedded connected sum of the last two components of a link $g:S^q_1\sqcup S^q_2\sqcup S^q_3\to S^m$ depend on $g$?
  We give the answers for the `first non-trivial case' $q=4k-1$ and $m=6k$. The first answer was used by S. Avvakumov for classification of linked 3-manifolds in $S^6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake the study of profinite quandles. We provide several constructions of profinite quandles from profinite groups, and from other profinite quandle. We characterize which subquandles of profinite quandles are again profinite. Finally, we provide a characterization of algebraically connected profinite quandles in terms of the profinite completion of their inner automorphism groups $\widehat{\Inn(Q)}$. It is anticipated that the results herein will find applications to the \'{e}tale homotopy theory of number fields.</description>

      <title>Topological invariants of 3-dimensional manifold with boundary by using crossed module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: J.H.C. Whitehead introduced the concept of crossed modules in the early 20th century. These crossed modules are crucial for algebraic models of 2-type homotopy, which involve connected spaces with no higher than second-degree homotopy groups. They consist of two groups and certain relations between them, with known connections to 2-groups.
  By employing crossed modules, we can develop invariants for closed 3-dimensional and 4-dimensional manifolds. The validity of these invariants was established in a paper authored by F.Girelli, H.Pfeiffer, and E.M.Popescu([4]).
  Essentially, these invariants involve counting correct colors over the triangulation of a closed manifold. Interestingly, I've discovered that these invariants can also be applied to compact 3-dimensional manifolds with boundaries. Therefore, in this paper, I intend to demonstrate how these invariants can be utilized for compact 3-dimensional manifolds with boundaries, including the complements of knots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper classifies the pairs of nonzero integers $(m,n)$ for which the locally compact group of combinatorial automorphisms, Aut$(X_{m,n})$, contains incommensurable torsion-free lattices, where $X_{m,n}$ is the combinatorial model for Baumslag-Solitar group $BS(m, n)$. In particular, we show that Aut$(X_{m,n})$ contains abstractly incommensurable torsion-free lattices if and only if there exists a prime $p \leq gcd(m, n)$ such that either $m/gcd(m,n)$ or $n/gcd(m,n)$ is divisible by $p$. Additionally, we show that when Aut$(X_{m,n})$ does not contain incommensurable lattices, the cell complex $X_{m,n}$ satisfies Leighton$'$s property.</description>

      <title>Walks with jumps: a neurobiologically motivated class of paths in the hyperbolic plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a "walk with jumps", which we conceive as an evolving process in which a point moves in a space (for us, typically $\mathbb{H}^2$) over time, in a consistent direction and at a consistent speed except that it is interrupted by a finite set of "jumps" in a fixed direction and distance from the walk direction. Our motivation is biological; specifically, to use walks with jumps to encode the activity of a neuron over time (a ``spike train``). Because (in $\mathbb{H}^2$) the walk is built out of a sequence of transformations that do not commute, the walk's endpoint encodes aspects of the sequence of jump times beyond their total number, but does so incompletely. The main results of the paper use the tools of hyperbolic geometry to give positive and negative answers to the following question: to what extent does the endpoint of a walk with jumps faithfully encode the walk's sequence of jump times?</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology of Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triple periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) have garnered significant interest due to their structural efficiency and controllable geometry, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. This paper investigates the relationships between porosity and persistence entropy with the shape factor of TPMS. We propose conjectures suggesting that these relationships are polynomial in nature, derived through the application of machine learning techniques. This study exemplifies the integration of machine learning methodologies in pure mathematical research. Besides the conjectures, we provide the mathematical models that might have the potential implications for the design and modeling of TPMS structures in various practical applications.</description>

      <title>Knots, Perturbative Series and Quantum Modularity</title>

Abstract: We introduce an invariant of a hyperbolic knot which is a map $\alpha\mapsto \boldsymbol{\Phi}_\alpha(h)$ from $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ to matrices with entries in $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}[[h]]$ and with rows and columns indexed by the boundary parabolic ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ representations of the fundamental group of the knot. These matrix invariants have a rich structure: (a) their $(\sigma_0,\sigma_1)$ entry, where $\sigma_0$ is the trivial and $\sigma_1$ the geometric representation, is the power series expansion of the Kashaev invariant of the knot around the root of unity ${\rm e}^{2\pi{\rm i} \alpha}$ as an element of the Habiro ring, and the remaining entries belong to generalized Habiro rings of number fields; (b) the first column is given by the perturbative power series of Dimofte-Garoufalidis; (c) the columns of $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ are fundamental solutions of a linear $q$-difference equation; (d) the matrix defines an ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-cocycle $W_\gamma$ in matrix-valued functions on $\mathbb{Q}$ that conjecturally extends to a smooth function on $\mathbb{R}$ and even to holomorphic functions on suitable complex cut planes, lifting the factorially divergent series $\boldsymbol{\Phi}(h)$ to actual functions. The two invariants $\boldsymbol{\Phi}$ and $W_\gamma$ are related by a refined quantum modularity conjecture which we illustrate in detail for the three simplest hyperbolic knots, the $4_1$, $5_2$ and $(-2,3,7)$ pretzel knots. This paper has two sequels, one giving a different realization of our invariant as a matrix of convergent $q$-series with integer coefficients and the other studying its Habiro-like arithmetic properties in more depth.</description>

Abstract: For a punctured surface $\mathfrak{S}$, the author and Scarinci (arXiv:2112.13329) have recently constructed a quantization of a moduli space of Lorentzian metrics on the 3-manifold $\mathfrak{S} \times \mathbb{R}$ of constant sectional curvature $\Lambda \in \{-1,0,1\}$. The invariance of this quantization under the action of the mapping class group ${\rm MCG}(\mathfrak{S})$ of $\mathfrak{S}$ yields families of unitary representations of ${\rm MCG}(\mathfrak{S})$ on a Hilbert space, with key ingredients being three versions of the quantum dilogarithm functions depending on $\Lambda$. In this survey article, we review and elaborate on this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an oriented smooth manifold, and $\operatorname{Homeo}(M,\omega)$ the group of measure preserving homeomorphisms of $M$, where $\omega$ is a finite measure induced by a volume form. In this paper we define volume and Euler classes in bounded cohomology of an infinite dimensional transformation group $\operatorname{Homeo}_0(M,\omega)$ and $\operatorname{Homeo}(M,\omega)$ respectively, and in several cases prove their non-triviality. More precisely, we define:
  - Volume classes in $\operatorname{H}_b^n(\operatorname{Homeo}_0(M,\omega))$ where $M$ is a hyperbolic manifold of dimension $n$.
  - Euler classes in $\operatorname{H}_b^2(\operatorname{Homeo}(S,\omega))$ where $S$ is a closed hyperbolic surface.
  We show that Euler classes have positive norms for any closed hyperbolic $S$ and volume classes have positive norms for all hyperbolic surfaces and certain hyperbolic $3$-manifolds, and hence they are non-trivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new proof of the Giroux Correspondence for tight contact $3$-manifolds using techniques from Heegaard splittings and convex surface theory. We introduce tight Heegaard splittings, which generalise the Heegaard splittings naturally induced by an open book decomposition of a contact manifold. Via a process called refinement, any tight Heegaard splitting determines an open book, up to positive open book stabilisation. This allows us to translate moves relating distinct tight Heegaard splittings into moves relating their associated open books. We use these tools to show that every Heegaard splitting of a contact 3-manifold may be stabilised to a splitting associated to a supporting open book decomposition. Finally, we prove the tight Giroux Correspondence, showing that any pair of open book decompositions compatible with isotopic contact structures become isotopic after a sequence of positive open book stabilisations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\em topological symmetry group} of an embedding $\Gamma$ of an abstract graph $\gamma$ in $S^3$ is the group of automorphisms of $\gamma$ which can be realized by homeomorphisms of the pair $(S^3, \Gamma)$. These groups are motivated by questions about the symmetries of molecules in space. In this paper, we find all the groups which can be realized as topological symmetry groups for each of the graphs in the Heawood family. This is an important collection of spatial graphs, containing the only intrinsically knotted graphs with 21 or fewer edges. As a consequence, we discover that the graphs in this family are all intrinsically chiral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.00567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a simple combinatorial criterion, in terms of an action on a hyperbolic simplicial complex, for a group to be hierarchically hyperbolic. We apply this to show that quotients of mapping class groups by large powers of Dehn twists are hierarchically hyperbolic (and even relatively hyperbolic in the genus 2 case). Under residual finiteness assumptions, we construct many non-elementary hyperbolic quotients of mapping class groups. Using these quotients, we reduce questions of Reid and Bridson-Reid-Wilton about finite quotients of mapping class groups to residual finiteness of specific hyperbolic groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for many right-angled Artin and Coxeter groups, all cocompact cubulations coarsely look the same: they induce the same coarse median structure on the group. These are the first examples of non-hyperbolic groups with this property.
  For all graph products of finite groups and for Coxeter groups with no irreducible affine parabolic subgroups of rank $\geq 3$, we show that all automorphism preserve the coarse median structure induced, respectively, by the Davis complex and the Niblo-Reeves cubulation. As a consequence, automorphisms of these groups have nice fixed subgroups and satisfy Nielsen realisation.</description>

      <title>Random actions of homeomorphisms of Cantor sets embedded in a line and Tits alternative</title>

Abstract: In 2000, Margulis proved that any group of homeomorphisms of the circle either preserves a probabilty measure on the circle or contains a free subgroup in two generators, which is reminiscent of the Tits alternatve for linear groups. In this article, we prove an analogous statement for groups of locally monotonic homeomorphisms of a compact subset of R.</description>

      <title>On the motivic description of truncated fundamental group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A topological theorem that appears in a paper by Deligne-Goncharov (and which they attribute to Beilinson) states the following. Let $(X,*)$ be a path connected pointed space with a reasonable topology and denote by $I$ the augmentation ideal of its fundamental group ring. Then for every field F and positive integer n, the space of F-valued linear forms on $ I/I^{n+1}$ is naturally isomorphic to $H^n(X^n,X(n,*); F)$, where $X(n,*)$ is an explicitly defined subspace of $X^n$.
  We here construct a simple isomorphism between $I/I^{n+1}$ and $H_n(X^n,X(n,*); \mathbf{Z})$ and express the maps that define the Hopf algebra structure on the $I$-adic completion of the fundamental group ring of $(X,*)$ in these terms.</description>

      <title>Generic doubling of rectangular pegs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a multiplicity result for rectangular pegs that there is a generic class of smooth Jordan curves in which every curve admits two geometrically distinct similar inscribed rectangles with aspect angle in $(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$, based on the a priori existence result of rectangular peg by Greene and Lobb, in which the rectangular peg problem is translated into finding intersection points of two Lagrangian tori. The key insights are certain generic geometric transversality of the two tori, and the correspondence between the intersection points and the inscribed rectangles. We present two distinct proofs: one involves the Lagrangian Floer homology, and the other is differential topological in nature which employs a novel computation formula for the algebraic intersection number. In Appendix B, written jointly with Urs Frauenfelder, we provide the detailed derivation of this computation formula.</description>
