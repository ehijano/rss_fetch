      <title>Spontaneous disentanglement and thermalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of quantum measurement can be partially resolved by incorporating a process of spontaneous disentanglement into quantum dynamics. We propose a modified master equation, which contains a nonlinear term giving rise to both spontaneous disentanglement and thermalisation. We find that the added nonlinear term enables limit cycle steady states, which are prohibited in standard quantum mechanics. This finding suggests that an experimental observation of such a limit cycle steady state can provide an important evidence supporting the spontaneous disentanglement hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Quantum Patch-Based Autoencoder for Anomaly Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning investigates the possibility of quantum computers enhancing Machine Learning algorithms. Anomaly segmentation is a fundamental task in various domains to identify irregularities at sample level and can be addressed with both supervised and unsupervised methods. Autoencoders are commonly used in unsupervised tasks, where models are trained to reconstruct normal instances efficiently, allowing anomaly identification through high reconstruction errors. While quantum autoencoders have been proposed in the literature, their application to anomaly segmentation tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a patch-based quantum autoencoder (QPB-AE) for image anomaly segmentation, with a number of parameters scaling logarithmically with patch size. QPB-AE reconstructs the quantum state of the embedded input patches, computing an anomaly map directly from measurement through a SWAP test without reconstructing the input image. We evaluate its performance across multiple datasets and parameter configurations and compare it against a classical counterpart.</description>

      <title>Momentum exchange method for quantum Boltzmann methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past years have seen a surge in quantum algorithms for computational fluid dynamics (CFD). These algorithms have in common that whilst promising a speed-up in the performance of the algorithm, no specific method of measurement has been suggested. This means that while the algorithms presented in the literature may be promising methods for creating the quantum state that represents the final flow field, an efficient measurement strategy is not available. This paper marks the first quantum method proposed to efficiently calculate quantities of interest (QoIs) from a state vector representing the flow field. In particular, we propose a method to calculate the force acting on an object immersed in the fluid using a quantum version of the momentum exchange method (MEM) that is commonly used in lattice Boltzmann methods to determine the drag and lift coefficients. In order to achieve this we furthermore give a scheme that implements bounce back boundary conditions on a quantum computer, as those are the boundary conditions the momentum exchange method is designed for.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory, or Bohmian mechanics, we examine two pedagogical problems that illustrate the bound and unbound motion of spin-1/2 particles: First, a single spin-1/2 particle trapped in the ground state of a spherical box is studied in both the relativistic and nonrelativistic versions of the theory; second, the free time evolution of this particle once the confinement is released is examined, demonstrating how the Fourier transform of the prepared wave function yields the statistics of the particle's far-field (asymptotic) velocity, thereby providing a deeper understanding of time-of-flight momentum spectroscopy techniques.</description>

      <title>Programmable Photonic Quantum Circuits with Ultrafast Time-bin Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum information processing platform that utilizes the ultrafast time-bin encoding of photons. This approach offers a pathway to scalability by leveraging the inherent phase stability of collinear temporal interferometric networks at the femtosecond-to-picosecond timescale. The proposed architecture encodes information in ultrafast temporal bins processed using optically induced nonlinearities and birefringent materials while keeping photons in a single spatial mode. We demonstrate the potential for scalable photonic quantum information processing through two independent experiments that showcase the platform's programmability and scalability, respectively. The scheme's programmability is demonstrated in the first experiment, where we successfully program 362 different unitary transformations in up to 8 dimensions in a temporal circuit. In the second experiment, we show the scalability of ultrafast time-bin encoding by building a passive optical network, with increasing circuit depth, of up to 36 optical modes. In each experiment, fidelities exceed 97\%, while the interferometric phase remains passively stable for several days.</description>

      <title>Toward a 2D Local Implementation of Quantum LDPC Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric locality is an important theoretical and practical factor for quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes which affects code performance and ease of physical realization. For device architectures restricted to 2D local gates, naively implementing the high-rate codes suitable for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing incurs prohibitive overhead. In this work, we present an error correction protocol built on a bilayer architecture that aims to reduce operational overheads when restricted to 2D local gates by measuring some generators less frequently than others. We investigate the family of bivariate bicycle qLDPC codes and show that they are well suited for a parallel syndrome measurement scheme using fast routing with local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Through circuit-level simulations, we find that in some parameter regimes bivariate bicycle codes implemented with this protocol have logical error rates comparable to the surface code while using fewer physical qubits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple description of rectangular matrices that can be implemented by a post-selected stabilizer circuit. Given a matrix with entries in dyadic cyclotomic number fields $\mathbb{Q}(\exp(i\frac{2\pi}{2^m}))$, we show that it can be implemented by a post-selected stabilizer circuit if it has entries in $\mathbb{Z}[\exp(i\frac{2\pi}{2^m})]$ when expressed in a certain non-orthogonal basis. This basis is related to Barnes-Wall lattices. Our result is a generalization to a well-known connection between Clifford groups and Barnes-Wall lattices. We also show that minimal vectors of Barnes-Wall lattices are stabilizer states, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we provide a few examples of generalizations beyond standard Clifford groups.</description>

      <title>A quantum annealing approach to minimum distance problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) is at the heart of fault-tolerant quantum computing. As the size of quantum platforms is expected to grow, one of the open questions is to design new optimal codes of ever-increasing size. A related challenge is to ``certify'' the quality of a given code by evaluating its minimum distance, a quantity characterizing code's capacity to preserve quantum information. This problem is known to be NP-hard. Here we propose to harness the power of contemporary quantum platforms to address this question, and in this way help design quantum platforms of the future. Namely, we introduce an approach to compute the minimum distance of quantum stabilizer codes by reformulating the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and leveraging established QUBO algorithms and heuristics as well as quantum annealing (QA) to address the latter. The reformulation as a QUBO introduces only a logarithmic multiplicative overhead in the required number of variables. We demonstrate practical viability of our method by comparing the performance of purely classical algorithms with the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 quantum annealer as well as hybrid quantum-classical algorithm Qbsolv. We found that the hybrid approach demonstrates competitive performance, on par with the best available classical algorithms to solve QUBO. In a practical sense, the QUBO-based approach is currently lagging behind the best deterministic minimal distance algorithms, however this advantage may disappear as the size of the platforms grows.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mediated Semi-Quantum Key Distribution Protocol Using Single Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new efficient mediated semi-quantum key distribution (MSQKD) protocol, facilitating the establishment of a shared secret key between two classical participants with the assistance of an untrusted third party (TP). Unlike existing MSQKD protocols, our approach significantly reduces the quantum requirements for TP, who only needs to prepare and measure qubits in the $X$ basis. Meanwhile, the classical participants are limited to preparing and measuring qubits in the $Z$ basis, along with performing Hadamard operations. This reduction in quantum overhead enhances the practicality of our MSQKD protocol without compromising qubit efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate the security of our protocol against various well-known attacks.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$ gates using a fixed coupler driven by two microwave pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attaining high-fidelity two-qubit gates represents a pivotal quantum operation for the realization of large-scale quantum computation and simulation. In this study, we propose a microwave-control protocol for the implementation of a two-qubit gate employing two transmon qubits coupled via a fixed-frequency transmon coupler. This protocol entails applying two microwave pulses exclusively to the coupler, thereby inducing interaction between the fixed-frequency transmon qubits. This interaction facilitates the realization of $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$ gates. Additionally, we explore the implementation of the gate scheme in two distinct qubit architectures. Demonstrating with experimentally accessible parameters, we show that high-fidelity $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$ gates can be achieved</description>

      <title>Trapping polar molecules by surface acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to trap polar molecules with the electrical force induced by the surface acoustic wave (SAW) on piezoelectric materials. In this approach, the electrical force is perpendicular to the moving direction of the polar molecules, and is used to control the positions of trapped polar molecules in the direction orthogonal to the acoustic transmission. By virtue of an external electrical force, the SAW-induced electrical field can trap the polar molecules into single-layer or multi-layer lattices. The arrangement of molecules can affect the binding energy and localization of the molecule array. Then the one- or two-dimensional trapped polar molecule arrays can be used to construct the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model, whose energy and dynamics are affected by the localizations of the trapped molecules. We find that the phase transitions between the superfluid and Mott insulator based on trapped polar molecule BH model can be modulated by the SAW induced electrical potential.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum sensing of the nonlinear bosonic interactions using Fock states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear processes with individual quanta beyond bilinear interactions are essential for quantum technology with bosonic systems. Diverse coherent splitting and merging of quanta in them already manifest in the estimation of their nonlinear coupling from observed statistics. We derive non-trivial, but optimal strategies for sensing the basic and experimentally available trilinear interactions using non-classical particle-like Fock states as a probe and feasible measurement strategies. Remarkably, the optimal probing of nonlinear coupling reaches estimation errors scaled down with $N^{-1/3}$ for overall $N$ of quanta in specific but available high-quality Fock states in all interacting modes. It can reveal unexplored aspects of nonlinear dynamics relevant to using such nonlinear processes in bosonic experiments with trapped ions and superconducting circuits and opens further developments of quantum technology with them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of efficiently computing the stationary distribution of general classes of structured Markov processes. In strong contrast with previous work, we consider this problem within the context of quantum computational environments from a mathematical perspective and devise the first quantum algorithms for computing the stationary distribution of structured Markov processes. We derive a mathematical analysis of the computational properties of our quantum algorithms together with related theoretical results, establishing that our quantum algorithms provide the potential for significant computational improvements over that of the best-known classical algorithms in various settings of both theoretical and practical importance. Although motivated by structured Markov processes, our quantum algorithms have the potential for being exploited to address a much larger class of numerical computation problems.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Low-Latency, Quantum-Ready RF Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown the promise of applying deep learning to enhance software processing of radio frequency (RF) signals. In parallel, hardware developments with quantum RF sensors based on Rydberg atoms are breaking longstanding barriers in frequency range, resolution, and sensitivity. In this paper, we describe our implementations of quantum-ready machine learning approaches for RF signal classification. Our primary objective is latency: while deep learning offers a more powerful computational paradigm, it also traditionally incurs latency overheads that hinder wider scale deployment. Our work spans three axes. (1) A novel continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that enables flexible online classification of RF signals on-the-fly with reduced sampling time. (2) Low-latency inference techniques for both GPU and CPU that span over 100x reductions in inference time, enabling real-time operation with sub-millisecond inference. (3) Quantum-readiness validated through application of our models to physics-based simulation of Rydberg atom QRF sensors. Altogether, our work bridges towards next-generation RF sensors that use quantum technology to surpass previous physical limits, paired with latency-optimized AI/ML software that is suitable for real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>XGSwap: eXtreme Gradient boosting Swap for Routing in NISQ Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current landscape of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, the inherent noise presents significant challenges to achieving high-fidelity long-range entanglement. Furthermore, this challenge is amplified by the limited connectivity of current superconducting devices, necessitating state permutations to establish long-distance entanglement. Traditionally, graph methods are used to satisfy the coupling constraints of a given architecture by routing states along the shortest undirected path between qubits. In this work, we introduce a gradient boosting machine learning model to predict the fidelity of alternative--potentially longer--routing paths to improve fidelity. This model was trained on 4050 random CNOT gates ranging in length from 2 to 100+ qubits. The experiments were all executed on ibm_quebec, a 127-qubit IBM Quantum System One. Through more than 200+ tests run on actual hardware, our model successfully identified higher fidelity paths in approximately 23% of cases.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Watermarking for Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing represents a burgeoning computational paradigm that significantly advances the resolution of contemporary intricate problems across various domains, including cryptography, chemistry, and machine learning. Quantum circuits tailored to address specific problems have emerged as critical intellectual properties (IPs) for quantum computing companies, attributing to the escalating commercial value of quantum computing. Consequently, designing watermarking schemes for quantum circuits becomes imperative to thwart malicious entities from producing unauthorized circuit replicas and unlawfully disseminating them within the market.
  Unfortunately, the prevailing watermarking technique reliant on unitary matrix decomposition markedly inflates the number of 2-qubit gates and circuit depth, thereby compromising the fidelity of watermarked circuits when embedding detectable signatures into the corresponding unitary matrices. In this paper, we propose an innovative multi-stage watermarking scheme for quantum circuits, introducing additional constraints across various synthesis stages to validate the ownership of IPs. Compared to the state-of-the-art watermarking technique, our multi-stage watermarking approach demonstrates, on average, a reduction in the number of 2-qubit gates by 16\% and circuit depth by 6\%, alongside an increase in the fidelity of watermarked circuits by 8\%, while achieving a 79.4\% lower probabilistic proof of authorship.</description>

      <title>Variational Optimization for Quantum Problems using Deep Generative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization is one of the keystones of modern science and engineering. Its applications in quantum technology and machine learning helped nurture variational quantum algorithms and generative AI respectively. We propose a general approach to design variational optimization algorithms based on generative models: the Variational Generative Optimization Network (VGON). To demonstrate its broad applicability, we apply VGON to three quantum tasks: finding the best state in an entanglement-detection protocol, finding the ground state of a 1D quantum spin model with variational quantum circuits, and generating degenerate ground states of many-body quantum Hamiltonians. For the first task, VGON greatly reduces the optimization time compared to stochastic gradient descent while generating nearly optimal quantum states. For the second task, VGON alleviates the barren plateau problem in variational quantum circuits. For the final task, VGON can identify the degenerate ground state spaces after a single stage of training and generate a variety of states therein.</description>

Abstract: In a theoretical study, we investigate the spin dynamics of interacting nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers and quadrupolar I = 3/2 nuclear spins, specifically 11B spins in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets located near the microdiamond surface. We demonstrate the possibility of obtaining external spin-polarization by magnetic-field sweeps across the level anticrossings around zero-field. To achieve this, we leverage crystal strains to establish a polarization transfer mechanism that remains robust against variations in NV orientation, crystal strain inhomogeneity, and electron-nuclear effective couplings. These results pave the way for hyperpolarization of spins in nanomaterials near the diamond surface without experiencing polarization loss to intrinsic nuclear spin-1/2 species, such as 13C and 1H nuclear spins in diamond. The 11B spins in h-BN nanosheets, with their extended relaxation time and large surface area, present a promising alternative for relayed nuclear polarization to the liquid phase and for the development of quantum simulators based on surface nuclear spins.</description>

      <title>The power of shallow-depth Toffoli and qudit quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relevance of shallow-depth quantum circuits has recently increased, mainly due to their applicability to near-term devices. In this context, one of the main goals of quantum circuit complexity is to find problems that can be solved by quantum shallow circuits but require more computational resources classically.
  Our first contribution in this work is to prove new separations between classical and quantum constant-depth circuits. Firstly, we show a separation between constant-depth quantum circuits with quantum advice $\mathsf{QNC}^0/\mathsf{qpoly}$, and $\mathsf{AC}^0[p]$, which is the class of classical constant-depth circuits with unbounded-fan in and $\pmod{p}$ gates. In addition, we show a separation between $\mathsf{QAC}^0$, which additionally has Toffoli gates with unbounded control, and $\mathsf{AC}^0[p]$. This establishes the first such separation for a shallow-depth quantum class that does not involve quantum fan-out gates.
  Secondly, we consider $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits with infinite-size gate sets. We show that these circuits, along with (classical or quantum) prime modular gates, can implement threshold gates, showing that $\mathsf{QNC}^0[p]=\mathsf{QTC}^0$. Finally, we also show that in the infinite-size gateset case, these quantum circuit classes for higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces do not offer any advantage to standard qubit implementations.</description>

      <title>Performance advantage of quantum hypothesis testing for partially coherent optical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the presence of a potential optical source in the interest region is important for an imaging system and can be achieved by using hypothesis testing. The previous studies assume that the potential source is completely incoherent. In this paper, this problem is generalized to the scenario with partially coherent sources and any prior probabilities. We compare the error probability limit given by the quantum Helstrom bound with the error probability given by direct decision based on the prior probability. On this basis, the quantum-optimal detection advantage and detection-useless region are analyzed. For practical purposes, we propose a specific detection strategy using binary spatial-mode demultiplexing, which can be used in the scenarios without any prior information. This strategy shows superior detection performance and the results hold prospects for achieving super-resolved microscopic and astronomical imaging.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Majumdar-Ghosh spin chain model and Max-cut problem using variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, energy levels of the Majumdar-Ghosh model (MGM) are analyzed up to 15 spins chain in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum framework using noisy simulations. This is a useful model whose exact solution is known for a particular choice of interaction coefficients. We have solved this model for interaction coefficients other than that required for the exactly solvable conditions as this solution can be of help in understanding the quantum phase transitions in complex spin chain models. The solutions are obtained using quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOA), and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). To obtain the solutions, the one-dimensional lattice network is mapped to a Hamiltonian that corresponds to the required interaction coefficients among spins. Then, the ground states energy eigenvalue of this Hamiltonian is found using QAOA and VQE. Further, the validity of the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem in the context of MGM is established by employing variational quantum deflation to find the first excited energy of MGM. Solution for an unweighted Max-cut graph for 17 nodes is also obtained using QAOA and VQE to know which one of these two techniques performs better in a combinatorial optimization problem. Since the variational quantum algorithms used here to revisit the Max-cut problem and MGM are hybrid algorithms, they require classical optimization. Consequently, the results obtained using different types of classical optimizers are compared to reveal that the QNSPSA optimizer improves the convergence of QAOA in comparison to the SPSA optimizer. However, VQE with EfficientSU2 ansatz using the SPSA optimizer yields the best results.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for quantum entropy production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum thermodynamics, entropy production is usually defined in terms of the quantum relative entropy between two states. We derive a lower bound for the quantum entropy production in terms of the mean and variance of quantum observables, which we will refer to as a thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) for the entropy production. In the absence of coherence between the states, our result reproduces classic TURs in stochastic thermodynamics. For the derivation of the TUR, we introduce a lower bound for a quantum generalization of the $\chi^2$ divergence between two states and discuss its implications for stochastic and quantum thermodynamics, as well as the limiting case where it reproduces the quantum Cram\'er-Rao inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the effects of postselected von Neumann measurement on the nonclassicality of the Single-Photon-Subtracted-Squeezed-Vacuum-State (SPSSVS). We calculate the squeezing effect, Mandel factor, Wigner function, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)s and state distance function.We found that postselected von Neumann measurement has positive effects on the optimization of SPSSVS. In particular, by properly choosing the anomalous weak value, the nonclassical inherent features of SPSSVS such as squeezing, photon statistics and phase space distribution can be optimized significantly. The advantages of postselected weak measurement on improving the SNR compared to non-postselected measurement scheme is also confirmed. The superiority of SPSSVS based postselected weak measurement in quantum state optimization may have potential applications of in the associated quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Permutation-equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Symmetric group $S_{n}$ manifests itself in large classes of quantum systems as the invariance of certain characteristics of a quantum state with respect to permuting the qubits. The subgroups of $S_{n}$ arise, among many other contexts, to describe label symmetry of classical images with respect to spatial transformations, e.g. reflection or rotation. Equipped with the formalism of geometric quantum machine learning, in this work we propose the architectures of equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks (EQCNNs) adherent to $S_{n}$ and its subgroups. We demonstrate that a careful choice of pixel-to-qubit embedding order can facilitate easy construction of EQCNNs for small subgroups of $S_{n}$. Our novel EQCNN architecture corresponding to the full permutation group $S_{n}$ is built by applying all possible QCNNs with equal probability, which can also be conceptualized as a dropout strategy in quantum neural networks. For subgroups of $S_{n}$, our numerical results using MNIST datasets show better classification accuracy than non-equivariant QCNNs. The $S_{n}$-equivariant QCNN architecture shows significantly improved training and test performance than non-equivariant QCNN for classification of connected and non-connected graphs. When trained with sufficiently large number of data, the $S_{n}$-equivariant QCNN shows better average performance compared to $S_{n}$-equivariant QNN . These results contribute towards building powerful quantum machine learning architectures in permutation-symmetric systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A matrix can be converted into a doubly stochastic matrix by using two diagonal matrices. And a doubly stochastic matrix can be written as a sum of permutation matrices. In this paper, we describe a method to write a given generic matrix in terms of quantum gates based on the block encoding.
  In particular, we first show how to convert a matrix into doubly stochastic matrices and by using Birkhoff's algorithm, we express that matrix in terms of a linear combination of permutations which can be mapped to quantum circuits. We then discuss a few optimization techniques that can be applied in a possibly future quantum compiler software based on the method described here.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization for state engineering of quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State engineering of quantum objects is a central requirement in most implementations. In the cases where the quantum dynamics can be described by analytical solutions or simple approximation models, optimal state preparation protocols have been theoretically proposed and experimentally realized. For more complex systems, however, such as multi-component quantum gases, simplifying assumptions do not apply anymore and the optimization techniques become computationally impractical. Here, we propose Bayesian optimization based on multi-output Gaussian processes to learn the quantum state's physical properties from few simulations only. We evaluate its performance on an optimization study case of diabatically transporting a Bose-Einstein condensate while keeping it in its ground state, and show that within only few hundreds of executions of the underlying physics simulation, we reach a competitive performance with other protocols. While restricting this benchmarking to well known approximations for straightforward comparisons, we expect a similar performance when employing more involving models, which are computationally more challenging. This paves the way to efficient state engineering of complex quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bethe equations, whose solutions determine exact eigenvalues and eigenstates of corresponding integrable Hamiltonians, are generally hard to solve. We implement a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) approach to estimating Bethe roots of the spin-1/2 XXZ quantum spin chain, by using Bethe states as trial states, and treating Bethe roots as variational parameters. In numerical simulations of systems of size up to 6, we obtain estimates for Bethe roots corresponding to both ground states and excited states with up to 5 down-spins, for both the closed and open XXZ chains. This approach is not limited to real Bethe roots.</description>

      <title>Quantum signatures of the mixed classical phase space for three interacting particles in a circular trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically two consequences of the mixed classical phase space for three repulsively-interacting bosonic particles in a circular trap. First, we show that the energy levels of the corresponding quantum system are well described by a Berry-Robnik distribution. Second, we identify stationary quantum states whose density is enhanced along the stable classical periodic trajectories, and calculate their energies and wavefunctions using the semiclassical Einstein-Brillouin-Keller (EBK) theory. Our EBK results are in excellent agreement with our full-fledged finite-element numerics. We discuss the impact of discrete symmetries, including bosonic exchange symmetry, on these classically localized states. They are within experimental reach, and occur in the same range of energies as the quantum scar reported in our previous work [Phys. Rev. A 107, 022217 (2023)].</description>

      <title>A Universal Kinematical Group for Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1968, Dashen and Sharp obtained a certain singular Lie algebra of local densities and currents from canonical commutation relations in nonrelativistic quantum field theory. The corresponding Lie group is infinite dimensional: the natural semidirect product of an additive group of scalar functions with a group of diffeomorphisms. Unitary representations of this group describe a wide variety of quantum systems, and have predicted previously unsuspected possibilities; notably, anyons and nonabelian anyons in two space dimensions. We present here foundational reasons why this semidirect product group serves as a universal kinematical group for quantum mechanics. We obtain thus a unified account of all possible quantum kinematics for systems with mass in an arbitrary physical space, and clarify the role played by topology in quantum mechanics. Our development does not require quantization of classical phase space; rather, the classical limit follows from the quantum mechanics. We also consider the relationship of our development to Heisenberg quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum sensor networks has presented opportunities for enhancing complex sensing tasks, while simultaneously introducing significant challenges in designing and analyzing quantum sensing protocols due to the intricate nature of entanglement and physical processes. Supervised learning assisted by an entangled sensor network (SLAEN) [Phys. Rev. X 9, 041023 (2019)] represents a promising paradigm for automating sensor-network design through variational quantum machine learning. However, the original SLAEN, constrained by the Gaussian nature of quantum circuits, is limited to learning linearly separable data. Leveraging the universal quantum control available in cavity-QED experiments, we propose a generalized SLAEN capable of handling nonlinear data classification tasks. We establish a theoretical framework for physical-layer data classification to underpin our approach. Through training quantum probes and measurements, we uncover a threshold phenomenon in classification error across various tasks -- when the energy of probes exceeds a certain threshold, the error drastically diminishes to zero, providing a significant improvement over the Gaussian SLAEN. Despite the non-Gaussian nature of the problem, we offer analytical insights into determining the threshold and residual error in the presence of noise. Our findings carry implications for radio-frequency photonic sensors and microwave dark matter haloscopes.</description>

Abstract: Network coordination is considered in three basic settings, characterizing the generation of separable and classical-quantum correlations among multiple parties. First, we consider the simulation of a classical-quantum state between two nodes with rate-limited common randomness (CR) and communication. Furthermore, we study the preparation of a separable state between multiple nodes with rate-limited CR and no communication. At last, we consider a broadcast setting, where a sender and two receivers simulate a classical-quantum-quantum state using rate-limited CR and communication. We establish the optimal tradeoff between communication and CR rates in each setting.</description>

      <title>GNarsil: Splitting Stabilizers into Gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum subsystem codes have been shown to improve error-correction performance, ease the implementation of logical operations on codes, and make stabilizer measurements easier by decomposing stabilizers into smaller-weight gauge operators. In this paper, we present two algorithms that produce new subsystem codes from a "seed" CSS code. They replace some stabilizers of a given CSS code with smaller-weight gauge operators that split the remaining stabilizers, while being compatible with the logical Pauli operators of the code. The algorithms recover the well-known Bacon-Shor code computationally as well as produce a new $\left[\left[ 9,1,2,2 \right]\right]$ rotated surface subsystem code with weight-$3$ gauges and weight-$4$ stabilizers. We illustrate using a $\left[\left[ 100,25,3 \right]\right]$ subsystem hypergraph product (SHP) code that the algorithms can produce more efficient gauge operators than the closed-form expressions of the SHP construction. However, we observe that the stabilizers of the lifted product quantum LDPC codes are more challenging to split into small-weight gauge operators. Hence, we introduce the subsystem lifted product (SLP) code construction and develop a new $\left[\left[ 775, 124, 20 \right]\right]$ code from Tanner's classical quasi-cyclic LDPC code. The code has high-weight stabilizers but all gauge operators that split stabilizers have weight $5$, except one. In contrast, the LP stabilizer code from Tanner's code has parameters $\left[\left[ 1054, 124, 20 \right]\right]$. This serves as a novel example of new subsystem codes that outperform stabilizer versions of them. Finally, based on our experiments, we share some general insights about non-locality's effects on the performance of splitting stabilizers into small-weight gauges.</description>

      <title>Evaluating a quantum-classical quantum Monte Carlo algorithm with Matchgate shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the electronic structure problem of molecules and solids to high accuracy is a major challenge in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. The rapid emergence and development of quantum computers offer a promising route to systematically tackle this problem. Recent work by Huggins et al.[1] proposed a hybrid quantum-classical quantum Monte Carlo (QC-QMC) algorithm using Clifford shadows to determine the ground state of a Fermionic Hamiltonian. This approach displayed inherent noise resilience and the potential for improved accuracy compared to its purely classical counterpart. Nevertheless, the use of Clifford shadows introduces an exponentially scaling post-processing cost. In this work, we investigate an improved QC-QMC scheme utilizing the recently developed Matchgate shadows technique [2], which removes the aforementioned exponential bottleneck. We observe from experiments on quantum hardware that the use of Matchgate shadows in QC-QMC is inherently noise robust. We show that this noise resilience has a more subtle origin than in the case of Clifford shadows. Nevertheless, we find that classical post-processing, while asymptotically efficient, requires hours of runtime on thousands of classical CPUs for even the smallest chemical systems, presenting a major challenge to the scalability of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>A SAT Scalpel for Lattice Surgery: Representation and Synthesis of Subroutines for Surface-Code Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is necessary for large-scale quantum computing. A promising quantum error correcting code is the surface code. For this code, fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery, i.e., splitting and merging patches of code. Given the frequent use of certain lattice-surgery subroutines (LaS), it becomes crucial to optimize their design in order to minimize the overall spacetime volume of FTQC. In this study, we define the variables to represent LaS and the constraints on these variables. Leveraging this formulation, we develop a synthesizer for LaS, LaSsynth, that encodes a LaS construction problem into a SAT instance, subsequently querying SAT solvers for a solution. Starting from a baseline design, we can gradually invoke the solver with shrinking spacetime volume to derive more compact designs. Due to our foundational formulation and the use of SAT solvers, LaSsynth can exhaustively explore the design space, yielding optimal designs in volume. For example, it achieves 8% and 18% volume reduction respectively over two states-of-the-art human designs for the 15-to-1 T-factory, a bottleneck in FTQC.</description>

      <title>Entanglement enhancement of two giant atoms with multiple connection points in bidirectional-chiral quantum waveguide-QED system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement generation of two giant atoms within a one-dimensional bidirectional-chiral waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) system, where the initial state of the two giant atoms are $|e_a,g_b\rangle $. Here, each giant atom is coupled to the waveguide through three connection points, with the configurations divided into five types based on the arrangement of coupling points between the giant atoms and the waveguide: separate, fully braided, partially braided, fully nested, and partially nested. We explore the entanglement generation process within each configuration in both nonchiral and chiral coupling cases. It is demonstrated that entanglement can be controlled as needed by either adjusting the phase shift or selecting different configurations. For nonchiral coupling, the entanglement of each configuration exhibits steady state properties attributable to the presence of dark state. In addition, we find that steady-state entanglement can be obtained at more phase shifts in certain configurations by increasing the number of coupling points between the giant atoms and the bidirectional waveguide. In the case of chiral coupling, the entanglement is maximally enhanced compared to the one of nonchiral case. Especially in fully braided configuration, the concurrence reaches its peak value 1, which is robust to chirality. We further show the influence of atomic initial states on the evolution of interatomic entanglement. Our scheme can be used for entanglement generation in chiral quantum networks of giant-atom waveguide-QED systems, with potential applications in quantum networks and quantum communications.</description>

      <title>Probing the topological phase transition in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model using Rydberg-atom synthetic dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model using Rydberg-atom synthetic dimensions constructed, in a single atom, from a ladder of six neighboring $n\:^3S_1$ Rydberg states in which adjacent states are coupled with two-photon transitions using microwave fields. Alternating strong/weak tunneling rates, controlled by adjusting the microwave amplitudes, are varied to map out the topological phase transition as a function of the ratio of the tunneling rates.
  For each ratio, quench dynamics experiments, in which the system is initially prepared in one of the bulk Rydberg states and then subjected to the microwave fields, are performed to measure the population evolution of the system. From the dynamics measurements, we extract the mean chiral displacement and verify that its long-time average value converges towards the system winding number.
  The topological phase transition is also examined by probing the energy spectrum of the system in steady state and observing the disappearance of the zero-energy edge states. The results show that even a system with as few as six levels can demonstrate the essential characteristics of the SSH Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Checking of Parameterised Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs) hold great promise for demonstrating quantum advantages in practical applications of quantum computation. Examples of successful applications include the variational quantum eigensolver, the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm, and quantum machine learning. However, before executing PQCs on real quantum devices, they undergo compilation and optimisation procedures. Given the inherent error-proneness of these processes, it becomes crucial to verify the equivalence between the original PQC and its compiled or optimised version. Unfortunately, most existing quantum circuit verifiers cannot directly handle parameterised quantum circuits; instead, they require parameter substitution to perform verification.
  In this paper, we address the critical challenge of equivalence checking for PQCs. We propose a novel compact representation for PQCs based on tensor decision diagrams. Leveraging this representation, we present an algorithm for verifying PQC equivalence without the need for instantiation. Our approach ensures both effectiveness and efficiency, as confirmed by experimental evaluations. The decision-diagram representations offer a powerful tool for analysing and verifying parameterised quantum circuits, bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Two-Particle Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon interference is an interesting quantum phenomenon that is usually captured in two distinct types of experiments, namely the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) experiment and the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) experiment. While the HBT experiment was carried out much earlier in 1956, with classical light, the demonstration of the HOM effect came much later in 1987. Unlike the former, the latter has been argued to be a purely quantum effect. Here two-particle interference is theoretically analyzed in a generalized setting. The HOM and the HBT effects emerge as special cases in the general analysis. A two-particle interference experiment, which is intermediate between the two effects, is proposed and analyzed. Thus two-particle interference is shown to be a single phenomenon with various possible implementations, including the HBT and HOM setups.</description>

      <title>Towards Classical Software Verification using Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of accelerating the formal verification of classical programs with a quantum computer.
  A common source of security flaws stems from the existence of common programming errors like use after free, null-pointer dereference, or division by zero. To aid in the discovery of such errors, we try to verify that no such flaws exist.
  In our approach, for some code snippet and undesired behaviour, a SAT instance is generated, which is satisfiable precisely if the behavior is present in the code. It is in turn converted to an optimization problem, that is solved on a quantum computer. This approach holds the potential of an asymptotically polynomial speedup.
  Minimal examples of common errors, like out-of-bounds and overflows, but also synthetic instances with special properties, specific number of solutions, or structure, are tested with different solvers and tried on a quantum device.
  We use the near-standard Quantum Approximation Optimisation Algorithm, an application of the Grover algorithm, and the Quantum Singular Value Transformation to find the optimal solution, and with it a satisfying assignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To realize a global quantum Internet, there is a need for communication between quantum subnetworks. To accomplish this task, there have been multiple design proposals for a quantum backbone network and quantum subnetworks. In this work, we elaborate on the design that uses entanglement and quantum teleportation to build the quantum backbone between packetized quantum networks. We design a network interface to interconnect packetized quantum networks with entanglement-based quantum backbone networks and, moreover, design a scheme to accomplish data transmission over this hybrid quantum network model. We analyze the use of various implementations of the backbone network, focusing our study on backbone networks that use satellite links to continuously distribute entanglement resources. For feasibility, we analyze various system parameters via simulation to benchmark the performance of the overall network.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Blockade Optimizing via Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon blockade in weak nonlinear regime is an exciting and promising subject that has been extensively studied in the steady state. However, how to achieve dynamic blockade in a single bosonic mode with weak nonlinearity using only pulsed driving field remains unexplored. Here, we propose to optimize the parameters of the pulsed driving field to achieve dynamic blockade in a single bosonic mode with weak nonlinearity via the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. We demonstrate that both Gaussian and rectangular pulses can be used to generate dynamic photon blockade in a single bosonic mode with weak nonlinearity. Based on the Fourier series expansions of the pulsed driving field, we identify that there are many paths for two-photon excitation in the bosonic mode, even only driven by pulsed field, and the dynamic blockade in weak nonlinear regime is induced by the destructive interference between them. Our work not only highlights the effectiveness of PSO algorithm in optimizing dynamical blockade, but also opens a way to optimize the parameters for other quantum effects, such as quantum entanglement and quantum squeezing.</description>

      <title>Optomechanically Induced Transparency on Exceptional Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are singularities in non-Hermitian systems, where the system transmission spectrum varies significantly at the phase transition point. Here, we propose a practical scheme to study the changes of the optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) spectrum on the exceptional surface (ES), which is formed by designing the structure of the waveguide in a non-Hermitian cavity optomechanical system. By comparing the transmission spectra of the system at different normal points, EPs on the same or different ESs, and exceptional derived points, we find that the peak-valley conversion of the system transmission spectra is obtained at the phase transition point and the arbitrary manipulation of the system transmission spectrum can be realized by moving the system on the same or different ESs. Furthermore, the phenomena of conversion and enhancement of the fast-slow light in the system transmission spectra have also been discovered in our researches. Different from the isolated EP, our proposal can discuss the system properties at different EPs, can find a richer transmission spectrum, and can provide more convenient options for experimental implementation, which paves the way for studying the nature of non-Hermitian systems in a higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Qubit encoding for a mixture of localized functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the crucial generic techniques for quantum computation is the amplitude encoding. Although such techniques have been proposed, each of them often requires exponential classical-computational cost or an oracle whose explicit construction is not provided. Given the recent demands for practical quantum computation, we develop moderately specialized encoding techniques that generate an arbitrary linear combination of localized complex functions. We demonstrate that $n_{\mathrm{loc}}$ discrete Lorentzian functions as an expansion basis set lead to efficient probabilistic encoding, whose computational time is $\mathcal{O} ( \max ( n_{\mathrm{loc}}^2 \log n_{\mathrm{loc}}, n_{\mathrm{loc}}^2 \log n_q, n_q \log n_q ))$ for $n_q$ data qubits equipped with $\log_2 n_{\mathrm{loc}}$ ancillae. Furthermore, amplitude amplification in combination with amplitude reduction renders it deterministic with controllable errors and the computational time is reduced to $\mathcal{O} ( \max ( n_{\mathrm{loc}}^{3/2} \log n_{\mathrm{loc}}, n_{\mathrm{loc}}^{3/2} \log n_q, n_q \log n_q )).$ We provide estimation of required resources for application of our scheme to quantum chemistry in real space. We also show the results on real superconducting quantum computers to confirm the validity of our techniques.</description>

Abstract: A hybrid system with tunable coupling between phonons and qubits shows great potential for advancing quantum information processing. In this work, we demonstrate strong and tunable coupling between a surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator and a transmon qubit based on galvanic-contact flip-chip technique. The coupling strength varies from $2\pi\times$7.0 MHz to -$2\pi\times$20.6 MHz, which is extracted from different vacuum Rabi oscillation frequencies. The phonon-induced ac Stark shift of the qubit at different coupling strengths is also shown. Our approach offers a good experimental platform for exploring quantum acoustics and hybrid systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising early use case for quantum computing. There has been progress in the last five years from theoretical studies and numerical simulations to proof of concepts. Use cases demonstrated on contemporary quantum devices include classifying medical images and items from the Iris dataset, classifying and generating handwritten images, toxicity screening, and learning a probability distribution. Potential benefits of QML include faster training and identification of feature maps not found classically. Although, these examples lack the scale for commercial exploitation, and it may be several years before QML algorithms replace the classical solutions, QML is an exciting area.
  This article is written for those who already have a sound knowledge of quantum computing and now wish to gain a basic overview of the terminology and some applications of classical machine learning ready to study quantum machine learning. The reader will already understand the relevant relevant linear algebra, including Hilbert spaces, a vector space with an inner product.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian quantum information processing with continuous-variable (CV) quantum information carriers holds significant promise for applications in quantum communication and quantum internet. However, applying Gaussian state distillation and quantum error correction (QEC) faces limitations imposed by no-go results concerning local Gaussian unitary operations and classical communications. This paper introduces a Gaussian QEC protocol that relies solely on local Gaussian resources. A pivotal component of our approach is CV gate teleportation using entangled Gaussian states, which facilitates the implementation of the partial transpose operation on a quantum channel. Consequently, we can efficiently construct a two-mode noise-polarized channel from two noisy Gaussian channels. Furthermore, this QEC protocol naturally extends to a nonlocal Gaussian state distillation protocol.</description>

      <title>Atomicity in Distributed Quantum Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomicity is a ubiquitous assumption in distributed computing, under which actions are indivisible and appear sequential. In classical computing, this assumption has several theoretical and practical guarantees. In quantum computing, although atomicity is still commonly assumed, it has not been seriously studied, and a rigorous basis for it is missing. Classical results on atomicity do not directly carry over to distributed quantum computing, due to new challenges caused by quantum entanglement and the measurement problem from the underlying quantum mechanics.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of atomicity in distributed quantum computing. A formal model of (non-atomic) distributed quantum system is established. Based on the Dijkstra-Lamport condition, the system dynamics and observable dynamics of a distributed quantum system are defined, which correspond to the quantum state of and classically observable events in the system, respectively. Within this framework, we prove that local actions can be regarded as if they were atomic, up to the observable dynamics of the system.</description>

      <title>Conservation Laws For Every Quantum Measurement Outcome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paradigmatic example of quantum measurements, whenever one measures a system which starts in a superposition of two states of a conserved quantity, it jumps to one of the two states, implying different final values for the quantity that should have been conserved. The standard law of conservation for quantum mechanics handles this jump by stating only that the total distribution of the conserved quantity over repeated measurements is unchanged, but states nothing about individual cases. Here however we show that one can go beyond this and have conservation in each individual instance. We made our arguments in the case of angular momentum of a particle on a circle, where many technicalities simplify, and bring arguments to show that this holds in full generality. Hence we argue that the conservation law in quantum mechanics should be rewritten, to go beyond its hitherto statistical formulation, to state that the total of a conserved quantity is unchanged in every individual measurement outcome. As a further crucial element, we show that conservation can be localised at the level of the system of interest and its relevant frame of reference, and is independent on any assumptions on the distribution of the conserved quantity over the entire universe.</description>

      <title>Semi-device independent characterization of multiphoton indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiphoton indistinguishability is a central resource for quantum enhancement in sensing and computation. Developing and certifying large scale photonic devices requires reliable and accurate characterization of this resource, preferably using methods that are robust against experimental errors. Here, we propose a set of methods for the characterization of multiphoton indistinguishability, based on measurements of bunching and photon number variance. Our methods are robust in a semi-device independent way, in the sense of being effective even when the interferometers are incorrectly dialled. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using an advanced photonic platform comprising a quantum-dot single-photon source and a universal fully-programmable integrated photonic processor. Our results show the practical usefulness of our methods, providing robust certification tools that can be scaled up to larger systems.</description>

      <title>QOSST: A Highly-Modular Open Source Platform for Experimental Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables secret key exchange between two remote parties with information-theoretic security rooted in the laws of quantum physics. Encoding key information in continuous variables (CV), such as the values of quadrature components of coherent states of light, brings implementations much closer to standard optical communication systems, but this comes at the price of significant complexity in the digital signal processing techniques required for operation at low signal-to-noise ratios. In this work, we wish to lower the barriers to entry for CV-QKD experiments associated to this difficulty by providing a highly modular, open source software that is in principle hardware agnostic and can be used in multiple configurations. We benchmarked this software, called QOSST, using an experimental setup with a locally generated local oscillator, frequency multiplexed pilots and RF-heterodyne detection, and obtained state-of-the-art secret key rates of the order of Mbit/s over metropolitan distances at the asymptotic limit. We hope that QOSST can be used to stimulate further experimental advances in CV-QKD and be improved and extended by the community to achieve high performance in a wide variety of configurations.</description>

      <title>Low-Overhead Defect-Adaptive Surface Code with Bandage-Like Super-Stabilizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To make practical quantum algorithms work, large-scale quantum processors protected by error-correcting codes are required to resist noise and ensure reliable computational outcomes. However, a major challenge arises from defects in processor fabrication, as well as occasional losses or cosmic rays during the computing process, all of which can lead to qubit malfunctions and disrupt error-correcting codes' normal operations. In this context, we introduce an automatic adapter to implement the surface code on defective lattices. Unlike previous approaches, this adapter leverages newly proposed bandage-like super-stabilizers to save more qubits when defects are clustered, thus enhancing the code distance and reducing super-stabilizer weight. For instance, in comparison with earlier methods, with a code size of 27 and a random defect rate of 2\%, the disabled qubits decrease by $1/3$, and the average preserved code distance increases by 63\%. This demonstrates a significant reduction in overhead when handling defects using our approach, and this advantage amplifies with increasing processor size and defect rates. Our work presents a low-overhead, automated solution to the challenge of adapting the surface code to defects, an essential step towards scaling up the construction of large-scale quantum computers for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Photon Condensation into Wannier-Stark States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly coupled light-matter systems can exhibit nonequilibrium collective phenomena due to loss and gain processes on the one hand and effective photon-photon interactions on the other hand. Here we study a photonic lattice system composed of a linear array of driven-dissipative coupled cavities (or cavity modes) with linearly increasing resonance frequencies across the lattice. The model amounts to a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model in a tilted potential without the particle-conservation constraint. We predict a diverse range of stationary and non-stationary states resulted from the interplay of the tilt, tunneling, on-site interactions, and the loss and gain processes. Our key finding is that, under weak on-site interactions, photons mostly Bose condense into a selected, single-particle Wannier-Stark state, instead of exhibiting expected Bloch oscillations. As the strength of the photon-photon interactions increase, a non-stationary regime emerges which is marked surprisingly by periodic Bloch-type oscillations. These intriguing, nontrivial effects are a direct consequence of the driven-dissipative nature of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometers based on ultra-cold atoms enable an absolute measurement of inertial forces with unprecedented precision. However, their resolution is fundamentally restricted by quantum fluctuations. Improved resolutions with entangled or squeezed atoms were demonstrated in internal-state measurements for thermal and quantum-degenerate atoms and, recently, for momentum-state interferometers with laser-cooled atoms. Here, we present a gravimeter based on Bose-Einstein condensates with a sensitivity of $-1.7^{+0.4}_{-0.5}\,$dB beyond the standard quantum limit. Interferometry with Bose-Einstein condensates combined with delta-kick collimation minimizes atom loss in and improves scalability of the interferometer to very-long baseline atom interferometers.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty relation and the constrained quadratic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty relation is a fundamental concept in quantum theory, plays a pivotal role in various quantum information processing tasks. In this study, we explore the additive uncertainty relation pertaining to two or more observables, in terms of their variance,by utilizing the generalized Gell-Mann representation in qudit systems. We find that the tight state-independent lower bound of the variance sum can be characterized as a quadratic programming problem with nonlinear constraints in optimization theory. As illustrative examples, we derive analytical solutions for these quadratic programming problems in lower-dimensional systems, which align with the state-independent lower bounds. Additionally, we introduce a numerical algorithm tailored for solving these quadratic programming instances, highlighting its efficiency and accuracy. The advantage of our approach lies in its potential ability to simultaneously achieve the optimal value of the quadratic programming problem with nonlinear constraints but also precisely identify the extremal state where this optimal value is attained. This enables us to establish a tight state-independent lower bound for the sum of variances, and further identify the extremal state at which this lower bound is realized.</description>

      <title>Dynamic temperature compensation for wavelength-stable entangled biphoton generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dynamic temperature compensation method is presented to stabilize the wavelength of the entangled biphoton source, which is generated via the spontaneous parametric down-conversion based on a MgO: PPLN waveguide. Utilizing the dispersive Fourier transformation technique combined with a digital proportional-integral-differential algorithm, the small amount of wavelength variation can be instantly identified and then compensated with active temperature correction. The long-term wavelength stability, assessed though Allan deviation, shows nearly a hundredfold enhancement, reaching 2.00*10^(-7) at the averaging time of 10000 s. It offers a simple, ready-to-use solution for precise wavelength control in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Positive and non-positive measurements in energy extraction from quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the concept of stochastic energy extraction from quantum batteries to the scenario where both positive operator-valued (POV) and physically realizable non-positive operator-valued measurements are applied (NPOVMs) on the auxiliary connected to the battery in presence of noise. The process involves joint evolution of the battery and the auxiliary for a particular time interval, an interaction of the auxiliary with its environment which induces noise in the auxiliary, and performing a POVM or NPOVM on the auxiliary, and finally the selection of a particular measurement outcome. Application of POVM on the auxiliary can be realised by attaching an external system to the auxiliary, which is initially in a product state with the rest of the system, and performing a joint projective measurement on the auxiliary and external. On the other hand, if there are interactions leading to correlations among the auxiliary, environment, and external systems, then performing the projective measurement on the auxiliary-environment-external system can be interpreted as a physically realizable NPOVM operation on the auxiliary. We however utilize interaction between the auxiliary and the environment to implement NPOVMs on the auxiliary. We find the expressions of stochastically extractable energy by performing POVMs and NPOVMs on the auxiliary and show that the latter does not depend on the applied noise. Focusing on a particular model of the governing Hamiltonian of a qubit battery and an auxiliary, and considering the presence of amplitude damping noise affecting the auxiliary, we show that stochastically extractable energy using NPOVMs is no less than that using POVMs. This advantage of using NPOVMs remains also for bit-flip noise. For dephasing noise, the energies by applying POVMs and NPOVMs are the same. We additionally consider the case when a limited set of measurement operators are allowed.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Designs with Clifford Enhanced Matrix Product States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or `magic', is a critical quantum resource that, together with entanglement, characterizes the non-classical complexity of quantum states. Here, we address the problem of quantifying the average nonstabilizerness of random Matrix Product States (RMPS). RMPS represent a generalization of random product states featuring bounded entanglement that scales logarithmically with the bond dimension $\chi$. We demonstrate that the $2$-Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy converges to that of Haar random states as $N/\chi^2$, where $N$ is the system size. This indicates that MPS with a modest bond dimension are as magical as generic states. Subsequently, we introduce the ensemble of Clifford enhanced Matrix Product States ($\mathcal{C}$MPS), built by the action of Clifford unitaries on RMPS. Leveraging our previous result, we show that $\mathcal{C}$MPS can approximate $4$-spherical designs with arbitrary accuracy. Specifically, for a constant $N$, $\mathcal{C}$MPS become close to $4$-designs with a scaling as $\chi^{-2}$. Our findings indicate that combining Clifford unitaries with polynomially complex tensor network states can generate highly non-trivial quantum states.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness versus entanglement in matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between entanglement and non-stabilizerness (also known as magic) in matrix product states (MPSs). We study the relation between magic and the bond dimension used to approximate the ground state of a many-body system in two different contexts: full state of magic and mutual magic (the non-stabilizer analogue of mutual information, thus free of boundary effects) of spin-1 anisotropic Heisenberg chains. Our results indicate that obtaining converged results for non-stabilizerness is typically considerably easier than entanglement. For full state magic at critical points and at sufficiently large volumes, we observe convergence with $1/\chi^2$, with $\chi$ being the MPS bond dimension. At small volumes, magic saturation is so quick that, within error bars, we cannot appreciate any finite-$\chi$ correction. Mutual magic also shows a fast convergence with bond dimension, whose specific functional form is however hindered by sampling errors. As a by-product of our study, we show how Pauli-Markov chains (originally formulated to evaluate magic) resets the state of the art in terms of computing mutual information for MPS. We illustrate this last fact by verifying the logarithmic increase of mutual information between connected partitions at critical points. By comparing mutual information and mutual magic, we observe that, for connected partitions, the latter is typically scaling much slower - if at all - with the partition size, while for disconnected partitions, both are constant in size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secret key exchange relies on the creation of correlated signals, serving as the raw resource for secure communication. Thermal states, exhibit Hanbury Brown and Twiss correlations, which offer a promising avenue for generating such signals. In this paper, we present an experimental implementation of a central broadcast thermal state quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol in the microwave region. Our objective is to showcase a straightforward method of QKD utilizing readily available broadcasting equipment. Unlike conventional approaches to thermal state QKD, we leverage displaced thermal states. These states enable us to share the output of a thermal source among Alice, Bob, and Eve via both waveguide channels and free space. Through measurement and conversion into bit strings, our protocol produces key-ready bit strings without the need for specialized equipment. By harnessing the inherent noise in thermal broadcasts, our setup facilitates the recovery of distinct bit strings by all parties involved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an implementation of bivariate bicycle codes (Nature {\bf 627}, 778 (2024)) based on long-range Rydberg gates between stationary neutral atom qubits. An optimized layout of data and ancilla qubits reduces the maximum Euclidean communication distance needed for non-local parity check operators. An optimized Rydberg gate pulse design enables $\sf CZ$ entangling operations with fidelity ${\mathcal F}&gt;0.999$ at a distance greater than $12~\mu\rm m$. The combination of optimized layout and gate design leads to a quantum error correction cycle time of $\sim 1.2~\rm ms$ for a $[[144,12,12]]$ code, an order of magnitude improvement over previous designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum repeaters are necessary to fully realize the capabilities of the emerging quantum internet, especially applications involving distributing entanglement across long distances. A more general notion of this can be called a quantum switch, which connects to many users and can act as a repeater to create end-to-end entanglement between different subsets of these users. Here we present a method of calculating the capacity region of both discrete- and continuous-variable quantum switches that in general support mixed-partite entanglement generation. The method uses tools from convex analysis to generate the boundaries of the capacity region. We show example calculations with illustrative topologies and perform simulations to support the analytical results.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate algorithmic cooling on IBM-Q devices. We utilize inherent qubit noise to simulate the equilibration of an interacting spin system towards its ground state, when coupled to a dissipative auxiliary-spin bath. The steady-state correlations in the system are defined by the system Hamiltonian and are stable as long as the algorithm can be executed. In particular, we demonstrate the relaxation of system spins to ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ordering, controlled by the definition of the Hamiltonian. We are able to perform simulated cooling for global systems of up to three system spins and four auxiliary spins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constrained optimization plays a crucial role in the fields of quantum physics and quantum information science and becomes especially challenging for high-dimensional complex structure problems. One specific issue is that of quantum process tomography, in which the goal is to retrieve the underlying quantum process based on a given set of measurement data. In this paper, we introduce a modified version of stochastic gradient descent on a Riemannian manifold that integrates recent advancements in numerical methods for Riemannian optimization. This approach inherently supports the physically driven constraints of a quantum process, takes advantage of state-of-the-art large-scale stochastic objective optimization, and has superior performance to traditional approaches such as maximum likelihood estimation and projected least squares. The data-driven approach enables accurate, order-of-magnitude faster results, and works with incomplete data. We demonstrate our approach on simulations of quantum processes and in hardware by characterizing an engineered process on quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a benchmarking protocol for universal quantum computers, achieved through the simulation of random dynamical quantum maps. This protocol provides a holistic assessment of system-wide error rates, encapsulating both gate inaccuracies and the errors associated with mid-circuit qubit measurements and resets. By employing random quantum circuits and segmenting mid-circuit qubit measurement and reset in a repeated fashion, we steer the system of qubits to an ensemble of steady-states. These steady-states are described by random Wishart matrices, and align with the steady-state characteristics previously identified in random Lindbladian dynamics, including the universality property. The protocol assesses the resulting ensemble probability distribution measured in the computational basis, effectively avoiding a tomographic reconstruction. Our various numerical simulations demonstrate the relationship between the final distribution and different error sources. Additionally, we implement the protocol on state-of-the-art transmon qubits provided by IBM Quantum, drawing comparisons between empirical results, theoretical expectations, and simulations derived from a fitted noise model of the device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomographic reconstruction of quantum states plays a fundamental role in benchmarking quantum systems and retrieving information from quantum computers. Among the informationally complete sets of quantum measurements the tight ones provide a linear reconstruction formula and minimize the propagation of statistical errors. However, implementing tight measurements in the lab is challenging due to the high number of required measurement projections, involving a series of experimental setup preparations. In this work, we introduce the notion of cyclic tight measurements, that allow us to perform full quantum state tomography while considering only repeated application of a single unitary-based quantum device during the measurement stage process. This type of measurements significantly simplifies the complexity of the experimental setup required to retrieve the quantum state of a physical system. Additionally, we design feasible setup preparation procedure that produce well-approximated cyclic tight measurements, in every finite dimension.</description>

      <title>Spin coupling is all you need: Encoding strong electron correlation on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of quantum algorithms for eigenvalue problems, such as computing Hamiltonian spectra, depends strongly on the overlap of the initial wavefunction and the target eigenvector. In a basis of Slater determinants, the representation of energy eigenstates of systems with $N$ strongly correlated electrons requires a number of determinants that scales exponentially with $N$. On classical processors, this restricts simulations to systems where $N$ is small. Here, we show that quantum computers can efficiently simulate strongly correlated molecular systems by directly encoding the dominant entanglement structure in the form of spin-coupled initial states. This avoids resorting to expensive classical or quantum state preparation heuristics and instead exploits symmetries in the wavefunction. We provide quantum circuits for deterministic preparation of a family of spin eigenfunctions with ${N \choose N/2}$ Slater determinants with depth $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ local gates. Their use as highly entangled initial states in quantum algorithms reduces the total runtime of quantum phase estimation and related fault-tolerant methods by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we assess the application of spin-coupled wavefunctions as initial states for a range of heuristic quantum algorithms, namely the variational quantum eigensolver, adiabatic state preparation, and different versions of quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) including QSD based on real-time-evolved states. We also propose a novel QSD algorithm that exploits states obtained through adaptive quantum eigensolvers. For all algorithms, we demonstrate that using spin-coupled initial states drastically reduces the quantum resources required to simulate strongly correlated ground and excited states. Our work paves the way towards scalable quantum simulation of electronic structure for classically challenging systems.</description>

      <title>Two-level adiabatic transition probability for small avoided crossings generated by tangential intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the asymptotic behaviors of the transition probability for two-level avoided crossings are studied under the limit where two parameters (adiabatic parameter and energy gap parameter) tend to zero. This is a continuation of our previous works where avoided crossings are generated by tangential intersections and obey a non-adiabatic regime. The main results elucidate not only the asymptotic expansion of transition probability but also a quantum interference caused by several avoided crossings and a coexistence of two-parameter regimes arising from different vanishing orders.</description>

      <title>Constrained Hamiltonian dynamics for electrons in magnetic field and additional forces besides the Lorentz force acting on electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the forces acting on electrons in magnetic field including the constraints and a condition arising from quantum mechanics. The force is calculated as the electron mass, $m_e$, multiplied by the total time-derivative of the velocity field evaluated using the quantum mechanical many-electron wave function. The velocity field includes a term of the Berry connection from the many-body wave function; thereby, quantum mechanical effects are included. It is shown that additional important forces besides the Lorentz force exist; they include the gradient of the electron velocity field kinetic energy, the gradient of the chemical potential, and the `force' for producing topologically protected loop currents. These additional forces are shown to be important in superconductivity, electric current in metallic wires, and charging of capacitors.</description>

      <title>Universality of the thermodynamics of a quantum-mechanically radiating black hole departing from thermality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathur and Mehta won the third prize in the 2023 Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition for proving the universality of black hole (BH) thermodynamics. Specifically, they demonstrated that any Extremely Compact Object (ECO) must have the same BH thermodynamic properties regardless of whether or not the ECO possesses an event horizon. The result is remarkable, but it was obtained under the approximation according to which the BH emission spectrum has an exactly thermal character. In fact, strong arguments based on energy conservation and BH back reaction imply that the spectrum of the Hawking radiation cannot be exactly thermal. In this work the result of Mathur and Mehta will be extended to the case where the radiation spectrum is not exactly thermal using the concept of BH dynamical state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum entanglement in strongly correlated quantum impurity systems for states manifesting interesting properties such as multi-level Kondo effect and dual nature between itineracy and localization etc.. For this purpose, we set up a system consisting of one or two quantum impurities arbitrarily selected from the system as a subsystem, and investigate quantum entanglement with its environmental system. We reduce the pure state of interest as described above to the subsystem, and formulate quantum informative quantities such as entanglement entropy, mutual information and relative entropy. We apply them to the single impurity Anderson model where the most basic Kondo effect is manifested, and obtain new insights into the Kondo effect there. The obtained results suggest that the method proposed here is promising for elucidating the quantum entanglement of pure states in various quantum impurity systems.</description>

      <title>The PRODSAT phase of random quantum satisfiability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $k$-QSAT problem is a quantum analog of the famous $k$-SAT constraint satisfaction problem. We must determine the zero energy ground states of a Hamiltonian of $N$ qubits consisting of a sum of $M$ random $k$-local rank-one projectors. It is known that product states of zero energy exist with high probability if and only if the underlying factor graph has a clause-covering dimer configuration. This means that the threshold of the PRODSAT phase is a purely geometric quantity equal to the dimer covering threshold. We revisit and fully prove this result through a combination of complex analysis and algebraic methods based on Buchberger's algorithm for complex polynomial equations with random coefficients. We also discuss numerical experiments investigating the presence of entanglement in the PRODSAT phase in the sense that product states do not span the whole zero energy ground state space.</description>

      <title>A Tensor Product Space for Studying the Interaction of Bipartite States of Light with Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pairs of entangled photons are important for applications in quantum nanophotonics, where their theoretical description must accommodate their bipartite character. Such character is shared at the other end of the intensity range by, for example, the two degenerate instances of the pump field involved in second-harmonic generation. Describing the interaction of nanophotonic structures with bipartite states of light is, regardless of their intensity, a challenge with important technological applications. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for studying the interaction of material structures with bipartite states of light. The basic element is the symmetrized tensor product space of two copies of an electromagnetic Hilbert space. One of the benefits inherited from the single Hilbert space is that consequences of material symmetries are readily deduced. We derive selection rules for second-order non-linear processes in objects with rotational and/or mirror symmetries. We numerically verify several selection rules by combining quantum-chemical calculations with a Maxwell solver to simulate second-harmonic generation in two different MoS$_2$ clusters. The computationally convenient scattering matrix method is also extended to the tensor product space when the response of the object to one part of the state is independent of the other. For such a case, we obtain the relation between the scattering matrix in the single Hilbert space and the scattering matrix for bipartite states. Such a separable case is relevant for the entanglement evolution of biphoton states interacting with nanostructures. We discuss some possibilities for accommodating the computations of non-linear effects in the framework, for example, through a non-separable scattering operator, where the response of the object to one part of the state depends on the other part.</description>

      <title>Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently conducted experiments on two-dimensional topological superconductors have revealed various indications of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, progress in the manipulation of MZM braiding has been limited, impeding the realization of topological quantum computing. In this study, we propose a potential braiding scheme based on a spintronic device matrix. This scheme involves utilizing a matrix composed of spin-transfer torque devices (STT-matrix) alongside a two-dimensional topological superconductor material. By programming the ON/OFF states of the spintronic devices within the STT-matrix, it becomes possible to manipulate vortices hosting MZMs in the two-dimensional topological superconductor. To further investigate this concept, we construct a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model and perform numerical simulations to analyze vortex-driving dynamics, MZM braiding processes, and MZM fusion phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that this system exhibits high versatility and flexibility in manipulating vortices. With advancements in spintronic device technology, our proposed scheme offers a feasible and practical method for operating MZMs within vortices present in topological superconductors.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional correlation propagation dynamics with a cluster discrete phase-space method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics of highly-controlled quantum systems is a challenging issue in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics, relevant to recent experimental developments of analog and digital quantum simulations. In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, makes it possible to realize scalable numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the choice of the separation into finite regions of clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on the correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We also compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those of a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in a short time region, where the energy is well conserved in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it can be potentially applied to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A supercurrent flow can induce a nonvanishing spin magnetization in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with spin-orbit interaction. Often known as the non-dissipative magnetoelectric effect, these are most commonly found at linear order in supercurrent flow. Here, we argue that a nonlinear superconducting magnetoelectric effect (NSM) can naturally manifest in altermagnet/superconductor (ALM/SC) heterostructures: NSM manifests as a spin polarization generated as a second-order response to a driving supercurrent. Strikingly, we find NSM is the leading order magnetization response in ALM/SC heterostructures and survives even in the presence of centrosymmetry; $C_4 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry in altermagnets zeroes both the equilibrium magnetization as well as out-of-plane linear magnetoelectric response. This renders NSM a powerful electric and non-dissipative means of controlling magnetization in ALM/SC heterostructures, a promising platform for superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Decoherence induced by a sparse bath of two-level fluctuators: peculiar features of $1/f$ noise in high-quality qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progress in fabrication of semiconductor and superconductor qubits has greatly diminished the number of decohering defects, thus decreasing the devastating low-frequency $1/f$ noise and extending the qubits' coherence times (dephasing time $T_2^*$ and the echo decay time $T_2$). However, large qubit-to-qubit variation of the coherence properties remains a problem, making it difficult to produce a large-scale register where all qubits have a uniformly high quality. In this work we show that large variability is a characteristic feature of a qubit dephased by a sparse bath made of many ($n\gg 1$) decohering defects, coupled to the qubit with similar strength. We model the defects as two-level fluctuators (TLFs) whose transition rates $\gamma$ are sampled from a log-uniform distribution over an interval $[\gamma_{m},\gamma_M]$, which is a standard model for $1/f$ noise. We investigate decoherence by such a bath in the limit of high-quality qubit, i.e.\ when the TLF density $d$ is small (the limit of sparse bath, with $d=n/w\ll 1$, where $n$ is the number of TLFs and $w=\ln{[\gamma_M/\gamma_{m}]}$ is the log-width of the distribution). We show that different realizations of the bath produce very similar noise power spectra $S(f)\sim 1/f$, but lead to drastically different coherence times $T_2^*$ and $T_2$. Thus, the spectral density $S(f)$ does not determine coherence of a qubit coupled to a sparse TLF bath, as opposed to a dense bath; instead, decoherence is controlled by only a few exceptional fluctuators, determined by their value of $\gamma$. We show that removing only two of these TLFs greatly increases $T_2$ and $T_2^*$ times. Our findings help theoretical understanding and further improvements in the coherence properties of semiconductor and superconductor qubits, battling the $1/f$ noise in these platforms.</description>

      <title>A diverse set of two-qubit gates for spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To realize large-scale quantum information processes, an ideal scheme for two-qubit operations should enable diverse operations with given hardware and physical interaction. However, for spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots, the common two-qubit operations, including CPhase gates, SWAP gates, and CROT gates, are realized with distinct parameter regions and control waveforms, posing challenges for their simultaneous implementation. Here, taking advantage of the inherent Heisenberg interaction between spin qubits, we propose and verify a fast composite two-qubit gate scheme to extend the available two-qubit gate types as well as reduce the requirements for device properties. Apart from the formerly proposed CPhase (controlled-phase) gates and SWAP gates, theoretical results indicate that the iSWAP-family gate and Fermionic simulation (fSim) gate set are additionally available for spin qubits. Meanwhile, our gate scheme limits the parameter requirements of all essential two-qubit gates to a common J~{\Delta}E_Z region, facilitate the simultaneous realization of them. Furthermore, we present the preliminary experimental demonstration of the composite gate scheme, observing excellent match between the measured and simulated results. With this versatile composite gate scheme, broad-spectrum two-qubit operations allow us to efficiently utilize the hardware and the underlying physics resources, helping accelerate and broaden the scope of the upcoming noise intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing.</description>

Abstract: We developed a general framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing of molecular and periodic embedding calculations based on an orbital space separation of the fragment and environment degrees of freedom. We show its potential by presenting a specific implementation of periodic range-separated DFT coupled to a quantum circuit ansatz, whereby the variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum equation-of-motion approach are used to obtain the low-lying spectrum of the embedded fragment Hamiltonian. Application of this scheme to study strongly correlated molecular systems and localized electronic states in materials is showcased through the accurate prediction of the optical properties for the neutral oxygen vacancy in magnesium oxide (MgO). Despite some discrepancies in absorption predictions, the method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art ab initio approaches, particularly evidenced by the accurate prediction of the photoluminescence emission peak.</description>

Abstract: Fragmentation of an interacting Bose gas refers to the macroscopic occupation of a finite set of single-particle eigenstates. This phenomenon is related to the notion of particle-number squeezing in quantum optics, an exquisite property of quantum states that can offer metrological gain. So far, fragmentation has only been partially achieved in experiments involving a large number $N$ of bosons in few modes. Here, we introduce a practical and efficient scheme to prepare fragmented states in systems realizing the $L$-mode Bose-Hubbard model. We demonstrate how a large energy detuning between the modes can be used as a practical control parameter to successfully fragment a Bose gas over an extremely short preparation time. Applying an optimal-control approach within realistic experimental constraints, we obtain total fragmentation at a high filling factor, realizing $\ket{N/L,...,N/L}$ Fock states with hundreds of bosons in very few modes over a few tunneling times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin and charge are the two most important degrees of freedom of electrons. Their interplay lies at the heart of numerous strongly correlated phenomena including Hubbard model physics and high temperature superconductivity. Such interplay for bosons, on the other hand, is largely unexplored in condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate a unique realization of the spin-1/2 Bose-Hubbard model through excitons in a semiconducting moir\'e superlattice. We find evidence of a transient in-plane ferromagnetic (FM-$xy$) order of exciton spin - here valley pseudospin - around exciton filling $\nu_{ex}$ = 1, which transitions into a FM-$z$ order both with increasing exciton filling and a small magnetic field of 10 mT. The phase diagram is different from the fermion case and is qualitatively captured by a simple phenomenological model, highlighting the unique consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics. Our study paves the way for engineering exotic phases of matter from spinor bosons, as well as for unconventional devices in optics and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Energy conservation and fluctuation theorem are incompatible for quantum work</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.09364v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing fluctuations of work in coherent quantum systems is notoriously problematic. Here we reveal the ultimate source of the problem by proving that ($\mathfrak{A}$) energy conservation and ($\mathfrak{B}$) the Jarzynski fluctuation theorem cannot be observed at the same time. Condition $\mathfrak{A}$ stipulates that, for any initial state of the system, the measured average work must be equal to the difference of initial and final average energies, and that untouched systems must exchange deterministically zero work. Condition $\mathfrak{B}$ is only for thermal initial states and encapsulates the second law of thermodynamics. We prove that $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ are incompatible for work measurement schemes that are differentiable functions of the state and satisfy two mild structural constraints. This covers all existing schemes and leaves the theoretical possibility of jointly observing $\mathfrak{A}$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ open only for a narrow class of exotic schemes. For the special but important case of state-independent schemes, the situation is much more rigid: we prove that, essentially, only the two-point measurement scheme is compatible with $\mathfrak{B}$.</description>

      <title>Heart Disease Detection using Quantum Computing and Partitioned Random Forest Methods</title>

Abstract: Heart disease morbidity and mortality rates are increasing, which has a negative impact on public health and the global economy. Early detection of heart disease reduces the incidence of heart mortality and morbidity. Recent research has utilized quantum computing methods to predict heart disease with more than 5 qubits and are computationally intensive. Despite the higher number of qubits, earlier work reports a lower accuracy in predicting heart disease, have not considered the outlier effects, and requires more computation time and memory for heart disease prediction. To overcome these limitations, we propose hybrid random forest quantum neural network (HQRF) using a few qubits (two to four) and considered the effects of outlier in the dataset. Two open-source datasets, Cleveland and Statlog, are used in this study to apply quantum networks. The proposed algorithm has been applied on two open-source datasets and utilized two different types of testing strategies such as 10-fold cross validation and 70-30 train/test ratio. We compared the performance of our proposed methodology with our earlier algorithm called hybrid quantum neural network (HQNN) proposed in the literature for heart disease prediction. HQNN and HQRF outperform in 10-fold cross validation and 70/30 train/test split ratio, respectively. The results show that HQNN requires a large training dataset while HQRF is more appropriate for both large and small training dataset. According to the experimental results, the proposed HQRF is not sensitive to the outlier data compared to HQNN. Compared to earlier works, the proposed HQRF achieved a maximum area under the curve (AUC) of 96.43% and 97.78% in predicting heart diseases using Cleveland and Statlog datasets, respectively with HQNN. The proposed HQRF is highly efficient in detecting heart disease at an early stage and will speed up clinical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Prog-QAOA: Framework for resource-efficient quantum optimization through classical programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current state-of-the-art quantum optimization algorithms require representing the original problem as a binary optimization problem, which is then converted into an equivalent Ising model suitable for the quantum device. Implementing each term of the Ising model separately often results in high redundancy, significantly increasing the resources required. Instead, we propose to design classical programs for computing the objective function and certifying the constraints, and later compile them to quantum circuits, eliminating the reliance on the binary optimization problem representation. This results in a new variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), which we name the Prog-QAOA. We exploit this idea for optimization tasks like the Travelling Salesman Problem and Max-$K$-Cut and obtain circuits that are near-optimal with respect to all relevant cost measures, e.g., number of qubits, gates, and circuit depth. While we demonstrate the power of Prog-QAOA only for a particular set of paradigmatic problems, our approach is conveniently applicable to generic optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in systems with symmetry is a cornerstone phenomenon accompanying second-order phase transitions. Here, we predict the opposite phenomenon, namely, spontaneous symmetry emergence in a system without symmetry. On the example of two coupled oscillators interacting non-symmetrically with a set of oscillators whose frequencies uniformly fill a finite frequency range, we demonstrate that the system state can acquire symmetry, which is not inherent to the system Hamiltonian. The emergence of symmetry manifests itself in a change of the system dynamics, which can be interpreted as a phase transition in a Hermitian system without symmetry.</description>

      <title>Method to deterministically generate large-amplitude optical cat states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02839v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cat states, as an important resource in the study of macroscopic quantum superposition and quantum information applications, have garnered widespread attention. To date, preparing large-sized optical cat states has remained challenging. We demonstrate that, by utilizing interaction-free measurement and the quantum Zeno effect, even a fragile quantum microscopic system can deterministically control and become entangled with strong light fields, thereby generating large-amplitude optical cat states. During the entire preparation process, our method ensures that the microscopic system functions within a weak field environment, so that its quantum property can be protected. Furthermore, we show that the preparation of cat states is possible even when the quantum microsystem suffers from significant photon loss, provided that optical losses from classical devices are kept low, which implies that the fidelity of the cat state can be enhanced by improvements to and the perfection of the classical optical system.</description>

      <title>A supplemental investigation of non-linearity in quantum generative models with respect to simulatability and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the utility of introducing non-linearity through repeat-until-success (RUS) sub-routines into quantum circuits for generative modeling. As a follow-up to this work, we investigate two questions of relevance to the quantum algorithms and machine learning communities: Does introducing this form of non-linearity make the learning model classically simulatable due to the deferred measurement principle? And does introducing this form of non-linearity make the overall model's training more unstable? With respect to the first question, we demonstrate that the RUS sub-routines do not allow us to trivially map this quantum model to a classical one, whereas a model without RUS sub-circuits containing mid-circuit measurements could be mapped to a classical Bayesian network due to the deferred measurement principle of quantum mechanics. This strongly suggests that the proposed form of non-linearity makes the model classically in-efficient to simulate. In the pursuit of the second question, we train larger models than previously shown on three different probability distributions, one continuous and two discrete, and compare the training performance across multiple random trials. We see that while the model is able to perform exceptionally well in some trials, the variance across trials with certain datasets quantifies its relatively poor training stability.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Quantum Refrigerators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a small quantum refrigerator consisting of three qubits, each of which is kept in contact with an environment. We consider two settings: one is when there is necessarily transient cooling and the other is when both steady-state and transient coolings prevail. We show that there can be significant advantages with respect to the case of Markovian environments for both these settings, if we replace the bath attached to the cold qubit by a non-Markovian reservoir, modeled by a few quantum spins interacting with the cold qubit. We also consider refrigeration with more than one non-Markovian baths of the three-qubit refrigerating device. Curiously, a steady temperature is reached only if there are at least two Markovian environments, although there are distinct envelopes of the temperature oscillations in all cases. We compare the device connected to one or more non-Markovian reservoirs with the case of all Markovian environs, as also with two- and single-qubit self-sustained devices connected to one or more non-Markovian baths. We propose a witness to detect non-Markovianity in such systems. Finally, the refrigerator models are studied in presence of Markovian noise, and we analyse the response on the refrigeration of the noise strength. In particular, we find the noise strength until which refrigeration remains possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For time travel to be consistent with the known laws of physics, the resulting paradoxes must be resolved. It has been suggested that parallel timelines (a.k.a. multiple histories) may provide a resolution. However, so far, a concrete mechanism by which parallel timelines can be created has never been satisfactorily formulated. In this paper we propose such a mechanism within the framework of unmodified quantum mechanics, also known as the Everett or "many-worlds" interpretation. The timelines in our model are emergent, like the "worlds" of the Everett interpretation; they are created by quantum entanglement between the time machine and the environment. Therefore, we call them "entangled timelines" or E-CTCs. As the entanglement gradually spreads out to additional systems, the timelines spread out as well, providing a local and well-defined alternative to the naive "branching timelines" picture often presented in the literature. The E-CTC model is similar to Deutsch's familiar D-CTC model, but differs from it mainly by making the entanglement explicit, which allows us to create a clearer practical definition of the resulting parallel timelines.</description>

Abstract: The importance of the quantum Fisher information metric is testified by the number of applications that this has in very different fields, ranging from hypothesis testing to metrology, passing through thermodynamics. Still, from the rich range of possible quantum Fisher information, only a handful are typically used and studied. This review aims at collecting a number of results scattered in the literature that can be useful to people who begin the study of Fisher information and to those who are already working on it to have a more organic understanding of the topic. Moreover, we complement the review with new results about the relation between Fisher information and physical evolutions. Extending the study done in [1], we prove that all the physically realisable dynamics can be defined solely in terms of their relation with respect to the Fisher information metric. Moreover, other properties as Markovianity, retrodiction or detailed balance can be expressed in the same formalism. These results show a fact that was partially overseen in the literature, namely the inherently dynamical nature of Fisher information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prospect of quantum computing with a potential exponential speed-up compared to classical computing identifies it as a promising method in the search for alternative future High Energy Physics (HEP) simulation approaches. HEP simulations, such as employed at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, are extraordinarily complex and require an immense amount of computing resources in hardware and time. For some HEP simulations, classical machine learning models have already been successfully developed and tested, resulting in several orders of magnitude speed-up. In this research, we proceed to the next step and explore whether quantum computing can provide sufficient accuracy, and further improvements, suggesting it as an exciting direction of future investigations.
  With a small prototype model, we demonstrate a full quantum Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model for generating downsized eight-pixel calorimeter shower images. The advantage over previous quantum models is that the model generates real individual images containing pixel energy values instead of simple probability distributions averaged over a test sample.
  To complete the picture, the results of the full quantum GAN model are compared to hybrid quantum-classical models using a classical discriminator neural network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A semiclassical approximation is derived by using a family of wavepackets to map arbitrary wavefunctions into phase space. If the Hamiltonian can be approximated as linear over each individual wavepacket, as often done when presenting Ehrenfest's theorem, the resulting approximation is a linear first-order partial differential equation on phase space, which will be referred to as the Schr\"odinger-Ehrenfest or SE equation. This advectively transports wavefunctions along classical trajectories, so that as a trajectory is followed in time the amplitude remains constant while the phase changes by the action divided by $\hbar$. The wavefunction's squared-magnitude is a plausible phase space density and obeys Liouville's equation for the classical time evolution. This is a derivation of the Koopman-von~Neumann (KvN) formulation of classical mechanics, which previously was postulated but not derived. With the time-independent SE equation, continuity of the wavefunction requires the change of phase around any closed path in the torus covered by a classical trajectory to be an integer multiple of $2\pi$, giving a standing wave picture of old quantum mechanics. While this applies to any system, for separable systems it gives Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization.</description>

Abstract: The decoherence effect caused by the coupling between the system and the environment undoubtedly leads to the errors in efficient implementations of two (or three) qubit logical gates in quantum information processing. Fortunately, decoherence-free subspace (DFS) introduced can effectively decrease the influence of decoherence effect. In this paper, we propose some schemes for setting up a family of quantum control gates, including controlled-NOT (CNOT), Toffoli, and Fredkin gates for two or three logical qubits by means of cross-Kerr nonlinearities in DFS. These three logical gates require neither complicated quantum computational c</description>

      <title>Autoparametric resonance extending the bit-flip time of a cat qubit up to 0.3 s</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cat qubits, for which logical $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ are coherent states $|\pm\alpha\rangle$ of a harmonic mode, offer a promising route towards quantum error correction. Using dissipation to our advantage so that photon pairs of the harmonic mode are exchanged with single photons of its environment, it is possible to stabilize the logical states and exponentially increase the bit-flip time of the cat qubit with the photon number $|\alpha|^2$. Large two-photon dissipation rate $\kappa_2$ ensures fast qubit manipulation and short error correction cycles, which are instrumental to correct the remaining phase-flip errors in a repetition code of cat qubits. Here we introduce and operate an autoparametric superconducting circuit that couples a mode containing the cat qubit to a lossy mode whose frequency is set at twice that of the cat mode. This passive coupling does not require a parametric pump and reaches a rate $\kappa_2/2\pi\approx 2~\mathrm{MHz}$. With such a strong two-photon dissipation, bit-flip errors of the autoparametric cat qubit are prevented for a characteristic time up to 0.3~s with only a mild impact on phase-flip errors. Besides, we illustrate how the phase of a quantum superposition between $|\alpha\rangle$ and $|-\alpha\rangle$ can be arbitrarily changed by driving the harmonic mode while keeping the engineered dissipation active.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13591v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an alternative formulation of quantum mechanical angular momentum, based on spatial wavefunctions that depend on the Euler angles $\phi, \theta, \chi$. The wavefunctions are Wigner D-functions, $D_{n m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$, for which the body-fixed projection quantum number $n$ has the unusual value $n=|j|=\sqrt{j(j+1)}$, or $n=0$. The $D_{\sqrt{j(j+1)},m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ wavefunctions are unnormalizable, however we demonstrate a renormalization procedure that allows the calculation of expectation values: for example, the states $D_{\sqrt{S(S+1)} M}^S (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ of elementary particles with spin $S$ give a gyromagnetic ratio of $g=2$ for $S&gt;0$, and we identify these as the spatial angular-momentum wavefunctions of known fundamental charged particles with spin. Therefore, we make the case that the $D_{n m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ are useful as spatial wavefunctions for angular momentum. Some implications of the quantum number $n$ for fundamental particles are discussed, such as the proposed Dirac-fermion nature of the neutrino, and some proposed dark-matter candidates.</description>

Abstract: Absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states of $k$ qudits (also known as perfect tensors) are quantum states that have maximal entanglement for all possible bipartitions of the sites/parties. We consider the problem of whether such states can be decomposed into a tensor network with a small number of tensors, such that all physical and all auxiliary spaces have the same dimension $D$. We find that certain AME states with $k=6$ can be decomposed into a network with only three 4-leg tensors; we provide concrete solutions for local dimension $D=5$ and higher. Our result implies that certain AME states with six parties can be created with only three two-site unitaries from a product state of three Bell pairs, or equivalently, with six two-site unitaries acting on a product state on six qudits. We also consider the problem for $k=8$, where we find similar tensor network decompositions with six 4-leg tensors.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic nature of quantum mechanics is more naturally reflected in a bilinear two-process representation of density matrices rather than in squared wave functions. This proposition comes with a remarkable change of the entanglement mechanism: entanglement effects do not originate from superpositions of wave functions, but result from the bilinear structure of density matrices. Quantum interference appears as a multiplicative phenomenon rather than an additive superposition mechanism. We propose two general requirements such that the bilinear representation of density matrices is given in terms of two uniquely defined, identically distributed, Markovian stochastic jump processes. These general ideas are illustrated for the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and double-slit experiments. The expression of the stochastic nature of quantum mechanics in terms of random variables rather than their probability distributions facilitates an ontological viewpoint and leads us to a bra-ket interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Learning complex quantum processes is a central challenge in many areas of quantum computing and quantum machine learning, with applications in quantum benchmarking, cryptanalysis, and variational quantum algorithms. This paper introduces the first learning framework for studying quantum process learning within the Quantum Statistical Query (QSQ) model, providing the first formal definition of statistical queries to quantum processes (QPSQs). The framework allows us to propose an efficient QPSQ learner for arbitrary quantum processes accompanied by a provable performance guarantee. We also provide numerical simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of this algorithm. In our new framework, we prove exponential query complexity lower bounds for learning unitary 2-designs, and a doubly exponential lower bound for learning haar-random unitaries. The practical relevance of this framework is exemplified through application in cryptography, highlighting vulnerabilities of a large class of Classical-Readout Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (CR-QPUFs), addressing an important open question in the field of quantum hardware security. This work marks a significant step towards understanding the learnability of quantum processes and shedding light on their security implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle physics underpins our understanding of the world at a fundamental level by describing the interplay of matter and forces through gauge theories. Yet, despite their unmatched success, the intrinsic quantum mechanical nature of gauge theories makes important problem classes notoriously difficult to address with classical computational techniques. A promising way to overcome these roadblocks is offered by quantum computers, which are based on the same laws that make the classical computations so difficult. Here, we present a quantum computation of the properties of the basic building block of two-dimensional lattice quantum electrodynamics, involving both gauge fields and matter. This computation is made possible by the use of a trapped-ion qudit quantum processor, where quantum information is encoded in $d$ different states per ion, rather than in two states as in qubits. Qudits are ideally suited for describing gauge fields, which are naturally high-dimensional, leading to a dramatic reduction in the quantum register size and circuit complexity. Using a variational quantum eigensolver, we find the ground state of the model and observe the interplay between virtual pair creation and quantized magnetic field effects. The qudit approach further allows us to seamlessly observe the effect of different gauge field truncations by controlling the qudit dimension. Our results open the door for hardware-efficient quantum simulations with qudits in near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two quantum Hamiltonian algorithms have been proposed to solve the maximum independent set problem: the PK algorithm, introduced in [Phys. Rev. A 101 (2020) 012318; Chin. Phys. Lett. 38, (2021) 030304], and the the HV algorithm, presented in [Science 376 (2022) 1209]. Here we demonstrate that the two algorithms are mathematically equivalent. Specifically, the Hamiltonian in the PK algorithm can be viewed as the HV Hamiltonian in the interaction picture. We remark on potential practical advantages of the PK algorithm.Although they are mathematically equivalent, their most straightforward physical implementations are different, and our numerical simulations suggest that the PK algorithm might can bring significant advantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inherent degeneracy of quantum low-density parity-check codes poses a challenge to their decoding, as it significantly degrades the error-correction performance of classical message-passing decoders. To improve their performance, a post-processing algorithm is usually employed. To narrow the gap between algorithmic solutions and hardware limitations, we introduce a new post-processing algorithm with a hardware-friendly orientation, providing error correction performance competitive to the state-of-the-art techniques. The proposed post-processing, referred to as check-agnosia, is inspired by stabilizer-inactivation, while considerably reducing the required hardware resources, and providing enough flexibility to allow different message-passing schedules and hardware architectures. We carry out a detailed analysis for a set of Pareto architectures with different tradeoffs between latency and power consumption, derived from the results of implemented designs on an FPGA board. We show that latency values close to one microsecond can be obtained on the FPGA board, and provide evidence that much lower latency values can be obtained for ASIC implementations. In the process, we also demonstrate the practical implications of the recently introduced t-covering layers and random-order layered scheduling.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Eigensolver with Constraints (VQEC): Solving Constrained Optimization Problems via VQE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum approaches have shown great promise in finding near-optimal solutions to computationally challenging tasks. Nonetheless, enforcing constraints in a disciplined fashion has been largely unexplored. To address this gap, this work proposes a hybrid quantum-classical algorithmic paradigm termed VQEC that extends the celebrated VQE to handle optimization with constraints. As with the standard VQE, the vector of optimization variables is captured by the state of a variational quantum circuit (VQC). To deal with constraints, VQEC optimizes a Lagrangian function classically over both the VQC parameters as well as the dual variables associated with constraints. To comply with the quantum setup, variables are updated via a perturbed primal-dual method leveraging the parameter shift rule. Among a wide gamut of potential applications, we showcase how VQEC can approximately solve quadratically-constrained binary optimization (QCBO) problems, find stochastic binary policies satisfying quadratic constraints on the average and in probability, and solve large-scale linear programs (LP) over the probability simplex. Under an assumption on the error for the VQC to approximate an arbitrary probability mass function (PMF), we provide bounds on the optimality gap attained by a VQC. Numerical tests on a quantum simulator investigate the effect of various parameters and corroborate that VQEC can generate high-quality solutions.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Execution for Quantum Error Correction Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define QSE, a symbolic execution framework for quantum programs by integrating symbolic variables into quantum states and the outcomes of quantum measurements. The soundness of QSE is established through a theorem that ensures the correctness of symbolic execution within operational semantics. We further introduce symbolic stabilizer states, which symbolize the phases of stabilizer generators, for the efficient analysis of quantum error correction (QEC) programs. Within the QSE framework, we can use symbolic expressions to characterize the possible discrete Pauli errors in QEC, providing a significant improvement over existing methods that rely on sampling with simulators. We implement QSE with the support of symbolic stabilizer states in a prototype tool named QuantumSE.jl. Our experiments on representative QEC codes, including quantum repetition codes, Kitaev's toric codes, and quantum Tanner codes, demonstrate the efficiency of QuantumSE.jl for debugging QEC programs with over 1000 qubits. In addition, by substituting concrete values in symbolic expressions of measurement results, QuantumSE.jl is also equipped with a sampling feature for stabilizer circuits. Despite a longer initialization time than the state-of-the-art stabilizer simulator, Google's Stim, QuantumSE.jl offers a quicker sampling rate in the experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical data encoding is usually treated as a black-box in the oracle-based quantum algorithms. On the other hand, their constructions are crucial for practical algorithm implementations. Here, we open the black-boxes of data encoding and study the Clifford$+T$ complexity of constructing some typical quantum access models. For general matrices, we show that both sparse-access input models and block-encoding require nearly linear circuit complexities relative to the matrix dimension, even if matrices are sparse. We also gives construction protocols achieving near-optimal gate complexities. On the other hand, the construction becomes efficient with respect to the data qubit when the matrix is the linear combination polynomial terms of efficient unitaries. As a typical example, we propose improved block encoding when these unitaries are Pauli strings. Our protocols are built upon improved quantum state preparation and a selective oracle for Pauli strings, which hold independent value. Our access model constructions offer considerable flexibility, allowing for tunable ancillary qubit number and offers corresponding space-time trade-offs.</description>

Abstract: Connecting quantum computers to a quantum network opens a wide array of new applications, such as securely performing computations on distributed data sets. Near-term quantum networks are noisy, however, and hence correctness and security of protocols are not guaranteed. To study the impact of noise, we consider a multiparty summation protocol with imperfect shared entangled states. We study analytically the impact of both depolarising and dephasing noise on this protocol and the noise patterns arising in the probability distributions. We conclude by eliminating the need for a trusted third party in the protocol using Shamir's secret sharing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate signatures of non-Markovianity in the dynamics of a periodically-driven qubit coupled to a dissipative bosonic environment. We propagate the dynamics of the reduced density matrix of the qubit by integrating the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion. Non-Markovian features are quantified by comparing on an equal footing the predictions from diverse and complementary approaches to quantum dissipation. In particular, we analyze the distinguishability of quantum states, the decay of the volume accessible to the qubit on the Hilbert space, the negativity of the canonical rates in the generalized Lindblad equation and the relaxation of the memory kernels in the Nakajima-Zwanzig generalized quantum master equation. We study the effects of controlled driving on the coherent dynamics of the system. We show that a suitable external field can offset the ergodic relaxation of time correlation functions, increase distinguishability over time and strengthen non-Markovian effects witnessed by the canonical dissipation channels. We furthermore observe the phenomenon of eternal non-Markovianity for sufficiently small system-bath coupling and we discuss how this can be enhanced by modulating the frequency of the external drive. The present work provides a broad theoretical analysis of quantum dissipation in the framework of open quantum dynamics and quantum information.</description>

      <title>A Strategy for Preparing Quantum Squeezed States Using Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a scheme leveraging reinforcement learning to engineer control fields for generating non-classical states. It is exemplified by the application to prepare spin-squeezed states for an open collective spin model where a linear control field is designed to govern the dynamics. The reinforcement learning agent determines the temporal sequence of control pulses, commencing from a coherent spin state in an environment characterized by dissipation and dephasing. Compared to the constant control scenario, this approach provides various control sequences maintaining collective spin squeezing and entanglement. It is observed that denser application of the control pulses enhances the performanceof the outcomes. However, there is a minor enhancement in the performance by adding control actions. The proposed strategy demonstrates increased effectiveness for larger systems. Thermal excitations of the reservoir are detrimental to the control outcomes. Feasible experiments are suggested to implement the control proposal. The extension to continuous control problems and another quantum system are discussed. The replaceability of the reinforcement learning module is also emphasized. This research paves the way for its application in manipulating other quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Entangled states with both multiple local levels and multiple subsystems is increasingly entering state-of-the-art quantum technology. We investigate whether such high-dimensional multipartite entangled states can be simulated using only low-dimensional entanglement. To this end, we propose to benchmark the multipartite entanglement dimensionality via the worst-case bipartite entanglement dimension needed to generate the state as a mixture over the different bisections of the system. In order to detect this genuinely high-dimensional and genuinely multipartite entanglement, we develop several classes of general criteria. They are respectively based on fidelity measurements, efficient fidelity estimation using only a minimal number of measurements and convex programming methods. The approach provides a simple way of benchmarking the entanglement dimensionality in the multipartite regime and our methods readily apply to high-dimensional multipartite entanglement experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to enter the era of utility, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices need to enable long-range entanglement of large qubit chains. However, due to the limited connectivity of superconducting NISQ devices, long-range entangling gates are realized in linear depth. Furthermore, a time-dependent degradation of the average CNOT gate fidelity is observed. Likely due to aging, this phenomenon further degrades entanglement capabilities. Our aim is to help in the current efforts to achieve utility and provide an opportunity to extend the utility lifespan of current devices --albeit by selecting fewer, high quality resources. To achieve this, we provide a method to transform user-provided CNOT and readout error requirements into a compliant partition onto which circuits can be executed. We demonstrate an improvement of up to 52% in fidelity for a random CNOT chain of length 50 qubits and consistent improvements between 11.8% and 47.7% for chains between 10 and 40 in varying in increments of 10, respectively.</description>

      <title>Saturability of the Quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound in Multiparameter Quantum Estimation at the Single-Copy Level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11567v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (QCRB) as the ultimate lower bound for precision in quantum parameter estimation is only known to be saturable in the multiparameter setting in special cases and under conditions such as full or average commutavity of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives (SLDs) associated with the parameters. Moreover, for general mixed states, collective measurements over infinitely many identical copies of the quantum state are generally required to attain the QCRB. In the important and experimentally relevant single-copy scenario, a necessary condition for saturating the QCRB in the multiparameter setting for general mixed states is the so-called partial commutativity condition on the SLDs. However, it is not known if this condition is also sufficient. This paper establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the multiparameter QCRB in the single-copy setting in terms of the commutativity of a set of projected SLDs and the existence of a unitary solution to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. New necessary conditions that imply partial commutativity are also obtained, which together with another condition become sufficient. Moreover, when the sufficient conditions are satisfied an optimal measurement saturating the QCRB can be chosen to be projective and explicitly characterized. An example is developed to illustrate the case of a multiparameter quantum state where the conditions derived herein are satisfied and can be explicitly verified.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Nathan and Rudner derived a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation from the Redfield equation. The claim is that the level of approximation is equal to that of the Redfield equation. Here we benchmark the Nathan-Rudner equation (NRE) against the exact solution of a damped harmonic oscillator and compare its performance to that of the time-dependent Redfield equation (RE). We find that which of the equations performs better depends on the regime considered. It turns out that the short-time dynamics is generally much better captured by the RE, whereas the NRE delivers results comparable to those of the rotating-wave approximation. For the steady state, in the high-temperature limit the RE again performs better and its solution approaches the exact result for ultrahigh temperatures. Nevertheless, here also the NR equation constitutes a good approximation. In the low-temperature limit, in turn, the NRE provides a better approximation than the RE. For too strong coupling, here the RE might even fail completely by predicting unphysical behaviour.</description>

      <title>Postselection technique for optical Quantum Key Distribution with improved de Finetti reductions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The postselection technique is an important proof technique for proving the security of quantum key distribution protocols against coherent attacks. In this work, we go through multiple steps to rigorously apply the postselection technique to optical quantum key distribution protocols. First, we place the postselection technique on a rigorous mathematical foundation by fixing a technical flaw in the original postselection paper. Second, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to prepare-and-measure protocols by using a de Finetti reduction with a fixed marginal. Third, we show how the postselection technique can be used for decoy-state protocols by tagging the source. Finally, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to realistic optical setups by developing a new variant of the flag-state squasher. We also improve existing de Finetti reductions, which reduce the effect of using the postselection technique on the key rate. These improvements can be more generally applied to other quantum information processing tasks. As an example to demonstrate the applicability of our work, we apply our results to the time-bin encoded three-state protocol. We observe that the postselection technique performs better than all other known proof techniques against coherent attacks.</description>

      <title>An invitation to the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing</title>

Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing (QHT) has been traditionally studied from the information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of samples of an unknown state. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of QHT, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of samples needed to reach a desired error probability. By making use of the wealth of knowledge that already exists in the literature on QHT, we characterize the sample complexity of binary QHT in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT. In more detail, we prove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's lemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse type II error probability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy. We then provide lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds. The final part of our paper outlines and reviews how sample complexity of QHT is relevant to a broad swathe of research areas and can enhance understanding of many fundamental concepts, including quantum algorithms for simulation and search, quantum learning and classification, and foundations of quantum mechanics. As such, we view our paper as an invitation to researchers coming from different communities to study and contribute to the problem of sample complexity of QHT, and we outline a number of open directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Effective Embedding of Integer Linear Inequalities for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In variational quantum algorithms, constraints are usually added to the problem objective via penalty terms. For linear inequality constraints, this procedure requires additional slack qubits. Those extra qubits tend to blow up the search space and complicate the parameter landscapes to be navigated by the classical optimizers. In this work, we explore approaches to model linear inequalities for quantum algorithms without these drawbacks. More concretely, our main suggestion is to omit the slack qubits completely and evaluate the inequality classically during parameter tuning. We test our methods on QAOA as well as on Trotterized adiabatic evolution, and present empirical results. As a benchmark problem, we consider different instances of the multi-knapsack problem. Our results show that removing the slack bits from the circuit Hamiltonian and considering them only for the expectation value yields better solution quality than the standard approach. The tests have been carried out using problem sizes up to 26 qubits. Our methods can in principle be applied to any problem with linear inequality constraints, and are suitable for variational as well as digitized versions of adiabatic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Light-cone feature selection for quantum machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feature selection plays an essential role in improving the predictive performance and interpretability of trained models in classical machine learning. On the other hand, the usability of conventional feature selection could be limited for quantum machine learning tasks; the technique might not provide a clear interpretation on embedding quantum circuits for classical data tasks and, more importantly, is not applicable to quantum data tasks. In this work, we propose a feature selection method with a specific focus on quantum machine learning. Our scheme treats the light-cones (i.e., subspace) of quantum models as features and then select relevant ones through training of the corresponding local quantum kernels. We numerically demonstrate its versatility for four different applications using toy tasks: (1) feature selection of classical inputs, (2) circuit architecture search for data embedding, (3) compression of quantum machine learning models and (4) subspace selection for quantum data. The proposed framework paves the way towards applications of quantum machine learning to practical tasks. Also, this technique could be used to practically test if the quantum machine learning tasks really need quantumness, while it is beyond the scope of this work.</description>

Abstract: Language processing is at the heart of current developments in artificial intelligence, and quantum computers are becoming available at the same time. This has led to great interest in quantum natural language processing, and several early proposals and experiments.
  This paper surveys the state of this area, showing how NLP-related techniques have been used in quantum language processing. We examine the art of word embeddings and sequential models, proposing some avenues for future investigation and discussing the tradeoffs present in these directions. We also highlight some recent methods to compute attention in transformer models, and perform grammatical parsing. We also introduce a new quantum design for the basic task of text encoding (representing a string of characters in memory), which has not been addressed in detail before.
  Quantum theory has contributed toward quantifying uncertainty and explaining "What is intelligence?" In this context, we argue that "hallucinations" in modern artificial intelligence systems are a misunderstanding of the way facts are conceptualized: language can express many plausible hypotheses, of which only a few become actual.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of Multi-Controlled Quantum Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an implementation of multi-controlled quantum gates which provides significant reductions of cost compared to state-of-the-art methods. The operator applied on the target qubit is a unitary, special unitary, or the Pauli X operator (Multi-Controlled Toffoli). The required number of ancilla qubits is no larger than one, similarly to known linear cost decompositions. We extend our methods for any number of target qubits, and provide further cost reductions if additional ancilla qubits are available. For each type of multi-controlled gate, we provide implementations for unrestricted (all-to-all) connectivity and for linear-nearest-neighbor. All of the methods use a linear cost of gates from the Clifford+T (fault-tolerant) set. In the context of linear-nearest-neighbor architecture, the cost and depth of our circuits scale linearly irrespective of the position of the qubits on which the gate is applied. Our methods directly improve the compilation process of many quantum algorithms, providing optimized circuits, which will result in a large reduction of errors.</description>

      <title>Local Test for Unitarily Invariant Properties of Bipartite Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the power of local test for bipartite quantum states. Our central result is that, for properties of bipartite pure states, unitary invariance on one part implies an optimal (over all global testers) local tester acting only on the other part. This suggests a canonical local tester for entanglement spectra (i.e., Schmidt coefficients), and reveals that purified samples offer no advantage in property testing of mixed states. As applications, we show new sample lower bounds, e.g.:
  - The first general lower bound $\Omega(r/\epsilon^2)$ for testing whether the Schmidt rank of a bipartite state is at most $r$ or $\epsilon$-far, settling an open question raised in Montanaro and de Wolf (ToC 2016).
  - A lower bound $\Omega((\sqrt n+\sqrt r)\cdot\sqrt r/\epsilon^2)$ for testing whether an $n$-partite state is a matrix product state of bond dimension $r$ or $\epsilon$-far, improving the prior lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt n/\epsilon^2)$ by Soleimanifar and Wright (SODA 2022) and $\Omega(\sqrt r)$ by Aaronson et al. (ITCS 2024). Further, when perfect completeness is required, we provide a matching lower bound $\Omega(r^2/\epsilon^2)$ with respect to $r$ and $\epsilon$.
  - A matching lower bound $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ for testing whether a $d$-dimensional bipartite state is maximally entangled or $\epsilon$-far, showing that the algorithm of O'Donnell and Wright (STOC 2015) is optimal for this task.
  Beyond sample complexity, we also contribute new query lower bounds:
  - A query lower bound $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{d/\Delta})$ for the $d$-dimensional entanglement entropy problem with gap $\Delta$, improving the prior best $\Omega(\sqrt[4]{d})$ by She and Yuen (ITCS 2023) and $\tilde\Omega(1/\sqrt\Delta)$ by Wang and Zhang (2023) and Weggemans (2024).
  Further, our central result can be extended when the tested state is mixed: one-way LOCC is sufficient to realize the optimal tester.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of topological orders subject to decoherence on the bipartition boundary. Focusing on the toric codes in $d$ space dimensions for $d=2,3,4$, we explore whether the boundary decoherence may be able to induce a disentangling transition, characterized by the destruction of mixed-state long-range entanglement across the bipartition, measured by topological entanglement negativity. A key insight of our approach is the connection between the negativity spectrum of the decohered mixed states and emergent symmetry-protected topological orders under certain symmetry-preserving perturbation localized on the bipartition boundary. This insight allows us to analytically derive the exact results of entanglement negativity without using a replica trick.</description>

Abstract: Computations with quantum harmonic oscillators or qumodes is a promising and rapidly evolving approach towards quantum computing. In contrast to qubits, which are two-level quantum systems, bosonic qumodes can in principle have infinite discrete levels, and can also be represented with continuous variable bases. One of the most promising applications of quantum computing is simulating many-fermion problems such as molecular electronic structure. Although there has been a lot of recent progress on simulating many-fermion systems on qubit-based quantum hardware, they can not be easily extended to bosonic quantum devices due to the fundamental difference in physics represented by qubits and qumodes. In this work, we show how an electronic structure Hamiltonian can be transformed into a system of qumodes with a fermion to boson mapping scheme and apply it to simulate the electronic structure of dihydrogen molecule as a system of two qumodes. Our work opens the door for simulating many-fermion systems by harnessing the power of bosonic quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by Einstein's thought experiment that a single quantum particle diffracted after a pinhole could in principle produce an action in two or several places on a hemispherical imaging screen, here we explore theoretically the possibility to simultaneously detect the action of a single photon at two remote places. This is considered in a cascade quantum system composed of two spatially distant cavities each coupled to a qubit in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that a single-photon pulse incident on the two cavities can simultaneously excite the two remote qubits and lead to two subsequent single-photon detection events even when the separation between them is comparable to the spatial length of the photon pulse. Our results not only uncover new facets of photons at a fundamental level but also have practical applications, such as the generation of remote entanglement by a single photon through a dissipative channel which is otherwise unattainable in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of achieving near-term quantum advantage for combinatorial optimization problems, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) are the primary methods of interest, but their practical effectiveness remains uncertain. Therefore, there is a persistent need to develop and evaluate alternative variational quantum algorithms. This study presents an investigation of the Block ENcoding Quantum Optimizer (BENQO), a hybrid quantum solver that uses block encoding to represent the cost function. BENQO is designed to be universally applicable across discrete optimization problems. Beyond Maximum Cut, we evaluate BENQO's performance in the context of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, which is of greater practical relevance. Our findings confirm that BENQO performs significantly better than QAOA and competes with VQE across a variety of performance metrics. We conclude that BENQO is a promising novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that should be further investigated and optimized to realize its full potential.</description>

Abstract: Learning the problem structure at multiple levels of coarseness to inform the decomposition-based hybrid quantum-classical combinatorial optimization solvers is a promising approach to scaling up variational approaches. We introduce a multilevel algorithm reinforced with the spectral graph representation learning-based accelerator to tackle large-scale graph maximum cut instances and fused with several versions of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and QAOA-inspired algorithms. The graph representation learning model utilizes the idea of QAOA variational parameters concentration and substantially improves the performance of QAOA. We demonstrate the potential of using multilevel QAOA and representation learning-based approaches on very large graphs by achieving high-quality solutions in a much faster time.

      <description>arXiv:1911.10893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every measurement determines a single value as its outcome, and yet quantum mechanics predicts it only probabilistically. The Kochen-Specker theorem and Bell's inequality are often considered to reject a realist view but favor a skeptical view that measuring an observable does not mean ascertaining the value that it has, but producing the outcome, having only a personal meaning. However, precise analysis supporting this view is unknown. Here, we show that a quantum mechanical analysis turns down this view. Supposing that two observers simultaneously measure the same observable, we can well pose the question as to whether they always obtain the same outcome, or whether the probability distributions are the same, but the outcomes are uncorrelated. Contrary to the widespread view in favor of the second, we shall show that quantum mechanics predicts that only the first case occurs. We further show that any measurement establishes a time-like entanglement between the observable to be measured and the meter after the measurement, which causes the space-like entanglement between the meters of different observers. We also show that our conclusion cannot be extended to measurements of so-called `generalized' observables, suggesting a demand for reconsidering the notion of observables in foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum communication networks (QCNs) utilize quantum mechanics for secure information transmission, but the reliance on fragile and expensive photonic quantum resources renders QCN resource optimization challenging. Unlike prior QCN works that relied on blindly compressing direct quantum embeddings of classical data, this letter proposes a novel quantum semantic communications (QSC) framework exploiting advancements in quantum machine learning and quantum semantic representations to extracts and embed only the relevant information from classical data into minimal high-dimensional quantum states that are accurately communicated over quantum channels with quantum communication and semantic fidelity measures. Simulation results indicate that, compared to semantic-agnostic QCN schemes, the proposed framework achieves approximately 50-75% reduction in quantum communication resources needed, while achieving a higher quantum semantic fidelity.</description>

      <title>Field theory in Rindler frame and more on the correspondence with thermal field theory formalisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering two accelerated observers with same acceleration in two timelike wedges of Rindler frame we calculate the Feynman-{\it like} propagators for a real scalar field in a thermal bath with respect to the Minkowski vacuum. Only the same wedge correlators are symmetric under the exchange of the {\it real} thermal bath and Unruh thermal bath, while the cross-wedge ones are not. Interestingly, they contain a cross term which is a collective effects of acceleration and thermal nature of field. Particularly the zero temperature description along with {\it no analytic continuation} between coordinates in right and left Rindler wedges, as expected, corresponds to usual thermofield-double formalism. However, unlike in later formulation, the two fields are now parts of the original system. Moreover it bears the features of a spacial case of closed-time formalism (CTP) where the Keldysh contour is along the increasing Rindler time in the respective Rindler wedges. Interestingly, we observe a new feature that the analytic continuation between the wedges provides the two more spacial cases of CTP. Hence Rindler-frame-field theory seems to be a viable candidate to deal thermal theory of fields and may illuminate the search for a bridge between the usual existing formalisms.</description>

Abstract: Emergent gauge theories take a prominent role in the description of quantum matter, supporting deconfined phases with topological order and fractionalized excitations. A common construction of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, first introduced by Wegner, involves Ising gauge spins placed on links and subject to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Gauss law constraint. As shown by Kitaev, $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories also emerge in the exact solution of certain spin systems with bond-dependent interactions. In this context, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field is constructed from Majorana fermions, with gauge constraints given by the parity of Majorana fermions on each site. In this work, we provide an explicit Jordan-Wigner transformation that maps between these two formulations on the square lattice, where the Kitaev-type gauge theory emerges as the exact solution of a spin-orbital (Kugel-Khomskii) Hamiltonian. We then apply our mapping to study local perturbations to the spin-orbital Hamiltonian, which correspond to anisotropic interactions between electric-field variables in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. These are shown to induce anisotropic confinement that is characterized by emergence of weakly-coupled one-dimensional spin chains. We study the nature of these phases and corresponding confinement transitions in both absence and presence of itinerant fermionic matter degrees of freedom. Finally, we discuss how our mapping can be applied to the Kitaev spin-1/2 model on the honeycomb lattice.</description>

      <title>Work statistics for Quantum Spin Chains: characterizing quantum phase transitions, benchmarking time evolution, and examining passivity of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13366v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study three aspects of work statistics in the context of the fluctuation theorem for the quantum spin chains up to $1024$ sites by numerical methods based on matrix-product states (MPS). First, we use our numerical method to evaluate the moments/cumulants of work done by sudden quench process on the Ising or Haldane spin chains and study their behaviors across the quantum phase transitions. Our results show that, up to the fourth cumulant, the work statistics can indicate the quantum phase transition characterized by the local order parameters but barely for purely topological phase transitions. Second, we propose to use the fluctuation theorem, such as Jarzynski's equality, which relates the real-time correlator to the ratio of the thermal partition functions, as a benchmark indicator for the numerical real-time evolving methods. Third, we study the passivity of ground and thermal states of quantum spin chains under some cyclic impulse processes. We show that the passivity of thermal states and ground states under the hermitian actions are ensured by the second laws and variational principles, respectively, and also verify it by numerical calculations. Besides, we also consider the passivity of ground states under non-hermitian actions, for which the variational principle cannot be applied. Despite that, we find no violation of passivity from our numerical results for all the cases considered in the Ising and Haldane chains. {Overall, we demonstrate that the work statistics for the sudden quench and impulse processes can be evaluated precisely by the numerical MPS method to characterize quantum phase transitions and examine the passivity of quantum states. We also propose to exploit the universality of the fluctuation theorem to benchmark the numerical real-time evolutions in an algorithm and model independent way.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Duality in Quantum Optimization: Overcoming QUBO Limitations for Constrained Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to solving constrained combinatorial optimization problems based on embedding the concept of Lagrangian duality into the framework of adiabatic quantum computation. Within the setting of circuit-model fault-tolerant quantum computation, we demonstrate that this approach achieves a quadratic improvement in circuit depth and maintains a constraint-independent circuit width in contrast to the prevalent approach of solving constrained problems via reformulations based on the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) framework. Our study includes a detailed review of the limitations encountered when using QUBO for constrained optimization. We show that the proposed method overcomes these limitations by encoding the optimal solution at an energetically elevated level of a simpler problem Hamiltonian, which results in substantially more resource-efficient quantum circuits. We consolidate our strategy with a detailed analysis on how the concepts of Lagrangian duality such as duality gap and complementary slackness relate to the success probability of sampling the optimal solution. Our findings are illustrated by benchmarking the Lagrangian dual approach against the QUBO approach using the NP-complete binary knapsack problem.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedups in Regret Analysis of Infinite Horizon Average-Reward Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of quantum acceleration in addressing infinite horizon Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to enhance average reward outcomes. We introduce an innovative quantum framework for the agent's engagement with an unknown MDP, extending the conventional interaction paradigm. Our approach involves the design of an optimism-driven tabular Reinforcement Learning algorithm that harnesses quantum signals acquired by the agent through efficient quantum mean estimation techniques. Through thorough theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the quantum advantage in mean estimation leads to exponential advancements in regret guarantees for infinite horizon Reinforcement Learning. Specifically, the proposed Quantum algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$, a significant improvement over the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ bound exhibited by classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Entanglement R\'{e}nyi Negativity of Interacting Fermions from Quantum Monte Carlo Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body entanglement unveils additional aspects of quantum matter and offers insights into strongly correlated physics. While ground-state entanglement has received much attention in the past decade, the study of mixed-state quantum entanglement using negativity in interacting fermionic systems remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate that the partially transposed density matrix of interacting fermions, similar to their reduced density matrix, can be expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian states describing free fermions, enabling the calculation of rank-$n$ R\'{e}nyi negativity within the determinant quantum Monte Carlo framework. We conduct the first calculation of rank-two R\'{e}nyi negativity for the half-filled Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model and find that the area law coefficient of the R\'{e}nyi negativity has a logarithmic finite-size scaling at the finite-temperature transition point. Our work contributes to the calculation of entanglement and sets the stage for future studies on quantum entanglement in various fermionic many-body mixed states.</description>

      <title>Social Echo Chambers in Quantum Field Theory: Exploring Faddeev-Popov Ghosts Phenomena, Loop Diagrams, and Cut-off Energy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an interdisciplinary approach to analyze the emergence and impact of filter bubbles in social phenomena, especially in both digital and offline environments, by applying the concepts of quantum field theory. Filter bubbles tend to occur in digital and offline environments, targeting digital natives with extremely low media literacy and information immunity. In addition, in the aftermath of stealth marketing, fake news, "inspirational marketing," and other forms of stealth marketing that never exist are rampant and can lead to major social disruption and exploitation. These are the causes of various social risks, including declining information literacy and knowledge levels and academic achievement. By exploring quantum mechanical principles such as remote interaction, proximity interaction, Feynman diagrams, and loop diagrams, we aim to gain a better understanding of information dissemination and opinion formation in social contexts. Our model incorporates key parameters such as agents' opinions, interaction probabilities, and flexibility in changing opinions, facilitating the observation of opinion distributions, cluster formation, and polarization under a variety of conditions. The purpose of this paper is to mathematically model the filter bubble phenomenon using the concepts of quantum field theory and to analyze its social consequences. This is a discussion paper and the proposed approach offers an innovative perspective for understanding social phenomena, but its interpretation and application require careful consideration. This paper is partially an attempt to utilize "Generative AI" and was written with educational intent. There are currently no plans for it to become a peer-reviewed paper.</description>

      <title>Quantum Modeling of Filter Bubbles Based on Kubo-Matsubara Form Green's Functions Considering Remote and Proximity Interactions:Ultraviolet Divergence to Indefinite Ghosting, Consideration of Cut Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05266</link>

Abstract: This research aims to model tracks the evolution of opinions among agents and their collective dynamics, and mathematically represents the resonance of opinions and echo chamber effects within the filter bubble by including non-physical factors such as misinformation and confirmation bias, known as FP ghosting phenomena.The indeterminate ghost phenomenon, a social science concept similar to the uncertainty principle, depicts the variability of social opinion by incorporating information uncertainty and nonlinearities in opinion formation into the model. Furthermore, by introducing the Kubo formula and the Matsubara form of the Green's function, we mathematically express temporal effects and model how past, present, and future opinions interact to reveal the mechanisms of opinion divergence and aggregation. Our model uses multiple parameters, including population density and extremes of opinion generated on a random number basis, to simulate the formation and growth of filter bubbles and their progression to ultraviolet divergence phenomena. In this process, we observe how resonance or disconnection of opinions within a society occurs via a disconnection function (type la, lb, ll, lll). However, the interpretation of the results requires careful consideration, and empirical verification is a future challenge.Finally, we will share our hypotheses and considerations for the model case of this paper, which is a close examination of regional differences in media coverage and its effectiveness and considerations unique to Japan, a disaster-prone country.</description>

      <title>Three-body scattering area for particles with infinite or zero scattering length in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansions of the wave function of three particles having equal mass with finite-range interactions and infinite or zero two-dimensional scattering length colliding at zero energy and zero orbital angular momentum, from which a three-body parameter $D$ is defined. The dimension of $D$ is length squared, and we call $D$ three-body scattering area. We find that the ground state energy per particle of a zero-temperature dilute Bose gas with these interactions is approximately $\frac{\hbar^2 D }{6m}\rho^2$, where $\rho$ is the number density of the bosons, $m$ is the mass of each boson, and $\hbar$ is Planck's constant over $2\pi$. Such a Bose gas is stable at $D\geq 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, and metastable at $D&lt;0$ in the harmonic trap if the number of bosons is less than $N_{cr}\approx 3.6413 \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m\omega |D|}}$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the harmonic trap. If the two-body interaction supports bound states, $D$ typically acquires a negative imaginary part, and we find the relation between this imaginary part and the amplitudes of the pair-boson production processes. We derive a formula for the three-body recombination rate constant of the many-boson system in terms of the imaginary part of $D$.</description>

      <title>Single-frame transmission and phase imaging using off-axis holography with undetected photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imaging with undetected photons relies upon nonlinear interferometry to extract the spatial image from an infrared probe beam and reveal it in the interference pattern of an easier-to-detect visible beam. Typically, the transmission and phase images are extracted using phase-shifting techniques and combining interferograms from multiple frames. Here we show that off-axis digital holography enables reconstruction of both transmission and phase images at the infrared wavelength from a single interferogram, and hence a single frame, recorded in the visible. This eliminates the need for phase stepping and multiple acquisitions, thereby greatly reducing total measurement time for imaging with long acquisition times at low flux or enabling video-rate imaging at higher flux. With this single-frame acquisition technique, we are able to reconstruct transmission images of an object in the infrared beam with a signal-to-noise ratio of $1.78\,\pm\,0.06$ at 10 frames per second, and record a dynamic scene in the infrared beam at 33 frames per second.</description>

      <title>Ring Structure in the Complex Plane: A Fingerprint of non-Hermitian Mobility Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By Avila's global theory, we analytically reveal that the non-Hermitian mobility edge will take on a ring structure in the complex plane, which we name as "mobility ring". The universality of mobility ring has been checked and supported by the Hermitian limit, $PT$-symmetry protection and without $PT$-symmetry cases. Further, we study the evolution of mobility ring versus quasiperiodic strength, and find that in the non-Hermitian system, there will appear multiple mobility ring structures. With cross-reference to the multiple mobility edges in Hermitian case, we give the expression of the maximum number of mobility rings. Finally, by comparing the results of Avila's global theorem and self-duality method, we show that self-duality relation has its own limitations in calculating the critical point in non-Hermitian systems. As we know, the general non-Hermitian system has a complex spectrum, which determines that the non-Hermitian mobility edge can but exhibit a ring structure in the complex plane.</description>
