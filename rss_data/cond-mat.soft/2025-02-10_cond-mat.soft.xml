      <title>Self-limiting states of polar misfits: Frustrated assembly of warped-jigsaw particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground state thermodynamics of a model class of geometrically frustrated assemblies, known as {\it warped-jigsaw} particles. While it is known that frustration in soft matter assemblies has the ability to propagate up to mesoscopic, multi-particle size scales, notably through the selection of self-limiting domain, little is understood about how the symmetry of shape-misfit at the particle scale influences emergent morphologies at the mesoscale. Here we show that polarity in the shape-misfit of warped-jigsaw puzzles manifests at a larger scale in the morphology and thermodynamics of the ground-state assembly of self-limiting domains. We use a combination of continuum theory and discrete particle simulations to show that the polar misfit gives rise to two mesoscopically distinct polar, self-limiting ribbon domains. Thermodynamic selection between the two ribbon morphologies is controlled by a combination of the binding anisotropy along distinct neighbor directions and the orientation of polar shape-misfit. These predictions are valuable as design features for ongoing efforts to program self-limiting assemblies through the synthesis of intentionally frustrated particles, and further suggests a generic classification of frustrated assembly behavior in terms of the relative symmetries of shape-misfit and the underlying long-range inter-particle order it frustrates.</description>

      <title>Unified description of viscous, viscoelastic, or elastic thin active films on substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is frequent for active or living entities to find themselves embedded in a surrounding medium. Resulting composite systems are usually classified as either active fluids or active solids. Yet, in reality, particularly in the biological context, a broad spectrum of viscoelasticity exists in between these two limits. There, both viscous and elastic properties are combined. To bridge the gap between active fluids and active solids, we here systematically derive a unified continuum-theoretical framework. It covers viscous, viscoelastic, and elastic active materials. Our continuum equations are obtained by coarse-graining a discrete, agent-based microscopic dynamic description. In our subsequent analysis, we mainly focus on thin active films on supporting substrates. Strength of activity and degree of elasticity are used as control parameters that control the overall behavior. We concentrate on the analysis of transitions between spatially uniform analytical solutions of collective migration. These include isotropic and polar, orientationally ordered states. A stationary polar solution of persistent directed collective motion is observed for rather fluid-like systems. It corresponds to the ubiquitous swarming state observed in various kinds of dry and wet active matter. With increasing elasticity, persistent motion in one direction is prevented by elastic anchoring and restoring forces. As a consequence, rotations of the spatially uniform migration direction and associated flow occur. Our unified description allows to continuously tune the material behavior from viscous, via viscoelastic, to elastic active behavior by variation of a single parameter. Therefore, it allows in the future to investigate the time evolution of complex systems and biomaterials such as biofilms within one framework.</description>

      <title>Linear-limit aging times of three monoalcohols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents data for the physical aging of the three monoalcohols 2-ethyl-1-butanol, 5-methyl-2-hexanol, and 1-phenyl-1-propanol. Aging is studied by monitoring how the dielectric loss at a fixed frequency in the kHz range equilibrates upon temperature jumps of a few Kelvin's magnitude from equilibrium to equilibrium. The three alcohols differ in the Debye relaxation strength and how much the Debye relaxation time is different from that of the $\alpha$ process. We first demonstrate that single-parameter aging describes all data well and proceed to use this to identify linear-limit normalized aging relaxation functions. From the Laplace transform of these functions, the linear-limit aging loss-peak angular frequency defines the inverse of the linear aging relaxation time. This allows for a comparison to the temperature dependence of the Debye and $\alpha$ dielectric relaxation times of the three monoalcohols. We conclude that the aging response for 5-methyl-2-hexanol and 2-ethyl-1-butanol follows the $\alpha$ relaxation, not on the Debye process, while no definite conclusion can be reached for 1-phenyl-1-propanol because the Debye and $\alpha$ relaxations are here too merged to be distinguished.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Effects of Curvature and Misorientation on the Shrinkage Behavior of Loop-Shaped Grain Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The material properties of polycrystals are strongly affected by the evolution and coarsening of their internal grain structures. Yet, studying this process is challenging due to the complex interactions within grain boundary networks. Here, we systematically investigate the shrinkage of isolated loop-shaped grain boundaries in 2D colloidal crystals. Unexpectedly, we find that shear coupling decreases with increasing grain misorientation, contrary to geometric predictions. This counterintuitive result is attributed to enhanced concurrent sliding driven by the annihilation of dislocations. Furthermore, by focusing on the evolution of the grain size, we reveal a transition in shrinkage kinetics between small and large loop sizes, offering an explanation for previously observed discrepancies in grain boundary mobility. These findings reveal a more intricate dependence of grain boundary behavior on curvature and misorientation than previously reported, offering new insights into polycrystal coarsening dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stirring supercooled colloidal liquids at the particle scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decay of tangential velocity profiles with distance from a local disturbance in hard-sphere colloidal suspensions as the colloidal glass transition is approached. The disturbance, generated by a dimer of superparamagnetic particles rotated by an external magnetic field, enables a precise characterization of the system's response through confocal microscopy and tracking of individual particle dynamics. The tangential velocity profiles exhibit nearly exponential decay with distance. As particle density increases toward the colloidal glass transition, the characteristic length scale derived from exponential fits grows. We also observe that the colloidal particles slip against the rotating dimer, with less slip in samples which are closer to the glass transition.</description>

      <title>Frustration In Physiology And Molecular Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecules provide the ultimate language in terms of which physiology and pathology must be understood. Myriads of proteins participate in elaborate networks of interactions and perform chemical activities coordinating the life of cells. To perform these often amazing tasks, proteins must move and we must think of them as dynamic ensembles of three dimensional structures formed first by folding the polypeptide chains so as to minimize the conflicts between the interactions of their constituent amino acids. It is apparent however that, even when completely folded, not all conflicting interactions have been resolved so the structure remains "locally frustrated". Over the last decades it has become clearer that this local frustration is not just a random accident but plays an essential part of the inner workings of protein molecules. We will review here the physical origins of the frustration concept and review evidence that local frustration is important for protein physiology, protein-protein recognition, catalysis and allostery. Also, we highlight examples showing how alterations in the local frustration patterns can be linked to distinct pathologies. Finally we explore the extensions of the impact of frustration in higher order levels of organization of systems including gene regulatory networks and the neural networks of the brain.</description>

      <title>Viscoelasticity reduces the droplet size in mucosalivary film fragmentation during intense respiratory events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental fluid dynamical mechanisms dictating the generation of bioaerosols in the human trachea during intense respiratory events such as coughing and sneezing, with an emphasis on the role played by the mucosalivary fluid viscoelasticity. An experimental investigation of the shear-induced fragmentation of a mucosalivary-mimetic fluid in a confined geometry reveals that viscoelastic liquids undergo atomization in a manner akin to Newtonian liquids -- via the formation of bag-like structures -- which ultimately rupture through the appearance of retracting holes on the bag surface. Droplets are produced via the unstable retraction of liquid rims bounding these holes. However, in comparison to Newtonian liquids, viscoelastic bags inflate to larger sizes -- implying thinner sheets and, consequently smaller droplets upon rupture. Numerical simulations support that the smaller droplets can be attributed to the thinner sheets, with a more uniform thickness, for viscoelastic bags prior to rupture. Hence, we highlight the role of the viscoelasticity in determining the thickness of the intermediate bag-like structures, which, in turn, govern the droplet size distribution of the expelled aerosol.</description>

      <title>Rigid clusters in shear-thickening suspensions: a nonequilibrium critical transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15165v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The onset and growth of rigid clusters in a two-dimensional (2D) suspension in shear flow are studied by numerical simulations. The suspension exhibits the lubricated-to-frictional rheology transition, but the key results here are for stresses above the levels that cause extreme shear-thickening. At large solid fraction, $\phi$, but below the stress-dependent jamming fraction, we find a critical $\phi_{c}(\sigma,\mu)$ where $\sigma$ is a dimensionless shear stress and $\mu$ is the interparticle friction coefficient. For $\phi&gt;\phi_c$, the proportion of particles in rigid clusters grows sharply, as $f_{\rm rig} \sim |\phi-\phi_{c}|^{\beta}$ with $\beta=1/8$. The fluctuations in the fraction of particles in rigid clusters yield a susceptibility measure $\chi_{\rm rig} \sim |\phi-\phi_{c}|^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma = 7/4$. The system is thus found to exhibit criticality. The results are shown to depend on an effective field $h(\mu)$, which provides data collapse near $\phi_c$ for both $f_{\rm rig}$ and $\chi_{\rm rig}$. This behavior occurs over a range of stresses, with $\phi_c(\sigma,\mu)$ increasing as the stress decreases.</description>

      <title>A Free Energy Model for the Plateau Shear Modulus in Thermosensitive Microgel Suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polymer microgels exhibit intriguing macroscopic flow properties arising from their unique microscopic structure. Microgel colloids usually comprise a crosslinked polymer network with a radially decaying density profile, resulting in a dense core surrounded by a fuzzy corona. Notably, microgels synthesized from poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) are thermoresponsive, capable of adjusting their size and density profile based on temperature. Above the lower critical solution temperature ($T_\text{LCST} \sim 33$ $^\circ$C), the microgel's polymer network collapses, expulsing water through a reversible process. Conversely, below $33$ $^\circ$C, the microgel's network swells, becoming highly compressible and allowing overpacking to effective volume fractions exceeding one. Under conditions of dense packing, microgels undergo deformation in distinct stages: corona compression and faceting, interpenetration, and finally, isotropic compression. Each stage exhibits a characteristic signature in the dense microgel suspensions' yield stress and elastic modulus. Here, we introduce a model for the linear elastic shear modulus by minimizing a quasi-equilibrium free energy, encompassing all relevant energetic contributions. We validate our model by comparing its predictions to experimental results from oscillatory shear rheology tests on microgel suspensions at different densities and temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that combining macroscopic rheological measurements with the model allows for temperature-dependent characterization of polymer interaction parameters.</description>

      <title>Potential of mean force and underscreening of polarizable colloids in concentrated electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study uses advanced numerical methods to estimate the mean force potential (PMF) between charged, polarizable colloidal particles in dense electrolytes. We observe that when the Debye screening length, $\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$, is below the hydrated ion size, the PMF shows discernible oscillations of purely electrostatic origin as opposed to chemical affinity, in addition to the expected decay in DLVO theory. Moreover, our findings suggest concentrated electrolytes are significantly less efficient at muting electrostatic interactions in electrostatically stabilized colloidal suspensions, potentially having significant implications for our understanding of colloidal stability and the forces that govern the behavior of concentrated charged soft matter systems beyond DLVO theory.</description>

      <title>Chemical control of self-assembly by the electrosolvation force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-assembly of matter in solution generally relies on attractive interactions that overcome entropy and drive the formation of higher-order molecular and particulate structures. Such interactions play key roles in a variety of contexts, e.g., crystallisation, biomolecular folding and condensation, pathological protein aggregation, pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. The electrosolvation force entails a new conceptual paradigm in the known palette of interactions that drive the spontaneous accretion and organisation of matter. However, an understanding of the underlying physical chemistry, and therefore the ability to exert control over and tune the interaction, remains incomplete. Here we demonstrate that this force arises from the structure of the interfacial electrolyte. Neutral molecules such as a different solvent, osmolytes or surfactants, can - even at very low concentrations in the medium - disrupt or reinforce pre-existing interfacial solvent structure, thereby furnishing unanticipated chemical tuning of the ability of matter to self-assemble. The observations further present unexpected mechanistic elements that may explain the impact of co-solvents and osmolytes on protein structure, stability and pathological protein condensation. Our findings shed new light on microscopic mechanisms that drive the emergence of order and structure from molecular to macroscopic scales in the solution phase.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Ionic Liquid Affinity and Its Effect on Phospholipid Membrane Structure and Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the impact of imidazolium based ILs on the viscoelasticity, dynamics, and phase behavior of two model membrane systems, (i) lipid monolayers and (ii) unilamellar vesicles composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Our findings demonstrate that both ILs induce significant disorder in lipid membranes by altering the area per lipid molecule, thereby modulating their viscoelastic properties. ILs with longer alkyl chains show stronger interactions with membranes, causing more pronounced disorder. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates that IL incorporation shifts the membrane main phase transition to lower temperatures and introduces gauche defects, signifying increased structural disorder. This effect is amplified with longer alkyl chains and higher IL concentrations. Quasielastic neutron scattering studies highlight that ILs markedly enhance the lateral diffusion of lipids within the membrane leaflet, with the extent of enhancement determined by the membrane physical state, IL concentration, and alkyl chain length. The most pronounced acceleration in lateral diffusion occurs in ordered membrane phase with higher concentrations of the longer chain IL. Molecular dynamics simulations corroborate these experimental findings, showing that longer chain ILs extensively disrupt lipid organization, introduce more gauche defects, increase the area per lipid, and consequently enhance lateral diffusion. This increase in lipid fluidity and permeability provides a mechanistic basis for the observed higher toxicity associated with longer chain ILs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.</description>
