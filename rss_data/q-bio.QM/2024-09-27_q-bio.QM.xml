      <title>Quantitative effects of the stress response to DNA damage in the cell size control of Escherichia coli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Escherichia coli the response to DNA damage shows strong cell-to-cell-heterogenity. This results in a random delay in cell division and asymmetrical binary fission of single cells, which can compromise the size homeostasis of the population. To quantify the effect of the heterogeneous response to genotoxic stress (called SOS response in E. coli) on the growth of the bacterial population, we propose a flexible time-continuous parametric model of individual-based population dynamics. We construct a stochastic model based on the "adder" size-control mechanism, extended to incorporate the dynamics of the SOS response and its effect on cell division. The model is fitted to individual lineage data obtained in a 'mother machine' microfluidic device. We show that the heterogeneity of the SOS response can bias the observed division rate. In particular, we show that the adder division rate is decreased by SOS induction and that this perturbative effect is stronger in fast-growing conditions.</description>

      <title>CodonMPNN for Organism Specific and Codon Optimal Inverse Folding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating protein sequences conditioned on protein structures is an impactful technique for protein engineering. When synthesizing engineered proteins, they are commonly translated into DNA and expressed in an organism such as yeast. One difficulty in this process is that the expression rates can be low due to suboptimal codon sequences for expressing a protein in a host organism. We propose CodonMPNN, which generates a codon sequence conditioned on a protein backbone structure and an organism label. If naturally occurring DNA sequences are close to codon optimality, CodonMPNN could learn to generate codon sequences with higher expression yields than heuristic codon choices for generated amino acid sequences. Experiments show that CodonMPNN retains the performance of previous inverse folding approaches and recovers wild-type codons more frequently than baselines. Furthermore, CodonMPNN has a higher likelihood of generating high-fitness codon sequences than low-fitness codon sequences for the same protein sequence. Code is available at https://github.com/HannesStark/CodonMPNN.</description>

      <title>So You Want to Image Myelin Using MRI: Magnetic Susceptibility Source Separation for Myelin Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In MRI, researchers have long endeavored to effectively visualize myelin distribution in the brain, a pursuit with significant implications for both scientific research and clinical applications. Over time, various methods such as myelin water imaging, magnetization transfer imaging, and relaxometric imaging have been developed, each carrying distinct advantages and limitations. Recently, an innovative technique named as magnetic susceptibility source separation has emerged, introducing a novel surrogate biomarker for myelin in the form of a diamagnetic susceptibility map. This paper comprehensively reviews this cutting-edge method, providing the fundamental concepts of magnetic susceptibility, susceptibility imaging, and the validation of the diamagnetic susceptibility map as a myelin biomarker that indirectly measure myelin content. Additionally, the paper explores essential aspects of data acquisition and processing, offering practical insights for readers. A comparison with established myelin imaging methods is also presented, and both current and prospective clinical and scientific applications are discussed to provide a holistic understanding of the technique. This work aims to serve as a foundational resource for newcomers entering this dynamic and rapidly expanding field.</description>

      <title>2D and 3D Deep Learning Models for MRI-based Parkinson's Disease Classification: A Comparative Analysis of Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Graph Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) diagnosis remains challenging. This study applies Convolutional Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (ConvKANs), integrating learnable spline-based activation functions into convolutional layers, for PD classification using structural MRI. The first 3D implementation of ConvKANs for medical imaging is presented, comparing their performance to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) across three open-source datasets. Isolated analyses assessed performance within individual datasets, using cross-validation techniques. Holdout analyses evaluated cross-dataset generalizability by training models on two datasets and testing on the third, mirroring real-world clinical scenarios. In isolated analyses, 2D ConvKANs achieved the highest AUC of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-0.99) on the PPMI dataset, outperforming 2D CNNs (AUC: 0.97, p = 0.0092). 3D models showed promise, with 3D CNN and 3D ConvKAN reaching an AUC of 0.85 on PPMI. In holdout analyses, 3D ConvKAN demonstrated superior generalization, achieving an AUC of 0.85 on early-stage PD data. GCNs underperformed in 2D but improved in 3D implementations. These findings highlight ConvKANs' potential for PD detection, emphasize the importance of 3D analysis in capturing subtle brain changes, and underscore cross-dataset generalization challenges. This study advances AI-assisted PD diagnosis using structural MRI and emphasizes the need for larger-scale validation.</description>
