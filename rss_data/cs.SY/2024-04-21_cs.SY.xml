      <title>Learning Stable and Passive Neural Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel class of neural differential equation, which are intrinsically Lyapunov stable, exponentially stable or passive. We take a recently proposed Polyak Lojasiewicz network (PLNet) as an Lyapunov function and then parameterize the vector field as the descent directions of the Lyapunov function. The resulting models have a same structure as the general Hamiltonian dynamics, where the Hamiltonian is lower- and upper-bounded by quadratic functions. Moreover, it is also positive definite w.r.t. either a known or learnable equilibrium. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on a damped double pendulum system.</description>

      <title>Emerging NGSO Constellations: Spectral Coexistence with GSO Satellite Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global communications have undergone a paradigm shift with the rapid expansion of low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, offering a new space era of reduced latency and ubiquitous, high-speed broadband internet access. However, the fast developments in LEO orbits pose significant challenges, particularly the coexistence with geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite systems. This article presents an overview of the regulatory aspects that cover the spectrum sharing in the bands allocated to the Fixed Satellite Service between geostationary networks (GSO) and non-geostationary systems (NGSO), as well as the main interference mitigation techniques for their coexistence. Our work highlights the increased potential for inter-system interference. It explores the regulatory landscape following the World Radio Conference (WRC-23). We discuss the different interference management strategies proposed for the GSO-NGSO spectral coexistence, including on-board and ground-based approaches and more advanced mitigation techniques based on beamforming. Moving onto operational aspects related to the sharing of spectrum, we introduce recent work on interference detection, identification, and mitigation and provide our vision of the emerging role of artificial intelligence (AI) in the aforementioned tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the electrification in clay calcination, proposing a dynamic model and energy management strategy for the integration of electrified calcination plants into sustainable power grids. A theoretical dynamic modeling of the electrified calcination process is introduced, aiming at outlining temperature profiles and energy usage - thus exploring the feasibility of electrification. The model serves as a tool for optimizing parameters, estimating system behavior, and enabling model-based process control. An innovative energy management model is also presented, ensuring efficient assimilation of electrified calcination plants into the power grid. It encapsulates demand-supply balancing and optimizes renewable energy usage. In essence, we provide an insightful pathway to a more sustainable cement production, underlining the value of renewable energy sources and effective energy management in the context of clay calcination.</description>

      <title>Towards Accurate and Efficient Sorting of Retired Lithium-ion Batteries: A Data Driven Based Electrode Aging Assessment Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retired batteries (RBs) for second-life applications offer promising economic and environmental benefits. However, accurate and efficient sorting of RBs with discrepant characteristics persists as a pressing challenge. In this study, we introduce a data driven based electrode aging assessment approach to address this concern. To this end, a number of 15 feature points are extracted from battery open circuit voltage (OCV) curves to capture their characteristics at different levels of aging, and a convolutional neural network with an optimized structure and minimized input size is established to relocate the relative positions of these OCV feature points. Next, a rapid estimation algorithm is proposed to identify the three electrode aging parameters (EAPs) which best reconstruct the 15 OCV feature points over the entire usable capacity range. Utilizing the three EAPs as sorting indices, we employ an adaptive affinity propagation algorithm to cluster RBs without the need for pre-determining the clustering number. Unlike conventional sorting methods based solely on battery capacity, the proposed method provides profound insights into electrode aging behaviors, minimizes the need for constant-current charging data, and supports module/pack-level tests for the simultaneous processing of high volumes of RBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate state of power (SOP) estimation is of great importance for lithium-ion batteries in safety-critical and power-intensive applications for electric vehicles. This review article delves deeply into the entire development flow of current SOP estimation technology, offering a systematic breakdown of all key aspects with their recent advancements. First, we review the design of battery safe operation area, summarizing diverse limitation factors and furnishing a profound comprehension of battery safety across a broad operational scale. Second, we illustrate the unique discharge and charge characteristics of various peak operation modes, such as constant current, constant voltage, constant current-constant voltage, and constant power, and explore their impacts on battery peak power performance. Third, we extensively survey the aspects of battery modelling and algorithm development in current SOP estimation technology, highlighting their technical contributions and specific considerations. Fourth, we present an in-depth dissection of all error sources to unveil their propagation pathways, providing insightful analysis into how each type of error impacts the SOP estimation performance. Finally, the technical challenges and complexities inherent in this field of research are addressed, suggesting potential directions for future development. Our goal is to inspire further efforts towards developing more accurate and intelligent SOP estimation technology for next-generation battery management systems.</description>

      <title>Piecewise Semi-Analytical Formulation for the Analysis of Coupled-Oscillator Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new simulation technique to obtain the synchronized steady-state solutions existing in coupled oscillator systems is presented. The technique departs from a semi-analytical formulation presented in previous works. It extends the model of the admittance function describing each individual oscillator to a piecewise linear one. This provides a global formulation of the coupled system, considering the whole characteristic of each voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) in the array. In comparison with the previous local formulation, the new formulation significantly improves the accuracy in the prediction of the system synchronization ranges. The technique has been tested by comparison with computationally demanding circuit-level Harmonic Balance simulations in an array of Van der Pol-type oscillators and then applied to a coupled system of FET based oscillators at 5 GHz, with very good agreement with measurements.</description>

      <title>Leveraging P90 Requirement: Flexible Resources Bidding in Nordic Ancillary Service Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The P90 requirement of the Danish transmission system operator, Energinet, incentivizes flexible resources with stochastic power consumption/production baseline to bid in Nordic ancillary service markets with the minimum reliability of 90%, i.e., letting them cause reserve shortfall with the probability of up to 10%. Leveraging this requirement, we develop a distributionally robust joint chance-constrained optimization model for aggregators of flexible resources to optimize their volume of reserve capacity to be offered. Having an aggregator of electric vehicles as a case study, we show how distributional robustness is key for the aggregator when making bidding decisions in a non-stationary uncertain environment. We also develop a heuristic based on a grid search for the system operator to adjust the P90 requirement and the level of conservativeness, aiming to procure the maximum reserve capacity from stochastic resources with least expected shortfall.</description>

      <title>Aggregator of Electric Vehicles Bidding in Nordic FCR-D Markets: A Chance-Constrained Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, two new innovative regulations in the Nordic ancillary service markets, the P90 rule and LER classification, were introduced to make the market more attractive for flexible stochastic resources. The regulations respectively relax market requirements related to the security and volume of flexible capacity from such resources. However, this incentivizes aggregators to exploit the rules when bidding flexible capacity. Considering the Nordic ancillary service Frequency Containment Reserve - Disturbance (FCR-D), we consider an aggregator with a portfolio of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using real-life data and present an optimization model that, new to the literature, uses Joint Chance-Constraints (JCCs) for bidding its flexible capacity while adhering to the new market regulations. Using different bundle sizes within the portfolio and the approximation methods of the JCCs, ALSO-X and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), we show that a significant synergy effect emerges when aggregating a portfolio of EVs, especially when applying ALSO-X which exploits the rules more than CVaR. We show that EV owners can earn a significant profit when participating in the aggregator portfolio.</description>

      <title>360{\deg} phase detector cell for measurement systems based on switched dual multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a 360{\deg} phase detector cell for performing phase-shift measurements on multiple output systems. An analog phase detector, capable of detecting a maximum range of {\pm}90{\deg}, has been used to perform a double multiplication of two signals, both in-phase and phase-shifted. The proposed solution broadens the frequency range beyond other solutions that require to fulfill the quadrature condition. Subsequently, the possibility of reaching the theoretical limit of phase shift within a hybrid coupler ({\Phi} &lt; 90{\deg} {\pm} 90{\deg}) is discussed by using four straight-line equations to characterize the phase detector response. The proposed solution allows to extend up to 360{\deg} the phase detection range and provide an increased immunity with respect to both impedance mismatching and phase deviations within the hybrid coupler. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed design, a phase detector cell prototype has been implemented using a commercial hybrid coupler with a phase shift of 92.5{\deg} {\pm} 0.5{\deg} at 3.1-5.9 GHz, an external switch and a microcontroller with 2 kB of memory. Measurements show a range of detection of 360{\deg} ({\pm}180{\deg}) across the tested frequency band of 2.7-6 GHz.</description>

      <title>Grid-aware Scheduling and Control of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for Dispatching Active Distribution Networks. Part-I: Day-ahead and Numerical Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a grid-aware scheduling and control framework for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) for dispatching the operation of an active power distribution network. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, we determine an optimal day-ahead power schedule at the grid connection point (GCP), referred to as the dispatch plan. Then, in the second stage, a real-time model predictive control is proposed to track the day-ahead dispatch plan using flexibility from EVCSs. The dispatch plan accounts for the uncertainties of vehicles connected to the EVCS along with other uncontrollable power injections, by day-ahead predicted scenarios. We propose using a Gaussian-Mixture-Model (GMM) for the forecasting of EVCS demand using the historical dataset on arrival, departure times, EV battery capacity, State-of-Charge (SoC) targets, etc. The framework ensures that the grid is operated within its voltage and branches power-flow operational bounds, modeled by a linearized optimal power-flow model, maintaining the tractability of the problem formulation. The scheme is numerically and experimentally validated on a real-life distribution network at the EPFL connected to two EVCSs, two batteries, three photovoltaic plants, and multiple heterogeneous loads. The day-ahead and real-time stages are described in Part-I and Part-II papers respectively.</description>

      <title>Grid-aware Scheduling and Control of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for Dispatching Active Distribution Networks. Part-II: Intra-day and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Part-I, we presented an optimal day-ahead scheduling scheme for dispatching active distribution networks accounting for the flexibility provided by electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) and other controllable resources such as battery energy storage systems (BESSs). Part-II presents the intra-day control layer for tracking the dispatch plan computed from the day-ahead scheduling stage. The control problem is formulated as model predictive control (MPC) with an objective to track the dispatch plan setpoint every 5 minutes, while actuated every 30 seconds. MPC accounts for the uncertainty of the power injections from stochastic resources (such as demand and generation from photovoltaic - PV plants) by short-term forecasts. MPC also accounts for the grid's operational constraints (i.e., the limits on the nodal voltages and the line power-flows) by a linearized optimal power flow (LOPF) model based on the power-flow sensitivity coefficients, and for the operational constraints of the controllable resources (i.e., BESSs and EVCSs). The proposed framework is experimentally validated on a real-life ADN at the EPFL's Distributed Electrical Systems Laboratory and is composed of a medium voltage (MV) bus connected to three low voltage distribution networks. It hosts two controllable EVCSs (172 kWp and 32 F~kWp), multiple PV plants (aggregated generation of 42~kWp), uncontrollable demand from office buildings (20 kWp), and two controllable BESSs (150kW/300kWh and 25kW/25kWh).</description>

      <title>Distributed Model Predictive Control for Heterogeneous Platoons with Affine Spacing Policies and Arbitrary Communication Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm for a heterogeneous platoon using arbitrary communication topologies, as long as each vehicle is able to communicate with a preceding vehicle in the platoon. The proposed DMPC algorithm is able to accommodate any spacing policy that is affine in a vehicle's velocity, which includes constant distance or constant time headway spacing policies. By analyzing the total cost for the entire platoon, a sufficient condition is derived to guarantee platoon asymptotic stability. Simulation experiments with a platoon of 50 vehicles and hardware experiments with a platoon of four 1/10th scale vehicles validate the algorithm and compare performance under different spacing policies and communication topologies.</description>

      <title>Learning a Stable, Safe, Distributed Feedback Controller for a Heterogeneous Platoon of Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platooning of autonomous vehicles has the potential to increase safety and fuel efficiency on highways. The goal of platooning is to have each vehicle drive at some speed (set by the leader) while maintaining a safe distance from its neighbors. Many prior works have analyzed various controllers for platooning, most commonly linear feedback and distributed model predictive controllers. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for learning a stable, safe, distributed controller for a heterogeneous platoon. Our algorithm relies on recent developments in learning neural network stability and safety certificates. We train a controller for autonomous platooning in simulation and evaluate its performance on hardware with a platoon of four F1Tenth vehicles. We then perform further analysis in simulation with a platoon of 100 vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate the practicality of the algorithm and the learned controller by comparing the performance of the neural network controller to linear feedback and distributed model predictive controllers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been growing discussions on estimating and subsequently reducing the operational carbon footprint of enterprise data centers. The design and intelligent control for data centers have an important impact on data center carbon footprint. In this paper, we showcase PyDCM, a Python library that enables extremely fast prototyping of data center design and applies reinforcement learning-enabled control with the purpose of evaluating key sustainability metrics including carbon footprint, energy consumption, and observing temperature hotspots. We demonstrate these capabilities of PyDCM and compare them to existing works in EnergyPlus for modeling data centers. PyDCM can also be used as a standalone Gymnasium environment for demonstrating sustainability-focused data center control.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning via Quadratic Variation Penalty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies continuous-time risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) under the entropy-regularized, exploratory diffusion process formulation with the exponential-form objective. The risk-sensitive objective arises either as the agent's risk attitude or as a distributionally robust approach against the model uncertainty. Owing to the martingale perspective in Jia and Zhou (2023) the risk-sensitive RL problem is shown to be equivalent to ensuring the martingale property of a process involving both the value function and the q-function, augmented by an additional penalty term: the quadratic variation of the value process, capturing the variability of the value-to-go along the trajectory. This characterization allows for the straightforward adaptation of existing RL algorithms developed for non-risk-sensitive scenarios to incorporate risk sensitivity by adding the realized variance of the value process. Additionally, I highlight that the conventional policy gradient representation is inadequate for risk-sensitive problems due to the nonlinear nature of quadratic variation; however, q-learning offers a solution and extends to infinite horizon settings. Finally, I prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm for Merton's investment problem and quantify the impact of temperature parameter on the behavior of the learning procedure. I also conduct simulation experiments to demonstrate how risk-sensitive RL improves the finite-sample performance in the linear-quadratic control problem.</description>

Abstract: Resilient operation of the power system during ongoing wildfires is challenging because of the uncertain ways in which the fires impact the electric power infrastructure (multiple arc-faults, complete melt-down). To address this challenge, we propose a novel cut-set and stability-constrained optimal power flow (OPF) that quickly mitigates both static and dynamic insecurities as wildfires progress through a region. First, a Feasibility Test (FT) algorithm that quickly desaturates overloaded cut-sets to prevent cascading line outages is integrated with the OPF problem. Then, the resulting formulation is combined with a data-driven transient stability analyzer that predicts the correction factors for eliminating dynamic insecurities. The proposed model considers the possibility of generation rescheduling as well as load shed. The results obtained using the IEEE 118-bus system indicate that the proposed approach alleviates vulnerability of the system to wildfires while minimizing operational cost.</description>

Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of solving stochastic optimization problems with a decision-dependent distribution in the setting of stochastic strongly-monotone games and when the distributional dependence is unknown. A two-stage approach is proposed, which initially involves estimating the distributional dependence on decision variables, and subsequently optimizing over the estimated distributional map. The paper presents guarantees for the approximation of the cost of each agent. Furthermore, a stochastic gradient-based algorithm is developed and analyzed for finding the Nash equilibrium in a distributed fashion. Numerical simulations are provided for a novel electric vehicle charging market formulation using real-world data.</description>

      <title>Autonomous vehicle decision and control through reinforcement learning with traffic flow randomization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of the current studies on autonomous vehicle decision-making and control tasks based on reinforcement learning are conducted in simulated environments. The training and testing of these studies are carried out under rule-based microscopic traffic flow, with little consideration of migrating them to real or near-real environments to test their performance. It may lead to a degradation in performance when the trained model is tested in more realistic traffic scenes. In this study, we propose a method to randomize the driving style and behavior of surrounding vehicles by randomizing certain parameters of the car-following model and the lane-changing model of rule-based microscopic traffic flow in SUMO. We trained policies with deep reinforcement learning algorithms under the domain randomized rule-based microscopic traffic flow in freeway and merging scenes, and then tested them separately in rule-based microscopic traffic flow and high-fidelity microscopic traffic flow. Results indicate that the policy trained under domain randomization traffic flow has significantly better success rate and calculative reward compared to the models trained under other microscopic traffic flows.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as chatbots have drawn remarkable attention thanks to their versatile capability in natural language processing as well as in a wide range of tasks. While there has been great enthusiasm towards adopting such foundational model-based artificial intelligence tools in all sectors possible, the capabilities and limitations of such LLMs in improving the operation of the electric energy sector need to be explored, and this article identifies fruitful directions in this regard. Key future research directions include data collection systems for fine-tuning LLMs, embedding power system-specific tools in the LLMs, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-based knowledge pool to improve the quality of LLM responses and LLMs in safety-critical use cases.</description>

      <title>Learning High-Order Control Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical Control with Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have recently introduced a systematic tool to ensure system safety by establishing set invariance. When combined with a nominal control strategy, they form a safety-critical control mechanism. However, the effectiveness of CBFs is closely tied to the system model. In practice, model uncertainty can compromise safety guarantees and may lead to conservative safety constraints, or conversely, allow the system to operate in unsafe regions. In this paper, we use Gaussian processes to mitigate the adverse effects of uncertainty on high-order CBFs (HOCBFs). A properly structured covariance function enables us to convert the chance constraints of HOCBFs into a second-order cone constraint. This results in a convex constrained optimization as a safety filter. We analyze the feasibility of the resulting optimization and provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for feasibility. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated through two numerical results.</description>

      <title>Learning Piecewise Residuals of Control Barrier Functions for Safety of Switching Systems using Multi-Output Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have recently been introduced as a systematic tool to ensure safety by establishing set invariance. When combined with a control Lyapunov function (CLF), they form a safety-critical control mechanism. However, the effectiveness of CBFs and CLFs is closely tied to the system model. In practice, model uncertainty can jeopardize safety and stability guarantees and may lead to undesirable performance. In this paper, we develop a safe learning-based control strategy for switching systems in the face of uncertainty. We focus on the case that a nominal model is available for a true underlying switching system. This uncertainty results in piecewise residuals for each switching surface, impacting the CLF and CBF constraints. We introduce a batch multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) framework to approximate these piecewise residuals, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of uncertainty. A particular structure of the covariance function enables us to convert the MOGP-based chance constraints CLF and CBF into second-order cone constraints, which leads to a convex optimization. We analyze the feasibility of the resulting optimization and provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for feasibility. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated through a simulation of a switching adaptive cruise control system.</description>

      <title>Enhance Low-Carbon Power System Operation via Carbon-Aware Demand Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the electrification process advances, enormous power flexibility is becoming available on the demand side, which can be harnessed to facilitate power system decarbonization. Hence, this paper studies the carbon-aware demand response (C-DR) paradigm, where individual users aim to minimize their carbon footprints through the optimal scheduling of flexible load devices. The specific operational dynamics and constraints of deferrable loads and thermostatically controlled loads are considered, and the carbon emission flow method is employed to determine users' carbon footprints using nodal carbon intensities. Then, an optimal power dispatch model that integrates the C-DR mechanism is proposed for low-carbon power system operation, based on the carbon-aware optimal power flow (C-OPF) method. Two solution algorithms, including a centralized Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) reformulation algorithm and an iterative solution algorithm, are developed to solve the bi-level power dispatch optimization model. Numerical simulations on the IEEE New England 39-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

Abstract: We provide the first known algorithm that provably achieves $\varepsilon$-optimality within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon)$ function evaluations for the discounted discrete-time LQR problem with unknown parameters, without relying on two-point gradient estimates. These estimates are known to be unrealistic in many settings, as they depend on using the exact same initialization, which is to be selected randomly, for two different policies. Our results substantially improve upon the existing literature outside the realm of two-point gradient estimates, which either leads to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ rates or heavily relies on stability assumptions.</description>

      <title>Inverse Cubature and Quadrature Kalman filters</title>

Abstract: Recent research in inverse cognition with cognitive radar has led to the development of inverse stochastic filters that are employed by the target to infer the information the cognitive radar may have learned. Prior works addressed this inverse cognition problem by proposing inverse Kalman filter (I-KF) and inverse extended KF (I-EKF), respectively, for linear and non-linear Gaussian state-space models. However, in practice, many counter-adversarial settings involve highly non-linear system models, wherein EKF's linearization often fails. In this paper, we consider the efficient numerical integration techniques to address such non-linearities and, to this end, develop inverse cubature KF (I-CKF), inverse quadrature KF (I-QKF), and inverse cubature-quadrature KF (I-CQKF). For the unknown system model case, we develop reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)-based CKF. We derive the stochastic stability conditions for the proposed filters in the exponential-mean-squared-boundedness sense and prove the filters' consistency. Numerical experiments demonstrate the estimation accuracy of our I-CKF, I-QKF, and I-CQKF with the recursive Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound as a benchmark.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive Control Barrier Functions for Safety Critical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies safety guarantees for systems with time-varying control bounds. It has been shown that optimizing quadratic costs subject to state and control constraints can be reduced to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs) using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). One of the main challenges in this method is that the CBF-based QP could easily become infeasible under tight control bounds, especially when the control bounds are time-varying. The recently proposed adaptive CBFs have addressed such infeasibility issues, but require extensive and non-trivial hyperparameter tuning for the CBF-based QP and may introduce overshooting control near the boundaries of safe sets. To address these issues, we propose a new type of adaptive CBFs called Auxiliary-Variable Adaptive CBFs (AVCBFs). Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary variable that multiplies each CBF itself, and define dynamics for the auxiliary variable to adapt it in constructing the corresponding CBF constraint. In this way, we can improve the feasibility of the CBF-based QP while avoiding extensive parameter tuning with non-overshooting control since the formulation is identical to classical CBF methods. We demonstrate the advantages of using AVCBFs and compare them with existing techniques on an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) problem with time-varying control bounds.</description>

      <title>Explicit feedback synthesis for nonlinear robust model predictive control driven by quasi-interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present QuIFS (Quasi-Interpolation driven Feedback Synthesis): an offline feedback synthesis algorithm for explicit nonlinear robust minmax model predictive control (MPC) problems with guaranteed quality of approximation. The underlying technique is driven by a particular type of grid-based quasi-interpolation scheme. The QuIFS algorithm departs drastically from conventional approximation algorithms that are employed in the MPC industry (in particular, it is neither based on multi-parametric programming tools and nor does it involve kernel methods), and the essence of its point of departure is encoded in the following challenge-answer approach: Given an error margin $\varepsilon&gt;0$, compute in a single stroke a feasible feedback policy that is uniformly $\varepsilon$-close to the optimal MPC feedback policy for a given nonlinear system subjected to constraints and bounded uncertainties. Closed-loop stability and recursive feasibility under the approximate feedback policy are also established. We provide a library of numerical examples to illustrate our results.</description>

Abstract: The perception of the value and propriety of modern engineered systems is changing. In addition to their functional and extra-functional properties, nowadays' systems are also evaluated by their sustainability properties. The next generation of systems will be characterized by an overall elevated sustainability -- including their post-life, driven by efficient value retention mechanisms. Current systems engineering practices fall short of supporting these ambitions and need to be revised appropriately. In this paper, we introduce the concept of circular systems engineering, a novel paradigm for systems sustainability, and define two principles to successfully implement it: end-to-end sustainability and bipartite sustainability. We outline typical organizational evolution patterns that lead to the implementation and adoption of circularity principles, and outline key challenges and research opportunities.</description>

      <title>Data-Enabled Policy Optimization for Direct Adaptive Learning of the LQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct data-driven design methods for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) mainly use offline or episodic data batches, and their online adaptation has been acknowledged as an open problem. In this paper, we propose a direct adaptive method to learn the LQR from online closed-loop data. First, we propose a new policy parameterization based on the sample covariance to formulate a direct data-driven LQR problem, which is shown to be equivalent to the certainty-equivalence LQR with optimal non-asymptotic guarantees. Second, we design a novel data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO) method to directly update the policy, where the gradient is explicitly computed using only a batch of persistently exciting (PE) data. Third, we establish its global convergence via a projected gradient dominance property. Importantly, we efficiently use DeePO to adaptively learn the LQR by performing only one-step projected gradient descent per sample of the closed-loop system, which also leads to an explicit recursive update of the policy. Under PE inputs and for bounded noise, we show that the average regret of the LQR cost is upper-bounded by two terms signifying a sublinear decrease in time $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ plus a bias scaling inversely with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which are independent of the noise statistics. Finally, we perform simulations to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the computational and sample efficiency of our method.</description>

      <title>Proactive Service Assurance in 5G and B5G Networks: A Closed-Loop Algorithm for End-to-End Network Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The customization of services in Fifth-generation (5G) and Beyond 5G (B5G) networks relies heavily on network slicing, which creates multiple virtual networks on a shared physical infrastructure, tailored to meet specific requirements of distinct applications, using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). It is imperative to ensure that network services meet the performance and reliability requirements of various applications and users, thus, service assurance is one of the critical components in network slicing. One of the key functionalities of network slicing is the ability to scale Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in response to changing resource demand and to meet Customer Service Level agreements (SLAs).
  In this paper, we introduce a proactive closed-loop algorithm for end-to-end network orchestration, designed to provide service assurance in 5G and B5G networks. We focus on dynamically scaling resources to meet key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to each network slice and operate in parallel across multiple slices, making it scalable and capable of managing completely automatically real-time service assurance. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively fulfills service assurance requirements for different network slice types, thereby minimizing network resource utilization and reducing the over-provisioning of spare resources.</description>
