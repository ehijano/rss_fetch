      <title>Demonstrating Dynamic Stability in Paul Traps: Exploring Rotating Saddles with Liquid Nitrogen Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating saddle potentials provide a compelling visual demonstration of dynamic stability, widely used in undergraduate physics as mechanical analogs to the RF Paul trap. Traditional demonstrations typically rely on rolling ball bearings, whose frictional effects and internal rotation obscure fundamental particle dynamics. We introduce a simple yet significant improvement by employing droplets of liquid nitrogen LN2, which levitate via the Leidenfrost effect, eliminating rolling dynamics and greatly reducing friction. LN2 droplets clearly illustrate the rotating ponderomotive-like force, producing trajectories closely consistent with theoretical predictions. Using experimental data, we compare the stability threshold and particle trajectories of LN2 droplets and traditional ball bearings. LN2 droplets exhibit a sharply defined and visually distinct stability threshold, transitioning abruptly from unstable to stable motion at a critical rotation frequency. In contrast, ball bearings demonstrate a more gradual threshold, accompanied by trajectories complicated by friction-induced deviations. We present detailed measurements of particle lifetimes and trajectories as functions of dimensionless stability parameters for both symmetric and intentionally asymmetric saddles. These improvements significantly enhance visual and conceptual clarity, reduce common misconceptions related to frictional dynamics, and provide natural opportunities for exploring related phenomena such as the Leidenfrost effect. We also offer practical guidance on assembling and implementing this enhanced demonstration for effective classroom and laboratory instruction.</description>

      <title>Relative benefits of different active learning methods to conceptual physics learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research has demonstrated that active learning methods are more effective than traditional lecturing at improving student conceptual understanding and reducing failure rates in undergraduate physics courses. Researchers have developed several distinct active learning methods that are now widely implemented in introductory physics; however, the relative benefits of these methods remain unknown. Here we present the first multi-institutional comparison of the impacts of four well-established active learning methods (ISLE, Peer Instruction, Tutorials, and SCALE-UP) on conceptual learning. We also investigate student development of peer networks and the activities that take place during instruction to explain differences in these impacts. Data include student concept inventory scores, peer network surveys, and classroom video recordings from 31 introductory physics and astronomy courses at 28 different institutions in the United States containing a total of 2,855 students. We find measurable increases in student conceptual learning in all four active learning methods (ranging from 2.09-sigma to 6.22-sigma differences from a null effect), and significantly larger conceptual learning gains in SCALE-UP than in both ISLE (2.25-sigma difference) and Peer Instruction (2.54-sigma difference). Conceptual learning gains in Tutorials are not significantly different from those in the other three methods. Despite the hypothesized benefits of student interactions, student development of peer networks is similar across the four methods. Instead, we observe differences in classroom activities; in many of the observed ISLE and Peer Instruction courses, instructors lecture for a large fraction of class time. In Tutorials and SCALE-UP courses, instructors dedicate most in-class time to student-centered activities such as worksheets and laboratory work.</description>

      <title>Inference accuracy about an aircraft crash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Problem-based learning benefits from situations taken from real life, which arouse student interest. The shooting of Rwanda president aircraft on April 6th, 1994 is still unsolved. We discuss the methods to infer information and conclusions about where the aircraft was shot and its trajectory during its fall, as well as about the place from which the missiles were launched, and their trajectory and type. To this goal, we compiled expert reports, witness indications and other public sources, then translated plain language sentences into quantitative equalities and inequalities applied to geometry and mechanics at undergraduate level. The accuracy of each result is discussed and propagated in order to ensure a proper assessment of the hypotheses and a traceability of their consequences. Overall, the accuracy discussion can train the students critical mind, and teach inference methods which are routinely used in several fields of physics research. In addition, it demonstrates the importance and limits of scientific expertise during a judiciary process.</description>
