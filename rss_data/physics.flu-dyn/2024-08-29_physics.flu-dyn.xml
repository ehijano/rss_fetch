      <title>How does vortex dynamics help undulating bodies spread odor?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the coupling between odor dynamics and vortex dynamics around undulating bodies, with a focus on bio-inspired propulsion mechanisms. Utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with an in-house Immersed-Boundary Method (IBM) solver, we investigate how different waveform patterns, specifically carangiform and anguilliform, influence the dispersion of chemical cues in both water and air environments. Our findings reveal that vortex dynamics significantly impact the overall trajectory of odor spots, although the alignment between odor spots and coherent flow structures is not always precise. We also evaluate the relative contributions of diffusion and convection in odor transport, showing that convection dominates in water, driven by higher Schmidt numbers, while diffusion plays a more prominent role alongside convection in air. Additionally, the anguilliform waveform generally produces stronger and farther-reaching chemical cues compared to carangiform swimmers. The critical roles of Strouhal number and Reynolds number in determining the efficiency of odor dispersion are also explained, offering insights that could enhance the design of more efficient, adaptive, and intelligent autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) by integrating sensory and hydrodynamic principles inspired by fish locomotion.</description>

      <title>Controlling Tip Vortices and Cavitation through Tip Permeability for Tidal Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blade-tip vortices can lead to wakes, cavitation and noise, and their control remains a significant challenge for tidal and wind turbines. In the present work, we propose and investigate controlling tip vortices through local permeability. Blade-resolved Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulation has been employed on a model-scale horizontal-axis turbine, following a rigorous validation and verification process. The tip-speed ratio of the turbine varies from 4.52 to 7.54. The tip permeability is modelled by including a porous zone over the blade tip section, within which Darcy's law is applied. The results demonstrate that there is an optimal range of permeability, corresponding to a non-dimensional Darcy number, Da, of around 10^{-5}, that can substantially decrease the tip vortex intensity. The revealed flow physics show that the permeable tip treatment can effectively enlarge the vortex viscous core radius with little change to the vortex circulation. As the tip vortex intensity is significantly reduced, the permeable tip treatment can increase the minimal pressure-coefficient at the vortex core by up to 63%, which significantly alleviates the cavitation risk due to tip vortices. This approach has negligible influence on the turbine's energy-harvesting performance because the spanwise extent of the permeable tip treatment is only in the order of 0.1% turbine diameter. Our findings demonstrate this approach's great promise to break the upper tip-speed ratio limit capped by cavitation for tidal turbines. These will contribute to developing more efficient and resilient turbines.</description>

      <title>Unsteady Load Mitigation through Passive Pitch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigation of load fluctuations due to flow unsteadiness is critical in a broad range of applications, including wind/tidal turbines, and aerial/underwater vehicles. While the use of active control systems is an established practice in engineering, passive systems are not well understood, and the limits of their efficacy are yet to be ascertained. To this end, the present study aims to provide new insights into the effectiveness of passive pitching in the mitigation of lift fluctuations in the most demanding case of fast, high-amplitude variations of the free stream speed and direction. We perform fluid-structure interaction simulations of a two-dimensional free-to-pitch rigid foil. Our study reveals that the lift amplitude of the force fluctuations can be decreased by at least two-thirds through passive pitching. The efficacy of the unsteady load mitigation is only weakly dependent on the exact pitching axis location, and the optimal position is upstream and close to the axis of the foil. These results may inform the design of passive control systems of wind/tidal turbines and aerial/underwater vehicles and provide new insights into interpreting the control strategy of natural flyers such as insects and birds.</description>

      <title>Physical Similarity of Fluid Flow in Bimodal Porous Media: Part 1 -- Basic Model and Solution Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid flow through bimodal porous media, characterized by a distinct separation in pore size distribution, is critical in various scientific and engineering applications, including groundwater management, oil and gas production, and carbon sequestration. This note delves into the physical similarity of fluid flow within such media, bridging the gap between microscale phenomena and macroscale observations. We present a representative mathematical model that conceptualizes bimodal porous media as a double-continuum system, distinguishing between macroporous and microporous regions. The model captures the complex interactions between these regions, particularly focusing on the challenges of modeling fluid flow when there is significant disparity in pore sizes. By employing a heuristic approach grounded in pore-scale tomography, we derive governing equations that describe fluid flow and analyze the solution characteristics. The results reveal unique features of the fluid flow in bimodal systems, such as the occurrence of boundary discontinuities and the delayed transient response, which are not observed in conventional porous media. This work provides ground for further studies in bimodal porous media, offering insights that could enhance predictive modeling and optimization in various applications concerning porous media with similar bimodal pore size distributions.</description>

      <title>Experimental validation of a linear momentum and bluff-body model for high-blockage cross-flow turbine arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance and near-wake characteristics of a turbine in a confined flow depend on the blockage ratio, defined as the ratio of the turbine projected area to the channel cross-sectional area. While blockage is understood to increase the power coefficient for turbine "fences" spanning a channel, most investigations at the upper range of practically-achievable blockage ratios have been theoretical or numerical in nature. Furthermore, while linear momentum actuator disk theory is frequently used to model turbines in confined flows, as confinement increases, the ability of this idealized model to describe performance and flow fields has not been established. In this work, the performance and near-wake flow field of a pair of cross-flow turbines are experimentally evaluated at blockage ratios from 30% to 55%. The fluid velocity measured in the bypass region is found to be well-predicted by the open-channel linear momentum model developed by Houlsby et al. (2008), while the wake velocity is not. Additionally, self-similar power and thrust coefficients are identified across this range of blockage ratios when array performance is scaled by the modeled bypass velocity following Whelan et al.'s (2009) adaptation of the bluff-body theory of Maskell (1963). This result demonstrates that, despite multiple non-idealities, relatively simple models can quantitatively describe highly confined turbines. From this, an analytical method for predicting array performance as a function of blockage is presented. Overall, this work illustrates turbine performance at relatively high confinement and demonstrates the suitability of analytical models to predict and interpret their hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Classifying acoustic cavitation with machine learning trained on multiple physical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic cavitation refers to the formation and oscillation of microbubbles in a liquid exposed to acoustic waves. Depending on the properties of the liquid and the parameters of the acoustic waves, bubbles behave differently. The two main regimes of bubble dynamics are transient cavitation, where a bubble collapses violently, and stable cavitation, where a bubble undergoes periodic oscillations. Predicting these regimes under specific sonication conditions is important in biomedical ultrasound and sonochemistry. For these predictions to be helpful in practical settings, they must be precise and computationally efficient. In this study, we have used machine learning techniques to predict the cavitation regimes of air bubble nuclei in a liquid. The supervised machine learning was trained by solving three differential equations for bubble dynamics, namely the Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis, and Gilmore equations. These equations were solved for a range of initial parameters, including temperature, bubble radius, acoustic pressure, and frequency. Four different classifiers were developed to label each simulation as either stable or transient cavitation. Subsequently, four different machine-learning strategies were designed to analyze the likelihood of transient or stable cavitation for a given set of acoustic and material parameters. Cross-validation on held-out test data shows a high accuracy of the machine learning predictions. The results indicate that machine learning models trained on physics-based simulations can reliably predict cavitation behavior across a wide range of conditions relevant to real-world applications. This approach can be employed to optimize device settings and protocols used in imaging, therapeutic ultrasound, and sonochemistry.</description>

      <title>Estimating Dynamic Flow Features in Groups of Tracked Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpreting motion captured in image sequences is crucial for a wide range of computer vision applications. Typical estimation approaches include optical flow (OF), which approximates the apparent motion instantaneously in a scene, and multiple object tracking (MOT), which tracks the motion of subjects over time. Often, the motion of objects in a scene is governed by some underlying dynamical system which could be inferred by analyzing the motion of groups of objects. Standard motion analyses, however, are not designed to intuit flow dynamics from trajectory data, making such measurements difficult in practice. The goal of this work is to extend gradient-based dynamical systems analyses to real-world applications characterized by complex, feature-rich image sequences with imperfect tracers. The tracer trajectories are tracked using deep vision networks and gradients are approximated using Lagrangian gradient regression (LGR), a tool designed to estimate spatial gradients from sparse data. From gradients, dynamical features such as regions of coherent rotation and transport barriers are identified. The proposed approach is affordably implemented and enables advanced studies including the motion analysis of two distinct object classes in a single image sequence. Two examples of the method are presented on data sets for which standard gradient-based analyses do not apply.</description>

      <title>Convective Instability Driven by Diffusiophoresis of Colloids in Binary Liquid Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a binary fluid mixture, the concentration gradient of a heavier molecular solute leads to a diffusive flux of solvent and solute to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium. If the solute concentration decreases with height, the system is always in a condition of stable mechanical equilibrium against gravity. We show experimentally that this mechanical equilibrium becomes unstable in case colloidal particles are dispersed uniformly within the mixture, and that the resulting colloidal suspension undergoes a transient convective instability with the onset of convection patterns. By means of a numerical analysis, we clarify the microscopic mechanism from which the observed destabilisation process originates. The solute concentration gradient drives an upward diffusiophoretic migration of colloids, in turn causing the development of a mechanically unstable layer within the sample, where the density of the suspension increases with height. Convective motions arise to minimize this localized rise in gravitational potential energy.</description>

      <title>Evaporation-driven tear film thinning and breakup in two space dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaporation profiles have a strong effect on tear film thinning and breakup (TBU), a key factor in dry eye disease (DED). In experiments, TBU is typically seen to occur in patterns that locally can be circular (spot), linear (streak), or intermediate . We investigate a two-dimensional (2D) model of localized TBU using a Fourier spectral collocation method to observe how the evaporation distribution affects the resulting dynamics of tear film thickness and osmolarity, among other variables. We find that the dynamics are not simply an addition of individual 1D solutions of independent TBU events, and we show how the TBU quantities of interest vary continuously from spots to streaks for the shape of the evaporation distribution. We also find a significant speedup by using a proper orthogonal decomposition to reduce the dimension of the numerical system. The speedup will be especially useful for future applications of the model to inverse problems, allowing the clinical observation at scale of quantities that are thought to be important to DED but not directly measurable in vivo within TBU locales.</description>

      <title>Data-driven reduced order modeling of a two-layer quasi-geostrophic ocean model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-layer quasi-geostrophic equations (2QGE) is a simplified model that describes the dynamics of a stratified, wind-driven ocean in terms of potential vorticity and stream function. Its numerical simulation is plagued by a high computational cost due to the size of the typical computational domain and the need for high resolution to capture the full spectrum of turbulent scales. In this paper, we present a data-driven reduced order model (ROM) for the 2QGE that drastically reduces the computational time to predict ocean dynamics, especially when there are variable physical parameters. The main building blocks of our ROM are: i) proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and ii) long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. Snapshots data are collected from a high-resolution simulation for part of the time interval of interest and for given parameter values in the case of variable parameters. POD is applied to each field variable to extract the dominant modes and a LSTM model is trained on the modal coefficients associated with the snapshots for each variable. Then, the trained LSTM models predict the modal coefficients for the remaining part of the time interval of interest and for a new parameter value. To illustrate the predictive performance of our POD-LSTM ROM and the corresponding time savings, we consider an extension of the so-called double-gyre wind forcing test. We show that the POD-LSTM ROM is accurate in predicting both time-averaged fields and time-dependent quantities (modal coefficients, enstrophy, and kinetic energy), even when retaining only 10-20\% of the singular value energy of the system. The computational speed up for the prediction is about up to 1E+07 compared to a finite volume based full order method.</description>

      <title>An experimental evaluation of the interplay between geometry and scale on cross-flow turbine performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cross-flow turbines harness kinetic energy in wind or moving water. Due to their unsteady fluid dynamics, it can be difficult to predict the interplay between aspects of rotor geometry and turbine performance. This study considers the effects of three geometric parameters: the number of blades, the preset pitch angle, and the chord-to-radius ratio. The relevant fluid dynamics of cross-flow turbines are reviewed, as are prior experimental studies that have investigated these parameters in a more limited manner. Here, 223 unique experiments are conducted across an order of magnitude of diameter-based Reynolds numbers ($\approx 8\!\times\!10^4 - 8\!\times\!10^5$) in which the performance implications of these three geometric parameters are evaluated. In agreement with prior work, maximum performance is generally observed to increase with Reynolds number and decrease with blade count. The broader experimental space clarifies parametric interdependencies; for example, the optimal preset pitch angle is increasingly negative as the chord-to-radius ratio increases. As these experiments vary both the chord-to-radius ratio and blade count, the performance of different rotor geometries with the same solidity (the ratio of total blade chord to rotor circumference) can also be evaluated. Results demonstrate that while solidity can be a poor predictor of maximum performance, across all scales and tested geometries it is an excellent predictor of the tip-speed ratio corresponding to maximum performance. Overall, these results present a uniquely holistic view of relevant geometric considerations for cross-flow turbine rotor design and provide a rich dataset for validation of numerical simulations and reduced-order models.</description>

      <title>From zero-mode intermittency to hidden symmetry in random scalar advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The statistical behavior of scalars passively advected by random flows exhibits intermittency in the form of anomalous multiscaling, in many ways similar to the patterns commonly observed in incompressible high-Reynolds fluids. This similarity suggests a generic dynamical mechanism underlying intermittency, though its specific nature remains unclear. Scalar turbulence is framed in a linear setting that points towards a zero-mode scenario connecting anomalous scaling to the presence of statistical conservation laws; the duality is fully substantiated within Kraichnan theory of random flows. However, extending the zero-mode scenario to nonlinear settings faces formidable technical challenges. Here, we revisit the scalar problem in the light of a hidden symmetry scenario introduced in recent deterministic turbulence studies addressing the Sabra shell model and the Navier-Stokes equations. Hidden symmetry uses a rescaling strategy based entirely on symmetry considerations, transforming the original dynamics into a rescaled (hidden) system; It ultimately identifies the scaling exponents as the eigenvalues of a Perron-Frobenius operator acting on invariant measures of the rescaled equations. Considering a minimal shell model of scalar advection of the Kraichnan type that was previously studied by Biferale &amp; Wirth, the present work extends the hidden symmetry approach to a stochastic setting, in order to explicitly contrast it with the zero-mode scenario. Our study indicates that the zero-mode and the multiplicative scenarios are intrinsically related. For systems of the Kraichnan type, the first approach provides a quantitative chararacterization of intermittency, while the second approach highlights the universal connection between the scalar case and a larger class of hydrodynamic models.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Viscoelastic Fluids via Energy-Based Kernel Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to measure differences in collected data is of fundamental importance for quantitative science and machine learning, motivating the establishment of metrics grounded in physical principles. In this study, we focus on the development of such metrics for viscoelastic fluid flows governed by a large class of linear and nonlinear stress models. To do this, we introduce a kernel function corresponding to a given viscoelastic stress model that implicitly embeds flowfield snapshots into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) whose squared norm equals the total mechanical energy. Working implicitly with lifted representations in the RKHS via the kernel function provides natural and unambiguous metrics for distances and angles between flowfields without the need for hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we present a solution to the preimage problem for our kernels, enabling accurate reconstruction of flowfields from their RKHS representations. Through numerical experiments on an unsteady viscoelastic lid-driven cavity flow, we demonstrate the utility of our kernels for extracting energetically-dominant coherent structures in viscoelastic flows across a range of Reynolds and Weissenberg numbers. Specifically, the features extracted by Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) of flowfield snapshots using our kernel functions yield reconstructions with superior accuracy in terms of mechanical energy compared to conventional methods such as ordinary Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with na\"ively-defined state vectors or KPCA with ad-hoc choices of kernel functions. Our findings underscore the importance of principled choices of metrics in both scientific and machine learning investigations of complex fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Fully quantum algorithm for lattice Boltzmann methods with application to partial differential equations</title>

Abstract: Fluid flow simulations marshal our most powerful computational resources. In many cases, even this is not enough. Quantum computers provide an opportunity to speed up traditional algorithms for flow simulations. We show that lattice-based mesoscale numerical methods can be executed as efficient quantum algorithms due to their statistical features. This approach revises a quantum algorithm for lattice gas automata to reduce classical computations and state preparation at every time step. For this, the algorithm approximates the qubit relative phases and subtracts them at the end of each time step. Phases are evaluated using the iterative phase estimation algorithm and subtracted using single-qubit rotation phase gates. This method optimizes the quantum resource required and makes it more appropriate for near-term quantum hardware. We also demonstrate how the checkerboard deficiency that the D1Q2 scheme presents can be resolved using the D1Q3 scheme. The algorithm is validated by simulating two canonical PDEs: the diffusion and Burgers' equations on different quantum simulators. We find good agreement between quantum simulations and classical solutions for the presented algorithm.</description>

      <title>Twisting in Hamiltonian Flows and Perfect Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of stability for non-autonomous Hamiltonian flows on two-dimensional annular surfaces. This notion of stability is designed to capture the sustained twisting of particle trajectories. The main Theorem is applied to establish a number of results that reveal a form of irreversibility in the Euler equations governing the motion of an incompressible and inviscid fluid. In particular, we show that nearby general stable steady states (i) all fluid flows exhibit indefinite twisting (ii) vorticity generically exhibits gradient growth and wandering. We also give examples of infinite time gradient growth for smooth solutions to the SQG equation and of smooth vortex patches that entangle and develop unbounded perimeter in infinite time.</description>
