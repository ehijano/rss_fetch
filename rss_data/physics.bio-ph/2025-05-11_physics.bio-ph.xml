      <title>Self-reorganization and Information Transfer in Massive Schools of Fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable cohesion and coordination observed in moving animal groups and their collective responsiveness to threats are thought to be mediated by scale-free correlations, where changes in the behavior of one animal influence others in the group, regardless of the distance between them. But are these features independent of group size? Here, we investigate group cohesiveness and collective responsiveness in computational models of massive schools of fish of up to 50,000 individuals. We show that as the number of swimmers increases, flow interactions destabilize the school, creating clusters that constantly fragment, disperse, and regroup, similar to their biological counterparts. We calculate the spatial correlation and speed of information propagation in these dynamic clusters. Spatial correlations in cohesive and polarized clusters are indeed scale free, much like in natural animal groups, but fragmentation events are preceded by a decrease in correlation length, thus diminishing the group's collective responsiveness, leaving it more vulnerable to predation events. Importantly, in groups undergoing collective turns, the information about the change in direction propagates linearly in time among group members, thanks to the non-reciprocal nature of the visual interactions between individuals. Merging speeds up the transfer of information within each cluster by several fold, while fragmentation slows it down. Our findings suggest that flow interactions may have played an important role in group size regulation, behavioral adaptations, and dispersion in living animal groups.</description>

      <title>Finite Membrane Thickness Influences Hydrodynamics on the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many lipid membrane-mediated transport processes--such as mechanically-gated channel activation and solute transport--involve structural and dynamical features on membrane thickness length scales. Most existing membrane models, however, tend to adopt (quasi-)two-dimensional descriptions that neglect thickness-dependent phenomena relevant to internal membrane mechanics, and thus do not fully account for the complex coupling of lipid membranes with their surrounding fluid media. Therefore, explicitly incorporating membrane thickness effects in lipid membrane models will enable a more accurate description of the influence of membrane/fluid coupling on transport phenomena in the vicinity of the bilayer surfaces. Here, we present a continuum model for membrane fluctuations that accounts for finite membrane thickness and resolves hydrodynamic interactions between the bilayer and its surrounding fluid. By applying linear response analysis, we observe that membrane thickness-mediated effects, such as bending-induced lipid reorientations, can generate shear flows close to the membrane surface that slow down the relaxation of nanometer scale shape fluctuations. Additionally, we reveal the emergence of pressure inversion and flow reversal near the membrane interfaces, accompanied by localized stagnation points. Among these, extensional stagnation points give rise to a novel mode of bulk dissipation, originating from bending-induced compression and expansion of the membrane surfaces and their coupling to shear stresses in the fluid. Our findings identify membrane thickness as a key factor in nanoscale hydrodynamics and suggest that its effects may be detectable in fluctuation spectra and can be relevant to interfacial processes such as solute permeability and contact with solid boundaries or other membranes.</description>

      <title>Control of encounter kinetics by chemically active droplets</title>

Abstract: Biomolecular condensates play a crucial role in the spatial organization of living matter. These membrane-less organelles, resulting from liquid-liquid phase separation, operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium, with their size and stability influenced by non-equilibrium chemical reactions. While condensates are frequently considered optimized nanoreactors that enhance molecular encounters, their actual impact on reaction kinetics remains unclear due to competing effects such as diffusion hindrance, and random trapping in non-specific condensates. In this study, we develop a microscopic, stochastic model for chemically active droplets, incorporating reaction-driven modulation of protein interactions. Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate how protein interactions and active coupling to a free energy reservoir influence phase separation, molecular transport and reaction kinetics. We demonstrate that the intensity of the chemical drive governs surface dynamics, generating fluxes that modulate bimolecular reaction rates. Comparing active emulsions to homogeneous systems, we reveal that condensates can either accelerate or decelerate molecular encounters. Our findings provide key insights into the role of biomolecular condensates as potential regulators of intracellular reaction kinetics.</description>

      <title>Controlling the morphologies and dynamics in three-dimensional tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of factors, such as, cell-cell interactions and self-propulsion of cells driven by cytoskeletal forces determine tissue morphologies and dynamics. To explore the interplay between these factors in controlling the dynamics at the tissue scale, we created a minimal three dimensional model in which short-range repulsive elastic forces account for cell-cell interactions. Self-propulsion is modeled as active uncorrelated random stochastic forces, with strength $\mu$, that act on individual cells and is the only source of cell motility. Strikingly, variations in polydispersity in cell sizes ($\Sigma$) and cell elasticity ($E$), results in the formation of a variety of distinct ``phases", driven entirely by $\mu$. At low $E$, the tissue behaves like a liquid, at all values of $\Sigma$, whereas at high $E$ and $\Sigma$, it has the characteristics of a glass. The tissue crystallizes at low $\Sigma$ provided $E$ exceeds a critical value. Over a narrow range of $E$ and $\Sigma$, that lies between the boundaries of the liquid and glass phase, the effective viscosity increases like in a glass as the cell density increases and saturates as the cells are compressed beyond a certain value, creating the viscosity saturation (VS) phase. The VS phase does not form in systems at finite temperature in which the dynamics satisfies the Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem. In the glass phase, the tissue exhibits aging (relaxation times depend on the waiting time) behavior at high $E$ values. Our findings provide a framework for designing tissues with tunable material properties by controlling the physical characteristics of cells.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Model for the Emergence of Natural Selection in Prebiotic Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simplified thermodynamic model for the emergence of natural selection in prebiotic systems, grounded in the dynamics of energy flow through reaction chains. The model captures the persistence or collapse of chemical systems as a function of environmental energy input, internal energy use, and stored energy buffering. We formalize this through a reaction viability inequality and extend it to incorporate entropy export and diffusion constraints, yielding a general framework for prebiotic persistence under non-equilibrium conditions. A thermal cycling scenario on early Earth is used to illustrate how energy-aligned systems can survive fluctuating input, while less compatible systems collapse. This framework offers a physically grounded precursor to Darwinian selection, suggesting that abiogenesis may emerge not as a rare event, but as a statistically favored outcome in environments where energy and entropy dynamics permit structural persistence.</description>

      <title>Locomotion of Active Polymerlike Worms in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the locomotion of thin, living T. tubifex worms, which display active polymerlike behavior, within quasi-2D arrays of cylindrical pillars, examining varying spatial arrangements and densities. These active worms spread in crowded environments, with a dynamics dependent on both the concentration and arrangement of obstacles. In contrast to passive polymers, our results reveal that in disordered configurations, increasing the pillar density enhances the long-time diffusion of our active polymer-like worms, while we observe the opposite trend in ordered pillar arrays. We found that in disordered media, living worms reptate through available curvilinear tubes, whereas they become trapped within pores of ordered media. Intriguingly, we show that reducing the worm's activity significantly boosts its spread, enabling passive sorting of worms by activity level. Our experimental observations are corroborated through simulations of the tangentially driven polymer model with matched persistence length predicting the same trends.</description>
