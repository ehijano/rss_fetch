      <title>Toward genuine efficiency and cluster robustness of preconditioned CG-like eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of eigenvalue problem solvers (eigensolvers) depends on various factors such as preconditioning and eigenvalue distribution. Developing stable and rapidly converging vectorwise eigensolvers is a crucial step in improving the overall efficiency of their blockwise implementations. The present paper is concerned with the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method for Hermitian eigenvalue problems, and motivated by two recently proposed alternatives for its single-vector version LOPCG. A common basis of these eigensolvers is the well-known CG method for linear systems. However, the optimality of CG search directions cannot perfectly be transferred to CG-like eigensolvers. In particular, while computing clustered eigenvalues, LOPCG and its alternatives suffer from frequent delays, leading to a staircase-shaped convergence behavior which cannot be explained by the existing estimates. Keeping this in mind, we construct a class of cluster robust vector iterations where LOPCG is replaced by asymptotically equivalent two-term recurrences and the search directions are timely corrected by selecting a far previous iterate as augmentation. The new approach significantly reduces the number of required steps and the total computational time.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear parametrization solver for fractional Burgers equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional Burgers equations pose substantial challenges for classical numerical methods due to the combined effects of nonlocality and shock-forming nonlinear dynamics. In particular, linear approximation frameworks-such as spectral, finite-difference, or discontinuous Galerkin methods-often suffer from Gibbs-type oscillations or require carefully tuned stabilization mechanisms, whose effectiveness degrades in transport-dominated and long-time integration regimes. In this work, we introduce a sequential-in-time nonlinear parametrization (STNP) for solving fractional Burgers equations, including models with a fractional Laplacian or with nonlocal nonlinear fluxes. The solution is represented by a nonlinear parametric ansatz, and the parameter evolution is obtained by projecting the governing dynamics onto the tangent space of the parameter manifold through a regularized least-squares formulation at each time step. This yields a well-posed and stable time-marching scheme that preserves causality and avoids global-in-time optimization. We provide a theoretical analysis of the resulting projected dynamics, including a stability estimate and an a posteriori error bound that explicitly decomposes the total error into contributions from initial condition fitting, projection residuals, and discretization of fractional operators. Our analysis clarifies the stabilizing role of regularization and quantifies its interaction with the nonlocal discretization error. Numerical experiments for both fractional Burgers models demonstrate that STNP achieves oscillation-free shock resolution and accurately captures long-time dynamics. The method consistently outperforms high-order spectral schemes augmented with spectral vanishing viscosity, while requiring significantly fewer degrees of freedom and avoiding ad hoc stabilization.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multi-Grade Deep Learning for Highly Oscillatory Fredholm Integral Equations of the Second Kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the use of Multi-Grade Deep Learning (MGDL) for solving highly oscillatory Fredholm integral equations of the second kind. We provide rigorous error analyses of continuous and discrete MGDL models, showing that the discrete model retains the convergence and stability of its continuous counterpart under sufficiently small quadrature error. We identify the DNN training error as the primary source of approximation error, motivating a novel adaptive MGDL algorithm that selects the network grade based on training performance. Numerical experiments with highly oscillatory (including wavenumber 500) and singular solutions confirm the accuracy, effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>The explicit constraint force method for optimal experimental design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explicit constraint force method (ECFM) was recently introduced as a novel formulation of the physics-informed solution reconstruction problem, and was subsequently extended to inverse problems. In both solution reconstruction and inverse problems, model parameters are estimated with the help of measurement data. In practice, experimentalists seek to design experiments such that the acquired data leads to the most robust recovery of the missing parameters in a subsequent inverse problem. While there are well-established techniques for designing experiments with standard approaches to the inverse problem, optimal experimental design (OED) has yet to be explored with the ECFM formulation. In this work, we investigate OED with a constraint force objective. First, we review traditional approaches to OED based on the Fisher information matrix, and propose an analogous formulation based on constraint forces. Next, we reflect on the different interpretations of the objective from standard and constraint force-based inverse problems. We then test our method on several example problems. These examples suggest that an experiment which is optimal in the sense of constraint forces tends to position measurements in the stiffest regions of the system. Because the responses -- and thus the measurements -- are small in these regions, this strategy is impractical in the presence of measurement noise and/or finite measurement precision. As such, our provisional conclusion is that ECFM is not a viable approach to OED.</description>

      <title>An HHT-$\alpha$-based finite element framework for wave propagation in constitutively nonlinear elastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a computational framework for modeling wave propagation in geometrically linear elastic materials characterized by algebraically nonlinear constitutive relations. We derive a specific form of the nonlinear wave equation in which the nonlinearity explicitly appears in the time-derivative terms that govern the evolution of the mechanical fields. The numerical solution is established using a fully discrete formulation that combines the standard finite element method for spatial discretization with the implicit Hilber-Hughes-Taylor (HHT)-$\alpha$ scheme for time integration. To address the nonlinear nature of the discrete system, we employ Newton's method to iteratively solve the linearized equations at each time step. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed framework are rigorously verified through convergence analyses, which demonstrate optimal convergence rates in both space and time. Furthermore, a detailed parametric study is conducted to elucidate the influence of the model's constitutive parameters. The results reveal that the magnitude parameter of the stress-dependent variation in wave speed leads to wavefront steepening and the formation of shock discontinuities. Conversely, the exponent parameter acts as a nonlinearity filter; high values suppress nonlinear effects in small-strain regimes, whereas low values allow significant dispersive behavior. This work provides a validated tool for analyzing shock formation in advanced nonlinear materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute numerically the $L^2$ Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund constants of cubature rules, with a special attention to their role in polynomial approximation by orthogonal bases. We test some relevant rules on domains such as the interval, the square, the disk, the triangle, the cube and the sphere. The approximation power of the corresponding least squares (LS) projection is compared with standard hyperinterpolation and its recently proposed ``exactness-relaxed'' version. The Matlab codes used for these tests are available in open-source form.</description>

      <title>A finite element method preserving the eigenvalue range of symmetric tensor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a finite element method that preserves (at the degrees of freedom) the eigenvalue range of the solution of tensor-valued time-dependent convection--diffusion equations. Starting from a high-order spatial baseline discretisation (in this case, the CIP stabilised finite element method), our approach formulates the fully discrete problem as a variational inequality posed on a closed convex set of tensor-valued functions that respect the same eigenvalue bounds at their degrees of freedom. The numerical realisation of the scheme relies on the definition of a projection that, at each node, performs the diagonalisation of the tensor and then truncates the eigenvalues to lie within the prescribed bounds. The temporal discretisation is carried out using the implicit Euler method, and unconditional stability and optimal-order error estimates are proven for this choice. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and illustrate the method's ability to maintain eigenvalue constraints while accurately approximating solutions in the convection-dominated regime.</description>

      <title>Virtual Element methods for non-Newtonian shear-thickening fluid flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis for Virtual Element discretizations of incompressible non-Newtonian flows governed by the Carreau-Yasuda constitutive law, in the shear-thickening regime (r &gt; 2) including both degenerate (delta = 0) and non-degenerate (delta &gt; 0) cases. The proposed Virtual Element method features two distinguishing advantages: the construction of an exactly divergence-free discrete velocity field and compatibility with general polygonal meshes. The analysis presented in this work extends a previous work, where only shear-thinning behavior (1 &lt; r &lt; 2) was considered. Indeed, the theoretical analysis of the shear-thickening setting requires several novel analytical tools, including: an inf-sup stability analysis of the discrete velocity-pressure coupling in non-Hilbertian norms, a stabilization term specifically designed to address the nonlinear structure as the exponent r &gt; 2; and the introduction of a suitable discrete norm tailored to the underlying nonlinear constitutive relation. Numerical results demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Guided Variational Network for Image Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cartoon-texture image decomposition is a critical preprocessing problem bottlenecked by the numerical intractability of classical variational or optimization models and the tedious manual tuning of global regularization parameters.We propose a Guided Variational Decomposition (GVD) model which introduces spatially adaptive quadratic norms whose pixel-wise weights are learned either through local probabilistic statistics or via a lightweight neural network within a bilevel framework.This leads to a unified, interpretable, and computationally efficient model that bridges classical variational ideas with modern adaptive and data-driven methodologies. Numerical experiments on this framework, which inherently includes automatic parameter selection, delivers GVD as a robust, self-tuning, and superior solution for reliable image decomposition.</description>

      <title>A simple rigorous integrator for semilinear parabolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of the dynamics generated by partial differential equations (PDEs) provide approximate, numerical solutions to initial value problems. Such simulations are ubiquitous in scientific computing, but the correctness of the results is usually not guaranteed. We propose a new method for the rigorous integration of parabolic PDEs, i.e., the derivation of rigorous and explicit error bounds between the numerically obtained approximate solution and the exact one, which is then proven to exist over the entire time interval considered. These guaranteed error bounds are obtained a posteriori, using a fixed point reformulation based on a piece-wise in time constant approximation of the linearization around the numerical solution. Our setup leads to relatively simple-to-understand estimates, which has several advantages. Most critically, it allows us to optimize various aspects of the proof, and in particular to provide an adaptive time-stepping strategy. In case the solution converges to a stable hyperbolic equilibrium, we are also able to prove this convergence, applying our rigorous integrator with a final, infinitely long timestep. We showcase the ability of our method to rigorously integrate over relatively long time intervals, and to capture non-trivial dynamics, via examples on the Swift--Hohenberg equation, the Ohta--Kawasaki equation and the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation. We expect that the simplicity and efficiency of the approach will enable generalization to a wide variety of other parabolic PDEs, as well as applications to boundary value problems.</description>

      <title>Variable Projection Methods for Solving Regularized Separable Inverse Problems with Applications to Semi-Blind Image Deblurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separable nonlinear least squares problems appear in many inverse problems, including semi-blind image deblurring. The variable projection (VarPro) method provides an efficient approach for solving such problems by eliminating linear variables and reducing the problem to a smaller, nonlinear one. In this work, we extend VarPro to solve minimization problems containing a differentiable regularization term on the nonlinear parameters, along with a general-form Tikhonov regularization term on the linear variables. Furthermore, we develop a quasi-Newton method for solving the resulting reduced problem, and provide a local convergence analysis under standard smoothness assumptions, establishing conditions for superlinear or quadratic convergence. For large-scale settings, we introduce an inexact LSQR-based variant and prove its local convergence despite inner-solve and Hessian approximations. Numerical experiments on semi-blind deblurring show that parameter regularization prevents degenerate no-blur solutions and that the proposed methods achieve accurate reconstructions, with the inexact variant offering a favorable accuracy-cost tradeoff consistent with the theory.</description>

      <title>Elimination Without Eliminating: Computing Complements of Real Hypersurfaces Using Pseudo-Witness Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many hypersurfaces in algebraic geometry, such as discriminants, arise as the projection of another variety. The real complement of such a hypersurface partitions its ambient space into open regions. In this paper, we propose a new method for computing these regions. Existing methods for computing regions require the explicit equation of the hypersurface as input. However, computing this equation by elimination can be computationally demanding or even infeasible. Our approach instead derives from univariate interpolation by computing the intersection of the hypersurface with a line. Such an intersection can be done using so-called pseudo-witness sets without computing a defining equation for the hypersurface - we perform elimination without actually eliminating. We implement our approach in a forthcoming Julia package and demonstrate, on several examples, that the resulting algorithm accurately recovers all regions of the real complement of a hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates for Learning Pseudo-Differential Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes convergence rates for learning elliptic pseudo-differential operators, a fundamental operator class in partial differential equations and mathematical physics. In a wavelet-Galerkin framework, we formulate learning over this class as a structured infinite-dimensional regression problem with multiscale sparsity. Building on this structure, we propose a sparse, data- and computation-efficient estimator, which leverages a novel matrix compression scheme tailored to the learning task and a nested-support strategy to balance approximation and estimation errors. In addition to obtaining convergence rates for the estimator, we show that the learned operator induces an efficient and stable Galerkin solver whose numerical error matches its statistical accuracy. Our results therefore contribute to bringing together operator learning, data-driven solvers, and wavelet methods in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Towards Spatio-Temporal Extrapolation of Phase-Field Simulations with Convolution-Only Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-field simulations of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can capture complex microstructural evolutions but can be prohibitively expensive for large domains and long time horizons. In this paper, we introduce a fully convolutional, conditionally parameterized U-Net surrogate designed to extrapolate far beyond its training data in both space and time. The architecture integrates convolutional self-attention, physically informed padding, and a flood-fill corrector method to maintain accuracy under extreme extrapolation, while conditioning on simulation parameters allows for flexible time-step skipping and adaptation to varying alloy compositions. To remove the need for costly solver-based initialization, we couple the surrogate with a conditional diffusion model that generates synthetic, physically consistent initial conditions. We train our surrogate on simulations generated over small domain sizes and short time spans, but, by taking advantage of the convolutional nature of U-Nets, we are able to run and extrapolate surrogate simulations for longer time horizons than what would be achievable with classic numerical solvers. Across multiple alloy compositions, the framework is able to reproduce the LMD physics accurately. It predicts key quantities of interest and spatial statistics with relative errors typically below 5% in the training regime and under 15% during large-scale, long time-horizon extrapolations. Our framework can also deliver speed-ups of up to 36,000 times, bringing the time to run weeks-long simulations down to a few seconds. This work is a first stepping stone towards high-fidelity extrapolation in both space and time of phase-field simulation for LMD.</description>

      <title>Neumann series of Bessel functions for the solutions of the Sturm-Liouville equation in impedance form and related boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Neumann series of spherical Bessel functions representation for solutions of the Sturm--Liouville equation in impedance form \[ (\kappa(x)u')' + \lambda \kappa(x)u = 0,\quad 0 &lt; x &lt; L, \] in the case where $\kappa \in W^{1,2}(0,L)$ and has no zeros on the interval of interest. The $x$-dependent coefficients of this representation can be constructed explicitly by means of a simple recursive integration procedure. Moreover, we derive bounds for the truncation error, which are uniform whenever the spectral parameter $\rho=\sqrt{\lambda}$ satisfies a condition of the form $|\operatorname{Im}\rho|\leq C$. Based on these representations, we develop a numerical method for solving spectral problems that enables the computation of eigenvalues with non-deteriorating accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Heat Flux Method for Simple and Accurate Neumann Thermal Boundary Imposition in the Material Point Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Material Point Method (MPM), accurately imposing Neumann-type thermal boundary conditions, particularly convective heat flux boundaries, remains a significant challenge due to the inherent nonconformity between complex evolving material boundaries and the fixed background grid. This paper introduces a novel Virtual Heat Flux Method (VHFM) to overcome this limitation. The core idea is to construct a virtual flux field on an auxiliary domain surrounding the physical boundary, which exactly satisfies the prescribed boundary condition. This transforms the surface integral in the weak form into an equivalent, and easily computed, volumetric integral. Consequently, VHFM eliminates the need for explicit boundary tracking, specialized boundary particles, or complex surface reconstruction. A unified formulation is presented, demonstrating the method's straightforward extension to general scalar, vector, and tensor Neumann conditions. The accuracy, robustness, and convergence of VHFM are rigorously validated through a series of numerical benchmarks, including 1D transient analysis, 2D and 3D curved boundaries, and problems with large rotations and complex moving geometries. The results show that VHFM achieves accuracy comparable to conforming node-based imposition and significantly outperforms conventional particle-based approaches. Its simplicity, computational efficiency, and robustness make it an attractive solution for integrating accurate thermal boundary conditions into thermo-mechanical and other multiphysics MPM frameworks.</description>

      <title>Stochastic convergence of a class of greedy-type algorithms for Configuration Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Greedy Sampling Methods (GSMs) are widely used to construct approximate solutions of Configuration Optimization Problems (COPs), where a loss functional is minimized over finite configurations of points in a compact domain. While effective in practice, deterministic convergence analyses of greedy-type algorithms are often restrictive and difficult to verify. We propose a stochastic framework in which greedy-type methods are formulated as continuous-time Markov processes on the space of configurations. This viewpoint enables convergence analysis in expectation and in probability under mild structural assumptions on the error functional and the transition kernel. For global error functionals, we derive explicit convergence rates, including logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential decay, depending on an abstract improvement condition. As a pedagogical example, we study stochastic greedy sampling for one-dimensional piecewise linear interpolation and prove exponential convergence of the $L^1$-interpolation error for $C^2$-functions. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce the Randomized Polytope Division Method (R-PDM), a randomized variant of the classical Polytope Division Method, and demonstrate its effectiveness and variance reduction in numerical experiments</description>

      <title>A high order accurate and provably stable fully discrete continuous Galerkin framework on summation-by-parts form for advection-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-order accurate fully discrete numerical scheme for solving Initial Boundary Value Problems (IBVPs) within the Continuous Galerkin (CG)-based Finite Element framework. Both the spatial and time approximation in Summation-By-Parts (SBP) form are considered here. The initial and boundary conditions are imposed weakly using the Simultaneous Approximation Term (SAT) technique. The resulting SBP-SAT formulation yields an energy estimate in terms of the initial and external boundary data, leading to an energy-stable discretization in both space and time. The proposed method is evaluated numerically using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS). The scheme achieves super-convergence in both spatial and temporal direction with accuracy $\mathcal{O}(p+2)$ for $p\geq 2$, where $p$ refers to the degree of the Lagrange basis. In an application case, we show that the fully discrete formulation efficiently captures space-time variations even on coarse meshes, demonstrating the method's computational effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A note on generalized tensor CUR approximation for tensor pairs and tensor triplets based on the tubal product</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00754v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we briefly present a generalized tensor CUR (GTCUR) approximation for tensor pairs (X,Y) and tensor triplets (X,Y,Z) based on the tubal product (t-product). We use the tensor Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (TDEIM) to do these extensions. We show how the TDEIM can be utilized to generalize the classical tensor CUR (TCUR) approximation, which acts only on a single tensor, to jointly compute the TCUR of two and three tensors. This approach can be used to sample relevant lateral/horizontal slices of one data tensor relative to one or two other data tensors. For some special cases, the Generalized TCUR (GTCUR) approximation is reduced to the classical TCUR for both tensor pairs and tensor triplets in a similar fashion as shown for the matrices.</description>

      <title>Sharp error bounds for edge-element discretisations of the high-frequency Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove sharp wavenumber-explicit error bounds for first- or second-family-N\'ed\'elec-element (a.k.a. edge-element) conforming discretisations, of arbitrary (fixed) order, of the variable-coefficient time-harmonic Maxwell equations posed in a bounded domain with perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary conditions. The PDE coefficients are allowed to be piecewise regular and complex-valued; this set-up therefore includes scattering from a PEC obstacle and/or variable real-valued coefficients, with the radiation condition approximated by a perfectly matched layer (PML).
  In the analysis of the $h$-version of the finite-element method, with fixed polynomial degree $p$, applied to the time-harmonic Maxwell equations, the $\textit{asymptotic regime}$ is when the meshwidth, $h$, is small enough (in a wavenumber-dependent way) that the Galerkin solution is quasioptimal independently of the wavenumber, while the $\textit{preasymptotic regime}$ is the complement of the asymptotic regime.
  The results of this paper are the first preasymptotic error bounds for the time-harmonic Maxwell equations using first-family N\'ed\'elec elements or higher-than-lowest-order second-family N\'ed\'elec elements. Furthermore, they are the first wavenumber-explicit results, even in the asymptotic regime, for Maxwell scattering problems with a non-empty scatterer.</description>

      <title>Neural Green's Function Accelerated Iterative Methods for Solving Indefinite Boundary Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural operators, which learn mappings between the function spaces, have been applied to solve boundary value problems in various ways, including learning mappings from the space of the forcing terms to the space of the solutions with the substantial requirements of data pairs. In this work, we present a data-free neural operator integrated with physics, which learns the Green kernel directly. Our method proceeds in three steps: 1. The governing equations for the Green's function are reformulated into an interface problem, where the delta Dirac function is removed; 2. The interface problem is embedded in a lifted space of higher-dimension to handle the jump in the derivative, but still solved on a two-dimensional surface without additional sampling cost; 3. Deep neural networks are employed to address the curse of dimensionality caused by this lifting operation. The approximate Green's function obtained through our approach is then used to construct preconditioners for the linear systems allowed by its mathematical properties. Furthermore, the spectral bias of it revealed through both theoretical analysis and numerical validation contrasts with the smoothing effects of traditional iterative solvers, which motivates us to propose a hybrid iterative method that combines these two solvers. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approximate Green's function in accelerating iterative methods, proving fast convergence for solving indefinite problems even involving discontinuous coefficients.</description>

      <title>A domain decomposition strategy for natural imposition of mixed boundary conditions in port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, a finite element scheme to impose mixed boundary conditions without introducing Lagrange multipliers is presented for hyperbolic systems described as port-Hamiltonian systems. The strategy relies on finite element exterior calculus and domain decomposition to interconnect two systems with dual input-output behavior. The spatial domain is split into two parts by introducing an arbitrary interface. Each subdomain is discretized with a mixed finite element formulation that introduces a uniform boundary condition in a natural way as the input. In each subdomain the finite element spaces are selected from a finite element subcomplex to obtain a stable discretization. The two systems are then interconnected together by making use of a feedback interconnection. This is achieved by discretizing the boundary inputs using appropriate spaces that couple the two formulations. The final systems include all boundary conditions explicitly and do not contain any Lagrange multiplier. Time integration is performed using the implicit midpoint or St\"ormer-Verlet scheme. The method can also be applied to semilinear systems containing algebraic nonlinearities. The proposed strategy is tested on different examples: geometrically exact intrinsic beam model, the wave equation, membrane elastodynamics and the Mindlin plate. Numerical tests assess the conservation properties of the scheme, the effectiveness of the methodology and its robustness against shear locking phenomena.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Approximation as a Bias-Reducing Strategy with Applications to Manifold-Valued Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bias-variance tradeoff within a multiscale approximation framework. Our approach uses a given quasi-interpolation operator, which is repeatedly applied within an error-correction scheme over a hierarchical data structure. We introduce a new bias measure, the bias ratio, to quantitatively assess the improvements afforded by multiscale approximations and demonstrate that this strategy effectively reduces the bias component of the approximation error, thereby providing an operator-level bias reduction framework for addressing scattered-data approximation problems. Our findings establish multiscale approximation as a bias-reduction methodology applicable to general quasi-interpolation operators, including applications to manifold-valued functions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider the numerical approximation of the incompressible surface Navier--Stokes equations on an evolving surface. For the discrete representation of the moving surface we use parametric finite elements of degree $\ell \geq 2$. In the semidiscrete continuous-in-time setting we are able to prove a stability estimate that mimics a corresponding result for the continuous problem. Some numerical results, including a convergence experiment, demonstrate the practicality and accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Weighted $L_p$-Discrepancy Bounds for Parametric Stratified Sampling and Applications to High-Dimensional Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the expected $L_p$-discrepancy ($2 \leq p &lt; \infty$) for stratified sampling schemes under importance sampling. We introduce a parametric family of equivolume partitions $\Omega_{\theta,\sim}$ and leverage recent exact formulas for the expected $L_2$-discrepancy \cite{xian2025improved}. Our main contribution is a weighted discrepancy reduction lemma that relates weighted $L_p$-discrepancy to standard $L_p$-discrepancy with explicit constants depending on the weight function. For $p=2$, we obtain explicit bounds using the exact discrepancy formulas. For $p&gt;2$, we derive probabilistic bounds via dyadic chaining techniques. The results yield uniform error estimates for multivariate integration in Sobolev spaces $\mathcal{H}^1(K)$ and $F^*_{d,q}$, demonstrating improved performance over classical jittered sampling in importance sampling scenarios. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and illustrate the practical advantages of parametric stratified sampling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timesteppers constitute a powerful tool in modern computational science and engineering. Although they are typically used to advance the system forward in time, they can also be viewed as nonlinear mappings that implicitly encode steady states and stability information. In this work, we present an extension of the matrix-free framework for calculating, via timesteppers, steady states of deterministic systems to stochastic particle simulations, where intrinsic randomness prevents direct steady state extraction. By formulating stochastic timesteppers in the language of optimal transport, we reinterpret them as operators acting on probability measures rather than on individual particle trajectories. This perspective enables the construction of smooth cumulative- and inverse-cumulative-distribution-function ((I)CDF) timesteppers that evolve distributions rather than particles. Combined with matrix-free Newton-Krylov solvers, these smooth timesteppers allow efficient computation of steady-state distributions even under high stochastic noise. We perform an error analysis quantifying how noise affects finite-difference Jacobian action approximations, and demonstrate that convergence can be obtained even in high noise regimes. Finally, we introduce higher-dimensional generalizations based on smooth CDF-related representations of particles and validate their performance on a non-trivial two-dimensional distribution. Together, these developments establish a unified variational framework for computing meaningful steady states of both deterministic and stochastic timesteppers.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Multigrid with Overlapping Schwarz Smoothers and Local Spectral Coarse Grids for Least Squares Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a new algebraic multigrid (AMG) method for sparse least-squares systems of the form $A=G^TG$ motivated by challenging applications in scientific computing where classical AMG methods fail. First we review and relate the use of local spectral problems in distinct fields of literature on AMG, domain decomposition (DD), and multiscale finite elements. We then propose a new approach blending aggregation-based coarsening, overlapping Schwarz smoothers, and locally constructed spectral coarse spaces. By exploiting the factorized structure of $A$, we construct an inexpensive symmetric positive semidefinite splitting that yields local generalized eigenproblems whose solutions define sparse, nonoverlapping coarse basis functions. This enables a fully algebraic and naturally recursive multilevel hierarchy that can either coarsen slowly to achieve AMG-like operator complexities, or coarsen aggressively-with correspondingly larger local spectral problems-to ensure robustness on problems that cannot be solved by existing AMG methods. The method requires no geometric information, avoids global eigenvalue solves, and maintains efficient parallelizable setup through localized operations. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed least-squares AMG-DD method achieves convergence rates independent of anisotropy on rotated diffusion problems and remains scalable with problem size, while for small amounts of anisotropy we obtain convergence and operator complexities comparable with classical AMG methods. Most notably, for extremely anisotropic heat conduction operators arising in magnetic confinement fusion, where AMG and smoothed aggregation fail to reduce the residual even marginally, our method provides robust and efficient convergence across many orders of magnitude in anisotropy strength.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning has become a popular tool across many scientific fields, including the study of differential equations, particularly partial differential equations. This work introduces the basic principles of deep learning and the Deep Galerkin method, which uses deep neural networks to solve differential equations. This primer aims to provide technical and practical insights into the Deep Galerkin method and its implementation. We demonstrate how to solve the one-dimensional heat equation step-by-step. We also show how to apply the Deep Galerkin method to solve systems of ordinary differential equations and integral equations, such as the Fredholm of the second kind. Additionally, we provide code snippets within the text and the complete source code on Github. The examples are designed so that one can run them on a simple computer without needing a GPU.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving Lift &amp; Learn: Scientific machine learning for nonlinear conservative partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents structure-preserving Lift &amp; Learn, a scientific machine learning method that employs lifting variable transformations to learn structure-preserving reduced-order models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with conservation laws. We propose a hybrid learning approach based on a recently developed energy-quadratization strategy that uses knowledge of the nonlinearity at the PDE level to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The lifted dynamics obtained via energy quadratization are linear in the old variables, making model learning very effective in the lifted setting. Based on the lifted quadratic PDE model form, the proposed method derives quadratic reduced terms analytically and then uses those derived terms to formulate a constrained optimization problem to learn the remaining linear reduced operators in a structure-preserving way. The proposed hybrid learning approach yields computationally efficient quadratic reduced-order models that respect the underlying physics of the high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate the generalizability of quadratic models learned via the proposed structure-preserving Lift &amp; Learn method through three numerical examples: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed learning approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving data-driven model reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Randomized subspace correction methods for convex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an abstract framework for randomized subspace correction methods for convex optimization, which unifies and generalizes a broad class of existing algorithms, including domain decomposition, multigrid, and block coordinate descent methods. We provide a convergence rate analysis ranging from minimal assumptions to more practical settings, such as sharpness and strong convexity. While most existing studies on block coordinate descent methods focus on nonoverlapping decompositions and smooth or strongly convex problems, our framework extends to more general settings involving arbitrary space decompositions, inexact local solvers, and problems with weaker smoothness or convexity assumptions. The proposed framework is broadly applicable to convex optimization problems arising in areas such as nonlinear partial differential equations, imaging, and data science.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Transfers linking Ballistic Captures to Earth-Moon Periodic Orbit Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of transfers to periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon system has regained prominence with NASA's Artemis and CNSA's Chang'e programs. This work addresses the problem of linking ballistic capture trajectories - exploiting multi-body dynamics for temporary lunar orbit insertion - with bounded periodic motion described in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). A unified framework is developed for optimizing bi-impulsive transfers to families of periodic orbits via a high-order polynomial expansion of the CR3BP dynamics. That same expansion underlies a continuous parameterization of periodic orbit families, enabling rapid targeting and analytic sensitivity. Transfers to planar periodic orbit families - such as Lyapunov L1/L2 and distant retrograde orbits (DROs) - are addressed first, followed by extension to spatial families - such as butterfly and halo L1/L2 orbits - with an emphasis towards near-rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs). Numerical results demonstrate low-{\Delta}v solutions and validate the method's adaptability for designing lunar missions. The optimized trajectories can inform an established low-energy transfer database, enriching it with detailed cost profiles that reflect both transfer feasibility and underlying dynamical relationships to specific periodic orbit families. Finally, the proposed transfers provide reliable estimates for rapid refinement, making them readily adaptable for further optimization across mission-specific needs.</description>

      <title>Why Does Stochastic Gradient Descent Slow Down in Low-Precision Training?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07142v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-precision training has become crucial for reducing the computational and memory costs of large-scale deep learning. However, quantizing gradients introduces magnitude shrinkage, which can change how stochastic gradient descent (SGD) converges. In this study, we explore SGD convergence under a gradient shrinkage model, where each stochastic gradient is scaled by a factor \( q_k \in (0,1] \). We show that this shrinkage affect the usual stepsize \( \mu_k \) with an effective stepsize \( \mu_k q_k \), slowing convergence when \( q_{\min} &lt; 1 \). With typical smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions, we prove that low-precision SGD still converges, but at a slower pace set by \( q_{\min} \), and with a higher steady error level due to quantization effects. We analyze theoretically how lower numerical precision slows training by treating it as gradient shrinkage within the standard SGD convergence setup.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multilevel Splitting: First Application to Rare-Event Derivative Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the computational burden of pricing binary options in rare event regimes and introduces an adaptation of the adaptive multilevel splitting (AMS) method for financial derivatives. Standard Monte Carlo becomes inefficient for deep out-of-the-money binaries due to discontinuous payoffs and extremely small exercise probabilities, requiring prohibitively large sample sizes for accurate estimation. The proposed AMS framework reformulates the rare-event problem as a sequence of conditional events and is applied under both Black-Scholes and Heston dynamics. Numerical experiments cover European, Asian, and up-and-in barrier digital options, together with a multidimensional digital payoff designed as a stress test. Across all contracts, AMS achieves substantial gains, reaching up to 200-fold improvements over standard Monte Carlo, while preserving unbiasedness and showing robust performance with respect to the choice of importance function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of AMS to derivative pricing. An open-source Rcpp implementation is provided, supporting multiple discretisation schemes and alternative importance functions.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of the Pivot: A Note on Lazy Pivoted Cholesky and Farthest Point Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank approximations of large kernel matrices are ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly for scaling Gaussian Processes to massive datasets. The Pivoted Cholesky decomposition is a standard tool for this task, offering a computationally efficient, greedy low-rank approximation. While its algebraic properties are well-documented in numerical linear algebra, its geometric intuition within the context of kernel methods often remains obscure. In this note, we elucidate the geometric interpretation of the algorithm within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We demonstrate that the pivotal selection step is mathematically equivalent to Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) using the kernel metric, and that the Cholesky factor construction is an implicit Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We provide a concise derivation and a minimalist Python implementation to bridge the gap between theory and practice.</description>
