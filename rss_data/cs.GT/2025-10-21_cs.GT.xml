      <title>The Strongly Stable Roommates Problem and Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stable roommates problem is a non-bipartite version of the stable matching problem in a bipartite graph. In this paper, we consider the stable roommates problem with ties. In particular, we focus on strong stability, which is one of the main stability concepts in the stable roommates problem with ties. We propose a new polynomial-time algorithm for the problem of checking the existence of a strongly stable matching in the stable roommates problem with ties. More concretely, we extend the linear programming approach of Abeledo and Blum to the stable roommates problem with strict preferences to our problem.</description>

      <title>No-Regret Online Autobidding Algorithms in First-price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated bidding to optimize online advertising with various constraints, e.g. ROI constraints and budget constraints, is widely adopted by advertisers. A key challenge lies in designing algorithms for non-truthful mechanisms with ROI constraints. While prior work has addressed truthful auctions or non-truthful auctions with weaker benchmarks, this paper provides a significant improvement: We develop online bidding algorithms for repeated first-price auctions with ROI constraints, benchmarking against the optimal randomized strategy in hindsight. In the full feedback setting, where the maximum competing bid is observed, our algorithm achieves a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, and in the bandit feedback setting (where the bidder only observes whether the bidder wins each auction), our algorithm attains $\widetilde{O}(T^{3/4})$ regret bound.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Regret Matching in Potential Games and Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regret matching (RM} -- and its modern variants -- is a foundational online algorithm that has been at the heart of many AI breakthrough results in solving benchmark zero-sum games, such as poker. Yet, surprisingly little is known so far in theory about its convergence beyond two-player zero-sum games. For example, whether regret matching converges to Nash equilibria in potential games has been an open problem for two decades. Even beyond games, one could try to use RM variants for general constrained optimization problems. Recent empirical evidence suggests that they -- particularly regret matching$^+$ (RM$^+$) -- attain strong performance on benchmark constrained optimization problems, outperforming traditional gradient descent-type algorithms.
  We show that alternating RM$^+$ converges to an $\epsilon$-KKT point after $O_\epsilon(1/\epsilon^4)$ iterations, establishing for the first time that it is a sound and fast first-order optimizer. Our argument relates the KKT gap to the accumulated regret, two quantities that are entirely disparate in general but interact in an intriguing way in our setting, so much so that when regrets are bounded, our complexity bound improves all the way to $O_\epsilon(1/\epsilon^2)$. From a technical standpoint, while RM$^+$ does not have the usual one-step improvement property in general, we show that it does in a certain region that the algorithm will quickly reach and remain in thereafter. In sharp contrast, our second main result establishes a lower bound: RM, with or without alternation, can take an exponential number of iterations to reach a crude approximate solution even in two-player potential games. This represents the first worst-case separation between RM and RM$^+$. Our lower bound shows that convergence to coarse correlated equilibria in potential games is exponentially faster than convergence to Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Eliciting Truthful Feedback for Preference-Based Learning via the VCG Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study resource allocation problems in which a central planner allocates resources among strategic agents with private cost functions in order to minimize a social cost, defined as an aggregate of the agents' costs. This setting poses two main challenges: (i) the agents' cost functions may be unknown to them or difficult to specify explicitly, and (ii) agents may misreport their costs strategically. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm that combines preference-based learning with Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) payments to incentivize truthful reporting. Our algorithm selects informative preference queries via D-optimal design, estimates cost parameters through maximum likelihood, and computes VCG allocations and payments based on these estimates. In a one-shot setting, we prove that the mechanism is approximately truthful, individually rational, and efficient up to an error of $\tilde{\mathcal O}(K^{-1/2})$ for $K$ preference queries per agent. In an online setting, these guarantees hold asymptotically with sublinear regret at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal O}(T^{2/3})$ after $T$ rounds. Finally, we validate our approach through a numerical case study on demand response in local electricity markets.</description>

      <title>The Invisible Handshake: Tacit Collusion between Adaptive Market Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergence of tacit collusion between adaptive trading agents in a stochastic market with endogenous price formation. Using a two-player repeated game between a market maker and a market taker, we characterize feasible and collusive strategy profiles that raise prices beyond competitive levels. We show that, when agents follow simple learning algorithms (e.g., gradient ascent) to maximize their own wealth, the resulting dynamics converge to collusive strategy profiles, even in highly liquid markets with small trade sizes. By highlighting how simple learning strategies naturally lead to tacit collusion, our results offer new insights into the dynamics of AI-driven markets.</description>

      <title>Trading Prophets with Initial Capital</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correa et al. [EC' 2023] introduced the following trading prophets problem. A trader observes a sequence of stochastic prices for a stock, each drawn from a known distribution, and at each time must decide whether to buy or sell. Unfortunately, they observed that in this setting it is impossible to compete with a prophet who knows all future stock prices.
  In this paper, we explore the trading prophets problem when we are given initial capital with which to start trading. We show that initial capital is enough to bypass the impossibility result and obtain a competitive ratio of $3$ with respect to a prophet who knows all future prices (and who also starts with capital), and we show that this competitive ratio is best possible. We further study a more realistic model in which the trader must pay multiplicative and/or additive transaction costs for trading which model dynamics such as bid-ask spreads and broker fees.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Quantum Algorithms for Computing (Coarse) Correlated Equilibria of General-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing Nash equilibria of zero-sum games in classical and quantum settings is extensively studied. For general-sum games, computing Nash equilibria is PPAD-hard and the computing of a more general concept called correlated equilibria has been widely explored in game theory. In this paper, we initiate the study of quantum algorithms for computing $\varepsilon$-approximate correlated equilibria (CE) and coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) in multi-player normal-form games. Our approach utilizes quantum improvements to the multi-scale Multiplicative Weight Update (MWU) method for CE calculations, achieving a query complexity of $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ for fixed $\varepsilon$. For CCE, we extend techniques from quantum algorithms for zero-sum games to multi-player settings, achieving query complexity $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n}/\varepsilon^{2.5})$. Both algorithms demonstrate a near-optimal scaling in the number of players $m$ and actions $n$, as confirmed by our quantum query lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Data Reliability Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we assess the reliability of a dataset without access to ground truth? We introduce the problem of reliability scoring for datasets collected from potentially strategic sources. The true data are unobserved, but we see outcomes of an unknown statistical experiment that depends on them. To benchmark reliability, we define ground-truth-based orderings that capture how much reported data deviate from the truth. We then propose the Gram determinant score, which measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical distribution of the observed data and experiment outcomes. We show that this score preserves several ground-truth based reliability orderings and, uniquely up to scaling, yields the same reliability ranking of datasets regardless of the experiment -- a property we term experiment agnosticism. Experiments on synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data demonstrate that the Gram determinant score effectively captures data quality across diverse observation processes.</description>

      <title>On the Universal Near Optimality of Hedge in Combinatorial Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the classical Hedge algorithm in combinatorial settings. In each round, the learner selects a vector $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a set $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\boldsymbol{y}_t \in \mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\langle \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_t \rangle \in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems, including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\big(\sqrt{T \log |X|}\big)$ after $T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\sqrt{\log d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\Omega\big(\sqrt{T \log(|X|)/\log d}\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of combinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\log d \leq m \leq \sqrt{d}$--for which this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by a factor of exactly $\sqrt{\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical $K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD) algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret guarantees for DAGs.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Symmetric Equilibria in Min-Max Optimization and Team Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08519v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing stationary points in min-max optimization, with a particular focus on the special case of computing Nash equilibria in (two-)team zero-sum games.
  We first show that computing $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in $3$-player \emph{adversarial} team games -- wherein a team of $2$ players competes against a \emph{single} adversary -- is \textsf{CLS}-complete, resolving the complexity of Nash equilibria in such settings. Our proof proceeds by reducing from \emph{symmetric} $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in \emph{symmetric}, identical-payoff, two-player games, by suitably leveraging the adversarial player so as to enforce symmetry -- without disturbing the structure of the game. In particular, the class of instances we construct comprises solely polymatrix games, thereby also settling a question left open by Hollender, Maystre, and Nagarajan (2024). We also provide some further results concerning equilibrium computation in adversarial team games.
  Moreover, we establish that computing \emph{symmetric} (first-order) equilibria in \emph{symmetric} min-max optimization is \textsf{PPAD}-complete, even for quadratic functions. Building on this reduction, we further show that computing symmetric $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in symmetric, $6$-player ($3$ vs. $3$) team zero-sum games is also \textsf{PPAD}-complete, even for $\epsilon = \text{poly}(1/n)$. As an immediate corollary, this precludes the existence of symmetric dynamics -- which includes many of the algorithms considered in the literature -- converging to stationary points. Finally, we prove that computing a \emph{non-symmetric} $\text{poly}(1/n)$-equilibrium in symmetric min-max optimization is \textsf{FNP}-hard.</description>

      <title>Verifying Equilibria in Finite-Horizon Probabilistic Concurrent Game Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14690v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-horizon probabilistic multiagent concurrent game systems, also known as finite multiplayer stochastic games, are a well-studied model in computer science due to their ability to represent a wide range of real-world scenarios involving strategic interactions among agents over a finite amount of iterations (given by the finite-horizon). The analysis of these games typically focuses on evaluating (verifying) and computing (synthesizing/realizing) which strategy profiles (functions that represent the behavior of each agent) qualify as equilibria. The two most prominent equilibrium concepts are the Nash equilibrium and the subgame perfect equilibrium, with the latter considered a conceptual refinement of the former. However, computing these equilibria from scratch is often computationally infeasible. Therefore, recent attention has shifted to the verification problem, where a given strategy profile must be evaluated to determine whether it satisfies equilibrium conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the verification problem for subgame perfect equilibria lies in PSPACE, while for Nash equilibria, it is EXPTIME-complete. This is a highly counterintuitive result since subgame perfect equilibria are often seen as a strict strengthening of Nash equilibria and are intuitively seen as more complicated.</description>

      <title>Dominated Actions in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09716v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dominance is a fundamental concept in game theory. In strategic-form games dominated strategies can be identified in polynomial time. As a consequence, iterative removal of dominated strategies can be performed efficiently as a preprocessing step for reducing the size of a game before computing a Nash equilibrium. For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could convert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated strategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential blowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated actions in imperfect-information games. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether an action is dominated (strictly or weakly) by any mixed strategy in n-player games, which can be extended to an algorithm for iteratively removing dominated actions. This allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the game tree as a preprocessing step for Nash equilibrium computation. We explore the role of dominated actions empirically in the "All In or Fold" No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker variant.</description>

      <title>Escaping a Polygon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose an escaping player ("human") moves continuously at maximum speed $1$ in the interior of a region, while a pursuing player ("zombie") moves continuously at maximum speed $r$ outside the region. For what $r$ can the first player escape the region, that is, reach the boundary a positive distance away from the pursuing player, assuming optimal play by both players? We formalize a model for this infinitesimally alternating 2-player game and prove that it has a unique winner in any locally rectifiable region. Our model thus avoids pathological behaviors (where both players can have "winning strategies") previously identified for pursuit-evasion games such as the Lion and Man problem in certain metric spaces. For some specific regions, including both equilateral triangle and square, we give exact results for the critical speed ratio, above which the pursuing player can win and below which the escaping player can win (and at which the pursuing player can win). For simple polygons, we give a simple formula and polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to give a 10.89898-approximation to the critical speed ratio, and we give a pseudopolynomial-time approximation scheme for approximating the critical speed ratio arbitrarily closely. On the negative side, we prove NP-hardness of the problem for polyhedral domains in 3D, and prove stronger results (PSPACE-hardness and NP-hardness even to approximate) for generalizations to multiple escaping and pursuing players.</description>

      <title>FlipDyn with Control: Resource Takeover Games with Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce FlipDyn with control, a finite-horizon zero-sum resource takeover game, where a defender and an adversary decide when to takeover and how to control a common resource. At each discrete-time step, the players can take over or retain control, incurring state and control-dependent costs. The system is modeled as a hybrid dynamical system, with a discrete \texttt{FlipDyn} state determining control authority. Our contributions are: (i) For arbitrary non-negative costs, we derive the saddle-point value of the \texttt{FlipDyn} game and the corresponding Nash equilibria (NE) takeover strategies. (ii) For linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we establish sufficient conditions under which the game admits an NE. (iii) For scalar linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we derive parameterized NE takeover strategies and saddle-point values independent of the continuous state. (iv) For higher-dimensional linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we derive approximate NE takeover strategies and control policies, and compute bounds on the saddle-point values. We validate our results through a numerical study on adversarial control of a linear system.</description>

      <title>Computational Modelling for Combinatorial Game Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a generic computational model that can be used effectively for establishing the existence of winning strategies for concrete finite combinatorial games. Our modelling is (equational) logic-based involving advanced techniques from algebraic specification, and it can be executed by equational programming systems such as those from the OBJ-family. We show how this provides a form of experimental mathematics for strategy problems involving combinatorial games. We do this by defining general methods and by illustrating these with case studies.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Truthful Language Models via Peer Elicitation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities but remain prone to inconsistencies and hallucinations. We introduce Peer Elicitation Games (PEG), a training-free, game-theoretic framework for aligning LLMs through a peer elicitation mechanism involving a generator and multiple discriminators instantiated from distinct base models. Discriminators interact in a peer evaluation setting, where utilities are computed using a determinant-based mutual information score that provably incentivizes truthful reporting without requiring ground-truth labels. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that each agent, via online learning, achieves sublinear regret in the sense their cumulative performance approaches that of the best fixed truthful strategy in hindsight. Moreover, we prove last-iterate convergence to a truthful Nash equilibrium, ensuring that the actual policies used by agents converge to stable and truthful behavior over time. Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in factual accuracy. These results position PEG as a practical approach for eliciting truthful behavior from LLMs without supervision or fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Going with the Flow: Approximating Banzhaf Values via Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count (5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.</description>
