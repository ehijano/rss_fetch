      <title>The connectivity of Vietoris-Rips complexes of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey what is known and unknown about Vietoris-Rips complexes and thickenings of spheres. Afterwards, we show how to control the homotopy connectivity of Vietoris-Rips complexes of spheres in terms of coverings of spheres and projective spaces. Let $S^n$ be the $n$-sphere with the geodesic metric, and of diameter $\pi$, and let $\delta &gt; 0$. Suppose that the first nontrivial homotopy group of the Vietoris-Rips complex $\mathrm{VR}(S^n;\pi-\delta)$ of the $n$-sphere at scale $\pi-\delta$ occurs in dimension $k$, i.e., suppose that the connectivity is $k-1$. Then $\mathrm{cov}_{S^n}(2k+2) \le \delta &lt; 2\cdot \mathrm{cov}_{\mathbb{R}P^n}(k)$. In other words, there exist $2k+2$ balls of radius $\delta$ that cover $S^n$, and no set of $k$ balls of radius $\frac{\delta}{2}$ cover the projective space $\mathbb{R}P^n$. As a corollary, the homotopy type of $\mathrm{VR}(S^n;r)$ changes infinitely many times as the scale $r$ increases.</description>

      <title>Configuration Spaces of Points: A User's Guide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This extensive survey is an invited contribution to the Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics, 2nd edition. It covers both classical and more modern aspects of configuration spaces of points on a "ground space" $M$. Most results pertain to $M$ a manifold. Configuration spaces of points have become so omnipresent in so many areas of mathematics, physics, and even the applied sciences, that a survey can only cover a selection of topics. We review key ideas, constructions, and results.</description>

      <title>Equivariant cohomology and rings of functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This submission is a PhD dissertation. It constitutes the summary of the author's work concerning the relations between cohomology rings of algebraic varieties and rings of functions on zero schemes and fixed point schemes. It includes the results from the co-authored article arXiv:2212.11836. They are complemented by: an introduction to the theory of group actions on algebraic varieties, with particular focus on vector fields; a historical overview of the field; a few newer results of the author.
  The fundamental theorem from arXiv:2212.11836 says that if the principal nilpotent has a unique zero, then the zero scheme over the Kostant section is isomorphic to the spectrum of the equivariant cohomology ring, remembering the grading in terms of a $\mathbb{C}$ action. In this thesis, we also tackle the case of a singular variety. As long as it is embedded in a smooth variety with regular action, we are able to study its cohomology as well by means of the zero scheme. In largest generality, this allows us to see geometrically a subring of the cohomology ring. We also show that the cohomology ring of spherical varieties appears as the ring of functions on the zero scheme. Lastly, the K-theory conjecture is studied, with some results attained for GKM spaces.</description>

      <title>On the smoothing theory delooping of disc diffeomorphism and embedding spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Morlet-Burghelea-Lashof-Kirby-Siebenmann smoothing theory theorem states that the group $\mathrm{Diff}_\partial(D^n)$ of diffeomorphisms of a disc $D^n$ relative to the boundary is equivalent to $\Omega^{n+1}\left(\mathrm{PL}_n/\mathrm{O}_n\right)$ for any $n\geq 1$ and to $\Omega^{n+1}\left(\mathrm{TOP}_n/\mathrm{O}_n\right)$ for $n\neq 4$. We revise smoothing theory results to show that the delooping generalizes to different versions of disc smooth embedding spaces relative to the boundary, namely the usual embeddings, those modulo immersions, and framed embeddings. The latter spaces deloop as $\mathrm{Emb}_\partial^{fr}(D^m,D^n)\simeq\Omega^{m+1}\left(\mathrm{O}_n\backslash\!\!\backslash\mathrm{PL}_n/\mathrm{PL}_{n,m}\right)\simeq \Omega^{m+1}\left(\mathrm{O}_n\backslash\!\!\backslash\mathrm{TOP}_n/\mathrm{TOP}_{n,m}\right)$ for any $n\geq m\geq 1$ ($n\neq 4$ for the second equivalence), where the left-hand side in the case $n-m=2$ or $(n,m)=(4,3)$ should be replaced by the union of the path-components of $\mathrm{PL}$-trivial knots (framing being disregarded). Moreover, we show that for $n\neq 4$, the delooping is compatible with the Budney $E_{m+1}$-action. We use this delooping to combine the Hatcher $\mathrm{O}_{m+1}$-action and the Budney $E_{m+1}$-action into a framed little discs operad $E_{m+1}^{\mathrm{O}_{m+1}}$-action on $\mathrm{Emb}_\partial^{fr}(D^m,D^n)$.</description>

      <title>Persistence-based Modes Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the estimation of multiple modes of a (multivariate) density. We start by proposing an estimator of the $H_0$ persistence diagram. We then derive from it a procedure to estimate the number of modes, their locations and the associated local maxima. For large classes of piecewise-continuous functions, we show that these estimators achieve nearly minimax rates. These classes involve geometric control over the discontinuities set and differ from commonly considered function classes in mode(s) inference. Although the global regularity assumptions are stronger, we do not suppose regularity (or even continuity) in any neighborhood of the modes.</description>

      <title>The Dowker theorem via discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dowker theorem is a classical result in the topology of finite spaces, claiming that any binary relation between two finite spaces defines two homotopy-equivalent complexes (the Dowker complexes). Recently, Barmak strengthened this to a simple-homotopy-equivalence. We reprove Barmak's result using a combinatorial argument that constructs an explicit acyclic matching in the sense of discrete Morse theory.</description>

Abstract: For a smooth manifold $N$ denote by $E^m(N)$ the set of smooth isotopy classes of smooth embeddings $N\to\mathbb R^m$. A description of the set $E^m(S^p\times S^q)$ was known only for $p=q=0$ or for $p=0$, $m\ne q+2$ or for $2m\ge 2(p+q)+\max\{p,q\}+4$. (The description was given in terms of homotopy groups of spheres and of Stiefel manifolds.) For $m\ge2p+q+3$ we introduce an abelian group structure on $E^m(S^p\times S^q)$ and describe this group `up to an extension problem'. This result has corollaries which, under stronger dimension restrictions, more explicitly describe $E^m(S^p\times S^q)$. The proof is based on relations between sets $E^m(N)$ for different $N$ and $m$, in particular, on a recent exact sequence of M. Skopenkov.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem Through Combinatorial Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To the best of our knowledge, a complete characterization of the domains that escape the famous Arrow's impossibility theorem remains an open question. We believe that different ways of proving Arrovian theorems illuminate this problem. This paper presents a new combinatorial topology proof of Arrow's theorem. In PODC 2022, Rajsbaum and Ravent\'os-Pujol proved this theorem using a combinatorial topology approach. This approach uses simplicial complexes to represent the sets of profiles of preferences and that of single preferences. These complexes grow in dimension with the number of alternatives. This makes it difficult to think about the geometry of Arrow's theorem when there are (any) finite number of voters and alternatives. Rajsbaum and Ravent\'os-Pujol (2022) use their combinatorial topology approach only for the base case of two voters and three alternatives and then proceed by induction to prove the general version. The problem with this strategy is that it is unclear how to study domain restrictions in the general case by focusing on the base case and then using induction. Instead, the present article uses the two-dimensional structure of the high-dimensional simplicial complexes (formally, the $2$$\unicode{x2013}$skeleton), yielding a new combinatorial topology proof of this theorem. Moreover, we do not assume the unrestricted domain, but a domain restriction that we call the class of polarization and diversity over triples, which includes the unrestricted domain. By doing so, we obtain a new generalization of Arrow's theorem. This shows that the combinatorial topology approach can be used to study domain restrictions in high dimensions through the $2$$\unicode{x2013}$skeleton.</description>

      <title>The band connected sum and the second Kirby move for higher-dimensional links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f:S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ be a link (i.e. an embedding).
  How does (the isotopy class of) the knot $S^q\to S^m$ obtained by embedded connected sum of the components of $f$ depend on $f$?
  Define a link $\sigma f:S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ as follows. The first component of $\sigma f$ is the `standardly shifted' first component of $f$. The second component of $\sigma f$ is the embedded connected sum of the components of $f$. How does (the isotopy class of) $\sigma f$ depend on $f$?
  How does (the isotopy class of) the link $S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ obtained by embedded connected sum of the last two components of a link $g:S^q_1\sqcup S^q_2\sqcup S^q_3\to S^m$ depend on $g$?
  We give the answers for the `first non-trivial case' $q=4k-1$ and $m=6k$. The first answer was used by S. Avvakumov for classification of linked 3-manifolds in $S^6$.</description>
