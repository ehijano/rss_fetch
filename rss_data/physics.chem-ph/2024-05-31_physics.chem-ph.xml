      <title>Chemical Space-Informed Machine Learning Models for Rapid Predictions of X-ray Photoelectron Spectra of Organic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present machine learning models based on kernel-ridge regression for predicting X-ray photoelectron spectra of organic molecules originating from the $K$-shell ionization energies of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), and fluorine (F) atoms. We constructed the training dataset through high-throughput calculations of $K$-shell core-electron binding energies (CEBEs) for 12,880 small organic molecules in the bigQM7$\omega$ dataset, employing the $\Delta$-SCF formalism coupled with meta-GGA-DFT and a variationally converged basis set. The models are cost-effective, as they require the atomic coordinates of a molecule generated using universal force fields while estimating the target-level CEBEs corresponding to DFT-level equilibrium geometry. We explore transfer learning by utilizing the atomic environment feature vectors learned using a graph neural network framework in kernel-ridge regression. Additionally, we enhance accuracy within the $\Delta$-machine learning framework by leveraging inexpensive baseline spectra derived from Kohn--Sham eigenvalues. When applied to 208 combinatorially substituted uracil molecules larger than those in the training set, our analyses suggest that the models may not provide quantitatively accurate predictions of CEBEs but offer a strong linear correlation relevant for virtual high-throughput screening. We present the dataset and models as the Python module, ${\tt cebeconf}$, to facilitate further explorations.</description>

      <title>Bridging electronic and classical density-functional theory using universal machine-learned functional approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of density-functional theory (DFT) is determined by the quality of the approximate functionals, such as exchange-correlation in electronic DFT and the excess functional in the classical DFT formalism of fluids. The exact functional is highly nonlocal for both electrons and fluids, yet most approximate functionals are semi-local or nonlocal in a limited weighted-density form. Machine-learned (ML) nonlocal density-functional approximations are promising in both electronic and classical DFT, but have so far employed disparate approaches with limited generality. Here, we formulate a universal approximation framework and training protocol for nonlocal ML functionals, combining features of equivariant convolutional neural networks and the weighted-density approximation. We prototype this approach for several 1D and quasi-1D problems and demonstrate that a functional with exactly the same hyperparameters achieves excellent accuracy for the hard-rod fluid, the inhomogeneous Ising model, the exact exchange functional for electrons, the electron kinetic energy functional for orbital-free DFT, as well as for liquid water with 1D inhomogeneities. These results lay the foundation for a universal ML approach to exact 3D functionals spanning electronic and classical DFT.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic language of proteinoid gels: Boolean gates and QR codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an aim to build analog computers out of soft matter fluidic systems in future, this work attempts to invent a new information-theoretic language, in the form of two-dimensional Quick Response (QR) codes. This language is, effectively, a digital representation of the analog signals shown by the proteinoids. We use two different experimental techniques: (i) a voltage-sensitive dye and (ii) a pair of differential electrodes, to record the analog signals. The analog signals are digitally approximatied (synthesised) by sampling the analog signals into a series of discrete values, which are then converted into binary representations. We have shown the AND-OR-NOT-XOR-NOR-NAND-XNOR gate representation of the digitally sampled signal of proteinoids. Additional encoding schemes are applied to convert the binary code identified above to a two-dimensional QR code. As a result, the QR code becomes a digital, unique marker of a given proteinoid network. We show that it is possible to retrieve the analog signal from the QR code by scanning the QR code using a mobile phone. Our work shows that soft matter fluidic systems, such as proteinoids, can have a fundamental informatiom-theoretic language, unique to their internal information transmission properties (electrical activity in this case) - such a language can be made universal and accessible to everyone using 2D QR codes, which can digitally encode their internal properties and give an option to recover the original signal when required. On a more fundamental note, this study identifies the techniques of approximating continuum properties of soft matter fluidic systems using a series representation of gates and QR codes, which are a piece-wise digital representation, and thus one step closer to programming the fluids using information-theoretic methods, as suggested almost a decade ago by Tao's fluid program.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Informed Multimodal Learning of High-Dimensional Free Energy Models in Molecular Coarse Graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a differentiable formalism for learning free energies that is capable of capturing arbitrarily complex model dependencies on coarse-grained coordinates and finite-temperature response to variation of general system parameters. This is done by endowing models with explicit dependence on temperature and parameters and by exploiting exact differential thermodynamic relationships between the free energy, ensemble averages, and response properties. Formally, we derive an approach for learning high-dimensional cumulant generating functions using statistical estimates of their derivatives, which are observable cumulants of the underlying random variable. The proposed formalism opens ways to resolve several outstanding challenges in bottom-up molecular coarse graining dealing with multiple minima and state dependence. This is realized by using additional differential relationships in the loss function to significantly improve the learning of free energies, while exactly preserving the Boltzmann distribution governing the corresponding fine-grain all-atom system. As an example, we go beyond the standard force-matching procedure to demonstrate how leveraging the thermodynamic relationship between free energy and values of ensemble averaged all-atom potential energy improves the learning efficiency and accuracy of the free energy model. The result is significantly better sampling statistics of structural distribution functions. The theoretical framework presented here is demonstrated via implementations in both kernel-based and neural network machine learning regression methods and opens new ways to train accurate machine learning models for studying thermodynamic and response properties of complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Algorithm for Simulating Real-Time Thermal Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid Path Integral Monte Carlo (hPIMC) algorithm to calculate real-time quantum thermal correlation functions and demonstrate its application to open quantum systems. The hPIMC algorithm leverages the successes of classical PIMC as a computational tool for high-dimensional system studies by exactly simulating dissipation using the Feynman-Vernon influence functional on a classical computer. We achieve a quantum speed-up over the classical algorithm by computing short-time matrix elements of the quantum propagator on a quantum computer. We show that the component of imaginary-time evolution can be performed accurately using the recently developed Probabilistic Imaginary-Time Evolution (PITE) algorithm, and we introduce a novel low-depth circuit for approximate real-time evolution under the kinetic energy operator using a Discrete Variable Representation (DVR). We test the accuracy of the approximation by computing the position-position thermal correlation function of a proton transfer reaction.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical applications of plasmonic nanoparticle conjugates need control over their optical properties modulated by surface coating with stabilizing or targeting molecules often attached to or embedded in the secondary functionalization shell, such as silica. Although current numerical techniques can simulate the plasmonic response of such structures, it is desirable in practice to have analytical models based on simple physical ideas that can be implemented without considerable computer resources. Here, we present two efficient analytical methods based on improved electrostatic approximation (IEA) and model expansion method (MEM) combined with the dipole equivalence method (DEM). The last approach avoids additional electromagnetic simulations and provides a direct bridge between analytical IEA and MEM models for bare particles and those with multilayer shells. As simple as the original IEA and MEM, the developed analytical extensions provide accurate extinction and scattering spectra for coated particles compared to exact calculations by separation of variable method and COMSOL. The possibility and accuracy of analytical models are illustrated by extensive simulations for prolate and oblate gold and silver nanoparticles with a maximal size of up to 200 nm, aspect ratio from 2 to 6, and 3-30 nm dielectric coating.</description>

      <title>The escape transition of a lattice star polymer grafted in a pore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers in confined spaces are compressed and have reduced conformational entropy, and will partially or fully escape from confinement if conditions are suitable. This is in particular the case for a polymer grafted in a pore. The escape of the polymer from the pore may be considered a partial translocation from the pore into bulk solution, and the resulting conformational readjustment of the polymer has characteristics of a thermodynamic phase transition. In this paper a lattice self-avoiding walk model of a star polymer grafted in a pore is examined numerically using the PERM algorithm. We show that the arms of the grafted lattice star escape one at a time as the length of the pore is reduced, consistent with earlier results in the literature. Critical points for the escape transitions are estimated for square and cubic lattice models and we also examine various properties of the model as it undergoes the escape transitions.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) Method with multiple pseudo statesmapped onto the same all electron wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) Method is based on generating a transform between the pseudo wavefunction and all electron wavefunction. For the accuracy of the method it is important that the local part of the transform (in each atomic sphere $\mathbf{R}$) be over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work by allowing for multiple smooth pseudo wavefunction states to be mapped onto the same all electron wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient fine-tuning of foundational models for first-principles quality sublimation enthalpies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculating sublimation enthalpies of molecular crystal polymorphs is relevant to a wide range of technological applications. However, predicting these quantities at first-principles accuracy -- even with the aid of machine learning potentials -- is a challenge that requires sub-kJ/mol accuracy in the potential energy surface and finite-temperature sampling. We present an accurate and data-efficient protocol based on fine-tuning of the foundational MACE-MP-0 model and showcase its capabilities on sublimation enthalpies and physical properties of ice polymorphs. Our approach requires only a few tens of training structures to achieve sub-kJ/mol accuracy in the sublimation enthalpies and sub 1 % error in densities for polymorphs at finite temperature and pressure. Exploiting this data efficiency, we explore simulations of hexagonal ice at the random phase approximation level of theory at experimental temperatures and pressures, calculating its physical properties, like pair correlation function and density, with good agreement with experiments. Our approach provides a way forward for predicting the stability of molecular crystals at finite thermodynamic conditions with the accuracy of correlated electronic structure theory.</description>

      <title>BEAST DB: Grand-Canonical Database of Electrocatalyst Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present BEAST DB, an open-source database comprised of ab initio electrochemical data computed using grand-canonical density functional theory in implicit solvent at consistent calculation parameters. The database contains over 20,000 surface calculations and covers a broad set of heterogeneous catalyst materials and electrochemical reactions. Calculations were performed at self-consistent fixed potential as well as constant charge to facilitate comparisons to the computational hydrogen electrode. This article presents common use cases of the database to rationalize trends in catalyst activity, screen catalyst material spaces, understand elementary mechanistic steps, analyze electronic structure, and train machine learning models to predict higher fidelity properties. Users can interact graphically with the database by querying for individual calculations to gain granular understanding of reaction steps or by querying for an entire reaction pathway on a given material using an interactive reaction pathway tool. BEAST DB will be periodically updated, with planned future updates to include advanced electronic structure data, surface speciation studies, and greater reaction coverage.</description>

Abstract: We have presented the theory, implementation, and benchmark results for the one-electronic variant of spin-free exact two-component (SFX2C1e) linear response coupled cluster (LRCCSD) theory for static and dynamic polarizabilities of atoms and molecules in the spin-adapted formulation. The resolution of identity (RI) approximation for two-electron integrals has been used to reduce the computational cost of the calculation and has been shown to have a negligible effect on accuracy. The calculated static and dynamic polarizability values agree very well with the more expensive X2C-LRCCSD and experimental results. Our calculated results show that accurate predictions of polarizabilities of atoms and molecules containing heavy atoms require the use of a large basis set containing an adequate number of diffuse functions, in addition to accounting for electron correlation and relativistic effects.</description>

      <title>Influence of cholesterol on hydrogen-bond dynamics of water molecules in lipid-bilayer systems at varying temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cholesterol (Chol) plays a crucial role in shaping the intricate physicochemical attributes of biomembranes, exerting considerable influence on water molecules proximal to the membrane interface. In this study, we conducted molecular dynamics simulations on the bilayers of two lipid species, dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM); they are distinct with respect to the structures of the hydrogen-bond (H-bond) acceptors. Our investigation focuses on the dynamic properties and H-bonds of water molecules in the lipid-membrane systems, with particular emphasis on the influence of Chol at varying temperatures. Notably, in the gel phase at 303 K, the presence of Chol extends the lifetimes of H-bonds of the oxygen atoms acting as H-bond acceptors within DPPC with water molecules by a factor of 1.5 to 2.5. In the liquid-crystalline phase at 323 K, on the other hand, H-bonding dynamics with lipid membranes remain largely unaffected by Chol. This observed shift in H-bonding states serves as a crucial key to unraveling the subtle control mechanisms governing water dynamics in lipid-membrane systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An outstanding property of any Hamiltonian system is the symplecticity of its flow, namely, the continuous trajectory preserves volume in phase space. Given a symplectic but discrete trajectory generated by a transition matrix applied at a fixed time-increment ($\tau &gt; 0$), it was generally believed that there exists a unique Hamiltonian producing a continuous trajectory that coincides at all discrete times ($t = n\tau$ with $n$ integers) as long as $\tau$ is small enough. However, it is now exactly demonstrated that, for any given discrete symplectic dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, there exists an infinite number of real-valued Hamiltonians for any small value of $\tau$ and an infinite number of complex-valued Hamiltonians for any large value of $\tau$. In addition, when the transition matrix is similar to a Jordan normal form with the supradiagonal element of $1$ and the two identical diagonal elements of either $1$ or $-1$, only one solution to the Hamiltonian is found for the case with the diagonal elements of $1$, but no solution can be found for the other case.</description>

      <title>Solvent Selectivity controls Micro- versus Macro-phase Separation in Multiblock Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble were used to obtain critical parameters and conditions leading to microphase separation for block copolymers with solvophilic and solvophobic segments. Solvent selectivity was systematically varied to distinguish between systems that undergo macrophase separation to ones that microphase separate in the dilute phase, prior to macrophase separating. Finite-size scaling was used to obtain the critical parameters. Interestingly, corrections to scaling increase significantly for systems that form finite aggregates. The threshold value of solvent selectivity for aggregation was determined for symmetric diblock chains of varying length. The results indicate that long diblock copolymers form micelles in the dilute phase prior to macrophase separation, even in marginally selective solvents. The dependence of critical temperature on solvent selectivity was obtained for triblock, multiblock, and alternating chains. For highly selective solvents, strong structuring of both dilute and dense phases makes it harder to reach equilibrium.</description>

      <title>On Nirmala indices based entropy measures for the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical parameter, known as a topological index, is employed to represent the molecular structure of a compound by considering its graph-theoretical properties. In the study of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR), topological indices are used to predict the physicochemical properties of chemical compounds. Graph entropies have evolved as information-theoretic tools to investigate the structural information of a molecular graph. In this study, we compute the Nirmala index, the first and second inverse Nirmala index of the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine, with the help of its M-polynomial. Furthermore, entropy measures for the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine are computed using Shannon's entropy model. The comparison between the Nirmala indices and their associated entropy measures is presented through numerical computation. The correlation between the Nirmala indices and associated entropy measurements is then examined using a regression model. Finally, it is shown that the structural characteristics and properties of the complex structure of ruthenium bipyridine will be predicted by Nirmala indices-based entropy measures rather than the Nirmala indices.</description>

Abstract: Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes are widely used in biomaterials and nanotechnology to regulate surface properties and interactions. Here, we apply the electrostatic correlation augmented self-consistent field theory to investigate the interactions between opposing PE brushes in a mixture of 1:1 and 3:1 salt solutions. Our theory predicts hysteretic feature of the normal stress induced by strong ion correlations. In the presence of trivalent ions, the force profile is discontinuous: repulsive in the compression branch and adhesive in the separation branch. The molecular origin of the hysteretic force is the coexistence of two collapsed modes: two separated condensed layer on each surface in the compression and a single bundled condensed layer in the separation. With the systematic inclusion of ion correlations, our theory fully captures the hysteretic force, adhesive separation, ``jump-in'' and ``jump-out'' features, and the ``specific ion effect'', all in good agreement with the reported experimental results.</description>
