      <title>Expansion Evolution of Nonhomogeneous Metric with Quantum-Mechanically Revisited Fundamental Metric Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore the properties of space and initial singularities in the context of general relativity, where spacetime becomes poorly defined and no longer belongs to a regular manifold, we examine the evolution of the expansion of timelike geodesic congruences for two distinct formulations of the fundamental metric tensor. This analysis is conducted within a nonhomogeneous, anisotropic, and spherically symmetric cosmic background. The results derived from the conventional metric tensor, the building block of Einstein's theory of general relativity, are compared with those obtained from a quantum-mechanically revisited metric tensor. This comparison enables an assessment of the proposed geometric quantization, particularly in terms of whether singularities are regulated or diminished. Utilizing a quantum geometric approach, the numerical analysis incorporating a quantum-mechanically revisited metric tensor applies a mean-field approximation on the integrated quantum operators. In contrast to the results obtained with conventional metric tensor, the quantum-mechanically induced revision of the metric tensor seems to provide a framework for controlling singularities in the new formulation of general relativity. The degree of quantization likely influences the ability to regulate or even potentially remove both singularities. We also conclude that the proposed geometric quantization provides a means to explore the quantum nature of spacetime curvatures, emphasizing that the singularity dilemma arose primarily from the standard semi-classical approximation of Einstein's general relativity.</description>

      <title>Metric-Affine Myrzakulov Gravity Theories: Models, Applications and Theoretical Developments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review presents a comprehensive overview of Myrzakulov gravity, highlighting key developments and significant results shaping the theory. It examines the foundational principles, field equations, and the role of non-metricity and torsion in gravitational interactions. The theory's implications extend to cosmology, astrophysics, and strong gravitational fields, offering alternatives to dark matter and dark energy. A focus is placed on the modified Einstein-Hilbert action, its impact on cosmic expansion, and astrophysical applications such as black holes and gravitational waves. Observational constraints from cosmology and gravitational wave tests are discussed to refine the model. By situating Myrzakulov gravity within the broader context of modified gravity, this review explores its potential to reshape fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Symmetry Violation in Charged Black Hole Thermodynamics and Gravitational Lensing: Effects of the Kalb-Ramond Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the consequences of Lorentz symmetry violation in the thermodynamics and gravitational lensing of charged black holes coupled to the Kalb-Ramond field. We first explore the impact of Lorentz-violating parameters on key thermodynamic properties, including the Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat, demonstrating significant deviations from their Lorentz-symmetric counterparts. Our analysis reveals that the Lorentz-violating parameter b induces modifications in phase transitions and stability conditions, offering novel insights into black hole thermodynamics. Additionally, the influence of Lorentz symmetry breaking on gravitational lensing is examined using modifications to the Rindler-Ishak method, showing that these effects enhance the bending of light near compact objects. Our findings, derived within the framework of the standard model extension and bumblebee gravity models, suggest that Lorentz-violating corrections could lead to observable astrophysical phenomena, providing potential tests for deviations from Einstein's theory of relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first numerical simulations of asymptotically flat space-times whose computational domain includes past and future null-infinity. As an application, we explore the scattering of a gravitational wave in a black hole space-time. The study is conducted in the fully non-linear regime using an initial boundary value problem formulation of Friedrich's generalised conformal field equations. We calculate the Bondi energy, Bondi news and gravitational information at both past and future null-infinity and discuss their relationships.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new exact black hole solution of a 5-dimensional Weyl-geometry Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravity. The Euclidean sector defines a fully regular metric coupled to the Weyl vector field. The Euclidean action and entropy are computed, with the latter following the simple $A/4$ form plus a term linear in the horizon radius, characteristic of Gauss-Bonnet couplings.</description>

      <title>On energy-momentum tensor for gravitational waves in $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Isaacson's procedure for describing back-reaction of the averaged energy-momentum for high frequency gravitational waves is generalized to $f(R)$ gravity case. From the beginning it is assumed that an initial background could be arbitrary one. By next steps it is restricted to de Sitter space that is a novelty for the study of a back-reaction in $f(R)$ gravity. Consideration of the de Sitter space as a background spacetime allows us to provide the averaging procedure completely. Using the results on the de Sitter space and generalizing the Isaacson procedure, we construct the averaged energy-momentum on an additionally curved (averaged) background. Relations of parameters, which preserve the de Sitter picture, and which disturb it are given. Our results generalize results of previous authors who use flat (Minkowski) spacetime as the beginning background in $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Relativistic compact object in Generalised Tolman-Kuchowicz spacetime with quadratic equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the class of solutions to the Einstein field equations for the uncharged static spherically symmetric compact object PSR J0952-0607 by using Generalized Tolman-Kuchowicz space-time metric with quadratic equation of state. We have obtained the bound on the model parameter n graphically and achieved the stable stellar structure of the mathematical model of a compact object. The stability of the generated model is examined by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov criterion. This anisotropic compact star model fulfills all the required stability criteria including the causality condition, adiabatic index, and Buchdahl condition, Herrera's cracking condition and pertains free from central singularities.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Approach for Quasinormal Frequencies of Noncommutative Geometry-inspired Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of quasinormal modes (QNMs) for noncommutative geometry-inspired wormholes, focusing on scalar, electromagnetic, and vector-type gravitational perturbations. By employing the spectral method, the perturbation equations are reformulated into an eigenvalue problem over a compact domain, using Chebyshev polynomials to ensure high precision and fast numerical convergence. Our results reveal the absence of overdamped modes, with all detected QNMs exhibiting oscillatory behaviour. Additionally, for large values of the rescaled mass parameter, the QNMs of the noncommutative wormhole transition smoothly to those of the classical Schwarzschild wormhole, validating the accuracy of the spectral method. This work represents the first comprehensive exploration of QNMs in noncommutative geometry-inspired wormholes, shedding light on their stability and dynamical properties.</description>

      <title>Polarimetry imprints of exotic compact objects: solitonic boson stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the polarization observational properties of solitonic boson stars orbited by spherical hot-spots emitting synchrotron radiation from a thermal distribution of electrons. We consider three boson star configurations with different compacticities ranging from a dilute model with a large radius to an ultra-compact model capable of holding null bound orbits. We observe that the polarimetric imprints of the primary images for all models are comparable to those of the Schwarzschild spacetime, and thus any potentially distinguishable differences must arise from the additional structure of secondary and plunge-through images. For low inclination ($20^\circ$) observations we find that the two QU-loops of the least compact model are in contradiction with the current ALMA and GRAVITY observations and effectively excludes the possibility of Sgr A* being a dilute solitonic boson star. For high inclination ($80^\circ$) observations, both the Electric Vector Position Angle (EVPA) and the QU-loops present large qualitative deviations from the Schwarzschild black-hole for all models analyzed. Our results emphasize the suitability of polarimetry as a framework to test the nature of supermassive compact objects with future observations, especially at high inclination.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM from broken diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple field theory model with reduced invariance under diffeomorphisms whose energy-momentum tensor is identical to the sum of pressureless irrotational matter and a cosmological constant. The model action is built from a single scalar field with a canonical kinetic term without any potential or Lagrange multiplier terms. The coupling to gravity is realized through a particular transverse diffeomorphism invariant volume element. The corresponding sound speed is exactly zero in any background geometry and the model is dynamically identical to $\Lambda$CDM. By restoring the full diffeomorphism invariance through the introduction of Stueckelberg-like fields, we obtain an equivalent local scalar-vector theory.</description>

      <title>Interpreting gravitational fields of Topologically Massive Gravity using geodesic deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study relative motion of nearby test particles in Topologically Massive Gravity (TMG) in three spacetime dimensions, using the equation of geodesic deviation. We show that, in a suitable reference frame, the influence of any gravitational field can be decomposed into transverse, longitudinal, and Newtonian components, which are directly related to the Cotton scalars of the Newman-Penrose-type. In particular, we prove that Cotton type N spacetimes exhibit a purely transverse gravitational effect on test particles, and can thus be reasonably interpreted as specific gravitational waves with a single polarization mode in TMG. The influence of the cosmological constant manifests itself as an isotropic effect. We also discuss the physical interpretation of spacetimes of specific algebraic types, as well as the influence of various matter fields, namely pure radiation, perfect fluid, and electromagnetic field. As an example, we provide an explicit analysis of TN-waves and pp-waves in three-dimensional TMG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the latest results from ACT observations we review a class of potentials labeled as fractional attractors, that can originate from Palatini gravity. We show in a model independent way that this class of potentials predicts both a spectral index $n_s$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ which fit the $1\sigma$ region of the combination ACT+Planck data for a wide choice of the parameters. We also provide a numerical fit for the parameter space of this models in the case of a simple quadratic and quartic fractional potential.</description>

      <title>The spinning self-force EFT: 1SF waveform recursion relation and Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on recent approaches, we develop an effective field theory for the interaction of spinning particles modeling Kerr black holes within the gravitational self-force expansion. To incorporate dimensional regularization into this framework, we analyze the Myers-Perry black hole and its particle description, obtaining a novel exponential form of the corresponding linearized stress tensor. We then derive the 1SF self-force effective action up to quadratic order in the spin expansion, identifying a new type of spinning recoil term that arises from integrating out the heavy dynamics. Next, we study the 1SF metric perturbation both from the traditional self-force perspective and through the diagrammatic background field expansion, making contact with the radiative waveform. This leads us to consider a novel recursion relation for the curved space 1SF Compton amplitude, which we study up to one-loop in the wave regime and compare with the flat space one-loop Compton amplitude for Kerr up to quadratic order in spin. Finally, we investigate the 1SF spinning Compton amplitude in the eikonal regime, clarifying how strong-field effects -- such as the location of the separatrix -- emerge from the resummation of the perturbative weak-field expansion.</description>

      <title>Optimal parameterizations for observational constraints on thawing dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-varying dark energy is often modeled in observational analyses through generic parameterizations of its equation of state $w(z)$, which typically use two free parameters $\{w_0, w_a\}$ to span a broad range of behaviors as a function of redshift. However, this broad range of behaviors can only approximately capture the dynamics of any given microphysical theory of dark energy. A complementary approach is to use targeted parameterizations designed to model specific classes of dynamical dark energy with greater precision. Focusing on the class of thawing dark energy, we quantify and compare the precision with which nineteen generic and targeted parameterizations can capture the dynamics of physically motivated thawing quintessence theories. We find that a targeted parameterization derived from a Pad\'e expansion of $w$ is the most reliable of these, producing accurate reconstructions of $w(z)$, the expansion history $H(z)$, and cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ and $\Omega_m$ for a broad range of microphysical theories.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Standard Siren Method: Improved Constraints on Modified Gravitational Wave Propagation with Future Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary mergers have emerged as one of the most promising probes of cosmology and General Relativity (GR). However, a major challenge in fully exploiting GWs as standard sirens with current and future GW observatories is developing efficient and robust codes capable of analyzing the increasing data volumes that are, and will be, acquired. We present here \texttt{CHIMERA} 2.0, an advanced computational framework for hierarchical Bayesian inference of cosmological, modified gravity, and population hyperparameters using standard sirens and galaxy catalogs. This upgrade introduces novel GPU-accelerated algorithms to estimate the hierarchical likelihood, enabling the analysis of thousands of events - crucial for next-generation experiments - and includes the two-parameter ($\Xi_0-n$) modified GW propagation model. Using \texttt{CHIMERA} 2.0, we forecast cosmological and modified GW propagation constraints for the future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5 run. We analyze three binary black hole populations of 300 events at SNR&gt;20, each with a different value of $\Xi_0$: 0.6, 1 (corresponding to GR), and 1.8. Multiple analyses were performed each catalog, comprising a population of approximately 5000 events, thanks to \texttt{CHIMERA} 2.0, which is 10-1000 times faster depending on the settings and catalog size. We jointly infer cosmological, modified GW propagation, and population hyperparameters. With spectroscopic galaxy catalogs, the fiducial $\Xi_0$ is recovered with a precision of 22%, 7.5%, and 10% for $\Xi_0$ = 0.6, 1, and 1.8, respectively; while the precision on $H_0$ is 2-7 times worse than when $\Xi_0$ is not inferred. Finally,in the case of photometric redshifts the constraints degrade on average by 3.5 times in all cases, underscoring the importance of future spectroscopic surveys in maximizing the constraining power of standard sirens.</description>

      <title>Near-Peak Spectrum of Gravitational Waves from Collapsing Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological domain walls appear in many well-motivated extensions to the standard model of particle physics. If produced, they quickly enter into a self-similar scaling regime, where they are capable of efficiently sourcing a stochastic background of gravitational waves. In order to avoid a cosmological catastrophe, they must also decay before their enormous energy densities can have adverse effects on background dynamics. Here, we provide a suite of lattice simulations to comprehensively study the gravitational wave signatures of the domain wall network during this decay phase. The domain walls are initially formed through spontaneous breaking of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, and subsequently decay through the action of a small bias term which causes regions of false vacuum to collapse. We find that gravitational waves are produced in abundance throughout this collapsing phase, leading to a shift in the peak frequency and increase in the overall amplitude of the spectrum by an $\mathcal{O}(100)$ factor when compared against simple analytic arguments. Importantly, we also find that the characteristic frequency of emitted gravitational waves increases as the network decays, which leads to a softening of the high frequency spectral index. This high frequency spectrum therefore carries key information related to the dynamics of the collapsing phase, and can be used to discriminate between different domain wall scenarios using upcoming data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave with Domain Wall Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain walls (DWs) can be produced when a discrete symmetry is spontaneously broken, and long-lived DWs can dominate the energy density of the universe. In this work, we explore the possibility that a "domain wall dominant (DWD)" phase existed in the early universe and ended with DW decay. During the DWD phase, the universe undergoes a power-law accelerated expansion of the scale factor and exhibits temporal superhorizon evolution of the relevant frequency modes. We show that this can lead to distinct features imprinted on the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating GW emission associated with DWD, leading to distinguishable long-lived DW-induced GWs from other cosmological sources, with significant implications for future GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Detection of cosmological dipoles aligned with transverse peculiar velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first observations of a novel dipole signature imprinted on the CMB by transverse velocities. Cosmological peculiar velocities point towards gravitational wells and away from potential hills, reflecting a large-scale dipole in the gravitational potential, coherent over hundreds of Mpc. We predict large-scale dipoles in all fields correlated with the potential, observable via effects of gravitational lensing and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW). The ISW dipole is distinct from the small-scale moving lens effect, which has a dipole of the opposite sign. We provide a unified framework for analysing these dipoles, and make the first detections in galaxy density, CMB lensing convergence and the ISW effect. We show that the observed signals are consistent with LCDM predictions, and set limits on modified gravity. The CMB dipole signal is independent of galaxy bias, and orthogonal to the monopole correlation function, so this new observable provides additional cosmological information (abridged).</description>

      <title>Unified Equation for Massless Spin Particles and New Spin Coefficient Definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new definition for the spin coefficients $\rho$, $\mu$, $\tau$, and $\pi$, which are defined as the directional derivatives of the logarithm of a generating function along the null tetrad ($l^{\mu}$, $n^{\mu}$, $m^{\mu}$, $\bar{m}^{\mu}$), respectively. This is the first discovery that these spin coefficients are interconnected through a generating function. Using the newly defined spin coefficients, we find that the field equations for massless particles with spins 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, and 2 in arbitrary black hole spacetimes can be described by a single unified equation. This finding is particularly surprising, as unifying these field equations is already a significant challenge in flat spacetime, let alone in the intricate spacetime around black holes. Consequently, this work will inevitably prompt a re-examination of the shared characteristics among various types of particles in black hole spacetimes. Meanwhile, we verify the correctness of the new definition for the spin coefficients, and provide the explicit form of the unified equation for nearly all known black hole backgrounds. This lays a solid foundation for studying the behavior of massless spin particles in any black hole background.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation in a Scalar Field Dominated Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical code that solves the Misner-Sharp system for a spherically symmetric cosmological model containing both a scalar field and a perfect fluid. While the code is capable of exploring general scenarios involving an minimally coupled scalar field and perfect fluid, we focus on the regime where the scalar field dominates the dynamics, particularly in the post-inflationary scalar field-dominated scenario, where the universe is governed by a rapidly oscillating scalar field for a period lasting a few $e$-folds. We analyse the threshold for PBH formation under quadratic and quartic potentials, evolving configurations from superhorizon scales. Our results confirm that a quartic potential behavior is similar to the radiation-dominated universe, resulting in a PBH formation threshold close to the well-established value in radiation backgrounds. Conversely, in the quadratic case, we observe a significant deviation from the expected dust-like behaviour, due to wave-like effects opposing the gravitational collapse. While numerical limitations prevent us from evolving a wide range of initial conditions to determine a precise threshold for PBH formation, our findings suggest that PBH formation may be suppressed with respect to the pure dust scenario, allowing the formation of stable solitonic structures instead. This study highlights the importance of properly accounting for wave dynamics in oscillating scalar fields when characterising PBH formation.</description>

      <title>One-loop correction to primordial tensor modes during radiation era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to infer properties of primordial inflation relies on the conservation of the superhorizon perturbations between their exit during inflation, and their re-entry during radiation era. Any considerable departure from this property would require reinterpreting the data. This is why it is important to understand how superhorizon perturbations interact with the thermal plasma driving the radiation dominated Universe. We model the plasma by free photons in a thermal state and compute the one-loop correction to the power spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations. This correction grows in time and is not suppressed by any small parameter. While one-loop result is not reliable because it invalidates perturbation theory, it signals potentially interesting effects that should be investigated further.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently released data from the $\textit{Atacama Cosmology Telescope}$ (ACT) confirms that the primordial scalar spectrum is extremely flat. This, together with current upper bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, implies that the simplest models of inflation coming from particle physics (for instance, a minimally-coupled scalar with monomial potentials) need additional ingredients in order to make them compatible with observations. Instead of invoking arbitrary new couplings or new interactions that are not protected symmetries, we argue that dissipation of the inflaton field with the radiation bath should be added as a new physical principle. Accordingly, we show that warm inflation provides the correct paradigm to explain the current observations, given very natural choices of dissipative terms.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</description>

Abstract: The idea of constructing a time machine is not new and even received a boost thanks to the realization that a traversable wormhole could be converted to a time machine. It was shown in a recent paper that the time-travel paradoxes can be avoided by assuming the existence of two or more histories or parallel timelines. Accordingly, we start with a physically acceptable model, a spacetime that is anti-de Sitter due to an extra time-like dimension. This model allows the existence of closed time-like curves, as well as two different histories, thereby suggesting a possible avoidance of the time-travel paradoxes. By assuming that the extra dimension is independent of the radial coordinate, the wormhole retains its basic geometric properties regardless of its location.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The {\Lambda}CDM model has long served as a robust and predictive framework for cosmology, successfully explaining a wide range of observations, including the accelerated expansion of the Universe. However, discrepancies in cosmological parameter estimates and recent findings, such as those from DESI, hint at potential deviations from {\Lambda}CDM. Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer an independent method to probe the nature of dark energy, leveraging GWs from compact binary mergers as standard candles. In this study, we demonstrate that the integrated GW memory over cosmological distances encodes a unique imprint of the background spacetime. Unlike previous analyses, our approach captures non-linear dependencies on cosmological quantities, resulting in an enhancement of the integrated GW memory by a factor of 100 for high-redshift sources well within the sensitivity range of next-generation detectors like Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. We find that despite the diminishing strength of individual GWs at high redshifts, their cumulative effect leads to a significant amplification, akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, offering a potential new avenue for cosmological studies. By examining a range of dark energy models, we reveal that GW memory is potentially highly sensitive to the underlying cosmological framework, making it a promising probe of dark energy. This novel approach presents the possibility of a fresh perspective to address persistent cosmological tensions, and the nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Mixmaster Universe in a non-commutative Generalized Uncertainty Principle framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the dynamical aspects of the cosmological Mixmaster model within the framework of non-commutative generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) theories. The theory is formulated classically by introducing a well-defined symplectic form that differs from the ordinary one, thereby inducing a general deformation of the Poisson brackets describing a precise class of GUP theories. In this general setting, we first investigate the behavior of the Bianchi I and Bianchi II models using Misner variables. Then, we study the Bianchi IX model in the Mixmaster approximation, which is well-known for accurately reproducing the dynamics of the point-particle Universe approaching the cosmological singularity. We derive the corresponding Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) map and then, by selecting a specific GUP model associated with string theory, we explicitly investigate its resulting features shaped by the non-commutative GUP scheme. Our findings reveal that the chaotic and ergodic behavior typically observed in the standard BKL map, which characterizes the point-Universe's approach to the singularity, is replaced by quasi-periodic orbits in the parameter space of the theory. This corresponds to an oscillatory behavior of the Universe's scale factors, dependent on the initial conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard Komar charge is a $(d-2)$-form that can be defined in spacetimes admitting a Killing vector and which is closed when the vacuum Einstein equations are satisfied. Its integral at spatial infinity (the Komar integral) gives the conserved charge associated to the Killing vector, and, due to its on-shell closedness, the same value (expressed in terms of other physical variables) is obtained integrating over the event horizon (if any). This equality is the basis of the Smarr formula. This charge can be generalized so that it still is closed on-shell in presence of matter and its integrals give generalizations of the Smarr formula. We show how the Komar charge and other closed $(d-2)$-form charges can be used to prove non-existence theorems for gravitational solitons and boson stars. In particular, we show how one can deal with generalized symmetric fields (invariant under a combination of isometries and other global symmetries) and how the geralized symmetric ansatz permits to evade the non-existence theorems.</description>

      <title>Probing dark matter halo profiles with multi-band observations of gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the potential of multiband gravitational wave observations from a deci-Hz space-based detector and third-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors to constrain the properties of dark matter spikes around intermediate-mass ratio inspirals. The presence of dark matter influences the orbital evolution of the secondary compact object through dynamic friction, which leads to a phase shift in the gravitational waveform compared to the vacuum case. Our analysis shows that the proposed Indian space-based detector GWSat, operating in the deciHz frequency band, provides the most stringent constraints on the dark matter spike parameters, as IMRIs spend a significant portion of their inspiral phase within its sensitivity range. While third-generation ground-based detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer offer additional constraints, their contribution is somewhat limited, particularly for higher-mass systems where the signal duration in their frequency bands is shorter. However, for systems with detector-frame total masses $M_z &lt; 400 \rm M_{\odot}$, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope could improve the estimation of the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, luminosity distance, and dark matter spike power-law index by more than $15\%$. Nonetheless, their impact on the constraint of spike density is minimal. These results highlight the crucial role of deciHz space-based detectors in probing dark matter interactions with gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>A healthier stochastic semiclassical gravity: world without Schr\"{o}dinger cats</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiclassical gravity couples classical gravity to the quantized matter in meanfield approximation. The meanfield coupling is problematic for two reasons. First, it ignores the quantum fluctuation of matter distribution. Second, it violates the linearity of the quantum dynamics. The first problem can be mitigated by allowing stochastic fluctuations of the geometry but the second problem lies deep in quantum foundations. Restoration of quantum linearity requires a conceptual approach to hybrid classical-quantum coupling. Studies of the measurement problem and the quantum-classical transition point to the solution. It is based on a postulated mechanism of spontaneous quantum monitoring plus feedback. This approach eliminates Schr\"{o}dinger cat states, takes quantum fluctuations into account, and restores the linearity of quantum dynamics. Such a captivating conceptionally `healthier' semiclassical theory exists in the Newtonian limit, but its relativistic covariance hits a wall. Here we will briefly recapitulate the concept and its realization in the nonrelativistic limit. We emphasize that the long-known obstacles to the relativistic extension lie in quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Weighing the curvature invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several inequalities between the curvature invariants, which impose constraints on curvature singularities. Some of the inequalities hold for a family of spacetimes which include static, Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker, and Bianchi type I metrics, independently of whether they are solutions of some particular field equations. In contrast, others hold for solutions of Einstein's gravitational field equation and a family of energy-momentum tensors (featuring ideal fluids, scalar fields and nonlinear electromagnetic fields), independently of the specific form of the spacetime metric. We illustrate different behaviour of the basic curvature invariants with numerous examples and discuss the consequences and limitations of the proven results.</description>

      <title>The impact of local noise recorded at the ET candidate sites on the signal to noise ratio of CBC gravitational wave signals for the ET triangle configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an evaluation of how site dependent noise can affect the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals in the future 3rd generation gravitational wave (GW) detector Einstein Telescope (ET). The design of ET is currently pushing the scientific community to study its scientific potential with respect to known, and possibly unexpected, GW signals using its design sensitivity curves. However, local ambient noise may have an impact on the ET sensitivity at low frequency and therefore affect the SNR of CBC signals at low frequency. Therefore, we study the impact of ambient noise on the ET sensitivity curve at the two sites candidate to host ET - Sardinia, in Italy, and the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (EMR) at the Netherlands-Belgium border - and infer the impact on the ET sensitivity curve and how the SNR of CBC signals at low frequencies is affected. We find that Sardinia shows results which are on par, if not better, than the design case. On the other hand, ambient noise for the current EMR sensitivity curve in Terziet causes a higher degradation of the SNR performances.</description>

      <title>Implications of Pulsar Timing Array Results for High Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments such as NANOGrav and PPTA recently reported evidence of a gravitational wave (GW) background at nano-Hz frequency band. This signal can originate from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW) generated by the enhanced curvature perturbation. Production of SIGW is expected to be accompanied by formation of primordial black holes (PBH), which can emit GW through binary mergers. Here we perform a joint likelihood inference on PTA datasets in combination with existing limits on PBH abundance and GW density, we derive full Bayesian posteriors for PBH distribution and relevant PBH merger signal. Our results show that analysis using PTA data alone implies significant overproduction of PBHs, and accounting for current PBH limits causes visible shifts in SIGW posterior. If PTA signals are indeed of SIGW origin, the required curvature perturbation amplitude produces PBHs in a narrow mass window of $[6 \times 10^{-2}, 2 \times 10^{-1}]\ m_\odot$. Mergers of these PBHs can leave a strong GW signature in $[10^{-3}, 10^5]$ Hz frequency range, to be detectable at upcoming interferometers such as LISA, aLIGO, Einstein Telescope, DECIGO and BBO, etc. This offers a multi-frequency opportunity to further scrutinize the source of the observed PTA signal and can potentially improve current PBH constraints by up to 5 orders of magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Spinning Black Hole Scattering at $\mathcal{O}(G^3 S^2)$: Casimir Terms, Radial Action and Hidden Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve subtleties in calculating the post-Minksowskian dynamics of binary systems, as a spin expansion, from massive scattering amplitudes of fixed finite spin. In particular, the apparently ambiguous spin Casimir terms can be fully determined from the gradient of the spin-diagonal part of the amplitudes with respect to $S^2 = -s(s+1)\hbar^2$, using an interpolation between massive amplitudes with different spin representations. From two-loop amplitudes of spin-0 and spin-1 particles minimally coupled to gravity, we extract the spin Casimir terms in the conservative scattering angle between a spinless and a spinning black hole at $\mathcal{O}(G^3 S^2)$, finding agreement with known results in the literature. This completes an earlier study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130 (2023), 021601] that calculated the non-Casimir terms from amplitudes. We also illustrate our methods using a model of spinning bodies in electrodynamics, finding agreement between scattering amplitude predictions and classical predictions in a root-Kerr electromagnetic background up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^3 S^2)$. For both gravity and electrodynamics, the finite part of the amplitude coincides with the two-body radial action in the aligned spin limit, generalizing the amplitude-action relation beyond the spinless case. Surprisingly, the two-loop amplitude displays a hidden spin-shift symmetry in the probe limit, which was previously observed at one loop. We conjecture that the symmetry holds to all orders in the coupling constant and is a consequence of integrability of Kerr orbits in the probe limit at the first few orders in spin.</description>

      <title>Back to the origins of brane-antibrane inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new framework for brane-antibrane inflation where moduli stabilisation relies purely on perturbative corrections to the effective action. This guarantees that the model does not suffer from the eta-problem. The inflationary potential has two contributions: the tension of an antibrane at the tip of a warped throat, and its Coulomb interaction with a mobile brane. This represents the first realisation of the original idea of brane-antibrane inflation, as opposed to inflection point inflation which arises when the moduli are fixed with non-perturbative effects. Moreover, we formulate the brane-antibrane dynamics as an F-term potential of a nilpotent superfield in a manifestly supersymmetric effective theory. We impose compatibility with data and consistency conditions on control over the approximations and find that slow-roll inflation can occur in a large region of the underlying parameter space. The scalar spectral index is in agreement with data and the tensor-to-scalar ratio is beyond current observational reach. Interestingly, after the end of inflation the volume mode can, but does not need to, evolve towards a late-time minimum at larger values.</description>

      <title>Revealing EMRI/IMRI candidates with quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first detection of the quasiperiodic ultrafast outflow in the ASASSN-20qc system was reported by Pasham et al. (2024). The outflow is revealed in the soft X-ray spectra as an absorption feature, which is enhanced periodically every $\sim 8.3$ days. The repetitive nature of the ultrafast outflow is tentatively explained by an orbiting massive perturber, possibly an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), trajectory of which is inclined with respect to the accretion flow around the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH). In this scenario, the orbiting body pushes the disc gas into the outflow funnel, where it is accelerated by the ordered magnetic field (Sukov\'a et al. 2021). Quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows (a.k.a. QPOuts) are thus a novel phenomenon that can help reveal new extreme-/intermediate-mass ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI) candidates. These then would be prime candidate sources for a simultaneous detection and monitoring in electromagnetic as well as gravitational wave domains.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of $(2+1)d$ chiral anomaly in a graphene plate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22843v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Dirac model model of graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.</description>

      <title>Isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced by cosmological soliton isocurvature perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological solitons are widely predicted by scenarios of the early Universe. In this work, we investigate the isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by soliton isocurvature perturbations, especially considering the effects of non-Gaussianity in these perturbations. Regardless of non-Gaussianity, the energy-density fraction spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs approximately has a universal shape within the perturbative regime, thus serving as a distinctive signal of solitons. We derive the angular power spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs to characterize their anisotropies. Non-Gaussianity plays a key role in generating anisotropies through the couplings between large- and small-scale isocurvature perturbations, making the angular power spectrum to be a powerful probe of non-Gaussianity. Moreover, the isocurvature-induced GWs have nearly no cross-correlations with the cosmic microwave background, providing a new observable to distinguish them from other GW sources, e.g., GWs induced by cosmological curvature perturbations enhanced at small scales. Therefore, detection of both the isotropic background and anisotropies of isocurvature-induced GWs could reveal important implications for the solitons as well as the early Universe.</description>

Abstract: Astrophysical observations of the cosmos allow us to probe extreme physics and answer foundational questions on our universe. Modern astronomy is increasingly operating under a holistic approach, probing the same question with multiple diagnostics including how sources vary over time, how they appear across the electromagnetic spectrum, and through their other signatures, including gravitational waves, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and dust on Earth. Astrophysical observations are now reaching the point where approximate physics models are insufficient. Key sources of interest are explosive transients, whose understanding requires multidisciplinary studies at the intersection of astrophysics, gravity, nuclear science, plasma physics, fluid dynamics and turbulence, computation, particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical science, condensed matter and materials science, radiation transport, and high energy density physics. This white paper provides an overview of the major scientific advances that lay at the intersection of physics and astronomy and are best probed through time-domain and multimessenger astrophysics, an exploration of how multidisciplinary science can be fostered, and introductory descriptions of the relevant scientific disciplines and key astrophysical sources of interest.</description>

      <title>Is Lorentz invariance violation found?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) has long been recognized as an observable low-energy signature of quantum gravity. In spite of a great effort to detect LIV effects, so far only lower bounds have been derived. The high energy photons from the gamma ray burst GRB 221009A have been detected by the LHAASO collaboration and one at ${\cal E} \simeq 251 \, \rm TeV$ by the Carpet collaboration using a partial data set. Very recently, the Carpet collaboration has completed the full data analysis, reporting further support for their previously detected photon now at ${\cal E} = 300^{+ 43}_{- 38} \, {\rm TeV}$, which manifestly clashes with conventional physics. Taking this result at face value, we derive the first evidence for LIV and we show that such a detection cannot be explained by axion-like particles (ALPs), which allow for the observation of the highest energy photons detected by LHAASO. We also outline a scenario in which ALPs and LIV naturally coexist. If confirmed by future observations our finding would represent the first positive result in quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>
