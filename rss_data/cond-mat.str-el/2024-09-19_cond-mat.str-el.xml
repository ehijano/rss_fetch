      <title>Ferrimagnetism from triple-q order in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The candidate Kitaev magnet Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ exhibits a characteristic ferrimagnetic response at low temperatures, with a finite residual magnetization that changes sign at a compensation point located at around half the ordering temperature. We argue that the behavior can be naturally understood to arise in this material as a consequence of a noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ magnetic ground state. Using large-scale classical Monte Carlo simulations, we study the finite-temperature response of the pertinent honeycomb Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model in weak training fields. Our model features all symmetry-allowed nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, as well as sublattice-dependent next-nearest-neighbor interactions, consistent with the reported crystal structure of the material. We also consider a six-spin ring exchange perturbation, which allows us to tune between the two different magnetic long-range orders that have been suggested for this material in the literature, namely, a collinear single-$\mathbf{q}$ zigzag state and a noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ state. We demonstrate that the experimentally-observed ferrimagnetic response of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ can be well described within our modeling if the magnetic ground state features noncollinear triple-$\mathbf{q}$ order. By contrast, a classical Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$-type model with collinear zigzag ground state is insufficient even in principle to describe the observed behavior. Our results illustrate the unconventional physics of noncollinear magnetic long-range orders hosted by frustrated magnets with bond-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>Frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on a Kagome-strip chain: Dimerization and mapping to a spin-orbital Kugel-Khomskii model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum phases of a frustrated antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 model Hamiltonian on a Kagome-strip chain (KSC), a one-dimensional analogue of the Kagome lattice, and construct its phase diagram in an extended exchange parameter space. The isolated unit cell of this lattice comprises of five spin-1/2 particles, giving rise to several types of magnetic ground states in a unit cell: a spin-$3/2$ state as well as spin-$1/2$ states with and without additional degeneracies. We explore the ground state properties of the fully connected thermodynamic system using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods, identifying several distinct quantum phases. All but one of the phases exhibit gapless spin excitations. The exception is a dimerized spin-gapped phase that covers a large part of the phase diagram and includes the uniformly exchange coupled system. We argue that this phase can be understood by perturbing around the limit of decoupled unit cells where each unit cell has six degenerate ground states. We use degenerate perturbation theory to obtain an effective Hamiltonian, a Kugel-Khomskii model with an anisotropic spin-one orbital degree of freedom, which helps explain the origin of dimerization.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnetism for rare-earth magnets on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice with non-Kramers ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the rapid experimental progress on the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets, we propose a generic effective spin model that describes interacting non-Kramers local moments on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. We point out that the local moments consist of both magnetic dipole and quadrupole components and the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model with an intrinsic field that accounts for the crystal field splitting. We then study the ground-state phase diagram of the model and find that pure quadrupole orders, which are invisible to conventional experimental probes, can be stabilized over a broad regime. In particular, we show that a hidden ``1/3 magnetization plateau'' with quadrupole orders generally exists and discuss its experimental signatures. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results to the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets Pr$_{2}$Ga$_{2}$BeO$_{7}$ and Pr$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition as a transition to partial ordered spins. Application to $La_{1-x}Ca_xMnO_3$ in the doping range $x\geq 0.50$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic state is a partial ordered state if only part of the electrons in the system give contribution to the magnetic order.
  We study Heisenberg model of two sublattice spin system, on the body-centered cubic lattice, with antiferromagnetic nearest neighbors exchange of sublattice A and B spins
  and two different ferromagnetic exchange constants for sublattice A ($J^A$) and B ($J^B$) spins. When $J^A&gt;J^B$ the system undergoes transition from
  paramagnetism to ferromagnetism at Curie temperature $T_C$. Only the sublattice A spins give contribution to the magnetization of the system.
  Upon cooling, the system possesses ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism transition at N\'eel temperature $T_N &lt; T_C$.
  Below $T_N $ sublattice A and B electrons give contribution to the magnetization. The transition is a partial ordered transition.
  There is thermodynamic evidence for this transition in the magnetic specific heat of the system. As a function of temperature there are two maxima. At high temperature $T_C$ it is $\lambda$-type. At lower temperature $T_N$ it characterizes the transition from ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism.
  As an example of ferromagnetism to antiferromagnetism partial ordered transition we consider the material $La_{1-x}Ca_xMnO_3$ in the doping range $x\geq 0.50$.
  Our calculations reproduce
  the experimental magnetization-temperature curve.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Decoherence and wavefunction deformation of $D_4$ non-Abelian topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of decoherence on topological order (TO) has been most deeply understood for the toric code, the paragon of Abelian TOs. We show that certain non-Abelian TOs can be analyzed and understood to a similar degree, despite being significantly richer. We consider both wavefunction deformations and quantum channels acting on $D_4$ TO, which has recently been realized on a quantum processor. By identifying the corresponding local statistical mechanical spin or rotor model with $D_4$ symmetry, we find a remarkable stability against proliferating non-Abelian anyons. This is shown by leveraging a reformulation in terms of the tractable O$(2)$ loop model in the pure state case, and $n$ coupled O$(2)$ loop models for R\'enyi-$n$ quantities in the decoherence case -- corresponding to worldlines of the proliferating anyon with quantum dimension $2$. In particular, we find that the purity ($n=2$) remains deep in the $D_4$ TO for any decoherence strength, while the $n \to \infty$ limit becomes critical upon maximally decohering a particular anyon type, similar to our wavefunction deformation result. The information-theoretic threshold ($n\to 1$) appears to be controlled by a disordered version of these stat-mech models, akin to the toric code case although significantly more robust. We furthermore use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagrams when multiple anyon types proliferate at the same time, leading to a continued stability of the $D_4$ TO in addition to critical phases with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry. Instead of loop models, these are now described by net models corresponding to different anyon types coupled together according to fusion rules.This opens up the exploration of statistical mechanical models for decohered non-Abelian TO, which can inform optimal decoders, and which in an ungauged formulation examples of non-Abelian strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Quantized axial charge of staggered fermions and the chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1+1D ultra-local lattice Hamiltonian for staggered fermions with a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, there are two conserved, integer-valued charges that flow in the continuum limit to the vector and axial charges of a massless Dirac fermion with a perturbative anomaly. Each of the two lattice charges generates an ordinary U(1) global symmetry that acts locally on operators and can be gauged individually. Interestingly, they do not commute on a finite lattice, but their commutator goes to zero in the continuum limit. This non-abelian algebra presents an alternative lattice realization of the vector and axial symmetries, which is consistent with the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. We further prove that the presence of these two conserved lattice charges forces the low-energy phase to be gapless, reminiscent of the consequence from perturbative anomalies of continuous global symmetries in continuum field theory. Upon bosonization, these two charges lead to two exact U(1) symmetries in the XY model that flow to the momentum and winding symmetries in the free boson conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Stability and Loop Models from Decohering Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decohering topological order (TO) is central to the many-body physics of open quantum matter and decoding transitions. We identify relevant statistical mechanical models for decohering non-Abelian TO, which have been crucial for understanding the error threshold of Abelian stabilizer codes. The decohered density matrix can be described by loop models, whose topological loop weight $N$ is given by the quantum dimension of the decohering anyon -- reducing to the Ising model if $N=1$. In particular, the R\'enyi-$n$ moments of the decohered state correspond to $n$ coupled O$(N)$ loop models, and we exactly diagonalize the density matrix at maximal error rate. This allows us to relate the fidelity between two logically distinct ground states to properties of random O$(N)$ loop and spin models. Utilizing the literature on loop models, we find a remarkable stability to quantum channels which proliferate non-Abelian anyons with large quantum dimension, with the possibility of critical phases for smaller dimensions. We confirm our framework with exact results for Kitaev quantum double models, and with numerical simulations for the non-Abelian phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model. The latter is an example of a non-fixed-point wavefunction with non-bosonic and non-integral anyon dimensions. Our work opens up the possibility of non-Abelian TO being robust against maximally proliferating certain anyons, which can inform error-correction studies of these topological memories.</description>

      <title>Ground states of strongly-correlated materials on quantum computers using ab initio downfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate first-principles description of strongly-correlated materials is an important and challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Ab initio downfolding has emerged as a way of deriving accurate many-body Hamiltonians including strong correlations, representing a subspace of interest of a material, using density functional theory calculations as a starting point. However, the solution of these material-specific models can scale exponentially on classical computers, constituting a challenge. Here we propose that utilizing quantum computers for obtaining the properties of downfolded Hamiltonians yields an accurate description of the ground state properties of strongly-correlated systems, while circumventing the exponential scaling problem. We demonstrate this for diverse strongly-correlated materials by combining ab initio downfolding and variational quantum eigensolvers, correctly predicting the antiferromagnetic state of one-dimensional cuprate $\text{Ca}_2\text{CuO}_3$, the excitonic ground state of monolayer $\text{WTe}_2$, and the charge-ordered state of correlated metal $\text{SrVO}_3$. By utilizing a classical tensor network implementation of variational quantum eigensolvers we are able to simulate large models with up to $54$ qubits and encompassing up to four bands in the correlated subspace, which is indicative of the complexity that our framework can address.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric superfluid weight in multiband superconductors: A microscopic interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even in non-interacting limit, electrons on different Bloch bands of a multiband system do not move as if they are oblivious to the presence of one another. Instead, they move in concert by virtue of a non-Abelian interband Berry connection. While the impact of this quantum geometric attribute manifests most famously through the Hall response of topological bands, the geometric effects in superconductors have attracted significant recent attention. In particular, much has been discussed about the quantum-metric-induced superfluid weight (SW) in flatband superconductors. In this study, we revisit the geometric SW in generic multiband superconductors and trace its origin to a series of microscopic processes. We separately derive the SW of models containing only intraband Cooper pairing and those involving interband pairing. Two classes of processes enabled by the so-called interband velocity (or the closely related interband Berry connection) are identified: one is equivalent to the transfer of Cooper pairs between different bands, and the other corresponds to virtual back-and-forth single-electron tunneling between the bands. The former contribution manifests as effective Josephson coupling between the multiband superconducting order parameters, while the latter constitutes the only source of SW for a superconducting flatband well isolated from other bands. We further numerically evaluate the SW of a simple topologically trivial two-band superconductor, showcasing how the geometric contribution is sensitive to the details of the multiband pairing configuration. In particular, we highlight an intriguing scenario of negative SW, which may pave way for the formation of novel pair density wave order. Our study provides deeper and more intuitive insight into the origin and nature of the SW induced by the quantum geometry of paired Bloch electrons.</description>

      <title>Electronic and magnetic properties of (NdNiO$_3$)/(La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$) superlattices: a DFT+U perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic and magnetic properties of NdNiO$_3$ (NNO) thin films are very sensitive to epitaxial strain and to the proximity to ferromagnetic oxides. In this work, we investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of NdNiO$_3$/La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ (NNO/LSMO) superlattices under the epitaxial strain of NdGaO$_3$ (NGO) using density functional theory with Hubbard U correction (DFT+U) calculations. Our findings reveal that LSMO induces insignificant structural distortions on the NiO$_6$ octahedra, and that there is a negligible charge transfer between LSMO and NNO. More importantly, we find an intricate magnetic order regarding the interfacial Ni local moments, where we observe a coexistence of ferromagnetic interactions between interfacial Ni and Mn atoms, and antiferromagnetic interactions between inner Ni ions, which results in an overall ferromagnetic coupling across the interface. We also observe the metallization of NNO through the emergence of a half-metallic density of states in the same spin channel as LSMO, which becomes suppressed the further we move away from the interface. Our theoretical findings agrees well with recent experimental data, shedding light on the complex interplay between the induced magnetic order and the electronic properties of NNO.</description>

      <title>A unified theoretical framework for Kondo superconductors: Periodic Anderson impurities with attractive pairing and Rashba spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic superconductors manifest a fascinating interplay between their magnetic and superconducting properties. This becomes evident, for example, in the significant enhancement of the upper critical field observed in uranium-based superconductors, or the destruction of superconductivity well below the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in cobalt-doped NbSe$_2$. In this work, we argue that the Kondo interaction plays a pivotal role in governing these behaviors. By employing a periodic Anderson model, we study the Kondo effect in superconductors with either singlet or triplet pairing. In the regime of small impurity energies and high doping concentrations, we find the emergence of a Kondo resistive region below $T_c$. While a magnetic field suppresses singlet superconductivity, it stabilizes triplet pairing through the screening of magnetic impurities, inducing reentrant superconductivity at high fields. Moreover, introducing an antisymmetric spin-orbital coupling suppresses triplet superconductivity. This framework provides a unified picture to understand the observation of Kondo effect in NbSe$_2$ as well as the phase diagrams in Kondo superconductors such as UTe$_2$, and URhGe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider chiral fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs) constructed from lattices and investigate their orbifolds under reflection and shift $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries. For lattices based on binary error-correcting codes, we show the duality between reflection and shift orbifolds using a triality structure inherited from the binary codes. Additionally, we systematically compute the partition functions of the orbifold theories for both binary and nonbinary codes. Finally, we explore applications of this code-based construction in the search for supersymmetric CFTs and chiral fermionic CFTs without continuous symmetries.</description>

      <title>Any Quantum Many-Body State under Local Dissipation will be Disentangled in Finite Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any quantum many-spin state under genetic local dissipation will be fully separable after a finite time independent of the system size. Such a sudden death of many-body entanglement occurs universally provided that there is a finite damping gap and the unique steady-state density matrix is of full rank. This result is rigorously derived by combining a state-reconstruction identity based on random measurements and the convergence bound for quantum channels. Related works and possible generalizations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Chiral phononic and electronic edge modes of EuPtSi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems with P2$_{1}$3 symmetry are characterized by the realization of chiral edge modes, propagating in one direction along closed loops around some high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. We study the phononic and electronic properties of EuPtSi, which crystallizes with P2$_{1}$3 symmetry. EuPtSi is also characterized by intriguing magnetic properties, such as the realization of the skyrmion lattice. Here, using ab initio techniques, we study bulk and slab properties of EuPtSi. The bulk phononic and electronic band structures exhibit a spin-1 Weyl point and a charge-2 Dirac point at the $\Gamma$ and R points, respectively. Consequently, the surface states exhibit chiral edge modes. Such features are present in both the phononic and electronic surface spectra. The chiral phononic edge mode is associated with the vibration of the atoms in close vicinity, while the chiral electronic surface states correspond to carrier accumulation at the edge of chiral atomic chains.</description>

      <title>Imprinted atomic displacements drive spin-orbital order in a vanadate perovskite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskites with the generic composition ABO$_3$ exhibit an enormous variety of quantum states such as magnetism, orbital order, ferroelectricity and superconductivity. Their flexible and comparatively simple structure allows for facile chemical substitution and cube-on-cube combination of different compounds in atomically sharp epitaxial heterostructures. However, already in the bulk, the diverse physical properties of perovskites and their anisotropy are determined by small deviations from the ideal perovskite structure, which are difficult to control. Here we show that directional imprinting of atomic displacements in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator YVO$_3$ is achieved by depositing epitaxial films on different facets of an isostructural substrate. These facets were chosen such that other control parameters, including strain and polarity mismatch with the overlayer, remain unchanged. We use polarized Raman scattering and spectral ellipsometry to detect signatures of staggered orbital and magnetic order, and demonstrate distinct spin-orbital ordering patterns on different facets. These observations can be attributed to the influence of specific octahedral rotation and cation displacement patterns, which are imprinted by the substrate facet, on the covalency of the bonds and the superexchange interactions in YVO$_3$. Well beyond established strain-engineering strategies, our results show that substrate-induced templating of lattice distortion patterns constitutes a powerful pathway for materials design.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the anomalous Hall effect arising from the altermagnetic order and spin-orbit interaction in doped FeSb$_2$. To investigate the anomalous transport, we have constructed a tight-binding model of FeSb$_2$. We separately considered the constraints imposed on the model parameters by the spin symmetry group and magnetic symmetry group at zero and finite spin-orbit interaction, respectively. The resulting model includes the effect of exchange splitting and is applicable at both zero and finite spin-orbit interaction. In the case of spin symmetry, the analysis covers the spin-only subgroup arising from collinear magnetism, as well as non-trivial symmetry elements. This allows us to explore changes in the hopping amplitudes as symmetry is reduced by spin-orbit interaction from the spin group to the magnetic group. While the anomalous Hall effect is forbidden by spin symmetry, it is allowed by the symmetries of the magnetic group. The intrinsic Hall conductivity is shown to vanish linearly with spin-orbit interaction. This non-analytic behavior is universal to altermagnets. It originates from the singularity of the Berry curvature localized along lines on a Fermi surface confined to symmetry planes. These planes host spin degeneracy protected by spin symmetry, which is lifted by spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>High-temperature quantum coherence of spinons in a rare-earth spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that quantum effects become unimportant at high temperatures. In magnets, when the thermal energy exceeds interactions between atomic magnetic moments, the moments are usually uncorrelated, and classical paramagnetic behavior is observed. This thermal decoherence of quantum spin behaviors is a major hindrance to quantum information applications of spin systems. Remarkably, our neutron scattering experiments on Yb chains in an insulating perovskite crystal defy these conventional expectations. We find a sharply defined spectrum of spinons, fractional quantum excitations of spin-1/2 chains, to persist to temperatures much higher than the scale of the interactions between Yb magnetic moments. The observed sharpness of the spinon continuum's dispersive upper boundary indicates a spinon mean free path exceeding $\approx 35$ inter-atomic spacings at temperatures more than an order of magnitude above the interaction energy scale. We thus discover an important and highly unique quantum behavior, which expands the realm of quantumness to high temperatures where entropy-governed classical behaviors were previously believed to dominate. Our results have profound implications for spin systems in quantum information applications operating at finite temperatures and motivate new developments in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Luttinger liquid tensor network: sine versus tangent dispersion of massless Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To apply the powerful many-body techniques of tensor networks to massless Dirac fermions one wants to discretize the $p\cdot\sigma$ Hamiltonian and construct a matrix-product-operator (MPO) representation. We compare two alternative discretization schemes, one with a sine dispersion, the other with a tangent dispersion, applied to a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid with Hubbard interaction. Both types of lattice fermions allow for an exact MPO representation of low bond dimension, so they are efficiently computable, but only the tangent dispersion gives a power law decay of the propagator in agreement with the continuum limit: The sine dispersion is gapped by the interactions, evidenced by an exponentially decaying propagator. Our construction of a tensor network with an unpaired Dirac cone works around the fermion-doubling obstruction by exploiting the fact that the \textit{nonlocal} Hamiltonian of tangent fermions permits a \textit{local} generalized eigenproblem.</description>

      <title>Complexity and order in approximate quantum error-correcting codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish rigorous connections between quantum circuit complexity and approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) capability, two properties of fundamental importance to the physics and practical use of quantum many-body systems, covering systems with both all-to-all connectivity and geometric scenarios like lattice systems in finite spatial dimensions. To this end, we introduce a type of code parameter that we call subsystem variance, which is closely related to the optimal AQEC precision. Our key finding is that, for a code encoding $k$ logical qubits in $n$ physical qubits, if the subsystem variance is below an $O(k/n)$ threshold, then any state in the code subspace must obey certain circuit complexity lower bounds, which identify nontrivial "phases" of codes. Based on our results, we propose $O(k/n)$ as a boundary between subspaces that should and should not count as AQEC codes. This theory of AQEC provides a versatile framework for understanding quantum complexity and order in many-body quantum systems, generating new insights for wide-ranging physical scenarios, in particular topological order and critical quantum systems which are of outstanding importance in many-body and high energy physics. We observe from various different perspectives that roughly $O(1/n)$ represents a common, physically significant "scaling threshold" of subsystem variance for features associated with nontrivial quantum order.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and dynamics of coupled complex SYK models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14644v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known that the large-$q$ complex SYK model falls under the same universality class as that of van der Waals (mean-field) and saturates the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, both features shared by various black holes. This makes the SYK model a useful tool in probing the fundamental nature of quantum chaos and holographic duality. This work establishes the robustness of this shared universality class and chaotic properties for SYK-like models by extending to a system of coupled large-$q$ complex SYK models of different orders. We provide a detailed derivation of thermodynamic properties, specifically the critical exponents for an observed phase transition, as well as dynamical properties, in particular the Lyapunov exponent, via the out-of-time correlator calculations. Our analysis reveals that, despite the introduction of an additional scaling parameter through interaction strength ratios, the system undergoes a continuous phase transition at low temperatures, similar to that of the single SYK model. The critical exponents align with the Landau-Ginzburg (mean-field) universality class, shared with van der Waals gases and various AdS black holes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the coupled SYK system remains maximally chaotic in the large-$q$ limit at low temperatures, adhering to the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford bound, a feature consistent with the single SYK model. These findings establish robustness and open avenues for broader inquiries into the universality and chaos in complex quantum systems. We provide a detailed outlook for future work by considering the "very" low-temperature regime, where we discuss relations with the Hawking-Page phase transition observed in the holographic dual black holes. We present preliminary calculations and discuss the possible follow-ups that might be taken to make the connection robust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how non-adiabatic terms affect quantum dynamics is fundamental to improving various protocols for quantum technologies. We present a novel approach to computing the Adiabatic Gauge Potential (AGP), which gives information on the non-adiabatic terms that arise from time dependence in the Hamiltonian. Our approach uses commutators of the Hamiltonian to build up an appropriate basis of the AGP, which can be easily truncated to give an approximate form when the exact result is intractable. We use this approach to study the AGP obtained for the transverse field Ising model on a variety of graphs, showing how the different underlying graph structures can give rise to very different scaling for the number of terms required in the AGP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons, Coulomb-driven bound states of electrons and holes, are typically composed of integer charges. However, in bilayer systems influenced by charge fractionalization, a more exotic form of interlayer exciton can emerge, where pairing occurs between constituents that carry fractional charges. Despite numerous theoretical predictions for such fractional excitons, their experimental observation has remained elusive. Here, we report transport signatures of excitonic pairing within fractional quantum Hall effect states. By probing the composition of these excitons and their impact on the underlying wavefunction, we uncover two novel quantum phases of matter. One of these orders can be viewed as the fractional counterpart of the exciton condensate at a total filling of one, while the other involves a more unusual type of exciton that obeys fermionic and anyonic quantum statistics, challenging the standard paradigm of bosonic excitons.</description>

      <title>Displacive Jahn--Teller transition in NaNiO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01267v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Below its Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{JT}$, NaNiO$_2$ has a monoclinic layered structure consisting of alternating layers of edge-sharing NaO$_6$ and Jahn-Teller-distorted NiO$_6$ octahedra. Above $T_\mathrm{JT}$ where NaNiO$_2$ is rhombohedral, diffraction measurements show the absence of a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion, accompanied by an increase in the unit cell volume. Using neutron total scattering, solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiments as local probes of the structure we find direct evidence for a displacive, as opposed to order-disorder Jahn-Teller transition at $T_\mathrm{JT}$. This is supported by \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. To our knowledge this study is the first to show a displacive Jahn-Teller transition in any material using direct observations with local probe techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that randomness in quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians results in certain information scrambling diagnostics, mirroring those in chaotic systems. Specifically, for initial Gaussian states, we observe the disappearance of the memory effect in the entanglement dynamics of disjoint blocks and the negative values of tripartite mutual information. We also find that the spectral form factor for these integrable systems exhibits a ramp. However, in contrast to chaotic systems, the ramp is nonlinear, and the out-of-time-ordered correlators display power-law growth for certain operators and Gaussian dynamics. These findings indicate that information scrambling driven by randomness is distinct from quantum chaos. Moreover, our results provide insight into the dynamics of Gaussian states in continuous-variable systems, which are useful and available resources for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a framework for computing the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories has been proposed by Saura-Bastida, Das, Sierra and Molina-Vilaplana [Phys. Rev. D109, 105026]. We revisit their theoretical setup, paying particular attention to possible contributions from the conformal boundary conditions imposed at the entangling surface -- a potential subtlety that was not addressed in the original proposal. We find that the presence of boundaries modifies the construction of projectors onto irreducible sectors, compared to what can be expected from a pure bulk approach. This is a direct consequence of the fusion algebra of non-invertible symmetries being different in the presence or absence of boundaries on which defects can end. We apply our formalism to the case of the Fibonacci category symmetry in the three-state Potts and tricritical Ising model and the Rep($S_3$) fusion category symmetry in the $SU(2)_4$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. We numerically corroborate our findings by simulating critical anyonic chains with these symmetries as a finite lattice substitute for the expected entanglement Hamiltonian. Our predictions for the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries seem to disagree with the recent work by Saura-Bastida et al.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity in altermagnets with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate some possible symmetries of the superconducting state that emerges in three-dimensional altermagnets in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate within a weak-coupling approach that altermagnetic fluctuations with form factor $\boldsymbol{g}_{\mathbf{k}}$ promote spin-triplet superconductivity described by gap functions $\boldsymbol{d}(\mathbf{k}) = \boldsymbol{u}(\mathbf{k}) \times \boldsymbol{g}_{\mathbf{k}}$, such that $\boldsymbol{u}(\mathbf{k}) = - \boldsymbol{u}(-\mathbf{k})$. Consequently, this singles out $f$-wave spin-triplet superconductivity as the most favorable pairing state to appear in the vicinity of $d$-wave altermagnetism. Furthermore, we obtain that the combination of spin-singlet superconducting states with altermagnetism gives rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which are protected by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant. Using a Ginzburg-Landau analysis, we show that, for a class of spin-orbit coupled altermagnetic models, a superconducting phase is expected to appear at low temperatures as an intertwined $d + if$ state, thus breaking time-reversal symmetry spontaneously.</description>
