      <title>Concept Drift Guided LayerNorm Tuning for Efficient Multimodal Metaphor Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaphorical imagination, the ability to connect seemingly unrelated concepts, is fundamental to human cognition and communication. While understanding linguistic metaphors has advanced significantly, grasping multimodal metaphors, such as those found in internet memes, presents unique challenges due to their unconventional expressions and implied meanings. Existing methods for multimodal metaphor identification often struggle to bridge the gap between literal and figurative interpretations. Additionally, generative approaches that utilize large language models or text-to-image models, while promising, suffer from high computational costs. This paper introduces \textbf{C}oncept \textbf{D}rift \textbf{G}uided \textbf{L}ayerNorm \textbf{T}uning (\textbf{CDGLT}), a novel and training-efficient framework for multimodal metaphor identification. CDGLT incorporates two key innovations: (1) Concept Drift, a mechanism that leverages Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP) of cross-modal embeddings from a CLIP encoder to generate a new, divergent concept embedding. This drifted concept helps to alleviate the gap between literal features and the figurative task. (2) A prompt construction strategy, that adapts the method of feature extraction and fusion using pre-trained language models for the multimodal metaphor identification task. CDGLT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MET-Meme benchmark while significantly reducing training costs compared to existing generative methods. Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of both Concept Drift and our adapted LN Tuning approach. Our method represents a significant step towards efficient and accurate multimodal metaphor understanding.

      <title>TCC-Bench: Benchmarking the Traditional Chinese Culture Understanding Capabilities of MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11275v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced the ability of artificial intelligence systems to understand and generate multimodal content. However, these models often exhibit limited effectiveness when applied to non-Western cultural contexts, which raises concerns about their wider applicability. To address this limitation, we propose the Traditional Chinese Culture understanding Benchmark (TCC-Bench), a bilingual (i.e., Chinese and English) Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for assessing the understanding of traditional Chinese culture by MLLMs. TCC-Bench comprises culturally rich and visually diverse data, incorporating images from museum artifacts, everyday life scenes, comics, and other culturally significant contexts. We adopt a semi-automated pipeline that utilizes GPT-4o in text-only mode to generate candidate questions, followed by human curation to ensure data quality and avoid potential data leakage. The benchmark also avoids language bias by preventing direct disclosure of cultural concepts within question texts. Experimental evaluations across a wide range of MLLMs demonstrate that current models still face significant challenges when reasoning about culturally grounded visual content. The results highlight the need for further research in developing culturally inclusive and context-aware multimodal systems.

      <title>NeoLightning: A Modern Reimagination of Gesture-Based Sound Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces NeoLightning, a modern reinterpretation of the Buchla Lightning. NeoLightning preserves the innovative spirit of Don Buchla's "Buchla Lightning" (introduced in the 1990s) while making its gesture-based interaction accessible to contemporary users. While the original Buchla Lightning and many other historical instruments were groundbreaking in their time, they are now largely unsupported, limiting user interaction to indirect experiences. To address this, NeoLightning leverages MediaPipe for deep learning-based gesture recognition and employs Max/MSP and Processing for real-time multimedia processing. The redesigned system offers precise, low-latency gesture recognition and immersive 3D interaction. By merging the creative spirit of the original Lightning with modern advancements, NeoLightning redefines gesture-based musical interaction, expanding possibilities for expressive performance and interactive sound design.</description>

      <title>Textured mesh Quality Assessment using Geometry and Color Field Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Textured mesh quality assessment (TMQA) is critical for various 3D mesh applications. However, existing TMQA methods often struggle to provide accurate and robust evaluations. Motivated by the effectiveness of fields in representing both 3D geometry and color information, we propose a novel point-based TMQA method called field mesh quality metric (FMQM). FMQM utilizes signed distance fields and a newly proposed color field named nearest surface point color field to realize effective mesh feature description. Four features related to visual perception are extracted from the geometry and color fields: geometry similarity, geometry gradient similarity, space color distribution similarity, and space color gradient similarity. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that FMQM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) TMQA metrics. Furthermore, FMQM exhibits low computational complexity, making it a practical and efficient solution for real-world applications in 3D graphics and visualization. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/yyyykf/FMQM.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust and Controllable Text-to-Motion via Masked Autoregressive Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating 3D human motion from text descriptions remains challenging due to the diverse and complex nature of human motion. While existing methods excel within the training distribution, they often struggle with out-of-distribution motions, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Existing VQVAE-based methods often fail to represent novel motions faithfully using discrete tokens, which hampers their ability to generalize beyond seen data. Meanwhile, diffusion-based methods operating on continuous representations often lack fine-grained control over individual frames. To address these challenges, we propose a robust motion generation framework MoMADiff, which combines masked modeling with diffusion processes to generate motion using frame-level continuous representations. Our model supports flexible user-provided keyframe specification, enabling precise control over both spatial and temporal aspects of motion synthesis. MoMADiff demonstrates strong generalization capability on novel text-to-motion datasets with sparse keyframes as motion prompts. Extensive experiments on two held-out datasets and two standard benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in motion quality, instruction fidelity, and keyframe adherence.</description>

      <title>Classifying Shelf Life Quality of Pineapples by Combining Audio and Visual Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the shelf life quality of pineapples using non-destructive methods is a crucial step to reduce waste and increase income. In this paper, a multimodal and multiview classification model was constructed to classify pineapples into four quality levels based on audio and visual characteristics. For research purposes, we compiled and released the PQC500 dataset consisting of 500 pineapples with two modalities: one was tapping pineapples to record sounds by multiple microphones and the other was taking pictures by multiple cameras at different locations, providing multimodal and multi-view audiovisual features. We modified the contrastive audiovisual masked autoencoder to train the cross-modal-based classification model by abundant combinations of audio and visual pairs. In addition, we proposed to sample a compact size of training data for efficient computation. The experiments were evaluated under various data and model configurations, and the results demonstrated that the proposed cross-modal model trained using audio-major sampling can yield 84% accuracy, outperforming the unimodal models of only audio and only visual by 6% and 18%, respectively.</description>

      <title>The heteronomy of algorithms: Traditional knowledge and computational knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If an active citizen should increasingly be a computationally enlightened one, replacing the autonomy of reason with the heteronomy of algorithms, then I argue in this article that we must begin teaching the principles of critiquing the computal through new notions of what we might call digital Bildung. Indeed, if civil society itself is mediated by computational systems and media, the public use of reason must also be complemented by skills for negotiating and using these computal forms to articulate such critique. Not only is there a need to raise the intellectual tone regarding computation and its related softwarization processes, but there is an urgent need to attend to the likely epistemic challenges from computation which, as presently constituted, tends towards justification through a philosophy of utility rather than through a philosophy of care for the territory of the intellect. We therefore need to develop an approach to this field that uses concepts and methods drawn from philosophy, politics, history, anthropology, sociology, media studies, computer science, and the humanities more generally, to try to understand these issues - particularly the way in which software and data increasingly penetrate our everyday life and the pressures and fissures that are created. We must, in other words, move to undertake a critical interdisciplinary research program to understand the way in which these systems are created, instantiated, and normatively engendered in both specific and general contexts.</description>

      <title>A Multi-modal Fusion Network for Terrain Perception Based on Illumination Aware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Road terrains play a crucial role in ensuring the driving safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, existing sensors of AVs, including cameras and Lidars, are susceptible to variations in lighting and weather conditions, making it challenging to achieve real-time perception of road conditions. In this paper, we propose an illumination-aware multi-modal fusion network (IMF), which leverages both exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception and optimizes the fusion process based on illumination features. We introduce an illumination-perception sub-network to accurately estimate illumination features. Moreover, we design a multi-modal fusion network which is able to dynamically adjust weights of different modalities according to illumination features. We enhance the optimization process by pre-training of the illumination-perception sub-network and incorporating illumination loss as one of the training constraints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the IMF shows a superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The comparison results with single modality perception methods highlight the comprehensive advantages of multi-modal fusion in accurately perceiving road terrains under varying lighting conditions. Our dataset is available at: https://github.com/lindawang2016/IMF.</description>

      <title>MAVOS-DD: Multilingual Audio-Video Open-Set Deepfake Detection Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first large-scale open-set benchmark for multilingual audio-video deepfake detection. Our dataset comprises over 250 hours of real and fake videos across eight languages, with 60% of data being generated. For each language, the fake videos are generated with seven distinct deepfake generation models, selected based on the quality of the generated content. We organize the training, validation and test splits such that only a subset of the chosen generative models and languages are available during training, thus creating several challenging open-set evaluation setups. We perform experiments with various pre-trained and fine-tuned deepfake detectors proposed in recent literature. Our results show that state-of-the-art detectors are not currently able to maintain their performance levels when tested in our open-set scenarios. We publicly release our data and code at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/unibuc-cs/MAVOS-DD.</description>

      <title>Seeing Sound, Hearing Sight: Uncovering Modality Bias and Conflict of AI models in Sound Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine hearing a dog bark and turning toward the sound only to see a parked car, while the real, silent dog sits elsewhere. Such sensory conflicts test perception, yet humans reliably resolve them by prioritizing sound over misleading visuals. Despite advances in multimodal AI integrating vision and audio, little is known about how these systems handle cross-modal conflicts or whether they favor one modality. In this study, we systematically examine modality bias and conflict resolution in AI sound localization. We assess leading multimodal models and benchmark them against human performance in psychophysics experiments across six audiovisual conditions, including congruent, conflicting, and absent cues. Humans consistently outperform AI, demonstrating superior resilience to conflicting or missing visuals by relying on auditory information. In contrast, AI models often default to visual input, degrading performance to near chance levels. To address this, we finetune a state-of-the-art model using a stereo audio-image dataset generated via 3D simulations. Even with limited training data, the refined model surpasses existing benchmarks. Notably, it also mirrors human-like horizontal localization bias favoring left-right precision-likely due to the stereo audio structure reflecting human ear placement. These findings underscore how sensory input quality and system architecture shape multimodal representation accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Video generation driven by artificial intelligence has advanced significantly, enabling the creation of dynamic and realistic content. However, maintaining character consistency across video sequences remains a major challenge, with current models struggling to ensure coherence in appearance and attributes. This paper introduces the Face Consistency Benchmark (FCB), a framework for evaluating and comparing the consistency of characters in AI-generated videos. By providing standardized metrics, the benchmark highlights gaps in existing solutions and promotes the development of more reliable approaches. This work represents a crucial step toward improving character consistency in AI video generation technologies.</description>

      <title>Question-Answering Dense Video Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04388v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents question-answering on dense video events, a novel task that answers and grounds dense-event questions in long videos, thus challenging MLLMs to faithfully comprehend and reason about multiple events over extended periods of time. To facilitate the study, we construct DeVE-QA -- a dataset featuring 78K questions about 26K events on 10.6K long videos. Our benchmarking shows that state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle on DeVE-QA. For improvement, we propose DeVi, a novel training-free MLLM approach that highlights a hierarchical captioning module, a temporal event memory module, and a self-consistency checking module to respectively detect, contextualize and memorize, and ground dense-events in long videos for question answering. Extensive experiments show that DeVi is superior at answering dense-event questions and grounding relevant video moments. Compared with existing MLLMs, it achieves a notable increase of 4.8% and 2.1% for G(round)QA accuracy on DeVE-QA and NExT-GQA, respectively. Data and code are available at https://github.com/QHUni/DeVE-QA.</description>
