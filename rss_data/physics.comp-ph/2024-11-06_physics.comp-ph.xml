      <title>A Robust and Efficient Multi-physics Numerical System for Intensive Blast Wave Propagation in Complex Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a high-resolution, high-performance, and high-confidence compressible multiphysics system in a Cartesian grid with irregular boundary topologies to simulate intensive blast waves propagating in large-scale and extremely complex environments. The multiphysics system is modeled by a multi-component model solved using a generalized Godunov method and a classical material point method in a combination of Lagrangian particles and a rigid material model. An artificial neural network equation of state (EOS) is proposed based on experimental data to simulate the intensive explosion products and real gas under extreme pressure and temperature. To improve computational accuracy and efficiency, a deepMTBVD reconstruction scheme of our previous work is extended to the multiphysics system. With the aid of high-performance parallel computation, several large-scale blast wave applications, such as blast wave propagating in a local and entire urban city, are simulated in a reasonable time period, which can validate numerical schemes and lead to more practical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>SK-PINN: Accelerated physics-informed deep learning by smoothing kernel gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automatic differentiation (AD) in the vanilla physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is the computational bottleneck for the high-efficiency analysis. The concept of derivative discretization in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) can provide an accelerated training method for PINNs. In this paper, smoothing kernel physics-informed neural networks (SK-PINNs) are established, which solve differential equations using smoothing kernel discretization. It is a robust framework capable of solving problems in the computational mechanics of complex domains. When the number of collocation points gradually increases, the training speed of SK-PINNs significantly surpasses that of vanilla PINNs. In cases involving large collocation point sets or higher-order problems, SK-PINN training can be up to tens of times faster than vanilla PINN. Additionally, analysis using neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory shows that the convergence rates of SK-PINNs are consistent with those of vanilla PINNs. The superior performance of SK-PINNs is demonstrated through various examples, including regular and complex domains, as well as forward and inverse problems in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Monte Carlo Simulation for Radiation Transport Based on Global Optimal Reference Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reference field method, known as the difference formulation, is a key variance reduction technique for Monte Carlo simulations of thermal radiation transport problems. When the material temperature is relatively high and the spatial temperature gradient is moderate, this method demonstrates significant advantages in reducing variance compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. However, in problems with larger temperature gradients, this method has not only been found ineffective at reducing statistical noise, but in some cases, it even increases noise compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. The global optimal reference field method, a recently proposed variance reduction technique, effectively reduces the average energy weight of Monte Carlo particles, thereby decreasing variance. Its effectiveness has been validated both theoretically and numerically, demonstrating a significant reduction in statistical errors for problems with large temperature gradients. In our previous work, instead of computing the exact global optimal reference field, we developed an approximate, physically motivated method to find a relatively better reference field using a selection scheme. In this work, we reformulate the problem of determining the global optimal reference field as a linear programming problem and solve it exactly. To further enhance computational efficiency, we use the MindOpt solver, which leverages graph neural network methods. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the MindOpt solver not only solves linear programming problems accurately but also significantly outperforms the Simplex and interior-point methods in terms of computational efficiency. The global optimal reference field method combined with the MindOpt solver not only improves computational efficiency but also substantially reduces statistical errors.</description>

      <title>Computing critical exponents in 3D Ising model via pattern recognition/deep learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we computed three critical exponents ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$) for the 3D Ising model with Metropolis Algorithm using Finite-Size Scaling Analysis on six cube length scales (L=20,30,40,60,80,90), and performed a supervised Deep Learning (DL) approach (3D Convolutional Neural Network or CNN) to train a neural network on specific conformations of spin states. We find one can effectively reduce the information in thermodynamic ensemble-averaged quantities vs. reduced temperature t (magnetization per spin $&lt;m&gt;(t)$, specific heat per spin $&lt;c&gt;(t)$, magnetic susceptibility per spin $&lt;\chi&gt;(t)$) to \textit{six} latent classes. We also demonstrate our CNN on a subset of L=20 conformations and achieve a train/test accuracy of 0.92 and 0.6875, respectively. However, more work remains to be done to quantify the feasibility of computing critical exponents from the output class labels (binned $m, c, \chi$) from this approach and interpreting the results from DL models trained on systems in Condensed Matter Physics in general.</description>

      <title>KinetiX: A performance portable code generator for chemical kinetics and transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present KinetiX, a software toolkit to generate computationally efficient fuel-specific routines for the chemical source term, thermodynamic and mixture-averaged transport properties for use in combustion simulation codes. The C++ routines are designed for high-performance execution on both CPU and GPU architectures. On CPUs, chemical kinetics computations are optimized by eliminating redundant operations and using data alignment and loops with trivial access patterns that enable auto-vectorization, reducing the latency of complex mathematical operations. On GPUs, performance is improved by loop unrolling, reducing the number of costly exponential evaluations and limiting the number of live variables for better register usage. The accuracy of the generated routines is checked against reference values computed using Cantera and the maximum relative errors are below $10^{-5}\%$. We evaluate the performance of the kernels on some of the latest CPU and GPU architectures from AMD and NVIDIA, i.e., AMD EPYC 9653, AMD MI250X, and NVIDIA H100. The routines generated by KinetiX outperform the general-purpose Cantera library, achieving speedups of up to 2.4x for species production rates and 3.2x for mixture-averaged transport properties on CPUs. Compared to the routines generated by PelePhysics (CEPTR), KinetiX achieves speedups of up to 2.6x on CPUs and 1.7x on GPUs for the species production rates kernel on a single-threaded basis.</description>

      <title>Adaptive-precision potentials for large-scale atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale atomistic simulations rely on interatomic potentials providing an efficient representation of atomic energies and forces. Modern machine-learning (ML) potentials provide the most precise representation compared to electronic structure calculations while traditional potentials provide a less precise, but computationally much faster representation and thus allow simulations of larger systems. We present a method to combine a traditional and a ML potential to a multi-resolution description, leading to an adaptive-precision potential with an optimum of performance and precision in large complex atomistic systems. The required precision is determined per atom by a local structure analysis and updated automatically during simulation. We use copper as demonstrator material with an embedded atom model as classical force field and an atomic cluster expansion (ACE) as ML potential, but in principle a broader class of potential combinations can be coupled by this method. The approach is developed for the molecular-dynamics simulator LAMMPS and includes a load-balancer to prevent problems due to the atom dependent force-calculation times, which makes it suitable for large-scale atomistic simulations. The developed adaptive-precision copper potential represents the ACE-forces and -energies with a precision of 10 meV/{\AA} and 0 meV for the precisely calculated atoms in a nanoindentation of 4 million atoms calculated for 100 ps and shows a speedup of 11.3 compared with a full ACE simulation.</description>

      <title>Ka-chow! A simple irregular 2D lattice model of lightning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model of lightning that captures the propagation of lightning channels on an irregular lattice is developed. The irregular lattice allows us to capture large two-dimensional systems (2 km x 2 km), while allowing grid refinement (on the order of cm) near areas of interest. Furthermore, the direction of lightning propagation is not biased in the orthogonal or diagonal directions of regular lattices. The probability of lightning strikes on people in standing positions, people in crouched positions, people near a tree and cattle are estimated.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the inference of ratings and rankings on Higher Order Networks with complex topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inference of rankings plays a central role in the theory of social choice, which seeks to establish preferences from collectively generated data, such as pairwise comparisons. Examples include political elections, ranking athletes based on competition results, ordering web pages in search engines using hyperlink networks, and generating recommendations in online stores based on user behavior. Various methods have been developed to infer rankings from incomplete or conflicting data. One such method, HodgeRank, introduced by Jiang et al.~\cite{jiang2011statistical}, utilizes Hodge decomposition of cochains in Higher Order Networks to disentangle gradient and cyclical components contributing to rating scores, enabling a parsimonious inference of ratings and rankings for lists of items. This paper presents a systematic study of HodgeRank's performance under the influence of quenched disorder and across networks with complex topologies generated by four different network models. The results reveal a transition from a regime of perfect trieval of true rankings to one of imperfect trieval as the strength of the quenched disorder increases. A range of observables are analyzed, and their scaling behavior with respect to the network model parameters is characterized. This work advances the understanding of social choice theory and the inference of ratings and rankings within complex network structures.</description>

      <title>Towards Monte Carlo based Full Spectrum Modeling of Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This monograph presents advancements in Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS), a critical tool for emergency response to radiological incidents such as severe nuclear accidents or nuclear weapon detonations. Current AGRS calibration and data evaluation methods struggle to accurately quantify many radioactive materials expected in radiological emergencies, limiting the risk assessment and, hence, the effectiveness of emergency response actions. To address these limitations, this work introduces a full spectrum numerical modeling approach that features three key innovations: high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations that combine an advanced scintillation physics model with detailed geometric representations of the aircraft and detector system; a surrogate model that replicates the Monte Carlo simulations with significantly reduced computation time; and a data evaluation methodology that leverages the surrogate model within a Bayesian inversion framework, enabling the quantification of arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. The methodology presented here, rigorously validated through laboratory and field measurements, achieves not only a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over traditional methods but also substantially expands the operational capabilities of AGRS systems for both emergency response scenarios and geophysical surveys. These innovations lay the groundwork for establishing a new global standard for AGRS, ultimately supporting better-informed protective actions and reducing health risks during radiological emergencies.</description>

      <title>An explicit numerical scheme for Milne's phase-amplitude equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an explicit numerical method to solve Milne's phase-amplitude equations. Previously proposed methods solve directly Milne's nonlinear equation for the amplitude. For that reason, they exhibit high sensitivity to errors and are prone to instability through the growth of a spurious, rapidly varying component of the amplitude. This makes the systematic use of these methods difficult. On the contrary, the present method is based on solving a linear third-order equation which is equivalent to the nonlinear amplitude equation. This linear equation was derived by Kiyokawa, who used it to obtain analytical results on Coulomb wavefunctions [Kiyokawa, AIP Advances, 2015]. The present method uses this linear equation for numerical computation, thus resolving the problem of the growth of a rapidly varying component.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Practical, optimal preparation of general quantum state with exponentially improved robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02782v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation, as a general process of loading classical data to quantum device, is essential for end-to-end implementation of quantum algorithms. Yet, existing methods suffer from either high circuit depth or complicated hardware, limiting their practicality and robustness. In this work, we overcome these limitations with a bucket-brigade approach. The tree architectures of our hardware represents the simplest connectivity required for achieving sub-exponential circuit depth. Leveraging the bucket-brigade mechanism that can suppress the error propagation between different branches, our approach exhibit exponential improvement on the robustness compared to existing depth-optimal methods. More specifically, the infidelity scales as $O(\text{polylog}(N))$ with data size $N$, as oppose to $O(N)$ for conventional methods. Moreover, our approach is the first to simultaneously achieve linear Clifford$+T$ circuit depth, gate count number, and space-time allocation. These advancements offer the opportunity for processing big data in both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Utilizing a machine-learned potential to explore enhanced radiation tolerance in the MoNbTaVW high-entropy alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) based on tungsten (W) have emerged as promising candidates for plasma-facing components in future fusion reactors, owing to their excellent irradiation resistance. In this study, we construct an efficient machine-learned interatomic potential for the MoNbTaVW quinary system. This potential achieves computational speeds comparable to the embedded-atom method (EAM) potential, allowing us to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the primary radiation damage through molecular dynamics simulations. Threshold displacement energies (TDEs) in the MoNbTaVW HEA are investigated and compared with pure metals. A series of displacement cascade simulations at primary knock-on atom energies ranging from 10 to 150 keV reveal significant differences in defect generation and clustering between MoNbTaVW HEA and pure W. In HEAs, we observe more surviving Frenkel pairs (FPs) but fewer and smaller interstitial clusters compared to W, indicating superior radiation tolerance. We propose extended damage models to quantify the radiation dose in the MoNbTaVW HEA, and suggest that one reason for their enhanced resistance is subcascade splitting, which reduces the formation of interstitial clusters. Our findings provide critical insights into the fundamental irradiation resistance mechanisms in refractory body-centered cubic alloys, offering guidance for the design of future radiation-tolerant materials.</description>

      <title>A variational quantum algorithm for tackling multi-dimensional Poisson equations with inhomogeneous boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a variational quantum algorithm to solve multi-dimensional Poisson equations with mixed boundary conditions that are typically required in various fields of computational science. Employing an objective function that is formulated with the concept of the minimal potential energy, we not only present in-depth discussion on the cost-efficient &amp; noise-robust design of quantum circuits that are essential for evaluation of the objective function, but, more remarkably, employ the proposed algorithm to calculate bias-dependent spatial distributions of electric fields in semiconductor systems that are described with a two-dimensional domain and up to 10-qubit circuits. Extending the application scope to multi-dimensional problems with mixed boundary conditions for the first time, fairly solid computational results of this work clearly demonstrate the potential of variational quantum algorithms to tackle Poisson equations derived from physically meaningful problems.</description>

      <title>Molecular Origins of Exciton Condensation in Van der Waals Heterostructure Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have realized exciton condensation in bilayer materials such as graphene double layers and the van der Waals heterostructure MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$ with the potential for nearly frictionless energy transport. Here we computationally observe the microscopic beginnings of exciton condensation in a molecular-scale fragment of MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$, using advanced electronic structure methods based on reduced density matrices. We establish a connection between the signature of exciton condensation -- the presence of a large eigenvalue in the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- and experimental evidence of exciton condensation in the material. The presence of a "critical seed" of exciton condensation in a molecular-scale fragment of a heterostructure bilayer provides insight into how local short-range strongly correlated effects may give rise to macroscopic exciton condensation. We find that molecular-scale properties such as layer alignment and interlayer distance can impact the formation of nonclassical long-range order in heterostructure bilayers, demonstrating the importance of geometric considerations for the rational design of exciton condensate material. Mechanistic insights into the microscopic origins of exciton condensation have potential implications for the design and development of new materials with enhanced energy transport properties.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Dynamic Network Model of the Space Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes to model the space environment as a stochastic dynamic network where each node is a group of objects of a given class, or species, and their relationship is represented by stochastic links. A set of stochastic dynamic equations, governing the evolution of the network, are derived from the network structure and topology. It will be shown that the proposed system of stochastic dynamic equations well reproduces existing results on the evolution of the space environment. The analysis of the structure of the network and relationships among node can help to understand which species of objects and orbit regimes are more critical and affect the most the future evolution of the space environment. In analogy with ecological networks, we develop a theory of the carrying capacity of space based on the stability of equilibria of the network dynamics. Some examples are presented starting from the current population of resident objects and different launch traffic forecast models. It will be shown how the proposed network model can be used to study the effect of the adoption of different policies on the execution of collision avoidance and post mission disposal manoeuvres.</description>

      <title>Fighting Gravity Gradient Noise with Gradient-Based Optimization at the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravity gradient noise in gravitational wave detectors originates from density fluctuations in the adjacency of the interferometer mirrors. At the Einstein Telescope, this noise source is expected to be dominant for low frequencies. Its impact is proposed to be reduced with the help of an array of seismometers that will be placed around the interferometer endpoints. We reformulate and implement the problem of finding the optimal seismometer positions in a differentiable way. We then explore the use of first-order gradient-based optimization for the design of the seismometer array for 1 Hz and 10 Hz and compare its performance and computational cost to two metaheuristic algorithms. For 1 Hz, we introduce a constraint term to prevent unphysical optimization results in the gradient-based method. In general, we find that it is an efficient strategy to initialize the gradient-based optimizer with a fast metaheuristic algorithm. For a small number of seismometers, this strategy results in approximately the same noise reduction as with the metaheuristics. For larger numbers of seismometers, gradient-based optimization outperforms the two metaheuristics by a factor of 2.25 for the faster of the two and a factor of 1.4 for the other one, which is significantly outperformed by gradient-based optimization in terms of computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of blazed gratings under conical incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A topology optimization method is presented and applied to a blazed diffraction grating in reflection under conical incidence. This type of gratings is meant to disperse the incident light on one particular diffraction order and this property is fundamental in spectroscopy. Conventionally, a blazed metallic grating is made of a sawtooth profile designed to work with the +/-1st diffraction order in reflection. In this paper, we question this intuitive triangular pattern and look for optimal opto-geometric characteristics using topology optimization based on Finite Element modelling of Maxwell's equations. In practical contexts, the grating geometry is mono-periodic but it is enlightened by a 3D plane wave with a wavevector outside of the plane of invariance. Consequently, this study deals with the resolution of a direct and inverse problem using the Finite Element Method in this intermediate state between 2D and 3D: the so-called conical incidence. A multi-wavelength objective is used in order to obtain a broadband blazed effect. Finally, several numerical experiments are detailed. The results show that it is possible to reach a 98% diffraction efficiency on the -1st diffraction order if the optimization is performed on a single wavelength, and that the reflection integrated over the [400,1500]nm wavelength range can be 29% higher in absolute terms, 56% in relative terms, than that of the sawtooth blazed grating when using a multi-wavelength optimization criterion (from 52% to 81%).</description>

      <title>Extreme Value Statistics of Community Detection in Complex Networks with Reduced Network Extremal Ensemble Learning (RenEEL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arguably, the most fundamental problem in Network Science is finding structure within a complex network. One approach is to partition the nodes into communities that are more densely connected than one expects in a random network. "The" community structure then corresponds to the partition that maximizes Modularity, an objective function that quantifies this idea. Finding the maximizing partition, however, is a computationally difficult, NP-Complete problem. We explore using a recently introduced machine-learning algorithmic scheme to find the structure of benchmark networks. The scheme, known as RenEEL, creates an ensemble of $K$ partitions and updates the ensemble by replacing its worst member with the best of $L$ partitions found by analyzing a simplified network. The updating continues until consensus is achieved within the ensemble. We perform an empirical study of three real-world networks to explore how the Modularity of the consensus partition depends on the values of $K$ and $L$ and relate the results to the extreme value statistics of record-breaking. We find that increasing $K$ is generally more effective than increasing $L$ for finding the best partition.</description>

      <title>Basis set generation and optimization in the NISQ era with Quiqbox.jl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, ab initio computation of the electronic structure problems has become one of the major benchmarks for identifying the boundary between classical and quantum computational power. Basis sets play a key role in the electronic structure methods implemented on both classical and quantum devices. To investigate the consequences of the single-particle basis sets, we propose a framework for more customizable basis set generation and optimization. This framework allows composite basis sets to go beyond typical basis set frameworks, such as atomic basis sets, by introducing the concept of mixed-contracted Gaussian-type orbitals. These basis set generations set the stage for more flexible variational optimization of basis set parameters. To realize this framework, we have developed an open-source software package named ``Quiqbox'' in the Julia programming language. We demonstrate various examples of using Quiqbox for basis set optimization and generation, ranging from optimizing atomic basis sets on the Hartree--Fock level, preparing the initial state for VQE computation, and constructing basis sets with completely delocalized orbitals. We also include various benchmarks of Quiqbox for basis set optimization and ab initial electronic structure computation.</description>

      <title>The role of electronic excited states in the spin-lattice relaxation of spin-1/2 molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance is a prime method for the study of chemical and biological structures and their dynamical processes. The interpretation of these experiments relies on considering the spin of electrons as the sole relevant degree of freedom. By applying ab inito open quantum systems theory to the full electronic wavefunction, here we show that contrary to this widespread framework the thermalization of the unpaired electron spin of two Cr(V) coordination compounds is driven by virtual transitions to excited states with energy higher than 20,000 cm$^{-1}$ instead of solely involving low-energy spin interactions such as Zeeman and hyperfine ones. Moreover, we found that a window of low-energy THz phonons contributes to thermalization, rather than a small number of high-energy vibrations. This work provides a drastic reinterpretation of relaxation in spin-1/2 systems and its chemical control strategies, and ultimately exemplifies the urgency of further advancing an ab initio approach to relaxometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the microcanonical thermal pure quantum (mTPQ) method, the canonical ensemble is derived using Taylor series expansions. We prove that the truncation error decreases exponentially with system size when the effective temperature of the mTPQ state is smaller than the target temperature, and otherwise, the error remains constant. We also show the discipline to set the mTPQ parameter by considering the trade-off between the error and the numerical cost.</description>

      <title>Mode-Dependent Phonon Relaxation in fcc Ni: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Frozen-Trajectory Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computational study of phonon relaxation in face-centered cubic (fcc) nickel (Ni), focusing on ultra-fast magnetization dynamics. The phonons are excited beyond their thermal equilibrium population, and the relaxation behavior is analyzed as a function of both wave vector ($\vec{q}$) and phonon frequency ($\omega$). To efficiently investigate these excitations, we introduce a trajectory post-processing technique, the frozen-trajectory excitation, which facilitates the $(\vec{q},\omega)$-resolved analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with the frozen-phonon multislice method predict relaxation signatures observable with time-resolved transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 10 -- 20 fs resolution. Our findings indicate mode dependence in the relaxation processes, highlighting the importance of phonon-specific behavior consideration in ultrafast dynamics.</description>

      <title>Designed self-assembly of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.</description>
