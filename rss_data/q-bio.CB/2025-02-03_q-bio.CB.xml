      <title>Three-dimensional chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for helical motion of microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites, for example the ones causing the disease malaria. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. Here we introduce a stochastic dynamics model for chiral self-propelled particles, for which both propulsion force and torque are internally generated, the latter stochastically by an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process. We demonstrate that a truncated version of the full model can be solved analytically, in very good agreement with computer simulations for the full model. Our main result is that this model allows for larger long-time mean squared displacements for helical compared to straight 3D movement at the same speed, suggesting an evolutionary benefit of the often observed helical movements of microorganisms, and opposite to the reduction of diffusion caused by chirality in 2D. We then provide an experimental example by analyzing imaging data for malaria parasites that glide through hydrogels on helical trajectories.</description>

      <title>Single cell resolution 3D imaging and segmentation within intact live tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epithelial cells form diverse structures from squamous spherical organoids to densely packed pseudostratified tissues. Quantification of cellular properties in these contexts requires high-resolution deep imaging and computational techniques to achieve truthful three-dimensional (3D) structural features. Here, we describe a detailed step-by-step protocol for sample preparation, imaging and deep-learning-assisted cell segmentation to achieve accurate quantification of fluorescently labelled individual cells in 3D within live tissues. We share the lessons learned through troubleshooting 3D imaging of Drosophila wing discs, including considerations on the choice of microscopy modality and settings (objective, sample mounting) and available segmentation methods. In addition, we include a computational pipeline alongside custom code to assist replication of the protocol. While we focus on the segmentation of cell outlines from membrane labelling, this protocol applies to a wide variety of samples, and we believe it be valuable for studying other tissues that demand complex analysis in 3D.</description>
