      <title>Synchronization and desynchronization in ensembles of mobile agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanisms of emergence and destruction are analyzed, as well as characteristics of synchronous and asynchronous modes of behavior of ensembles (swarms) of interacting mobile agents moving according to chaotic phase trajectories of Rossler and Lorenz systems. The possibility of organizing sequential and parallel motion of agents based on the effect of chaotic phase synchronization is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Chimera states in a system of stationary and flying-through deterministic particles with an internal degree of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effect of the emergence of chimera states in a system of coexisting stationary and flying-through in potential particles with an internal degree of freedom determined by the phase. All particles tend to an equilibrium state with a small number of potential wells, which leads to the emergence of a stationary chimera. An increase in the number of potential wells leads to the emergence of particles flying-through along the medium, the phases of which form a moving chimera. Further, these two structures coexist and interact with each other. In this case, an increase in the local synchronization degree of the chimera is observed in the areas of the synchronous cluster location.</description>

      <title>Chaotic mixing in plane Couette turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian tracer particle trajectories for invariant solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations confined to the three-dimensional geometry of plane Couette flow are studied. Treating the Eulerian velocity field of an invariant solution as a dynamical system, the transport of these passive scalars along Lagrangian flow trajectories reveals a rich repertoire of different types of motion that can occur, including stagnation points, for which there is no fluid movement, and invariant tori, which obstruct chaotic mixing across the full volume of the plane Couette flow minimal cell. We determine the stability of these stagnation points, along with their stable and unstable manifolds, and find heteroclinic connections between them. These topological features produce a skeleton that shapes the passive tracer flow for a turbulent fluid, providing a first step to elucidating Lagrangian particle transport and mixing in three-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in Mixed Phase Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Krylov complexity of thermofield double states in systems with mixed phase space, uncovering a direct correlation with the Brody distribution, which interpolates between Poisson and Wigner statistics. Our analysis spans two-dimensional random matrix models featuring (I) GOE-Poisson and (II) GUE-Poisson transitions and extends to higher-dimensional cases, including a stringy matrix model (GOE-Poisson) and the mass-deformed SYK model (GUE-Poisson). Krylov complexity consistently emerges as a reliable marker of quantum chaos, displaying a characteristic peak in the chaotic regime that gradually diminishes as the Brody parameter approaches zero, signaling a shift toward integrability. These results establish Krylov complexity as a powerful diagnostic of quantum chaos and highlight its interplay with eigenvalue statistics in mixed phase systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of McMillan mappings III. Symmetric map with mixed nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article extends the study of dynamical properties of the symmetric McMillan map, emphasizing its utility in understanding and modeling complex nonlinear systems. Although the map features six parameters, we demonstrate that only two are irreducible: the linearized rotation number at the fixed point and a nonlinear parameter representing the ratio of terms in the biquadratic invariant. Through a detailed analysis, we classify regimes of stable motion, provide exact solutions to the mapping equations, and derive a canonical set of action-angle variables, offering analytical expressions for the rotation number and nonlinear tune shift. We further establish connections between general standard-form mappings and the symmetric McMillan map, using the area-preserving H\'enon map and accelerator lattices with thin sextupole magnet as representative case studies. Our results show that, despite being a second-order approximation, the symmetric McMillan map provides a highly accurate depiction of dynamics across a wide range of system parameters, demonstrating its practical relevance in both theoretical and applied contexts.</description>
