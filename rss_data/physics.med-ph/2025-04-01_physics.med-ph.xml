      <title>Correlative Symmetric Index: An alternative mathematical evaluation for beam profile symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work assess the accuracy of standard profile beam symmetry metrics used in radiotherapy quality assurance and compare them to the proposed correlative symmetric index metric and Structural similarity index. The objective is to propose a new method based on cross correlation, named correlative symmetric index, that we show is less susceptible to noise than traditional methods. In addition, a supplemental method called Structural Similarity Index is presented.Simulations of non symmetric beams with similar left and right areas were used to compare the effectiveness of quantifying beam symmetry through proposed and standard methods. To assess each metric dependence on noise, an assessment was performed on all metrics using a noisy, simulated, non symmetric beam profile. A comparison of standard and proposed methods was also performed to characterize beam symmetry of roughly symmetric beam profiles measures at different depths in a water tank.In quantifying beam symmetry, the proposed correlative index metric and Structural Similarity Index method resulted in values 0.387, 0.5401, respectively for the non symmetric noisy scenario. More traditional approaches of PDQ and area based symmetry resulted in values of 0.312 and 0.400, respectively, for the non symmetric noisy scenario. The corresponding percentage change between the non symmetric no noise and the non symmetric with noise for the Point Difference Quotient, area based symmetric value, Structural Similarity Index Measurement, and Correlative symmetric index were 0.111, 0.056, 0.1625, 0.008, respectively. For the clinical measured symmetric profiles all methods achieved values above 0.9. Comparisons of quantitative and qualitative metrics demonstrate that the proposed correlative symmetry index method outperforms both the pointwise and area based symmetric metrics for when beam profiles are noisy.</description>

      <title>Development of a Miniaturized, Automated, and Cost-Effective Device for Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a miniaturized, automated, and cost-effective ELISA device is designed and implemented, without the utilization of conventional techniques such as pipetting or microfluidic valve technologies. The device has dimensions of 24 cm x 19 cm x 14 cm and weighs &lt;3 Kg. The total hardware cost of the device is estimated to be approximately $1,200, which can be further reduced through optimization during scale-up production. 3D printed disposable parts, including the reagent reservoir disk and the microfluidic connector, have also been developed. IL-6 is used as a model system to demonstrate how the device provides an ELISA measurement. The cost per test is estimated to be less than ten dollars. The compactness, automated operation, along with the cost-effectiveness of this ELISA device, makes it suitable for point-of-care applications in resource-limited regions.</description>

      <title>Anthropomorphic tissue-mimicking phantoms for oximetry validation in multispectral optical imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significance: Optical imaging of blood oxygenation (sO$_2$) can be achieved based on the differential absorption spectra of oxy- and deoxy-haemoglobin. A key challenge in realising clinical validation of the sO$_2$ biomarkers is the absence of reliable sO$_2$ reference standards, including test objects.
  Aim: To enable quantitative testing of multispectral imaging methods for assessment of sO$_2$ by introducing anthropomorphic phantoms with appropriate tissue-mimicking optical properties.
  Approach: We used the stable copolymer-in-oil base material to create physical anthropomorphic structures and optimised dyes to mimic the optical absorption of blood across a wide spectral range. Using 3D-printed phantom moulds generated from a magnetic resonance image of a human forearm, we moulded the material into an anthropomorphic shape. Using both reflectance hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and photoacoustic tomography (PAT), we acquired images of the forearm phantoms and evaluated the performance of linear spectral unmixing (LSU).
  Results: Based on 10 fabricated forearm phantoms with vessel-like structures featuring five distinct sO$_2$ levels (between 0 and 100%), we showed that the measured absorption spectra of the material correlated well with HSI and PAT data with a Pearson correlation coefficient consistently above 0.8. Further, the application of LSU enabled a quantification of the mean absolute error in sO$_2$ assessment with HSI and PAT.
  Conclusion: Our anthropomorphic tissue-mimicking phantoms hold potential to provide a robust tool for developing, standardising, and validating optical imaging of sO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Construction and characterisation of a coded-mask gamma camera for beam range monitoring in proton therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The major advantage of proton therapy over conventional radiotherapy is the dose deposition pattern, enabling precise coverage of the tumour volume while sparing nearby healthy tissues. However, accurate control of the proton beam range online during patient irradiation is still considered a challenge. Thus, there are extensive efforts to develop a detector capable of in vivo beam range monitoring for proton therapy, among them, the coded-mask gamma camera developed by the SiFi-CC group. The assembly of this detector, as well as its first test under clinical conditions, are the subject of this thesis. The detector consists of a tungsten collimator and a stack of thin scintillation fibres, read out at both ends by SiPMs. Such a design allows for efficient detection of prompt gammas (PG) and reconstruction of a PG depth profile, which is strongly correlated with the proton beam range. The readout system was selected in an extensive comparison study of five different systems. After assembly, the detector was tested under clinical conditions: a phantom was irradiated with proton beams of energies from 70.51 MeV to 108.15 MeV, the detector response was processed with low-level reconstruction software, and the MLEM algorithm was applied to reconstruct the PG depth profiles (images). The distal falloff positions of these profiles were determined and compared with the calculated proton ranges. The image reconstruction parameters were optimised in terms of accuracy of proton range shift determination. The results obtained were checked against a Geant4 simulation, showing good consistency. The statistical precision was found to be 1.7 mm for $10^8$ protons. The result is comparable to similar systems investigated by other research groups. However, simulation results suggest that certain hardware amendments to the detector can increase that precision about four times.</description>

      <title>An Explainable Neural Radiomic Sequence Model with Spatiotemporal Continuity for Quantifying 4DCT-based Pulmonary Ventilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate evaluation of regional lung ventilation is essential for the management and treatment of lung cancer patients, supporting assessments of pulmonary function, optimization of therapeutic strategies, and monitoring of treatment response. Currently, ventilation scintigraphy using nuclear medicine techniques is widely employed in clinical practice; however, it is often time-consuming, costly, and entails additional radiation exposure. In this study, we propose an explainable neural radiomic sequence model to identify regions of compromised pulmonary ventilation based on four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT). A cohort of 45 lung cancer patients from the VAMPIRE dataset was analyzed. For each patient, lung volumes were segmented from 4DCT, and voxel-wise radiomic features (56-dimensional) were extracted across the respiratory cycle to capture local intensity and texture dynamics, forming temporal radiomic sequences. Ground truth ventilation defects were delineated voxel-wise using Galligas-PET and DTPA-SPECT. To identify compromised regions, we developed a temporal saliency-enhanced explainable long short-term memory (LSTM) network trained on the radiomic sequences. Temporal saliency maps were generated to highlight key features contributing to the model's predictions. The proposed model demonstrated robust performance, achieving average (range) Dice similarity coefficients of 0.78 (0.74-0.79) for 25 PET cases and 0.78 (0.74-0.82) for 20 SPECT cases. The temporal saliency map explained three key radiomic sequences in ventilation quantification: during lung exhalation, compromised pulmonary function region typically exhibits (1) an increasing trend of intensity and (2) a decreasing trend of homogeneity, in contrast to healthy lung tissue.</description>

      <title>Current status of real-time imaging of antiproton annihilation in biological targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following a successful pioneering study of the biological effects of antimatter ( the AD-4/ACE experiment at CERN), the use of antiprotons in clinical radiotherapy became a very serious possibility. A major part of any future radiotherapy using antiprotons will be real-time imaging of antiproton annihilation in biological targets. In principle, real-time imaging is possible thanks to the secondary particles, neutral pions and charger pions, produced by the annihilation of antiprotons in the cells they come to a stop in.Neutral pions decay dominantly and almost instantaneously into a photon pair, and one approach to real-time imaging is based on the detection of these high-energy gammas. An alternative is based on the detection of charged pions, which have lifetimes almost a billion times longer than neutral pions. This paper is a brief review of this field of research, from the first real-time imaging achieved by the AD-4/ACE experiment in 2004 to the present day.</description>

      <title>Computational Orthodontic Force Simulation: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In orthodontic treatment, the biological response of the tooth, periodontal ligament, and bone complex to orthodontic force is crucial in influencing treatment outcomes. The challenge lies in accurately measuring, estimating, and predicting these forces during clinical procedures. This review aims to fill the gap in the literature by systematically summarizing existing research on orthodontic force simulation, examining common loading techniques and technologies, and discussing the potential for refining the orthodontic force simulation process. The literature was comprehensively reviewed, with an emphasis on the exploration of the biological mechanism of tooth movement. Studies were categorized based on force-loading techniques for both fixed and invisible orthodontic appliances. Finite element (FE) analysis stands out as the predominant technique for orthodontic force simulation, with a significant focus on fixed orthodontics but limited emphasis on invisible orthodontics. Current orthodontic force simulations tend to be fragmented, often considering only the instantaneous response to applied forces. There exists an urgent demand for a sophisticated analytical simulation model. Such a model, possibly leveraging advanced technologies like deep learning, holds the promise of forecasting orthodontic treatment outcomes with heightened precision and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Reducing Artifacts in Grating Interferometry Using Multiple Harmonics and Phase Step Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray interferometry is an emerging imaging modality with a wide variety of potential clinical applications, including lung and breast imaging, as well as in non-destructive testing, such as additive manufacturing and porosimetry. A grating interferometer uses a diffraction grating to produce a periodic interference pattern and measures how a patient or sample perturbs the pattern, producing three unique images that highlight X-ray absorption, refraction, and small angle scattering, known as the transmission, differential-phase, and dark-field images, respectively. Image artifacts that are unique to X-ray interferometry are introduced when assuming the fringe pattern is perfectly sinusoidal and the phase steps are evenly spaced. Inaccuracies in grating position, coupled with multi-harmonic fringes, lead to remnant oscillations and phase wraparound artifacts. We have developed an image recovery algorithm that uses additional harmonics, direct relative phase fitting, and phase step corrections to prevent them. The direct relative phase fitting removes the phase wraparound artifact. Correcting the phase step positions and introducing the additional harmonic removes the grating remnant artifact present in the transmission, differential-phase, and dark-field images. By modifying existing algorithms, the fit to the fringe pattern is greatly improved and artifacts are minimized, as we demonstrate with the imaging of several samples, including PMMA microspheres, ex vivo formalin fixed mouse lungs, and porous alumina.</description>

      <title>Federated Self-Supervised Learning for One-Shot Cross-Modal and Cross-Imaging Technique Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized federated learning enables learning of data representations from multiple sources without compromising the privacy of the clients. In applications like medical image segmentation, where obtaining a large annotated dataset from a single source is a distressing problem, federated self-supervised learning can provide some solace. In this work, we push the limits further by exploring a federated self-supervised one-shot segmentation task representing a more data-scarce scenario. We adopt a pre-existing self-supervised few-shot segmentation framework CoWPro and adapt it to the federated learning scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to attempt a self-supervised few-shot segmentation task in the federated learning domain. Moreover, we consider the clients to be constituted of data from different modalities and imaging techniques like MR or CT, which makes the problem even harder. Additionally, we reinforce and improve the baseline CoWPro method using a fused dice loss which shows considerable improvement in performance over the baseline CoWPro. Finally, we evaluate this novel framework on a completely unseen held-out part of the local client dataset. We observe that the proposed framework can achieve performance at par or better than the FedAvg version of the CoWPro framework on the held-out validation dataset.</description>

      <title>FlowMRI-Net: A Generalizable Self-Supervised 4D Flow MRI Reconstruction network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Image reconstruction from highly undersampled 4D flow MRI data can be very time consuming and may result in significant underestimation of velocities depending on regularization, thereby limiting the applicability of the method. The objective of the present work was to develop a generalizable self-supervised deep learning-based framework for fast and accurate reconstruction of highly undersampled 4D flow MRI and to demonstrate the utility of the framework for aortic and cerebrovascular applications.
  Methods: The proposed deep-learning-based framework, called FlowMRI-Net, employs physics-driven unrolled optimization using a complex-valued convolutional recurrent neural network and is trained in a self-supervised manner. The generalizability of the framework is evaluated using aortic and cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI acquisitions acquired on systems from two different vendors for various undersampling factors (R=8,16,24) and compared to state-of-the-art compressed sensing (CS-LLR) and deep learning-based (FlowVN) reconstructions. Evaluation includes an ablation study and a qualitative and quantitative analysis of image and velocity magnitudes.
  Results: FlowMRI-Net outperforms CS-LLR and FlowVN for aortic 4D flow MRI reconstruction, resulting in significantly lower vectorial normalized root mean square error and mean directional errors for velocities in the thoracic aorta. Furthermore, the feasibility of FlowMRI-Net's generalizability is demonstrated for cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI reconstruction, where no FlowVN can be trained due to the lack of high-quality reference data. Reconstruction times ranged from 3 to 7 minutes on commodity CPU/GPU hardware.
  Conclusion: FlowMRI-Net enables fast and accurate reconstruction of highly undersampled aortic and cerebrovascular 4D flow MRI, with possible applications to other vascular territories.</description>

      <title>Material Decomposition in Photon-Counting Computed Tomography with Diffusion Models: Comparative Study and Hybridization with Variational Regularizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) enables spectral imaging and material decomposition (MD) but often suffers from low signal-to-noise ratios due to constraints like low photon counts and sparse-view settings. Traditional variational methods depend heavily on handcrafted regularizers, while AI-based approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have become state-of-the-art. More recently, diffusion models (DMs) have gained prominence in generative modeling by learning distribution functions, which can serve as priors for inverse problems. This work explores DMs as regularizers for MD tasks in PCCT using diffusion posterior sampling (DPS). We evaluate three DPS-based approaches: image-domain two-step DPS (im-TDPS), projection-domain two-step DPS (proj-TDPS), and one-step DPS (ODPS). Im-TDPS first samples spectral images via DPS, then performs image-based MD; proj-TDPS applies projection-based MD before sampling material images via DPS; ODPS directly samples material images from measurement data. Results show ODPS outperforms im-TDPS and proj-TDPS, producing sharper, noise-free, and crosstalk-free images. Additionally, we propose a hybrid ODPS method integrating DM priors with variational regularizers to handle materials absent from the training dataset. This approach enhances material reconstruction quality over standard variational methods.</description>

      <title>Deducing Cardiorespiratory Motion of Cardiac Substructures Using a Novel 5D-MRI Workflow for Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Cardiotoxicity is a devastating complication of thoracic radiotherapy. Current radiotherapy imaging protocols are insufficient to decouple and quantify cardiac motion, limiting substructure-specific motion considerations in treatment planning. We propose a 5D-MRI workflow for substructure-specific motion analysis, with future extension to margin calculation.
  Approach: Our 5D-MRI workflow was implemented for 10 healthy volunteers, ranging from 23 to 65 years old, reconstructing images for end-exhale/inhale and active-exhale/inhale for end-systole/diastole. For motion assessment, proximal coronary arteries, chambers, great vessels, and cardiac valves/nodes were contoured across all images and verified. Centroid/bounding box excursion was calculated for cardiac, respiratory, and hysteresis motion. Distance metrics were tested for statistical independence across substructure pairings.
  Main Results: 5D-MRI images were successfully acquired and contoured for all volunteers. Cardiac motion was greatest for the coronary arteries (specifically the right coronary) and smallest for the great vessels. Respiratory motion was dominant in the S-I direction and largest for the inferior vena cava. Respiratory hysteresis was generally &lt;5 mm but exceeded 5 mm for some volunteers. For cardiac motion, there were statistical differences between the coronary arteries, chambers, and great vessels, and between the right/left heart. Respiratory motion differed significantly between the base and apex of the heart.
  Significance: Our 5D-MRI workflow successfully decouples cardiorespiratory motion with one ~5-minute acquisition. Cardiac motion was &gt;5mm for the coronary arteries and chambers, while respiratory motion was &gt;5mm for all substructures. Statistical considerations and inter-patient variability indicate a substructure and patient-specific approach may be needed for PRV assessment.</description>
