      <title>Partitioning of multiple brain metastases improves dose gradients in single-isocenter radiosurgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: A growing number of cancer patients with brain metastases can benefit from stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) thanks to recent advances in systemic therapies. With an increasing patient load, single-isocenter treatments on widely available C-arm linear accelerators are an attractive option. However, the planning of such treatments is challenging for multi-target cases due to the island blocking problem, which occurs when the multi-leaf collimator cannot conform to all targets simultaneously.
  Purpose: We propose a multi-target partitioning algorithm that mitigates excessive exposure of normal tissue caused by the island blocking problem.
  Methods: The algorithm divides (partitions) the set of targets into subsets to treat with separate arc passes, optimizing both subsets and collimator angles to minimize island blocking. The algorithm was incorporated into a fully automated treatment planning script and evaluated on 20 simulated patient cases, each with 10 brain metastases and 21 Gy prescriptions. It was also retrospectively evaluated on six clinical cases.
  Results: Partitioning significantly improved the gradient index, global efficiency index, and brain V12Gy compared to simultaneous treatment of all metastases. For example, the average gradient index improved from 5.9 to 3.3, global efficiency index from 0.32 to 0.46, and normal brain V12Gy from 49 cm3 to 26 cm3 between 3 and 9 arcs. The proposed algorithm outperformed baselines in utilizing a limited number of arcs. All target partitioning strategies increased the total number of monitor units (MUs).
  Conclusions: The dose gradient in single-isocenter VMAT plans can be substantially improved by treating a smaller subset of metastases at a time. This requires more MUs and arcs, implying a trade-off between delivery time and plan quality which can be explored using the algorithm proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high dose rate 6 MeV electron irradiation generates stable [1-$^{13}$C]alanine radicals suitable for medical imaging with dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarisation (dDNP) is an experimental technique that increases the sensitivity of magnetic resonance experiments by more than a factor of $10^5$, permitting isotopically-labelled molecules to be transiently visible in MRI scans with their biochemical fates spatially resolvable over time following injection into a patient. dDNP requires a source of unpaired electrons to be in contact with the isotope-labelled nuclei, cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero, and spin-pumped into a given state by microwave irradiation. At present, these electrons are typically provided by chemical radicals which require removal by filtration prior to injection into humans. Alternative sources include UV irradiation, requiring storing samples in liquid nitrogen, or cobalt-60 gamma irradiation, which requires days and generates polarisation two to three orders of magnitude lower than chemical radicals. In this study, we present ultra-high dose rate electron beam irradiation as a novel alternative for generating non-persistent radicals in glycerol/alanine mixtures. These radicals are stable for months at room temperature, are present at concentrations dependent on irradiation dose, and generate comparable nuclear polarisation to the typically used trityl radicals (20%) through a novel mechanism. The process of their generation inherently sterilises samples, and they enable the imaging of alanine metabolism in vivo using dDNP. This new method of generating radicals for dDNP offers the potential to report on relevant biological processes while being translatable to the clinic.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of CT-to-RED Calibration Curves on Dosimetric Accuracy in Brain Radiotherapy Dose Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16805v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate dose calculation is crucial in radiotherapy, as tissue relative electron densities (RED) derived from CT scans play a vital role. This study investigated the impact of different CT-to-RED calibration curves on brain cancer treatment plans. Three calibration curves were compared: CIRS phantom-derived, Catphan phantom-derived, and the default curve in the Monaco Treatment Planning System. Ten volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were generated and recalculated using each curve. Dosimetric parameters for Planning Target Volume (PTV) and Organs at Risk (OARs) were analyzed. Results showed significant differences in PTV dose distribution between the CIRS-derived and default curves, while no significant differences were found between Catphan-derived and default curves. The CIRS-derived curve demonstrated superior performance in representing brain tissue electron densities. These findings emphasize the importance of using site-specific CT-to-RED calibration curves for accurate dose calculations in brain radiotherapy, potentially improving treatment safety and efficacy</description>

      <title>3D-1D modelling of cranial plate heating induced by low or medium frequency magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety assessment of patients with one-dimensionally structured passive implants, like cranial plates or stents, exposed to low or medium frequency magnetic fields, like those generated in magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic hyperthermia, can be challenging, because of the different length scales of the implant and the human body. Most of the methods used to estimate the heating induced near such implants neglect the presence of the metallic materials within the body, modeling the metal as thermal seeds. To overcome this limitation, a novel numerical approach that solves three-dimensional and one-dimensional coupled problems is proposed. This method leads to improved results by modelling the thermal diffusion through the highly conductive metallic implants. A comparison of the proposed method predictions with measurements performed on a cranial plate exposed to the magnetic field generated by a gradient coil system for magnetic resonance imaging is presented, showing an improved accuracy up to 25 % with respect to the method based on thermal seeds. The proposed method is finally applied to a magnetic hyperthermia case study in which a patient with a cranial plate is exposed to the magnetic field generated by a collar-type magnetic hyperthermia applicator for neck tumour treatment, predicting a temperature increase in proximity of the implant that is 10 % lower than the one overestimated by relying on thermal seeds.</description>

      <title>A Physiological-Model-Based Neural Network Framework for Blood Pressure Estimation from Photoplethysmography Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous blood pressure (BP) estimation via photoplethysmography (PPG) remains a significant challenge, particularly in providing comprehensive cardiovascular insights for hypertensive complications. This study presents a novel physiological model-based neural network (PMB-NN) framework for BP estimation from PPG signals, incorporating the identification of total peripheral resistance (TPR) and arterial compliance (AC) to enhance physiological interpretability. Preliminary experimental results, obtained from a single healthy participant under varying activity intensities, demonstrated promising accuracy, with a median standard deviation of 6.88 mmHg for systolic BP and 3.72 mmHg for diastolic BP. The median error for TPR and AC was 0.048 mmHg*s/ml and -0.521 ml/mmHg, respectively. Consistent with expectations, both estimated TPR and AC exhibited a reduction as activity intensity increased.</description>

      <title>Resolving quantitative MRI model degeneracy in self-supervised machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) estimates tissue properties of interest from measured MRI signals. This process is conventionally achieved by model fitting, whose computational expense limits qMRI's clinical use, motivating recent development of machine learning-based methods. Self-supervised approaches are particularly popular as they avoid the pitfall of distributional shift that affects supervised methods. However, it is unknown how such methods behave if similar signals can result from multiple tissue properties, a common challenge known as model degeneracy. Understanding this is crucial for ascertaining the scope within which self-supervised approaches may be applied. To this end, this work makes two contributions. First, we demonstrate that model degeneracy compromises self-supervised approaches, motivating the development of mitigation strategies. Second, we propose a mitigation strategy based on applying appropriate constraining transforms on the output of the bottleneck layer of the autoencoder network typically employed in self-supervised approaches. We illustrate both contributions using the estimation of proton density fat fraction and $R_2^*$ from chemical shift-encoded MRI, an ideal exemplar due to its exhibition of degeneracy across the full parameter space. The results from both simulation and $\textit{in vivo}$ experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy helps resolve model degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Embedding Radiomics into Vision Transformers for Multimodal Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Deep learning has significantly advanced medical image analysis, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) offering a powerful alternative to convolutional models by modeling long-range dependencies through self-attention. However, ViTs are inherently data-intensive and lack domain-specific inductive biases, limiting their applicability in medical imaging. In contrast, radiomics provides interpretable, handcrafted descriptors of tissue heterogeneity but suffers from limited scalability and integration into end-to-end learning frameworks. In this work, we propose the Radiomics-Embedded Vision Transformer (RE-ViT) that combines radiomic features with data-driven visual embeddings within a ViT backbone.
  Purpose: To develop a hybrid RE-ViT framework that integrates radiomics and patch-wise ViT embeddings through early fusion, enhancing robustness and performance in medical image classification.
  Methods: Following the standard ViT pipeline, images were divided into patches. For each patch, handcrafted radiomic features were extracted and fused with linearly projected pixel embeddings. The fused representations were normalized, positionally encoded, and passed to the ViT encoder. A learnable [CLS] token aggregated patch-level information for classification. We evaluated RE-ViT on three public datasets (including BUSI, ChestXray2017, and Retinal OCT) using accuracy, macro AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. RE-ViT was benchmarked against CNN-based (VGG-16, ResNet) and hybrid (TransMed) models.
  Results: RE-ViT achieved state-of-the-art results: on BUSI, AUC=0.950+/-0.011; on ChestXray2017, AUC=0.989+/-0.004; on Retinal OCT, AUC=0.986+/-0.001, which outperforms other comparison models.
  Conclusions: The RE-ViT framework effectively integrates radiomics with ViT architectures, demonstrating improved performance and generalizability across multimodal medical image classification tasks.</description>
