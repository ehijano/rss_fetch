      <title>Algorithms for Stable Roommate with Externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the roommate matching model, given a set of 2n agents and n rooms, we find an assignment of a pair of agents to a room. Although the roommate matching problem is well studied, the study of the model when agents have preference over both rooms and roommates was recently initiated by Chan et al. [11]. We study two types of stable roommate assignments, namely, 4-person stable (4PS) and 2-person stable (2PS) in conjunction with efficiency and strategy-proofness. We design a simple serial dictatorship based algorithm for finding a 4PS assignment that is Pareto optimal and strategy-proof. However, the serial dictatorship algorithm is far from being 2PS. Next, we study top trading cycle (TTC) based algorithms. We show that variations of TTC cannot be strategy-proof or PO. Finally, as Chan et al. (2016) showed that deciding the existence of 2PS assignment is NP-complete, we identify preference structures where a 2PS assignment can be found in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Explainable Information Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal signaling schemes in information design (Bayesian persuasion) problems often involve non-explainable randomization or disconnected partitions of state space, which are too intricate to be audited or communicated. We propose explainable information design in the context of information design with a continuous state space, restricting the information designer to use $K$-partitional signaling schemes defined by deterministic and monotone partitions of the state space, where a unique signal is sent for all states in each part. We first prove that the price of explainability (PoE) -- the ratio between the performances of the optimal explainable signaling scheme and unrestricted signaling scheme -- is exactly $1/2$ in the worst case, meaning that partitional signaling schemes are never worse than arbitrary signaling schemes by a factor of 2.
  We then study the complexity of computing optimal explainable signaling schemes. We show that the exact optimization problem is NP-hard in general. But for Lipschitz utility functions, an $\varepsilon$-approximately optimal explainable signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time. And for piecewise constant utility functions, we provide an efficient algorithm to find an explainable signaling scheme that provides a $1/2$ approximation to the optimal unrestricted signaling scheme, which matches the worst-case PoE bound.
  A technical tool we develop is a conversion from any optimal signaling scheme (which satisfies a bi-pooling property) to a partitional signaling scheme that achieves $1/2$ fraction of the expected utility of the former. We use this tool in the proofs of both our PoE result and algorithmic result.</description>

      <title>Properties of Egalitarian Sequences of Committees: Theory and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the task of electing egalitarian sequences of $\tau$ committees given a set of agents with additive utilities for candidates available on each of $\tau$ levels. We introduce several rules for electing an egalitarian committee sequence as well as properties for such rules. We settle the computational complexity of finding a winning sequence for our rules and classify them against our properties. Additionally, we transform sequential election data from existing election data from the literature. Using this data set, we compare our rules empirically and test them experimentally against our properties.</description>

      <title>Learning in Repeated Multi-Objective Stackelberg Games with Payoff Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study payoff manipulation in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games, where a leader may strategically influence a follower's deterministic best response, e.g., by offering a share of their own payoff. We assume that the follower's utility function, representing preferences over multiple objectives, is unknown but linear, and its weight parameter must be inferred through interaction. This introduces a sequential decision-making challenge for the leader, who must balance preference elicitation with immediate utility maximisation. We formalise this problem and propose manipulation policies based on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), which guide the leader in selecting actions and offering incentives that trade off short-term gains with long-term impact. We prove that under infinite repeated interactions, longEU converges to the optimal manipulation. Empirical results across benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach improves cumulative leader utility while promoting mutually beneficial outcomes, all without requiring explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of the follower's utility function.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion is Algorithm Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a fresh `meta-game' perspective on the problem of algorithmic collusion in pricing games a la Bertrand. Economists have interpreted the fact that algorithms can learn to price collusively as tacit collusion. We argue instead that the co-parametrization of algorithms -- that we show is necessary to obtain algorithmic collusion -- requires algorithm designer(s) to engage in explicit collusion by algorithm orchestration. To highlight this, we model a meta-game of algorithm parametrization that is played by algorithm designers, and the relevant strategic analyses at that level reveal new equilibrium and collusion phenomena.</description>

      <title>MOHAF: A Multi-Objective Hierarchical Auction Framework for Scalable and Fair Resource Allocation in IoT Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has intensified the challenge of efficiently allocating heterogeneous resources in highly dynamic, distributed environments. Conventional centralized mechanisms and single-objective auction models, focusing solely on metrics such as cost minimization or revenue maximization, struggle to deliver balanced system performance. This paper proposes the Multi-Objective Hierarchical Auction Framework (MOHAF), a distributed resource allocation mechanism that jointly optimizes cost, Quality of Service (QoS), energy efficiency, and fairness. MOHAF integrates hierarchical clustering to reduce computational complexity with a greedy, submodular optimization strategy that guarantees a (1-1/e) approximation ratio. A dynamic pricing mechanism adapts in real time to resource utilization, enhancing market stability and allocation quality. Extensive experiments on the Google Cluster Data trace, comprising 3,553 requests and 888 resources, demonstrate MOHAF's superior allocation efficiency (0.263) compared to Greedy (0.185), First-Price (0.138), and Random (0.101) auctions, while achieving perfect fairness (Jain's index = 1.000). Ablation studies reveal the critical influence of cost and QoS components in sustaining balanced multi-objective outcomes. With near-linear scalability, theoretical guarantees, and robust empirical performance, MOHAF offers a practical and adaptable solution for large-scale IoT deployments, effectively reconciling efficiency, equity, and sustainability in distributed resource coordination.</description>

      <title>The Cost Advantage of Virtual Machine Migrations: Empirical Insights into Amazon's EC2 Marketspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, cloud providers have introduced novel approaches for trading virtual machines. For example, Virtustream introduced so-called muVMs to charge cloud computing resources while other providers such as Google, Microsoft, or Amazon re-invented their marketspaces. Today, the market leader Amazon runs six marketspaces for trading virtual machines. Consumers can purchase bundles of virtual machines, which are called cloud-portfolios, from multiple marketspaces and providers. An industry-relevant field of research is to identify best practices and guidelines on how such optimal portfolios are created. In the paper at hand, a cost analysis of cloud portfolios is presented. Therefore, pricing data from Amazon was used as well as a real virtual machine utilization dataset from the Bitbrains datacenter. The results show that a cost optimum can only be reached if heterogeneous portfolios are created where virtual machines are purchased from different marketspaces. Additionally, the cost-benefit of migrating virtual machines to different marketplaces during runtime is presented. Such migrations are especially cost-effective for virtual machines of cloud-portfolios which run between 6 hours and 1 year. The paper further shows that most of the resources of virtual machines are never utilized by consumers, which represents a significant future potential for cost optimization. For the validation of the results, a second dataset of the Bitbrains datacenter was used, which contains utility data of virtual machines from a different domain of application.</description>

      <title>Nash Convergence of Mean-Based Learning Algorithms in First-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.03906v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The convergence properties of learning dynamics in repeated auctions is a timely and important question, with numerous applications in, e.g., online advertising markets. This work focuses on repeated first-price auctions where bidders with fixed values learn to bid using mean-based algorithms -- a large class of online learning algorithms that include popular no-regret algorithms such as Multiplicative Weights Update and Follow the Perturbed Leader. We completely characterize the learning dynamics of mean-based algorithms, under two notions of convergence: (1) time-average: the fraction of rounds where bidders play a Nash equilibrium converges to 1; (2) last-iterate: the mixed strategy profile of bidders converges to a Nash equilibrium. Specifically, the results depend on the number of bidders with the highest value:
  - If the number is at least three, the dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium of the auction, in both time-average and last-iterate.
  - If the number is two, the dynamics almost surely converges to a Nash equilibrium in time-average but not necessarily last-iterate.
  - If the number is one, the dynamics may not converge to a Nash equilibrium in time-average or last-iterate.
  Our discovery opens up new possibilities in the study of the convergence of learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Infinite Horizon Markov Economies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a generalization of Markov games and pseudo-games that we call Markov pseudo-games, which, like the former, captures time and uncertainty, and like the latter, allows for the players' actions to determine the set of actions available to the other players. In the same vein as Arrow and Debreu, we intend for this model to be rich enough to encapsulate a broad mathematical framework for modeling economies. We then prove the existence of a game-theoretic equilibrium in our model, which in turn implies the existence of a general equilibrium in the corresponding economies. Finally, going beyond Arrow and Debreu, we introduce a solution method for Markov pseudo-games and prove its polynomial-time convergence.
  We then provide an application of Markov pseudo-games to infinite-horizon Markov exchange economies, a stochastic economic model that extends Radner's stochastic exchange economy and Magill and Quinzii's infinite-horizon incomplete markets model. We show that under suitable assumptions, the solutions of any infinite-horizon Markov exchange economy (i.e., recursive Radner equilibria -- RRE) can be formulated as the solution to a concave Markov pseudo-game, thus establishing the existence of RRE and providing first-order methods for approximating RRE. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practice by building the corresponding generative adversarial policy neural network and using it to compute RRE in a variety of infinite-horizon Markov exchange economies.</description>

      <title>Dominated Actions in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dominance is a fundamental concept in game theory. In strategic-form games dominated strategies can be identified in polynomial time. As a consequence, iterative removal of dominated strategies can be performed efficiently as a preprocessing step for reducing the size of a game before computing a Nash equilibrium. For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could convert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated strategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential blowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated actions in imperfect-information games. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether an action is dominated (strictly or weakly) by any mixed strategy in n-player games, which can be extended to an algorithm for iteratively removing dominated actions. This allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the game tree as a preprocessing step for Nash equilibrium computation. We explore the role of dominated actions empirically in the "All In or Fold" No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker variant.</description>

      <title>It Takes Two: A Peer-Prediction Solution for Blockchain Verifier's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01794v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The security of blockchain systems is fundamentally based on the decentralized consensus in which the majority of parties behave honestly, and the content verification process is essential to maintaining the robustness of blockchain systems. However, the phenomenon that a rational verifier may not have the incentive to honestly perform the costly verification, referred to as the Verifier's Dilemma, could incentivize lazy reporting and undermine the fundamental security of blockchain systems, particularly for verification-expensive decentralized AI applications.
  In this paper, we initiate the research with the development of a Byzantine-robust peer prediction framework towards the design of one-phase Bayesian truthful mechanisms for the decentralized verification games among multiple verifiers, incentivizing all verifiers to perform honest verification without access to the ground truth even in the presence of noisy observations, malicious players and inaccurate priors in the verification process, proposing the compactness criteria that ensures such robustness guarantees. With robust incentive guarantees and budget efficiency, our study provides a framework of incentive design for decentralized verification protocols that enhances the security and robustness of the blockchain, decentralized AI, and potentially other decentralized systems.</description>
