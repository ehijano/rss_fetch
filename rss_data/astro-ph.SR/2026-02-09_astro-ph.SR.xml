      <title>Compact HII Regions as Clocks of Massive-Star Formation: Evidence for Long Formation Timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the luminosity function (LF) of compact HII regions in the context of the inertial--inflow model, in which massive stars assemble over extended, mass-dependent timescales. The comparison of the compact-HII-region LF with that of OB stars is traditionally used to estimate the compact-HII-phase lifetime and is often cited as evidence for the classical ``lifetime problem" of HII regions. We show that once stellar growth during the ionizing phase is included, the LF comparison instead constrains massive-star formation timescales, so the lifetime problem turns into evidence for prolonged growth. We illustrate the principle with a simple analytic model and then forward-model the two LFs with Monte Carlo realizations. We also derive revised Galactic LFs for compact HII regions and OB stars from the Red MSX Source survey and the Alma Luminous Star catalogue. The joint LF constraints imply a growth law where the formation time is about 2 Myr for a $60\,M_\odot$ star, with a square-root dependence on mass. The revised OB-star LF exhibits a statistically significant knee at $\log_{10}(L_{\rm k}/L_\odot)=5.0$, while the HII-region LF knee occurs at lower luminosity, as expected in the interpretation that HII regions are powered by stars that are still growing in mass. We conclude that massive stars in the Milky Way form over Myr timescales that increase with their final mass.</description>

      <title>Disk-Regulated Mass Transfer Between Rotating Non-Degenerate Stars: Insights from Be and sdOB Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass transfer between non-degenerate stars is a fundamental but still poorly understood process in binary evolution. The commonly used rotationally limited accretion prescription in detailed binary evolution simulations that account for stellar rotation generally yields low accretion efficiencies that are difficult to reconcile with several observational constraints. We present a physically-motivated mass-accretion prescription in which accretion or decretion disks regulate the angular momentum transported to the accretor, thereby allowing for continued accretion at near-critical rotation. The accretion efficiency can be calculated from the conservation of the mass and the angular momentum of the disk. Analytical estimates show that the accretion efficiency depends on stellar rotation and mass ratio for direct impact accretion, and additionally on stellar radius and orbital separation in the disk accretion regime. The overall mass-weighted accretion efficiencies are close to the values expected near the threshold rotation rate, where the accreted specific angular momentum declines sharply. Applying this model to binary evolution simulations, we find that rotationally limited accretion systematically underestimates Be-star masses in Be+subdwarf O/B-type star (sdOB) systems, whereas the disk-star coupling model can produce more massive Be stars that are consistent with observations. The final binary component masses depend not only on accretion efficiency but also core-envelope mass ratio, which itself depends sensitively on the assumed overshooting. We find that our new disk-star coupling model with reduced overshooting yields component masses for Be+sdOB systems that are in closer agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>The Walkaway Star HP Tau/G2: Evidence for a Stellar Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HP~Tau/G2 is a luminous, short-period, fast-rotating G-type weak-line T Tauri star with a large radius, an oblate shape with gravity-darkening, little circumstellar material, and centered in a slowly expanding cloud cavity. It is an X-ray source and a variable nonthermal radio source. It forms, together with the late-type T Tauri star KPNO 15, a pair of oppositely directed walkaway stars launched when a multiple system broke apart ~5600 yr ago. Momentum conservation indicates a mass of G2 of only ~0.7 Msun, much lower than the ~1.9 Msun determined from evolutionary models. G2 is virtually a twin of FK Com, the prototype of a class of evolved stars resulting from coalescence of W UMa binaries. We suggest that G2 became a very close and highly eccentric binary during viscous evolution in the protostellar stage and with KPNO 15 formed a triple system, which again was part of a larger unstable group including the binary G3 and the single G1. Dynamical evolution led to multiple bound ejections of KPNO 15 before it finally escaped after ~2 Myr. As a result the G2 binary recoiled and contracted 5600 yr ago, became Darwin unstable and merged in a major outburst ~2000 yr ago. The nearby compact triple system G1+G3 was also disturbed, and broke up 4900 yr ago, forming another walkaway pair. The G5 star HD 283572 has similar unusual properties, indicating that G2 is not a pathological case. G2 is now fading towards a new stable configuration. YSO mergers may be rather common and could explain some FUor eruptions.</description>

      <title>The Non-Eruptive Reconfiguration of a Quiescent Filament After a Nearby Active Region Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unpredictability of solar filament eruptions presents major challenges for forecasting space weather, as such eruptions frequently drive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that impact the heliosphere. While nearby flux emergence is often linked to their destabilisation, the specific characteristics of both the emerging flux and the filament that determine whether an eruption occurs remain unclear. We report observations of a quiescent filament that did not erupt following the nearby emergence of active region NOAA 13270 and a subsequent C-class flare in April 2023. Our analysis combines multi-viewpoint extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imaging and X-ray imaging with EUV spectroscopy, radio imaging and measurements of, and extrapolations from, the photospheric magnetic field. We identify the formation of a coronal null point and fan-spine topology at the interface between the active region and filament which exhibited persistent slow reconnection, indicated by chromospheric brightenings, persistent radio emission, and plasma upflows. Our results indicate that ongoing reconnection and jets can relieve magnetic stress and enable filament stability, even when under strong perturbation. We suggest that the orientation of emerging flux relative to the ambient field is a critical parameter in filament evolution, and provide observational constraints for models of filament stability and eruption.</description>

      <title>Dilution of accreted planetary matter in hot DA white dwarfs according to their mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large proportion of observed white dwarfs (WDs) show evidence of debris disks, remnants of the former planetary systems, and/or signatures of heavy elements in their atmospheres, induced by the accretion of planetary matter onto their surfaces. The observed abundances are the result of the balance between the accretion flux and the dilution of this planetary material by internal transport processes. A recent study showed that more massive DA WDs are less polluted than smaller mass ones. It was suggested that the reason could be related to the formation of planetary systems when these stars were on the main sequence. The aim of this work is to test how internal dilution processes, including thermohaline convection, change with WD masses, and whether such an effect could account for variations in the observed pollution. We computed the efficiency of atomic diffusion and thermohaline convection after the accretion of heavy elements onto WDs using static DA models with various masses, effective temperatures, and hydrogen contents. We confirm that thermohaline convection is always more efficient in diluting accreted elements than atomic diffusion, as previously shown in the literature. However, we find that element dilution by thermohaline convection is less efficient in massive WDs than in smaller mass ones, due to their larger internal density. We showed that the differences in observed heavy element pollution in WDs according to their masses cannot be explained by the dilution induced by atomic diffusion and thermohaline mixing alone. Indeed, the pollution by planetary system accretion should be more easily detectable in massive WDs than in low-mass ones. We discuss other processes that should be taken into account before drawing any conclusion about the occurrences of planetary systems according to the mass of the star on the main sequence.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic ages for 17,000 stars in Kepler, K2 and TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of asteroseismic constraints for tens of thousands of red giant (RG) stars has opened the door to robust age estimates, enabling time-resolved studies of different populations of stars in the Milky Way. This study leverages data from Kepler, K2, and TESS, in conjunction with astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and spectroscopic constraints from APOGEE DR17 and GALAH DR3, to infer parameters for over 17,000 RGs. We use the code PARAM to homogeneously infer stellar properties considering in detail the sensitivity of our results to different choices of observational constraints. We focus on age estimation, identifying potentially unreliable age determinations, and highlight stars with unreliable $\Delta\nu$ measurements based on comparisons using Gaia luminosities. These are particularly relevant in K2 data due to the short duration of the observations of each campaign, and therefore important to characterise for Galactic archaeology studies where the spatial range of K2 is a benefit. Thanks to the combination of data from different missions we explore trends in age, mass, and orbital parameters such as $R_\mathrm{g}$ and $Z_\mathrm{max}$, and examine time-resolved [$\alpha$/M]-[Fe/H] planes across different Galactic regions. Additionally, we compare age distributions in low- and high-$\alpha$ populations and chemically selected ex situ stars. The study also extends known mass-[C/N] ratio relationships to lower masses. The catalogues resulting from this work will be instrumental in addressing key questions in Galactic archaeology and stellar evolution, and to improve training sets for machine-learning-based age estimations.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in stellar radiative regions. I. Linear study of shear-driven instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series investigating magnetohydrodynamic instabilities that may contribute to angular-momentum transport and magnetic-field evolution in stellar radiative zones. We focus on shear-driven instabilities, specifically the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) instability and the magnetorotational instability (MRI), which are expected to play key roles in the internal dynamics of radiative regions. We carried out a local linear stability analysis using a numerical approach that extends beyond classical limiting cases and includes stabilizing effects such as stratification and magnetic tension, allowing the exploration of realistic flow regimes. These results were validated through a global mode analysis in a Taylor-Couette configuration. We recovered the standard MRI and azimuthal MRI stability criteria and quantified the effects of stratification, magnetic tension, and diffusion on their growth. In strongly sheared regimes, we derived a new criterion for the magnetised GSF (MGSF) instability and clarified the transition from SMRI to MGSF as stratification and magnetic effects narrow the unstable domain. We also provided approximate growth-time formulae that identify the dominant instability under given stellar conditions and can be implemented in 1D stellar evolution codes. Global Taylor-Couette calculations validate the local WKB analysis. Applied to subgiants and young red giants, our results show that shear-driven instabilities can grow rapidly for magnetic fields below 100 kG. Strong axial fields (100 kG) confined to the hydrogen-burning shell suppress instabilities unless the shear is sufficiently distant. These results support incorporating our criteria and growth estimates into stellar evolution models to assess the efficiency of shear-driven transport.</description>

      <title>Towards a Fully Automated Pipeline for Short-Term Forecasting of In Situ Coronal Mass Ejection Magnetic Field Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an automated pipeline for operational short-term forecasting of coronal mass ejection (CME) magnetic field structure at L1, coupling arrival time prediction, in situ detection, and iterative flux rope reconstruction, following near-real-time remote-sensing CME identification. The system is triggered by new entries in the CCMC DONKI database and first applies the drag-based ELEvo model to determine whether an Earth impact is expected and estimate arrival time. This estimate defines a temporal window constraining the search for CME signatures in real-time L1 in situ solar wind data, where the magnetic obstacle (MO) is automatically detected using the deep learning model ARCANE. Upon MO onset, iterative reconstructions with the semi-empirical flux rope model 3DCORE are performed, using a Monte Carlo fitting scheme, producing continuously updated forecasts of the remaining magnetic field profile.
  We evaluate the pipeline using 3870 archived DONKI entries and archived NOAA real-time in situ data from 2013-2025, assessing forecast performance at different stages of MO observation. For 61 events with an associated ground-truth counterpart in the ICMECAT catalog, forecasts based on initial MO data already achieve performance comparable to full-event reconstructions. Typical errors are ~5 hours in timing of magnetic field extrema and ~10 nT in field strength metrics, with limited systematic improvement as more of the event is observed. Results show substantial event variability and systematic underestimation of extrema, indicating deviations from ideal flux rope assumptions. These findings demonstrate the potential of fully autonomous real-time forecasting while highlighting limitations imposed by event complexity and model representational capacity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar high-energy radiation is a key driver of atmospheric erosion and evolution in exoplanets, directly affecting their long-term habitability. We present a comprehensive study on stellar high-energy radiation and its impact on exoplanetary atmospheres, leveraging data from the \textit{SRG/eROSITA} all-sky survey. Our sample consists of 3750 main-sequence stars identified by cross-matching with \textit{Gaia} DR3. Utilizing X-ray spectral fits from the \textit{eROSITA} catalog, we computed X-ray ($L_X$) and combined extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) luminosities ($L_{\mathrm{EUV}}$), which we used to derive XUV fluxes at the habitable zone ($F_{\mathrm{XUV,HZ}}$). We find that the majority of stars in our sample are significantly more XUV-active than the Sun, with habitable zone fluxes ranging from $10^0$ to $10^5$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The ratio of $L_{\mathrm{XUV}}/L_{\mathrm{bol}}$ is found to be higher for cooler, magnetically active stars, highlighting their potentially hazardous nature for planetary atmospheres. Applying the energy-limited escape model, we computed atmospheric mass-loss rates for hypothetical earth-like planets located at the habitable zone of each star. We also present local maps for distances up to $500$~pc of the average XUV flux, revealing ``hazard zones'' where stellar radiation could significantly influence planetary atmospheric evolution. This work demonstrates the power of X-ray surveys in constraining the high-energy environments of exoplanets and underscores the critical role of stellar activity in planetary habitability.</description>

      <title>AB Aur, a Rosetta stone for studies of planet formation (IV): C/O estimates from CS and SO interferometric observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Protoplanetary disks are the birthplace of planets. As such, they set the initial chemical abundances available for planetary atmosphere formation. Thus, studying elemental abundances, molecular compositions, and abundance ratios in protoplanetary disks is key to linking planetary atmospheres to their formation sites. Aims. We aim to derive the sulfur abundance and the C/O ratio in the AB Aur disk using interferometric observations of CS and SO. Methods. New NOEMA observations of CS 3-2 towards AB Aur are presented. We used velocity-integrated intensity maps to determine the inclination and position angles. Keplerian masks were constructed for all observed species to assess the presence of non-Keplerian motions. We use the CS/SO ratio to study the C/O ratio. We compare our present and previous interferometric observations of AB Aur with a NAUTILUS disk model to gain insight into the S elemental abundance and C/O ratio. Results. We derive an observational CS/SO ratio ranging from 1.8 to 2.6. Only NAUTILUS models with C/O &gt; 1 can reproduce such ratios. The comparison with models points to strong sulfur depletion, with [S/H]=8e-8, but we note that no single model can simultaneously fit all observed species.</description>

      <title>Spectral Appearance of Self-gravitating AGN Disks Powered by Stellar Objects: Universal Effective Temperature in the Optical Continuum and Application to Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\bullet$, and disk viscosity $\alpha$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\dot{M}/\alpha \gtrsim 0.1 M_\odot /{\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population.</description>

Abstract: We present a radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) scheme that enables three-dimensional simulations resolving both protostellar interiors and their surrounding accretion flows within a single framework, to clarify how a protostar evolves while interacting with the accretion flow. The method builds on an explicit two-moment M1 closure scheme with a reduced speed of light approximation (RSLA) for massively parallel computation. Our scheme introduces a complementary non-RSLA radiation component that dominates in optically thick regions. This hybrid treatment restores physical energy conservation inside protostars, which would otherwise be violated under the RSLA, while retaining the advantage of large time steps. To overcome the limitation of the conventional M1 closure in solving radiative transfer in extremely optically thick regions inside protostars and across steep optical-depth gradients near their surfaces, we incorporate the optical-depth information of neighboring cells into the radiative transfer calculation. We further evolve photon number densities in addition to radiation energy densities to reconstruct an effective local spectrum on the fly without resorting to costly multi-frequency transport. We implement this scheme in the adaptive mesh refinement code SFUMATO and verify its validity through a series of test calculations. As an application, we follow the early evolution of a massive protostar formed at high redshift, within a full cosmological context. The results reveal a continuous structure connecting the swollen protostar and its surrounding disk, which cannot be captured in conventional one-dimensional models. This RHD scheme opens a path to studies of protostellar evolution and its interaction with the accretion flow in realistic three-dimensional environments.</description>

      <title>The Birth of Be Star Disks II. A High-Resolution Spectroscopic Campaign and TESS Observations of an Outburst of the Classical Be star {\lambda} Pavonis</title>

Abstract: Be stars are rapidly-rotating B stars that have shown emission lines originating in a circumstellar disk. The mechanisms that lead to disk formation and dissipation are not known although progress has been made with some systems. We present a study of a disk outburst of the Be star lambda Pavonis. Our dataset comprises 698 high-resolution spectra contemporaneous with TESS photometry in 2023. Near the end of TESS monitoring, the star began disk building from a pristine diskless state. We find the disk built within 5 days in optical H I and He I lines, while the disk circularized in about 12 days. The disk began to decay in higher excitation He I first, then lower excitation transitions, with the decay ending last for H-alpha. We examine non-radial pulsations both through TESS photometry and the line profile variations (LPVs) in the spectroscopy. Our analysis indicates that two periodicities seen in TESS photometry (at 1.644 and 1.485 cycles/d) are not seen in the spectral lines before, during, or after the outburst. The strongest photometric signal is a periodicity at 0.163 cycles/d, which appears as a difference between the two weaker signals and is visible in the spectra without any apparent changes in amplitude or phase. We additionally find evidence for fast non-photometric pulsational variations over the course of spectroscopy obtained before, during, and after the outburst. These fast LPVs are strong, and interfere with the two weaker signals, hampering our ability to detect them in spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Ultimate large-$Rm$ regime of the solar dynamo</title>

Abstract: For more than 40 years the quest to understand how large-scale magnetic fields emerge from turbulent flows in rotating astrophysical systems, such as the Sun, has been a major focus of computational astrophysics research. Using a parameter scan and phenomenological analysis of maximally simplified three-dimensional cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulations of large-scale non-linear helical turbulent dynamos, I present results in this Letter that strongly point to an asymptotic ultimate regime of the large-scale solar dynamo at large magnetic Reynolds numbers, $Rm$, involving helicity fluxes between hemispheres. I obtained corresponding numerical solutions at both $Pm&gt;1$ and $Pm&lt;1$, and show that they can currently only be achieved in clean, simplified numerical set-ups. The analysis further strongly suggests that all global simulations to date lie in non-asymptotic turbulent magnetohydrodynamic regimes highly sensitive to changes in kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Ideas are presented to attempt to reach the ultimate regime in such 'realistic' global spherical models at a reasonable numerical cost. Overall, the results clarify the current state, and some hard limitations of the brute-force numerical modelling approach applied to this, and other similar astrophysical turbulence problems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying sunspot group nesting with density-based unsupervised clustering</title>

Abstract: Sunspot groups often emerge in spatial-temporal clusters, known as nests or complexes of activity. Quantifying how frequently such nesting occurs is important for understanding the organisation and recurrence of solar magnetic fields. We introduce an automated approach based on kernel density estimation and DBSCAN clustering to identify nests in the longitude-time domain and to measure the fraction of sunspot groups that belong to them. The method combines a smooth representation of emergence patterns with a density-based clustering procedure, validated using synthetic solar-like cycles and corrected for variations in data density. We apply this method to 151 years of sunspot-group observations from the Royal Greenwich Observatory Photoheliographic Results (RGO, 1874-1976) and Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station (KMAS, 1955-2025) catalogues. Across all cycles and latitude bands, the mean nesting degree is $\langle D\rangle = 0.61 \pm 0.12$, implying that about 60 percent all sunspot groups emerge within nests. Nesting is strongest at mid-latitudes (10$^\circ$-20$^\circ$), and results from the two independent datasets agree in the period of overlap. The nesting degree significantly correlates with the solar activity level, with the correlation strengthening when small groups are excluded. The characteristic inter-nest spacing contracts from $\sim$200-500~Mm at low activity to $\sim$60-100~Mm at solar maximum, approaching typical sunspot-group dimensions. The identified nests range from compact clusters to long-lived, drifting structures, offering new quantitative constraints on the persistence and organisation of solar magnetic activity.</description>

      <title>The WINTER Observatory: A One-Degree InGaAs Survey Camera to study the Transient Infrared Sky</title>

Abstract: The Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) is a near-infrared time-domain survey instrument operating on a dedicated 1-meter robotic telescope at Palomar Observatory. The project takes advantage of recent technology advances in time-domain astronomy, robotic telescopes, large-format sensors, and rapid data reduction and alert software for timely follow up of events. Since June of 2023, WINTER robotically surveys the sky each night to a median depth of J_AB = 18.5 mag, balancing a variety of science programs including searching for kilonovae from gravitational-wave alerts, blind surveys to study galactic and extragalactic transients and variables, and building up reference images of the near-infrared sky. The project also serves as a technology demonstration for new large-format Indium Gallium Arsenide (InGaAs) sensors for wide-field science in the near infrared without cryogenically cooled optics or detectors. WINTER's custom camera combines six InGaAs sensors with a novel tiled fly's-eye optical design to cover a &gt;1 deg^2 field of view with 1 arcsecond pixels in the Y-, J-, and shortened-H-band filters (0.9 - 1.7 micron). This paper presents the design, performance, and early on-sky science of the WINTER observatory.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of the relations between the properties of planetary systems and the chemical compositions of their host stars</title>

Abstract: The giant planet-metallicity correlation revealed that planetary formation depends on the stellar properties. There is growing evidence that it is also valid for smaller hot planets, but it is not clear whether elements other than iron also influence the properties of planetary systems. To investigate this, we determined the abundances of 13 chemical elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) for a sample of 561 Kepler exoplanet-hosting stars using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra. We find that stars in systems having only large or hot planets are enriched in some elements relative to those having only small or warm planets, respectively, with this signature being related to the underlying stellar metallicity. This Kepler sample is composed of stars belonging to the Galactic low- and high-$\alpha$ sequences, corresponding to the chemical thin and thick disks. Our results reveal that stars enhanced in $\alpha$-elements may facilitate the formation of large planets in metal-poor environments although the iron abundance is still a limiting factor. We also investigated chemical abundances as a function of elemental condensation temperatures and found that there is a diversity of slopes regardless of the exoplanetary systems hosted by the star. We confirmed that the Sun is depleted in refractory elements relative to the solar twins in our sample, all of which host a diversity of exoplanets, suggesting that this depletion is caused by processes not related to planet formation.</description>

      <title>Broadband infrared spectroscopy of methanol isotopologues in pure, H2O-rich, and CO-rich ice analogues</title>

Abstract: Deuterium fractionation is highly efficient during the early stages of star formation, particularly in starless and prestellar cores where temperatures are low (&lt;10 K) and molecular freeze-out onto dust grains is significant. Methanol forms early in these environments following CO freeze-out via successive hydrogenation reactions on grain surfaces, while the production of deuterated methanol requires elevated gas-phase D/H ratios generated through dissociative recombination of deuterated H3+. Consequently, large abundances of deuterated methanol are observed toward young stellar objects where prestellar ices have recently sublimated. Here, we present laboratory infrared spectra of methanol and its deuterated isotopologues in astrophysical ice analogues, complemented by anharmonic vibrational calculations used to guide band assignments. Experiments were performed at the CASICE laboratory using a Bruker Vertex 70v spectrometer coupled to a closed-cycle helium cryostat, with isotopologue ices deposited at 10 K under high-vacuum conditions. Infrared transmission spectra were recorded over 6000-30 cm-1 (1.67-333 um) and compared with spectra of pure isotopologue ices. Distinctive mid-infrared band patterns are identified for each deuterated species. In particular, CH2DOH exhibits a characteristic doublet at 1293 and 1326 cm-1 (7.73 and 7.54 um), while CHD2OH shows a similar doublet at 1301 and 1329 cm-1 (7.69 and 7.52 um), both remaining largely invariant across all studied ice mixtures. These robust spectral signatures provide reliable tracers for identifying deuterated methanol in JWST observations and for constraining astrochemical gas-grain models of deuterium enrichment prior to star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>On the stability of viscous Riemann ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present study investigates the linear stability of Riemann ellipsoids in both the inviscid limit and in the presence of weak viscosity. In the inviscid regime, we derive a generalised Poincare equation governing small fluid oscillations and construct a family of polynomial solutions that extends the classical results of Cartan to flows with a uniform strain field. This formulation provides an analytic dispersion relation for three-dimensional ellipsoidal disturbances and remains computationally efficient at arbitrary harmonic degree, in contrast to the virial tensor method or to short-wavelength (WKB) approximations. The viscous effects are incorporated through a boundary-layer analysis based on Prandtls theory, leading to first-order viscous corrections to the inviscid spectrum and allowing a systematic investigation of viscosity-driven instabilities. Stability diagrams are presented over the space of admissible Riemann ellipsoids, illustrating the roles of rotation, internal strain, and diffusion, with implications for rotating shear flows in geophysical and astrophysical contexts.</description>
