      <title>Exploring atmospheric neutrino oscillations at ESSnuSB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides an analysis of atmospheric neutrino oscillations at the ESSnuSB far detector facility. The prospects of the two cylindrical Water Cherenkov detectors with a total fiducial mass of 540 kt are investigated over 10 years of data taking in the standard three-flavor oscillation scenario. We present the confidence intervals for the determination of mass ordering, $\theta_{23}$ octant as well as for the precisions on $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and $|\Delta m_{31}^2|$. It is shown that mass ordering can be resolved by $3\sigma$ CL ($5\sigma$ CL) after 4 years (10 years) regardless of the true neutrino mass ordering. Correspondingly, the wrong $\theta_{23}$ octant could be excluded by $3\sigma$ CL after 4 years (7 years) in the case where the true neutrino mass ordering is normal ordering (inverted ordering). The results presented in this work are complementary to the accelerator neutrino program in the ESSnuSB project.</description>

      <title>Waveform resampling with LMN method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resampling is a common technique applied in digital signal processing. Based on the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), we apply an optimization called here the LMN method to achieve fast and robust re-sampling. In addition to performance comparisons with some other popular methods, we illustrate the effectiveness of this LMN method in a particle physics experiment: re-sampling of waveforms from Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers.</description>

      <title>Confronting perturbative QCD with the hardest exclusive reactions: kaon electromagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among countless channels of hard exclusive reactions, the kaon electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) are of special interest, which have been measured up to $Q^2 \sim 50\;{\rm GeV}^2$ in the timelike domain. The kaon EMFFs thereby serve an ideal platform to critically examine the validity and effectiveness of perturbative QCD (pQCD) in accounting for hard exclusive processes. In this work we confront the pQCD predictions that incorporate the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) perturbative corrections, with the available kaon EMFFs data set from experimental measurements and from lattice predictions. The inclusion of the NNLO corrections turns out to have a substantial and positive impact. If the profiles of the kaon light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) are taken from the recent lattice QCD prediction by {\tt LPC} Collaboration, the satisfactory agreement between theory and data can be reached for both charged and neutral kaons, in both spacelike and timelike large-$Q^2$ domains.</description>

      <title>TrackSorter: A Transformer-based sorting algorithm for track finding in High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Track finding in particle data is a challenging pattern recognition problem in High Energy Physics. It takes as inputs a point cloud of space points and labels them so that space points created by the same particle have the same label. The list of space points with the same label is a track candidate. We argue that this pattern recognition problem can be formulated as a sorting problem, of which the inputs are a list of space points sorted by their distances away from the collision points and the outputs are the space points sorted by their labels. In this paper, we propose the TrackSorter algorithm: a Transformer-based algorithm for pattern recognition in particle data. TrackSorter uses a simple tokenization scheme to convert space points into discrete tokens. It then uses the tokenized space points as inputs and sorts the input tokens into track candidates. TrackSorter is a novel end-to-end track finding algorithm that leverages Transformer-based models to solve pattern recognition problems. It is evaluated on the TrackML dataset and has good track finding performance.</description>

      <title>Considerations on measuring spin-spin correlation of hyeprons in heavy-ion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significant global spin alignment observed for $\phi$ mesons in heavy-ion collisions has sparked intense discussions about its origin and implications. One explanation suggests that fluctuations in the strong force field may introduce strong spin correlations between strange ($s$) and anti-strange ($\bar{s}$) quarks, leading to the global spin alignment of $\phi$ mesons. Extending this line of research, the theoretical community has proposed studying the spin correlation between $\Lambda$ and $\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons. In this paper, we construct experimental observables and make connections between them and the theoretical proposed quantities.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the RD50-MPW4 HV-CMOS pixel sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The RD50-MPW4 is the latest HV-CMOS pixel sensor from the CERN-RD50-CMOS working group, designed to evaluate the HV-CMOS technology in terms of spatial resolution, radiation hardness and timing performance. Fabricated by LFoundry using a 150nm process, it features an improved architecture to mitigate crosstalk, which has been an issue with the predecessor RD50-MPW3, allowing more sensitive threshold settings and full matrix operation. Enhancements include separated power domains for peripheral and in-pixel digital readout, a new backside-biasing step, and an improved guard ring structure supporting biasing up to 500V, significantly boosting radiation hardness. Laboratory measurements and test beam results presented in this paper show significant improvements over its predecessor regarding noise behavior, spatial resolution, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic $|G_E/G_M|$ ratios of hyperons at large timelike $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has become possible to measure not only the magnitude of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ baryons, but also to measure the relative phases of those quantities in the timelike kinematic region. Aiming to interpret present $|G_E/G_M|$ data on hyperons of the baryon octet, as well as to predict future data, we present model calculations of that ratio for large invariant 4-momentum square $q^2$ in the timelike region ($q^2&gt;0$). Without any further parameter fitting, we extend to the timelike region a covariant quark model previously developed to describe the kinematic spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$) of the baryon octet form factors. The model takes into account both the effects of valence quarks and the excitations of the meson cloud which dresses the baryons. We report here that our results are in good agreement with very recent data from BESIII, within the uncertainty limits of our model. We also make new predictions which may be tested in the near future, when the range of the present measurements is expanded to the 20--50 GeV$^2$ region.</description>

      <title>Final state interactions for high energy scattering off atomic electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the scattering of high energy leptons off bound atomic electrons focusing primarily on final state interactions i.e., the exchange of virtual photons between the outgoing energetic electron, and the heavy residual charged "debris" in the final state. These effects are inherently absent from calculations for a free electron at rest. Coulomb exchanges are enhanced by the large number of electrons in the atomic debris, and are unsuppressed by non-relativistic velocities in the debris. We find that these exchanges can be resummed using operator methods, and cancel at the level of the cross section until at least $O(\alpha^3)$. Furthermore, we argue that both final {\it and} initial state Coulomb exchanges (enhanced by the number of electrons in the atom) do not affect the cross section until at least $O(\alpha^3)$. Transverse photon couplings to non relativistic electrons are proportional to their small velocities, and rotational invariance suppresses their contribution to $O(\alpha^3)$. Our results are relevant for precision experiments involving neutrinos, electrons, positrons, and muons scattering off of atomic electrons in a fixed target.</description>

      <title>Search for dark QCD with emerging jets in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for ``emerging jets'' produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is performed using data collected by the CMS experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. This search examines a hypothetical dark quantum chromodynamics (QCD) sector that couples to the standard model (SM) through a scalar mediator. The scalar mediator decays into an SM quark and a dark sector quark. As the dark sector quark showers and hadronizes, it produces long-lived dark mesons that subsequently decay into SM particles, resulting in a jet, known as an emerging jet, with multiple displaced vertices. This search looks for pair production of the scalar mediator at the LHC, which yields events with two SM jets and two emerging jets at leading order. The results are interpreted using two dark sector models with different flavor structures, and exclude mediator masses up to 1950 (1950) GeV for an unflavored (flavor-aligned) dark QCD model. The unflavored results surpass a previous search for emerging jets by setting the most stringent mediator mass exclusion limits to date, while the flavor-aligned results provide the first direct mediator mass exclusion limits to date.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global and local topological properties of multi-lepton patterns reconstructed at the detectors. We investigate the sensitivity of Forman Ricci curvature distributions and persistent homology features to kinematic cuts, integrated luminosity, and scales of maximum filtration. We find that these topological properties are efficient enough in discriminating the BSM scenarios from the SM background, particularly when the BSM scenarios possess a massive invisible particle. We also find that the topological properties exhibit a scaling behaviour with integrated luminosity. This exploratory study suggests that the topological features can potentially supplement the traditional cut-and-count analyses in search of new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD radiative corrections to the pion electromagnetic form factor with large momentum transfer. We explicitly verify the validity of the collinear factorization to two-loop order for this observable, and obtain the respective IR-finite two-loop hard-scattering kernel in the closed form. The NNLO QCD correction turns to be positive and significant. Incorporating this new ingredient of correction, we then make a comprehensive comparison between the finest theoretical predictions and numerous pion form factor measurements in both space-like and time-like regions. Our phenomenological analysis provides strong constraint on the second Gegenbauer moment of the pion light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) obtained from recent lattice QCD studies.</description>

Abstract: We present results for the $\tau_1$ and $\tau_{1a}$ 1-Jettiness global event shape distributions, for Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), at the N$^3$LL + ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$ level of accuracy. These event-shape distributions quantify and characterize the pattern of final state radiation in electron-nucleus collisions. They can be used as a probe of nuclear structure functions, nuclear medium effects in jet production, and for a precision extraction of the QCD strong coupling. The results presented here, along with the corresponding numerical codes, can be used for analyses with HERA data, in EIC simulation studies, and for eventual comparison with real EIC data.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Small-$x$ Evolution: Exact Results in the Large-$N_c$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution to the revised small-$x$ orbital angular momentum (OAM) evolution equations derived recently, based on an earlier work. These equations are derived in the double logarithmic approximation (summing powers of $\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant and $x$ the Bjorken $x$ variable) and the large-$N_c$ limit, with $N_c$ the number of quark colors. From our solution, we extract the small-$x$, large-$N_c$ expressions of the quark and gluon OAM distributions. Additionally, we determine the large-$N_c$ small-$x$ asymptotics of the OAM distributions to be
  \begin{align}
  \notag
  L_{q+\bar{q}}(x,Q^2) \sim L_G(x,Q^2) \sim \Delta \Sigma (x,Q^2) \sim \Delta G(x,Q^2) \sim \left(\frac{1}{x} \right)^{\alpha_h},
  \end{align} with the intercept $\alpha_h$ the same as obtained in the small-$x$ helicity evolution, which can be approximated as $\alpha_h \approx 3.66074 \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{2\pi}}$. This result is in complete agreement with the literature. Additionally, we calculate the ratio of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to the flavor-singlet quark and gluon helicity parton distribution functions respectively in the small-$x$ region.</description>

      <title>Global Lepton Flavour Violating Constraints on New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of the bounds from charged lepton flavour violating observables to new physics. We parametrize generic new physics through the Effective Field Theory formalism and perform global fits beyond the common one-operator-at-a-time analyses to investigate how much present data is able to constrain the full parameter space. We particularly focus on leptonic and semileptonic operators with light quarks, identifying unbounded flat directions, detailing how many are present and which operators are involved. The analysis is performed in the general LEFT formalism, which contains all possible low-energy effective operators relevant for lepton flavour violation, as well as in more restricted scenarios, when operators come from a SMEFT completion. We find that flat directions play no role in the fully leptonic four-fermion operators. Conversely, they significantly hinder the ability to derive global bounds on semileptonic operators, with several flat or at least very poorly constrained directions preventing to fully constrain the parameter space. These results are particularly affected by the proper inclusion of uncertainties in the parameters describing $\mu-e$ conversion, which decrease the number of well-constrained directions in operator space when treated as nuisance parameters in the fit. While present data is able to provide global constraints on all operators only in the more restricted scenarios we investigated, very strong correlations among the parameters must exist to avoid conflict with the different observables. We provide correlation matrices approximating our full results as a useful tool to compare present data with particular UV completions.</description>

      <title>Statistical divergences in high-dimensional hypothesis testing and a modern technique for estimating them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis testing in high dimensional data is a notoriously difficult problem without direct access to competing models' likelihood functions. This paper argues that statistical divergences can be used to quantify the difference between the population distributions of observed data and competing models, justifying their use as the basis of a hypothesis test. We go on to point out how modern techniques for functional optimization let us estimate many divergences, without the need for population likelihood functions, using samples from two distributions alone. We use a physics-based example to show how the proposed two-sample test can be implemented in practice, and discuss the necessary steps required to mature the ideas presented into an experimental framework.</description>

      <title>A Novel Diamond-like Carbon based photocathode for PICOSEC Micromegas detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08712v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The PICOSEC Micromegas (MM) detector is a precise timing gaseous detector based on a MM detector operating in a two-stage amplification mode and a Cherenkov radiator. Prototypes equipped with cesium iodide (CsI) photocathodes have shown promising time resolutions as precise as 24 picoseconds (ps) for Minimum Ionizing Particles. However, due to the high hygroscopicity and susceptibility to ion bombardment of the CsI photocathodes, alternative photocathode materials are needed to improve the robustness of PICOSEC MM. Diamond-like Carbon (DLC) film have been introduced as a novel robust photocathode material, which have shown promising results. A batch of DLC photocathodes with different thicknesses were produced and evaluated using ultraviolet light. The quantum efficiency measurements indicate that the optimized thickness of the DLC photocathode is approximately 3 nm. Furthermore, DLC photocathodes show good resistance to ion bombardment in aging test compared to the CsI photocathode. Finally, a PICOSEC MM prototype equipped with DLC photocathodes was tested in muon beams. A time resolution of around 42 ps with a detection efficiency of 97% for 150 GeV/c muons were obtained. These results indicate the great potential of DLC as a photocathode for the PICOSEC MM detector.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thresholds in $B\to (P,V)\gamma^*$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of anomalous thresholds on the non-local form factors describing the hadronization of the light-quark contribution to $B\to(P,V)\gamma^*$ transitions. Starting from a comprehensive discussion of anomalous thresholds in the triangle loop function for different mass configurations, we detail how the dispersion relation for $\pi\pi$ intermediate states is affected by contour deformations mandated by the anomalous branch points. Phenomenological estimates of the size of the anomalous contributions to the form factors are provided with couplings determined from measured branching fractions and Dalitz plot distributions. Our key finding is that anomalous effects are suppressed on the $\rho(770)$ resonance, while off-peak the effects can become as large as $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ of the full (light-quark-loop induced) non-local form factors. We comment on future generalizations towards higher intermediate states and the charm loop, outlining how the dispersive framework established in this work could help improve the non-local form factors needed as input for a robust interpretation of $B\to (P,V)\ell^+\ell^-$ decays.</description>

      <title>Dark photon distortions of NO$\nu$A and T2K neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons coupling to $L_\mu-L_\tau$ lepton number difference are a highly studied light dark matter candidate, with potential to be discovered through their impact on terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. We re-examine this in the light of claimed tensions between the NO$\nu$A and T2K long baseline experiments, also taking into account data from the MINOS experiment. We obtain leading limits on the $L_\mu-L_\tau$ gauge coupling $g'$ versus dark photon mass $m_{A'}$, and find no statistically significant alleviation of the tension from inclusion of the new physics effect.</description>
