      <title>Microscopic model for yields and total kinetic energy in nuclear fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extension of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), the generalized time-dependent generator coordinate method (TDGCM), is applied to a study of induced nuclear fission dynamics. In the generalized TDGCM, the correlated nuclear wave function is represented as a coherent superposition of time-dependent DFT trajectories. In the first realistic application, a large basis of 25 TDDFT trajectories is employed to calculate the charge yields and total kinetic energy distribution for the fission of $^{240}$Pu. The results are compared with available data, and with those obtained using a standard TDDFT, that does not consider quantum fluctuations, and the adiabatic TDGCM+GOA (Gaussian overlap approximation). It is shown that fragment yields and kinetic energies can simultaneously be described in a consistent microscopic framework that includes fluctuations in the collective degrees of freedom and the one-body dissipation mechanism.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic variant of the Grodzins relation and the Quasiparticle Phonon Model are applied to predict the excitation energies of the $2^+_1$ states of neutron deficient U and Pu isotopes. The P-factor systematics is used to determine the quadrupole deformation of nuclei under consideration. The excitation energies of the $4^+_1$ states are predicted based on the simple universal anharmonic vibrator type relation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous analyses are performed for cross section of elastic scattering, Coulomb breakup, transfer, and other direct yields for the $d$+$^{197}$Au system at all available energies. The data are reproduced well by the optical model that is based on parts related to the Coulomb and nuclear contributions of the direct cross sections. This method of calculation can be successfully applied to the reactions of deuteron with heavy targets.</description>

      <title>Radiative $\alpha$ capture on $^{12}$C in cluster effective field theory: short review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Study of radiative $\alpha$ capture on $^{12}$C, $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O, in cluster effective field theory (EFT) is reviewed. A low energy EFT for $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O at the Gamow-peak energy, $E_G=0.3$~MeV, is constructed, and the theory is first applied to the study of elastic $\alpha$-$^{12}$C scattering at low energies. The effective range parameters are fitted to the precise phase shift data of the elastic scattering and the astrophysical $S_{E1}$ factor of the $E1$ transition of $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O at $E_G$ is estimated. For the study of the $E2$ transition of $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O, we discuss a difficulty to determine the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) of the subthreshold $2_1^+$ state of $^{16}$O from the elastic scattering data, and demonstrate the difficulty with the estimate of the astrophysical $S_{E2}$ factor of $^{12}$C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{16}$O at $E_G$. We discuss the uncertainty in the estimate of the $S$ factors at $E_G$ in the present approach.</description>

      <title>Symmetry energy dependence of the bulk viscosity of nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify how the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity $\zeta$ and the bulk relaxation time $\tau_\Pi$ of neutrino-transparent $npe$ matter depend on the nuclear symmetry energy. We show that, at saturation density, the equation-of-state dependence of these transport quantities is fully determined by the experimentally constrained nuclear symmetry energy $S$ and its slope $L$. Variations of $L$ within current experimental uncertainties can change the (frequency-independent) bulk viscosity by orders of magnitude. This suggests that dissipative effects encoded in the gravitational-wave signatures of binary neutron star inspirals may help constrain nuclear symmetry energy properties.</description>

      <title>Scattering and gluon emission of physical quarks in a SU(3) colored field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scattering of the gluon-dressed physical quarks, defined as the eigenstates of the vacuum QCD Hamiltonian, off a colored medium. We solve the wavefunction of the physical quark state by diagonalizing the QCD Hamiltonian in vacuum in a $\ket{q}+\ket{qg}$ Fock space, with implementing the sector-dependent mass renormalization scheme. We then perform numerical simulations of the real-time quantum state evolution of the initially dressed quark state at various medium densities. The results are compared with those of an initially bare or off-shell quark states. With the obtained light-front wavefunction of the evolved state, we extract the quark jet transverse momentum broadening, the quenching parameter, the cross section, the gluon emission rate, and the evolution of the invariant mass. The scenario considered is relevant for high energy scattering processes, where the quark originates from far outside the color field describing the scattering target. This investigation on dressed quarks complements our earlier studies of the single quark scattering in the $\ket{q}$ Fock space, and of the bare quark scattering in the $\ket{q}+\ket{qg}$ Fock space, providing a novel systematic description of quark scattering process using a non-perturbative formalism.</description>

      <title>Empirical Determination of the Kaon Distribution Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach to extract the Kaon leading-twist distribution amplitude (DA) from empirical information on the ratio of the neutral-to-charged kaon electromagnetic form factors, $\mathcal{R}_K$. Our study employs a two-parameter representation of the DA at $\zeta=2$ GeV, designed to capture the expected broadening and asymmetry of the distribution, as well as the soft endpoint behavior predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our leading-order analysis of the latest experimental measurements of $\mathcal{R}_K$ reveals that the extracted DA exhibits a somewhat significant skewness, with the first symmetric moment approximately $\langle 1-2x \rangle_K= 0.082(7)$. On the other hand, the brodaness and general shape of the produced distributions show a reasonable consistency with contemporaty lattice and continuum QCD analyses. These findings highlight the importance of accurately determining the profile of the DA, especially the skewness and its relation to $SU_F(3)$ flavor symmetry breaking, as well as the inclusion of higher-order effects in the hard-scattering kernels for analyzing data at experimentally accessible scales.</description>

      <title>$C$ and $CP$ violation in effective field theories and applications to $\eta$-meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest for sources of the simultaneous violation of $C$ and $CP$ symmetry was popular in the 1960s, but has since been neglected for a long time. We revisit the operators that break $C$ and $CP$ for flavor-conserving transitions in both the Standard Model effective field theory and the low-energy effective field theory, which subsequently can be matched to light-meson physics using chiral perturbation theory. As applications, we discuss in particular the $C$-odd Dalitz plot asymmetries in $\eta\to3\pi$, but also decays with dilepton pairs in the final state, such as long-distance contributions to the rare semileptonic decays $\eta\to\pi^0\ell^+\ell^-$ as well as asymmetries in $\eta^{(\prime)} \to \gamma \ell^+\ell^-$ and $\eta^{(\prime)} \to \pi^+\pi^-\ell^+\ell^-$.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating in binary inspiral of strange quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate tidal heating associated with the binary inspiral of strange quark stars and its impact on the resulting gravitational wave signal. Tidal heating during the merger of neutron stars composed of nuclear matter may be considered negligible, but it has been demonstrated recently that the presence of hyperons at high densities could significantly enhance the dissipation during inspiral. In this work, we evaluate the bulk viscosity arising from non-leptonic weak processes involving quarks and show that it can be several orders of magnitude higher than the viscosity of nuclear matter at temperatures relevant to the inspiral phase of the merger of strange stars. We model strange quark matter in the normal phase using a non-ideal bag model including electrons and ensure compatibility with astrophysical constraints. By analysing equal-mass binary systems with component masses ranging from 1.4 to 1.8 $\, M_{\odot}$, we find that temperatures close to 0.1 MeV are reached by the end of the inspiral phase. We also estimate the effect on the gravitational waveform and conclude that the additional phase shift could range from $0.1$ to $0.5$ radians for strange quark masses of 200 MeV, making it potentially detectable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors. Given that tidal heating from hyperons is dominant only for very massive neutron stars having masses 1.8 to 2.0 $\, M_{\odot}$, a successful detection of this phase shift during the inspiral of binary systems with relatively low masses of 1.4 to 1.6 $\, M_{\odot}$ could be a smoking gun signature for the existence of strange quark stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter we give a pedagogical introduction to the constituent quark model. The explanation of magnetic moments of the nucleons was crucial to introduce an effective quark mass for light quarks that nowadays are understood as an effect of Spontaneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking in QCD. We give an overview of the first applications of the model and an introduction to the most modern developments studying states beyond the naive quark model as tetraquarks and pentaquarks.</description>

      <title>Neutron-star seismology with realistic, finite-temperature nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The oscillation spectrum of a neutron star is notably rich and intrinsically dependent on the equation of state of nuclear matter. With recent advancements in gravitational-wave and electromagnetic astronomy, we are nearing the capability to perform neutron-star asteroseismology and probe the complex physics of neutron stars. With this in mind, we explore the implementation of three-parameter finite-temperature matter models in the computation of neutron-star oscillations. We consider in detail the thermodynamics of nuclear matter and show how this information enters the problem. Our realistic treatment takes into account entropy and composition gradients that exist in the nuclear matter, giving rise to buoyant g-mode oscillations. To illustrate the implementation, we determine the oscillation spectrum of a low-temperature neutron star. In addition to the expected compositional and thermal g-modes, we find perturbations sourced by phase transitions in the equation of state. We also examine two thermal models, comparing the results for constant redshifted temperature with those for uniform entropy per baryon.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $P-$wave doubly charmed and bottom baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the strong decays for $P-$wave excited states of doubly charmed and bottom baryons in the constituent quark model. Our results indicate that some $\lambda-$mode $\Xi_{cc/bb}(1P)$ and $\Omega_{cc/bb}(1P)$ states are relatively narrow, which are very likely to be discovered by future experiments. The light meson emissions for the low-lying $\rho-$mode states are highly suppressed due to the orthogonality of wave functions between initial and final states. Moreover, the strong decay behaviors for doubly charmed and bottom baryons preserve the heavy superflavor symmetry well, where the small violation originates from the finite heavy quark masses and different phase spaces. We hope that present theoretical results for undiscovered doubly charmed and bottom baryons can provide helpful information for future experiments and help us to better understand the heavy quark symmetry.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state via the $Z_c(3900)$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position to constrain the existence of the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state within the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state remains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction, particularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can differ by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This discrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this issue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and the $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out, leaving the coupling constant of the $\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown parameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound states exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ located within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the three-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more than $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on the $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other state. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters calibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters provide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving few-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence of the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination of the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method.</description>

      <title>Non-radial oscillations of hadronic neutron stars, quark stars, and hybrid stars : Calculation of $f$, $p$, and $g$ mode frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The composition and equation of state (EoS) of dense matter relevant to compact stars are quite inconclusive. However, certain observational constraints on the structural properties of compact stars help us constrain the EoS to a fair extent. Moreover, gravitational asteroseismology gives a notion of the composition and EoS of compact stars. The next generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors are likely to detect several oscillation mode frequencies of the GWs. In this work we compute the fundamental ($f$) and the first pressure ($p_1$) mode frequencies ($f_f$ and $f_{p1}$, respectively) with different compositions viz., hadronic, quark, and hybrid star (HS) matter. For HSs, we also study the gravity ($g$) mode frequency ($f_g$). For each phase we also study the correlation between the oscillation frequencies of 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ and 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ compact stars with other different properties. We find that various possible composition of compact stars substantially affects the oscillation frequencies. However, the mass-scaled angular $f$ mode frequency ($\omega_f M$) varies universally with compactness ($C$) for all hadronic, quark and hybrid stars. The $f$ mode frequency ($f_{f_{1.4}}$) of the canonical 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ compact star, obtained with different composition, is quite correlated with the canonical radius ($R_{1.4}$) and tidal deformability ($\Lambda_{1.4}$) while $f_{p_{1.4}}$ is well correlated with slope parameter of the symmetry energy. We also show that $f_{g_{1.4}}$ of the HSs varies almost linearly with $\Lambda_{1.4}$. Should $g$ modes be detected, they could not only support the existence of HSs, but $f_g$ could be useful to understand the strength of quark repulsion in HSs.</description>
