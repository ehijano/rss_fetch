      <title>Classification of nilpotent Lie algebras of nilpotency class 3 having a derived subalgebra of dimension three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate nilpotent Lie algebras $ L $ of nilpotency class $3 $ and provide a complete classification of those satisfying $ \dim L^2 = 3 $ and $Z(L) = L^3 \cong A(2). $ Furthermore, we explicitly characterize the structure of such Lie algebras in the case when $ \dim L = 7. $</description>

      <title>Modular elements of the lattices of varieties of semigroups and epigroups. I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the first part of a study devoted to description of modular elements in the lattices of semigroup and epigroup varieties. We provide strengthened necessary and sufficient conditions under which a semigroup or epigroup variety constitutes a modular element in its respective lattice. These results refine previously known criteria and lay the groundwork for a complete classification, to be presented in the second part of the study.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of relative Lie central extension for pair of multiplicative Lie algebras. Then, we discuss the concept of isoclinism for relative Lie central extensions and prove some related results. We also define the Frattini subalgebra for multiplicative Lie algebras and discuss its properties, finally the Schur multiplier for pair of multiplicative Lie algebras is introduced and under certain conditions prove the existence of multiplicative covering pair.</description>

      <title>Separating versus ordinary Noether numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $K$ a field containing an element of multiplicative order $|G|$. It is shown that if $G$ has a cyclic subgroup of index at most $2$, then the separating Noether number over $K$ of $G$ coincides with the Noether number over $K$ of $G$. The same conclusion holds when $G$ is the direct product of a dihedral group and the $2$-element group. On the other hand, the smallest non-abelian groups $G$ are found for which the separating Noether number over $K$ is strictly less than the Noether number over $K$. Along the way the exact value of the separating Noether number is determined for all groups of order at most $16$. The results show in particular that unlike the ordinary Noether number, the separating Noether number of a non-abelian finite group may well be equal to the separating Noether number of a proper direct factor of the group.</description>

      <title>Invitation to finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to the finite groups, with focus on the groups of permutations and reflections, and more generally, on the finite groups of unitary matrices. We first discuss the basics of group theory, featuring the cyclic, dihedral and symmetric groups, and the structure result for finite abelian groups. Then we study the complex reflection groups, with general theory and examples, classification results, and with a look into braid groups too. We then go into the study of representation theory, and of more advanced aspects, such as Tannakian duality, Brauer theorems and Clebsch-Gordan rules. Finally, we discuss, using representation theory methods, a number of advanced analytic aspects, for the most in relation with questions coming from probability.</description>

      <title>Height zero characters and Galois automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $p$ be a prime. In this paper, we prove a strengthened version of Brauer's height zero conjecture for the principal $p$-block of $G$ that takes the action of a certain group of Galois automorphisms into account. This answers a conjecture recently proposed by Malle, Moret\'o, Rizo and Schaeffer Fry. We then use this to obtain a structural result which can be seen as a Galois version of the It\^o-Michler theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that Anderson's conjecture on symmetric sequencings and Bailey's conjecture on 2-sequencings hold for sufficiently large groups. In addition, we discuss extensions of partial harmonious sequences and partial R-sequencings. Several further results on double sequencings are presented, both in the context of abelian groups and for sufficiently large non-abelian groups.</description>

      <title>An explicit algorithm for the Higman Embedding Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04347v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which for any recursive group $G$, given by its effectively enumerable generators and recursively enumerable relations, outputs an explicit embedding of $G$ into a finitely presented group directly written by its generators and defining relations. This is the explicit analogue of the remarkable Higman Embedding Theorem stating that a finitely generated group $G$ is embeddable into a finitely presented group if and only if $G$ is recursive. The constructed finitely presented group can even be chosen to be $2$-generator. This algorithm has already been applied, for example, to the additive group of rational numbers $\mathbb Q$, which clearly is recursive. The question on explicit embedding of $\mathbb Q$ into a finitely presented group was mentioned in the literature by Johnson, de la Harpe, Bridson and others. The suggested method can be used to solve the problem of embeddings for some other recursive groups, also. The embedding algorithm is built using conventional free constructions, including free products with amalgamation, HNN-extensions, and also their modifications, such as the auxiliary $*$-constructions. We also analyze the steps of original Higman embedding to clearly indicate which of its parts are not explicit.</description>

      <title>Rotation sets and axes in the fine curve graph for torus homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expand the dictionary between the action of a torus homeomorphism on the fine curve graph and its rotation set. More precisely, we show that the fixed points at infinity of a loxodromic element determine the rotation set up to scale. A key ingredient is a metric version of the classical WPD property from geometric group theory.
  As a consequence we find new stable criteria for positive scl, and for two homeomorphisms to generate a free group, and we provide a Tits alternative for groups of torus homeomorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A representation $\Phi: G \to \mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F})$ of a finite group $G$ is called unisingular if the matrix $\Phi(g)$ admits $1$ as an eigenvalue for any $g\in G$. In this paper, we determine all the complex irreducible unisingular representations of the finite simple groups of Lie type of rank $1$ and of the almost simple sporadic groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biggs gave an explicit construction, using finite colored trees, of finite permutation groups whose Cayley graphs have valence \(C\) and girth tending to infinity as the radius \(R\) of the tree tends to infinity. We show that when the number of colors is at least 3, the group so presented contains the full alternating group on the vertices of the tree.
  This gives, for each \(C\geq 3\), an infinite family of pairs \((G_{C,R},S_{C,R})\) such that \(G_{C,R}\) is an alternating or symmetric group, \(S_{C,R}\) is a generating set of \(G_{C,R}\) of size \(C\) with an explicit permutation description of its generators, and such that the sequence of Cayley graphs \(\mathrm{Cay}(G_{C,R},S_{C,R})\) has constant valence \(C\) and girth tending to infinity as \(R\) tends to infinity.</description>

Abstract: We extend the class of abelian groups for which a conjecture of Asai and Yoshida on the number of crossed homomorphisms holds. We also prove a general result which connects certain problems concerning divisibility in groups to the Asai-Yoshida conjecture. One of the consequences is that for finite groups F and G the number |Hom(F,G)| is divisible by gcd(|G|, |F:F'|) if F/F' is a product of a cyclic group and a group with cube-free exponent.</description>

      <title>Coarse cops and robber in graphs and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (abstract shortened to meet arxiv's length requirements) We investigate two variants of the classical Cops and robber game in graphs, recently introduced by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche. The two versions are played in infinite graphs and the goal of the cops is to prevent the robber to visit some ball of finite radius (chosen by the robber) infinitely many times. Moreover the cops and the robber move at a different speed, and the cops can choose a radius of capture before the game starts. Depending on the order in which the parameters are chosen, this naturally defines two games, a weak version and a strong version (in which the cops are more powerful), and thus two variants of the cop number of a graph $G$: the weak cop number and the strong cop number. It turns out that these two parameters are invariant under quasi-isometry and thus we can investigate these parameters in finitely generated groups by considering any of their Cayley graphs; the parameters do not depend on the chosen set of generators.
  We answer a number of questions raised by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche, and more recently by Cornect and Mart\'inez-Pedroza. This includes a proof that the weak and strong cop numbers are monotone under quasi-isometric embedding, characterizations of graphs of weak cop number 1 and graphs of strong cop number 1, and a proof that the grid has infinite strong cop number. Moreover we tie the weak cop number of a graph $G$ to the existence of asymptotic minors of large tree-width in $G$, and use the result to prove that any finitely presented group has weak cop number 1 or $\infty$.
  We have learned very recently that some of our results have been obtained independently by Appenzeller and Klinge, using fairly different arguments.</description>

Abstract: We study definably primitive pseudo-finite permutation groups of finite $SU$-rank. We show that if $(G,X)$ is such a permutation group, then the rank of $G$ can be bounded in terms of the rank of $X$, providing an analogue of a theorem of Borovik and Cherlin in the setting of definably primitive permutation groups of finite Morley rank.</description>

      <title>Spectral selections, commutativity preservation and Coxeter-Lipschitz maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system whose graph is connected, with no infinite edges. A self-map $\tau$ of $W$ such that $\tau_{\sigma\theta}\in \{\tau_{\theta},\ \sigma\tau_{\theta}\}$ for all $\theta\in W$ and all reflections $\sigma$ (analogous to being 1-Lipschitz with respect to the Bruhat order on $W$) is either constant or a right translation. A somewhat stronger version holds for $S_n$, where it suffices that $\sigma$ range over smaller, $\theta$-dependent sets of reflections.
  These combinatorial results have a number of consequences concerning continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps $\mathrm{SU}(n)\to M_n$ defined on special unitary groups: every such map is a conjugation composed with (a) the identity; (b) transposition, or (c) a continuous diagonal spectrum selection. This parallels and recovers Petek's analogous statement for self-maps of the space $H_n\le M_n$ of self-adjoint matrices, strengthening it slightly by expanding the codomain to $M_n$.</description>

      <title>Profinite approach to S-adic shift spaces I: Saturating directive sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a series of three, about (relatively)free profinite semigroups and S-adic representations of minimal
  shift spaces. We associate to each primitive S-adic directivesequence ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ a $\textit{profinite image}$ in the free profinite
  semigroup over the alphabet of the induced minimal shift space. When this profinite image contains a $\mathcal{J}$-maximal maximal subgroup
  of the free profinite semigroup (which, up to isomorphism, is called the $\textit{Sch\"utzenberger group}$ of the shift space), we say that
  ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is $\textit{saturating}$. We show that if ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is recognizable, then it is saturating. Conversely, we use the notion
  of saturating sequence to obtain several sufficient conditions for ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ to be recognizable: ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ consists of pure encodings;
  or ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is eventually recognizable, saturating and consists of encodings; or ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ is eventually recognizable, recurrent,
  bounded and consists of encodings. For the most part, we do not assume that ${\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$ has finite alphabet rank although we establish
  that this combinatorial property has important algebraic consequences, namely that the rank of the Sch\"utzenberger group is
  also finite, whose maximum possible value we also determine. We also show that for every minimal shift space of finite topological rank,
  the rank of its Sch\"utzenberger group is a lower bound of the topological rank.</description>

      <title>On Salem numbers of degree 4 and arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we construct an arithmetic hyperbolic $6-$orbifold $\mathcal{O}$ such that, any square-rootable Salem number of degree at most $4$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is realized as the exponential of the length of a closed geodesic in $\mathcal{O}$. We also prove that $n=6$ is the minimal dimension among arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds of the first type where it can be obtained. In an appendix, we establish a general relation between the discriminant of a Salem number and the determinant of a quadratic space which realizes it. In particular, for any $m,d&gt;0$ we present a geometric proof of the existence of Salem numbers of degree $2m$ with discriminant $(-1)^{m+1}d$ in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}/\mathbb{Q}^{\times 2}$.</description>
