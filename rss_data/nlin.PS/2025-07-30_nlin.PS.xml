      <title>On the fate of travelling waves at the boundary of quantum droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze quantum droplets formed in a two-dimensional symmetric mixture of Bose-Einstein condensed atoms. For sufficiently large atom numbers, these droplets exhibit a flat-top density profile with sharp boundaries governed by surface tension. Within the bulk of the droplet, traveling matter waves - localized density dips - can propagate at constant velocity while maintaining their shape. Using numerical simulations and qualitative analysis, we investigate the rich phenomenology that arises when such excitations reach the boundary of a finite droplet. We show that they can emit a small outgoing droplet, excite internal modes of the host soliton, or, in the case of vortex-antivortex pairs, split into individual vortices propagating backward near the edge. Furthermore, we demonstrate that traveling waves can be dynamically generated near the boundary through the collision of distinct droplets, and we discuss their trajectories and interactions.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for dynamic patterns in coupled oscillator networks: When larger networks are simpler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks of coupled phase oscillators are one of the most studied dynamical systems with numerous applications in physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering. Their typical behaviour looks like a partially synchronized dynamic pattern, where some oscillators behave almost identically, while others behave differently relative to each other. In the case of large networks, the properties of these patterns can often be analysed using a kind of mean-field approach (called thermodynamic limit or continuum limit), where the state of the system is represented by a single-particle probability density function and its evolution is described by a standard continuity equation. Such an analytical approach allows to predict what type of network dynamics can be observed for different system parameters. But it is less known that for different partially synchronized patterns it also allows to obtain statistical equilibrium relations that express the dependence of some time-averaged observable quantities of individual oscillators on the internal parameters of these oscillators and the interaction functions between them. In this paper, we show how such relations can be derived, what their typical accuracy is for finite-size networks, and how they can be used to reconstruct the parameters of the corresponding model. The proposed method is particularly effective for large networks, for unevenly sampled or noisy observables, and for partial observations. Its possibilities are demonstrated by application to chimera states in networks of phase oscillator with nonlocal coupling.</description>

      <title>Travelling front solutions in a spatially heterogeneous reaction-diffusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-component reaction-diffusion system with a slow-fast structure and spatially varying coefficients $ f_1 $ and $ f_2 $ appearing in the slow equation. Under mild boundedness and regularity conditions on $ f_1 $ and $ f_2 $ the system is shown to exhibit bi-stability in the form of two stable stationary heterogeneous background states. These background states can be connected by stationary and travelling front solutions. Travelling fronts feature an interface that moves with a non-uniform speed through the motionless spatially varying background states it connects. As a result, unlike classical travelling waves, these fronts are not stationary in any co-moving frame. We construct both the background states and stationary fronts using an extension of Fenichel theory to the non-compact case. Additionally, we establish the existence of travelling front solutions and derive a leading-order expression for the dynamic position of the moving interface through a non-autonomous spatial dynamics approach. This expression takes the form of a delay-differential equation, and its accuracy is validated through numerical simulations. A key contribution of our work lies in the general treatment of $ f_1 $ and $ f_2 $, which are neither (necessarily) asymptotically small nor restricted to specific forms such as periodic or localised structures. Furthermore, our derivation of the front position formula circumvents the traditional reliance on spectral analysis, enabling us to describe front dynamics beyond bifurcations from stationary fronts. This approach has the potential to be extended to other settings in which spectral properties at onset preclude conventional reduction techniques.</description>
