      <title>A Study on Actions for Atomic Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays there is a large number of non-classical logics, each one best suited for reasoning about some issues in abstract fields, such as linguistics or epistemology, among others. Proving interesting properties for each one of them supposes a big workload for logicians and computer scientists. We want an approach into this problematic that is modular. To adress this issue, the report shows new insights in the construction of Atomic Logics introduced by Guillaume Aucher. Atomic Logics let us represent very general left and right introduction rules and they come along a new kind of rules based on display logics and residuation. A new approach is taken into the definition of Atomic Logics, which is now built on a class of actions for which we prove cut-elimination. We show that some of them are equivalent to Aucher's Atomic Logics and we prove cut-elimination and Craig Interpolation for a class of them. The introduced theory is applied to the non-associative Lambek Calculus throughout the report. It is accompanied by a computer-checked formalisation of the original syntax in the proof assistant Coq.</description>

      <title>On closed definable subsets in Hensel minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with Hensel minimal structures on non-trivially valued fields $K$. The main aim is to establish the following two properties of closed 0-definable subsets $A$ in the affine spaces $K^{n}$. Every such subset $A$ is the zero locus of a continuous 0-definable function $f:K^{n} \to K$, and there exists a 0-definable retraction $r: K^{n} \to A$. While the former property is a non-Archimedean counterpart of the one from o-minimal geometry, the former does not hold in real geometry in general. The proofs make use of a model-theoretic compactness argument and ubiquity of clopen sets in non-Archimedean geometry.</description>

      <title>On conjugacy and perturbation of subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study conjugacy orbits of certain types of subalgebras in tracial von Neumann algebras. For any separable II$_1$ factor $N_0$ we construct a highly indecomposable non Gamma II$_1$ factor $N$ such that $N_0 \subset N$ and moreover every von Neumann subalgebra of $N$ with Haagerup's property admits a unique embedding up to unitary conjugation. Such a factor necessarily has to be non separable, but we show that it can be taken of density character $2^{\aleph_0}$. On the other hand we are able to construct for any separable II$_1$ factor $M_0$, a separable II$_1$ factor $M$ containing $M_0$ such that every property (T) subfactor admits a unique embedding into $M$ up to uniformly approximate unitary equivalence; i.e., any pair of embeddings can be conjugated up to a small uniform $2$-norm perturbation.</description>

      <title>Hochschild cohomology in toposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of internal Hochschild cohomology in a ringed topos. We construct it via the internal Hochschild cochain complex, as well as through derived functor/topos cohomology theory, and discuss its relationship to the absolute Hochschild cohomology.
  By specialising to the topos of difference sets, we obtain a theory of internal difference Hochschild cohomology, and compare it to the absolute Hochschild cohomology through the Grothendieck and hypercohomology spectral sequences.
  We provide a systematic and detailed treatment of tensor products in suitable toposes in hope to complete the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Generalized Chevalley criteria in simplicial homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a generalized treatment of (co)cartesian arrows, fibrations, and functors. Compared to the classical conditions, the endpoint inclusions get replaced by arbitrary shape inclusions. Our framework is Riehl--Shulman's simplicial homotopy type theory which supports the development of synthetic internal $(\infty,1)$-category theory.</description>

      <title>Surfaces and other Peano Continua with no Generic Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space of chains on a compact connected space encodes all the different ways of continuously growing out of a point until exhausting the space. A chain is generic if its orbit under the action of the underlying homeomorphism group is comeager: a space X has a generic chain if there is essentially just one type of chain on X. Gutman, Tsankov and Zucker proved that compact manifolds of dimension at least 3 do not have a generic chain. We extend and generalize their result, covering a large class of spaces which includes all compact surfaces except for the sphere and the real projective plane - for which the question remains open - as well as all other homogeneous Peano continua, circle excluded. If the spaces are moreover strongly locally homogeneous, which is the case for any closed manifold as well as the Menger curve, we prove that chains cannot be classified up to homeomorphism by countable structures, and that the underlying homomorphism groups have non-metrizable universal minimal flows. This is in contrast with the case of 1-dimensional manifolds: their homomorphism groups have metrizable universal minimal flow and we show that their chains are classifiable by countable structures and have a generic element. The proof of the main result relies on crafting a dictionary between open sets of chains on one side, and walks on finite connected graphs on the other. We then establish a novel combinatorial necessary condition for the existence of a generic chain, an off-by-one weak amalgamation principle, and prove that it is not satisfied under the hypotheses of our theorem.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous isosceles-free spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study homogeneity aspects of metric spaces in which all triples of distinct points admit pairwise different distances; such spaces are called isosceles-free. In particular, we characterize all homogeneous isosceles-free spaces up to isometry as vector spaces over the two-element field, endowed with an injective norm. Using isosceles-free decompositions, we provide bounds on the maximal number of distances in arbitrary homogeneous finite metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Herbrand's Theorem in Refutation Schemata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An inductive proof can be represented as a proof schema, i.e. as a parameterized sequence of proofs defined in a primitive recursive way. A corresponding cut-elimination method, called schematic CERES, can be used to analyze these proofs, and to extract their (schematic) Herbrand sequents, even though Herbrand's theorem in general does not hold for proofs with induction inferences. This work focuses on the most crucial part of the schematic cut-elimination method, which is to construct a refutation of a schematic formula that represents the cut-structure of the original proof schema. We develop a new framework for schematic substitutions and define a unification algorithm for resolution schemata. Moreover, we show that this new formalism allows the extraction of a structure from the refutation schema, called a Herbrand schema, which represents its Herbrand sequent.</description>

      <title>On some Fraisse limits with free amalgamation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first section of this work we discuss some curiosities around stable Kim-forking. In the second section we give a general way of building some known and some new examples of NSOP1 theories as the limit of some Fraisse class satisfying some strong conditions. These limits will satisfy existence, that Kim independence and algebraic independence coincide over arbitrary sets, that forcing base monotonicity on Kim-independance gives forking independence, and they come with a stationary independence relation. This study is based on the results of Baudish, Ramsey, Chernikov and Kruckman.</description>

      <title>Cardinality and Representation of Stone Relation Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous work has axiomatised the cardinality operation in relation algebras, which counts the number of edges of an unweighted graph. We generalise the cardinality axioms to Stone relation algebras, which model weighted graphs, and study the relationships between various axioms for cardinality. This results in simpler cardinality axioms also for relation algebras. We give sufficient conditions for the representability of Stone relation algebras and for Stone relation algebras to be relation algebras.</description>
