Abstract: The preceding Comment [1], previously posted as arXiv:2312.04495 [2], on our paper J. Supercond. Nov. Mag. 35, 3141 (2022) [3] provides a welcome opportunity to clarify what we understand to be pervading misconceptions by Eremets, Minkov and coauthors in regard to our analysis [3] of their trapped flux experiments in hydrides under pressure [4]. We hope that this Reply [5] will help readers interested in hydride superconductivity sort out between different claims and counterclaims in the literature and inform their views based on verifiable facts.</description>

      <title>Universal approach to light driven "superconductivity" via preformed pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there are many different mechanisms which have been proposed to understand the physics behind light induced "superconductivity", what seems to be common to the class of materials in which this is observed are strong pairing correlations, which are present in the normal state. Here we argue, that the original ideas of Eliashberg are applicable to such a pseudogap phase and that with exposure to radiation the fermions are redistributed to higher energies where they are less deleterious to pairing. What results then is a photo-induced state with dramatically enhanced number of nearly condensed fermion pairs. In this phase, because the a.c. conductivity, $\sigma(\omega) = \sigma_1(\omega) + i \sigma_2(\omega)$, is dominated by the bosonic contribution, it can be computed using conventional (Aslamazov Larkin) fluctuation theory. We, thereby, observe the expected fingerprint of this photoinduced "superconducting" state which is a $1/\omega$ dependence in $\sigma_2$ with fits to the data of the same quality as found for the so-called photo-enhanced (Drude) conductivity scenario. Here, however, we have a microscopic understanding of the characteristic low energy scale which appears in transport and which is necessarily temperature dependent. This approach also provides insight into recent observations of concomitant diamagnetic fluctuations. Our calculations suggest that the observed light-induced phase in these strongly paired superconductors has only short range phase coherence without long range superconducting order.</description>

      <title>Dome-Shaped Superconducting Phase Diagram Linked to Charge Order in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and charge order is a central focus in condensed matter research, with kagome lattice systems offering unique insights. The kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ ($T_{\rm c}$ ${\simeq}$ 6.5 K) exhibits a hierarchy of charge order transitions: primary ($T_{\rm co,I}$ ${\simeq}$ 400 K), secondary ($T_{\rm co,II}$ ${\simeq}$ 80 K), and an additional transition at ($T^{*}$ $\simeq$ 35 K). The transitions at $T_{\rm co,II}$ and $T^{*}$ are linked to electronic and magnetic responses as revealed by muon-spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments. However, the connection between superconductivity, charge order, and electronic responses has remained elusive. By employing magnetotransport and X-ray diffraction techniques under pressures of up to 40 GPa, we observe that $T_{\rm c}$ rises to 9 K at 2 GPa, remains nearly constant up to 12 GPa, and then decreases to 2 K at 40 GPa, resulting in a dome-shaped phase diagram. The resistivity anomaly at $T^{*}$ and magnetoresistance also exhibit a similar dome-shaped pressure dependence. Furthermore, we find that charge order transitions from long-range to short-range above 12 GPa, correlating with the suppression of $T_{\rm c}$, suggesting superconductivity is closely tied to the charge-ordered state. Specifically, $T_{\rm c}$ peaks when charge order and the normal-state electronic responses are optimized. In contrast to systems like the cuprates, transition metal dichalcogenides, and other kagome materials, where superconductivity typically competes with charge order, LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ displays a pronounced interdependence between these two phenomena. This distinctive behavior sheds new light on the connection between superconductivity and charge order, offering avenues for theoretical advancements in understanding superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity-enhanced magnetic field noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stray magnetic field noise outside a two-dimensional superconductor. Our considerations are motivated by recent experiments, which observed an enhancement in the magnetic field noise below the superconducting critical temperature based on the relaxation of diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers. Such enhancement is not captured by the standard two-fluid model for the superconducting state, recently proposed to explain such NV relaxometry experiments. Instead, we show that a microscopic BCS theory captures such an enhancement, and we compare with a similar theory and phenomenon, known as the Hebel-Schlicter peak (or coherence peak), observed in the relaxation of nuclear spins in the material. The primary difference is that the NV probes long-wavelength magnetic noise outside the sample, while the nuclear spin probes local hyperfine noise inside the sample. Accordingly, the noise probed by the NV depends on its height and can probe, in pristine samples, the superfluid coherence length. Finally, we discuss potential avenues for NVs to probe unconventional superconductivity via deviations from the above BCS theory.</description>

      <title>The role of superconducting fitness in pairing from fluctuating order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many unconventional superconductors the pairing interaction is believed to be mediated by a fluctuating order. Although this is typically taken to be magnetic in origin, the role of other fluctuating orders has recently been considered. In this work we examine the weak-coupling pairing interaction produced by a general fluctuating order, and seek to identify the leading pairing instability. For a given pairing channel, we show that the superconducting fitness with the associated static order appears prominently in the expression for the coupling constant. We consequently argue that fit gaps (for which the static order is not pair-breaking) should have an attractive interaction, whereas unfit gaps (for which the static order is pair-breaking) have a repulsive interaction. We propose a simple heuristic test for the tendency of a given pairing state to have an attractive interaction. We show the validity of this test in the case of pairing caused by fluctuating density-wave order, and use it to probe the superconducting state generated by a fluctuating noncolinear magnetic order on the pyrochlore lattice.</description>

      <title>Towards novel tunability schemes for hybrid ferromagnetic transmon qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux tuning of qubit frequencies in superconducting quantum processors is fundamental for implementing single and multi-qubit gates in quantum algorithms. Typical architectures involve the use of DC or fast RF lines. However, these lines introduce significant heat dissipation and undesirable decoherence mechanisms, leading to a severe bottleneck for scalability. Among different solutions to overcome this issue, we propose integrating tunnel Superconductor-Insulating-thin superconducting interlayer-Ferromagnet-Superconductor Josephson junctions (SIsFS JJs) into a novel transmon qubit design, the so-called ferrotransmon. SIsFS JJs provide memory properties due to the presence of ferromagnetic barriers and preserve at the same time the low-dissipative behavior of tunnel-insulating JJs, thus promoting an alternative tuning of the qubit frequency. In this work, we discuss the fundamental steps towards the implementation of this hybrid ferromagnetic transmon. We will give a special focus on the design, simulations, and preliminary experimental characterization of superconducting lines to provide in-plane magnetic fields, fundamental for an on-chip control of the qubit frequencies in the ferrotransmon.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Non-superconducting Pairs in YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} Below Tc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairing states are essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. Here the non-superconducting state in an optimally doped YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta} film was driven out of equilibrium by an optical pump with low fluence at a temperature well below the critical temperature (Tc), and its recovery dynamics were exclusively measured using transient terahertz spectroscopy. The pump-fluence dependent experiments unveiled evidence of local pairs without superconductivity coexisting with the superconducting Cooper pairs. An energy gap opening induced by the local pairing with short-range coherence was invoked to rationalize the temperature-dependent recovery time of local pairs with a characteristic divergence at a temperature substantially below Tc. These local pairs displayed remarkable likeness to the short-range pair-density-wave state. Our finding shed light on understanding the dynamic interplay between the coexisting superconducting and non-superconducting pairs in cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Strong Coupling Theory of Superconductivity and Ferroelectric Quantum Criticality in metallic SrTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ has remained an enduring mystery for over 50 years. The material's status as a ``quantum" ferroelectric metal, characterized by a soft polar mode, suggests that quantum criticality could play a pivotal role in the emergence of its superconducting state. We show that the system is amenable to a strong coupling (Eliashberg) pairing analysis, with the dominant coupling to the soft mode being a ``dynamical'' Rashba coupling. We compute the expected $T_c$ for the entire phase diagram, all the way to the quantum critical point and beyond. We demonstrate that the linear coupling is sufficient to obtain a rough approximation of the experimentally measured phase diagram, but that nonlinear coupling terms are crucial in reproducing the finer features in the ordered phase. The primary role of nonlinear terms at the peak of the superconducting dome is to enhance the effective linear coupling induced by the broken order, shifting the dome's maximum into the ordered phase. Our theory quantitatively reproduces the three-dimensional experimental phase diagram in the space of carrier density, distance from the quantum critical point and temperature, and allows us to estimate microscopic parameters from the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Transport of Majorana Bound State in the presence of telegraph noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana Bound States (MBS) have emerged as promising candidates for robust quantum computing due to their non-Abelian statistics and topological protection. In this study, we focus on the dynamical transport of MBS in the semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) heterostructure via the piano key-type setup, wherein each of the keys of the wire can be tuned from topological to trivial phases. We focus on the transport of MBS under noisy conditions and evaluate the feasibility for realistic scenarios. The central emphasis of our work lies in using both numerical and analytical techniques to understand the effect of noise in inducing diabatic errors during transport and to establish scaling laws that relate these errors to the drive time. To achieve this, we derive an effective model that captures the scaling behavior in both noise-free and noisy scenarios, providing a unified framework for analyzing the transport dynamics. We investigate the optimal number of keys for both noisy and noiseless scenarios. Additionally, we explore the effects of disorder on transport dynamics, highlighting its impact on error scaling and robustness.</description>

      <title>Moving Protocol of Majorana Corner Modes in a Superconducting 2D Weyl Semimetal Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-order topological superconductors host Majorana corner modes (MCMs), which are confined to specific corners of the system. This spatial restriction presents challenges for manipulating and relocating MCMs. We propose a novel protocol for dynamically controlling the movement of time-reversal symmetric MCMs in a heterostructure consisting of a 2D Weyl semimetal and a $d$-wave superconductor. By leveraging the energy asymmetry of topological edge states in the 2D Weyl semimetal, the position of MCMs can be effectively tuned via chemical potential adjustments. We further introduce a device architecture that integrates multiple heterostructure blocks, each controlled by independent gate voltages, to enable the adiabatic movement and exchange of MCMs. This approach demonstrates a robust mechanism for Majorana manipulation and provides a scalable framework for future experimental studies of topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>The Ising dual-reflection interface: $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, Majorana strong zero modes and SPT phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an interface in the transverse field quantum Ising chain connecting an ordered ferromagnetic phase and a disordered paramagnetic phase that are Kramers-Wannier duals of each other. Unlike prior studies focused on non-invertible defects, this interface exhibits a symmetry that combines Kramers-Wannier transformation with spatial reflection. We demonstrate that, under open boundary conditions, this setup gives rise to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, encompassing the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising parity as a subgroup, while in a closed geometry a non-invertible symmetry emerges. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the spin chain onto a solvable quadratic Majorana fermion system. In this formulation, the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is realized manifestly as a parity-dependent reflection operation with respect to a Majorana site, in contrast to the conventional reflection which mirrors with respect to the central link of the Majorana chain. Additionally, we construct Majorana strong zero modes that retain the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, ensure degeneracies of all energy eigenstates, and are robust under generic local symmetry-preserving perturbations of the fermion model, including interactions. In an open geometry of the studied model, we identify two regimes that exhibit different degeneracy patterns. We discuss whether this is a manifestation of distinct fermion symmetry-protected topological orders protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Crossover from Conventional to Unconventional Superconductivity in 2M-WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging reciprocal-space proximity effect between superconducting bulk and topological surface states (TSSs) offers a promising way to topological superconductivity. However, elucidating the mutual influence of bulk and TSSs on topological superconductivity remains a challenge. Here, we report pioneering transport evidence of a thickness-dependent transition from conventional to unconventional superconductivity in 2M-phase WS2 (2M-WS2). As the sample thickness reduces, we see clear changes in key superconducting metrics, including critical temperature, critical current, and carrier density. Notably, while thick 2M-WS2 samples show conventional superconductivity, with an in-plane (IP) upper critical field constrained by the Pauli limit, samples under 20 nm exhibit a pronounced IP critical field enhancement, inversely correlated with 2D carrier density. This marks a distinct crossover to unconventional superconductivity with strong spin-orbit-parity coupling. Our findings underscore the crucial role of sample thickness in accessing topological states in 2D topological superconductors, offering pivotal insights into future studies of topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced nonlinear Hall effect by Cooper pairs near superconductor criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike the linear Hall effect that requires broken time-reversal symmetry, the nonlinear Hall effect may occur in time-reversal symmetric systems as long as there exists a non-zero Berry curvature dipole in the absence of inversion symmetry. Interestingly, the presence of time-reversal symmetry is consistent with and thus allows a direct transition into a superconducting phase. Indeed, superconductivity has been established in various nonlinear Hall materials, such as WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$, at sufficiently low temperatures. We find that the nonlinear Hall response should be significantly enhanced near the superconducting criticality, dominated by the Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) contributions augmented by superconducting fluctuations, which we attribute to the Berry curvature dipole and a divergent lifetime $\tau\sim (T-T_c)^{-1}$ of the Cooper pairs, instead of the single electrons. Such a controlled enhancement brings the nonlinear Hall effect into various simple experimental observations and practical applicational potentials.</description>

      <title>Pseudogap in electron-doped cuprates: Strong correlation leading to band splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:1801.04247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudogap phenomena have been a long-standing mystery of the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. The pseudogap in the electron-doped cuprates has been attributed to band folding due to antiferromagnetic (AFM) long-range order or short-range correlation. We performed an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study of the electron-doped cuprates Pr$_{1.3-x}$La$_{0.7}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$ showing spin-glass, disordered AFM behaviors, and superconductivity at low temperatures and, by measurements with fine momentum cuts, found that the gap opens on the unfolded Fermi surface rather than the AFM Brillouin zone boundary. The gap did not show a node, following the full symmetry of the Brillouin zone, and its magnitude decreased from the zone-diagonal to ($\pi$,0) directions, opposite to the hole-doped case. These observations were reproduced by cluster dynamical-mean-field-theory (CDMFT) calculation, which took into account electron correlation precisely within a (CuO$_2$)$_4$ cluster. The present experimental and theoretical results are consistent with the mechanism that electron or hole doping into a Mott insulator creates an in-gap band that are separated from the upper or lower Hubbard band by the pseudogap.</description>

      <title>Magnetic phases of electron-doped infinite-layer Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$CuO$_2$ from first-principles density functional calculations</title>

Abstract: The magnetic phases of electron-doped infinite-layer Sr$_{1-x}$La$_x$CuO$_2$ are elucidated by first-principles density functional calculations. The antiferromagnetic parent state, metallic transition, as well as lattice evolution with doping and pressure are found to be consistent with experiments. The specific heat coefficient $\gamma$, magnetic exchange coupling $J$, as well as the density of states at Fermi level $N(0)$ of low-energy states with multiple magnetic configurations are investigated. We highlight a subset of such states in which we note an increase in $N(0)$ to suggest the interesting effects of magnetic fluctuations and La substitution on the electronic structure of this material.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous reduction-annealing effects on the electron-doped cuprate superconductor revealed by micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of the protect-annealing method has extended the superconductivity of the electron-doped cuprate Pr$_{1.3-x}$La$_{0.7}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ (PLCCO) into lower Ce concentrations, while the superconducting volume fraction decreases with underdoping. Employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a micro-focused beam, we investigated the electronic structure of protect-annealed PLCCO ($x=0.08$) with small superconducting volume fraction. Significant spatial variation of Fermi surface area and shape was observed, suggesting inhomogeneity in electron concentrations and the pseudogap that competes with superconductivity. By performing measurements at dozens of different sample positions, negative and non-monotonic correlation was found between the electron concentration and pseudogap magnitude. The established correlation illustrates a systematic annealing dependence of the electronic structure where a pseudogap abruptly opens with insufficient oxygen reduction.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a nonadiabatic geometric gate with an Andreev spin qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a hybrid structure of a ferromagnetic-insulator and a superconductor connected by a weak link, which accommodates Andreev bound states whose spin degeneracy is lifted due to the exchange interaction with the ferromagnet. The resultant spin-resolved energy levels realize a two-state quantum system, provided that a single electron is trapped in the bound state, i.e., an Andreev spin qubit. The qubit state can be manipulated by controlling the magnetization dynamics of the ferromagnet, which mediates the coupling between external fields and the qubit. In particular, our hybrid structure provides a simple platform to manipulate and control the spin qubit using spintronic techniques. By employing a modified Hahn spin echo protocol for the magnetization dynamics, we show that our Andreev spin qubit can realize a nonadiabatic geometric gate.</description>

      <title>Electron-beam annealing of Josephson junctions for frequency tuning of quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are a promising route to achieving large-scale quantum computers. A key challenge in realising large-scale superconducting quantum processors involves mitigating frequency collisions. In this paper, we present an approach to tuning fixed-frequency qubits with the use of an electron beam to locally anneal the Josephson junction. We demonstrate the ability to both increase and decrease the junction barrier resistance. The technique shows an improvement in wafer scale frequency targetting by assessing the frequency collisions in our qubit architecture. Coherence measurements are also done to evaluate the performance before and after tuning. The tuning process utilises a standard electron beam lithography system, ensuring reproducibility and implementation by any group capable of fabricating these Josephson junctions. This technique has the potential to significantly improve the performance of large-scale quantum computing systems, thereby paving the way for the future of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Two-tone spectroscopy of high-frequency quantum circuits with a Josephson emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform two-tone spectroscopy on quantum circuits, where high-frequency radiation is generated by a voltage-biased superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junction and detection is carried out by an ancillary microwave resonator. We implement this protocol on two different systems, a transmon qubit and a $\lambda/4$ resonator. We demonstrate that this two-tone Josephson spectroscopy operates well into the millimeter-wave band, reaching frequencies larger than 80 GHz, and is well-suited for probing highly coherent quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-broken metallic orders in spin-orbit-coupled Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore Bernal bilayer graphene in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions, short-range Hund's coupling, and proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling using self-consistent Hartree-Fock simulations. We show that the interplay between these three ingredients produces an intricate phase diagram comprising a multitude of symmetry-broken metallic states tunable via doping and applied displacement field. In particular, we find intervalley coherent and spin-canted ground states that may hold the key to understanding spin-orbit-enabled superconductivity observed in this platform. We also investigate various phase transitions where a continuous $\mathrm{U}(1)$ symmetry is broken to ascertain the possible role of critical fluctuations on pairing.</description>

      <title>Topological zero modes and bounded modes at smooth domain walls: Exact solutions and dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology describes global quantities invariant under continuous deformations, such as the number of elementary excitations at a phase boundary, without detailing specifics. Conversely, differential laws are needed to understand the physical properties of these excitations, such as their localization and spatial behavior. For instance, topology mandates the existence of solitonic zero-energy modes at the domain walls between topologically inequivalent phases in topological insulators and superconductors. However, the spatial dependence of these modes is only known in the idealized (and unrealistic) case of a sharp domain wall. Here, we find the analytical solutions of these zero-modes by assuming a smooth and exponentially-confined domain wall. This allows us to characterize the zero-modes using a few length scales: the domain wall width, the exponential decay length, and oscillation wavelength. These quantities define distinct regimes: featureless modes with "no hair" at sharp domain walls, and nonfeatureless modes at smooth domain walls, respectively, with "short hair", i.e., featureless at long distances, and "long hair", i.e., nonfeatureless at all length scales. We thus establish a universal relation between the bulk excitation gap, decay rate, and oscillation momentum of the zero modes, which quantifies the bulk-boundary correspondence in terms of experimentally measurable physical quantities. Additionally, we reveal an unexpected duality between topological zero modes and Shockley modes, unifying the understanding of topologically-protected and nontopological boundary modes. These findings shed some new light on the localization properties of edge modes in topological insulators and Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors and on the differences and similarities between topological and nontopological zero modes in these systems.</description>
