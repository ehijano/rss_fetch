      <title>An Evaluation of Interleaved Instruction Tuning on Semantic Reasoning Performance in an Audio MLLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard training for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) involves concatenating non-textual information, like vision or audio, with a text prompt. This approach may not encourage deep integration of modalities, limiting the model's ability to leverage the core language model's reasoning capabilities. This work examined the impact of interleaved instruction tuning in an audio MLLM, where audio tokens are interleaved within the prompt. Using the Listen, Think, and Understand (LTU) model as a testbed, we conduct an experiment using the Synonym and Hypernym Audio Reasoning Dataset (SHARD), our newly created reasoning benchmark for audio-based semantic reasoning focusing on synonym and hypernym recognition. Our findings show that while even zero-shot interleaved prompting improves performance on our reasoning tasks, a small amount of fine-tuning using interleaved training prompts improves the results further, however, at the expense of the MLLM's audio labeling ability.</description>

      <title>Wireless Video Semantic Communication with Decoupled Diffusion Multi-frame Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing wireless video transmission schemes directly conduct video coding in pixel level, while neglecting the inner semantics contained in videos. In this paper, we propose a wireless video semantic communication framework with decoupled diffusion multi-frame compensation (DDMFC), abbreviated as WVSC-D, which integrates the idea of semantic communication into wireless video transmission scenarios. WVSC-D first encodes original video frames as semantic frames and then conducts video coding based on such compact representations, enabling the video coding in semantic level rather than pixel level. Moreover, to further reduce the communication overhead, a reference semantic frame is introduced to substitute motion vectors of each frame in common video coding methods. At the receiver, DDMFC is proposed to generate compensated current semantic frame by a two-stage conditional diffusion process. With both the reference frame transmission and DDMFC frame compensation, the bandwidth efficiency improves with satisfying video transmission performance. Experimental results verify the performance gain of WVSC-D over other DL-based methods e.g. DVSC about 1.8 dB in terms of PSNR.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Personalization: Towards Fine-Grained Explainability in Natural Language for Personalized Image Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation models.</description>

      <title>Human-Machine Ritual: Synergic Performance through Real-Time Motion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a lightweight, real-time motion recognition system that enables synergic human-machine performance through wearable IMU sensor data, MiniRocket time-series classification, and responsive multimedia control. By mapping dancer-specific movement to sound through somatic memory and association, we propose an alternative approach to human-machine collaboration, one that preserves the expressive depth of the performing body while leveraging machine learning for attentive observation and responsiveness. We demonstrate that this human-centered design reliably supports high accuracy classification (&lt;50 ms latency), offering a replicable framework to integrate dance-literate machines into creative, educational, and live performance contexts.</description>

      <title>Let Multimodal Embedders Learn When to Augment Query via Adaptive Query Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Query augmentation makes queries more meaningful by appending further information to the queries to find relevant documents. Current studies have proposed Large Language Model (LLM)-based embedders, which learn representation for embedding and generation for query augmentation in a multi-task manner by leveraging the generative capabilities of LLM. During inference, these jointly trained embedders have conducted query augmentation followed by embedding, showing effective results. However, augmenting every query leads to substantial embedding latency and query augmentation can be detrimental to performance for some queries. Also, previous methods have not been explored in multimodal environments. To tackle these problems, we propose M-Solomon, a universal multimodal embedder that can adaptively determine when to augment queries. Our approach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at the dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other includes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that generates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging a powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation. Through this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary by learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for queries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others. Experimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline without augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that always used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.</description>

      <title>MultiSoundGen: Video-to-Audio Generation for Multi-Event Scenarios via SlowFast Contrastive Audio-Visual Pretraining and Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current video-to-audio (V2A) methods struggle in complex multi-event scenarios (video scenarios involving multiple sound sources, sound events, or transitions) due to two critical limitations. First, existing methods face challenges in precisely aligning intricate semantic information together with rapid dynamic features. Second, foundational training lacks quantitative preference optimization for semantic-temporal alignment and audio quality. As a result, it fails to enhance integrated generation quality in cluttered multi-event scenes. To address these core limitations, this study proposes a novel V2A framework: MultiSoundGen. It introduces direct preference optimization (DPO) into the V2A domain, leveraging audio-visual pretraining (AVP) to enhance performance in complex multi-event scenarios. Our contributions include two key innovations: the first is SlowFast Contrastive AVP (SF-CAVP), a pioneering AVP model with a unified dual-stream architecture. SF-CAVP explicitly aligns core semantic representations and rapid dynamic features of audio-visual data to handle multi-event complexity; second, we integrate the DPO method into V2A task and propose AVP-Ranked Preference Optimization (AVP-RPO). It uses SF-CAVP as a reward model to quantify and prioritize critical semantic-temporal matches while enhancing audio quality. Experiments demonstrate that MultiSoundGen achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-event scenarios, delivering comprehensive gains across distribution matching, audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Demos are available at https://v2aresearch.github.io/MultiSoundGen/.</description>

      <title>Prevailing Research Areas for Music AI in the Era of Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel to rapid advancements in foundation model research, the past few years have witnessed a surge in music AI applications. As AI-generated and AI-augmented music become increasingly mainstream, many researchers in the music AI community may wonder: what research frontiers remain unexplored? This paper outlines several key areas within music AI research that present significant opportunities for further investigation. We begin by examining foundational representation models and highlight emerging efforts toward explainability and interpretability. We then discuss the evolution toward multimodal systems, provide an overview of the current landscape of music datasets and their limitations, and address the growing importance of model efficiency in both training and deployment. Next, we explore applied directions, focusing first on generative models. We review recent systems, their computational constraints, and persistent challenges related to evaluation and controllability. We then examine extensions of these generative approaches to multimodal settings and their integration into artists' workflows, including applications in music editing, captioning, production, transcription, source separation, performance, discovery, and education. Finally, we explore copyright implications of generative music and propose strategies to safeguard artist rights. While not exhaustive, this survey aims to illuminate promising research directions enabled by recent developments in music foundation models.</description>

      <title>RoboTron-Mani: All-in-One Multimodal Large Model for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, robotics has advanced significantly through the integration of larger models and large-scale datasets. However, challenges remain in applying these models to 3D spatial interactions and managing data collection costs. To address these issues, we propose the multimodal robotic manipulation model RoboTron-Mani and the comprehensive dataset RoboData. RoboTron-Mani, on one hand, enhances 3D perception through camera parameters and occupancy supervision. On the other hand, it further incorporates Modality-Isolation-Mask and multimodal decoder blocks based on OpenFlamingo, improving modality fusion and fine-grained perception. RoboData integrats several publicly-available datasets, achieving the first fusion of multi-view images, camera parameters, depth maps, actions, and space alignment, which facilitates comprehensive learning from diverse robotic datasets and offers one complete evaluation system. Trained on RoboData, RoboTron-Mani is the first generalist policy that surpasses expert models, enabling simultaneous evaluation of all tasks across multiple datasets, rather than being limited to specific data or task selections. Specifically, RoboTron-Mani boosts manipulation performance by increasing the average sequence length on CALVIN from 1.7 to 3.5, enabling cross-embodiment generalization, and achieving state-of-the-art results on both simulated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Light Future: Multimodal Action Frame Prediction via InstructPix2Pix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting future motion trajectories is a critical capability across domains such as robotics, autonomous systems, and human activity forecasting, enabling safer and more intelligent decision-making. This paper proposes a novel, efficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering significantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to conventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation of the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic tasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep learning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will observe 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a textual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to accept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame prediction. Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world scenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared to state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike conventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy computation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image and a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference, reduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for applications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion trajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity.</description>

      <title>Audio-Thinker: Guiding Audio Language Model When and How to Think via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models, multimodal large language models, and large audio language models (LALMs) have significantly improved their reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards. However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of satellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the continuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images across diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data, but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration. To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion. Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF) module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to real-world Sat-IoT scenarios.
