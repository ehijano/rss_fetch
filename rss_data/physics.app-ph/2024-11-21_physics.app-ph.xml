      <title>Angle measurement method of electronic speckle interferometry based on Michelson interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {This paper proposes an angle measurement method based on Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) using a Michelson interferometer. By leveraging different principles within the same device, this method achieves complementary advantages across various angle ranges, enhancing measurement accuracy while maintaining high robustness. By utilizing CCD to record light field information in real time and combining geometric and ESPI methods, relationships between small angles and light field information are established, allowing for the design of relevant algorithms for real-time angle measurement. Numerical simulations and experiments were conducted to validate the feasibility and practicality of this method. Results indicate that it maintains measurement accuracy while offering a wide angle measurement range, effectively addressing the limitations of small angle measurements in larger ranges, showcasing significant potential for widespread applications in related fields.</description>

      <title>Third-order Orbital Corner State and its Realization in Acoustic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three dimensional (3D) third-order topological insulators (TIs) have zero-dimensional (0D) corner states, which are three dimensions lower than bulk. Here we investigate the third-order TIs on breathing pyrochlore lattices with p-orbital freedom. The tight-binding Hamiltonian is derived for the p-orbital model, in which we find that the two orthogonal ${\pi}$-type (transverse) hoppings are the key to open a band gap and obtain higher-order topological corner states. We introduce the Z4 berry phase to characterize the bulk topology and analysis the phase diagram. The corner states, demonstrated in a finite structure of a regular tetrahedron, exhibit rich 3D orbital configurations. Furthermore, we design an acoustic system to introduce the necessary ${\pi}$-type hopping and successfully observe the orbital corner states. Our work extends topological orbital corner states to third-order, which enriches the contents of orbital physics and may lead to applications in novel topological acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Edge-Detected 4DSTEM -- effective low-dose diffraction data acquisition method for nanopowder samples in a SEM instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The appearance of direct electron detectors marked a new era for electron diffraction. Their high sensitivity and low noise opens the possibility to extend electron diffraction from transmission electron microscopes (TEM) to lower energies such as those found in commercial scanning electron microscopes (SEM).The lower acceleration voltage does however put constraints on the maximum sample thickness and it is a-priori unclear how useful such a diffraction setup could be. On the other hand, nanoparticles are increasingly appearing in consumer products and could form an attractive class of naturally thin samples to investigate with this setup.In this work we present such a diffraction setup and discuss methods to effectively collect and process diffraction data from dispersed crystalline nanoparticles in a commercial SEM instrument. We discuss ways to drastically reduce acquisition time while at the same time lowering beam damage and contamination issues as well as providing significant data reduction leading to fast processing and modest data storage needs. These approaches are also amenable to TEM and could be especially useful in the case of beam-sensitive objects.</description>

      <title>ZnO-based Semiconductors and Structures for Transistors, Optoelectronic Devices and Sustainable Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal oxide thin films are of great interest in scientific advancement, particularly semiconductor thin films in transistors and in a wide range of optoelectronic applications. Many metal oxide thin films attract interest for their electronic bandgap, charge carrier mobility, optical opacity, luminescence, low cost, relative abundance and environmentally-friendly production. Additionally, these properties are often tuneable via particle size, film density, surface morphology, film deposition, growth method, hetero-interface engineering or ion-doping. Zinc oxide as a n-type semiconducting metal oxide is material of great interest owing to its intrinsically wide direct bandgap, high electron mobility, relatively high exciton binding energy, high optical transparency, demonstrated metal-ion doping optoelectronic effects, a range of different particle morphologies and deposition methods, photoluminescence ability, low cost and a variety of existing green synthesis methods. Here, these aspects of zinc oxide and some related oxides are reviewed, focusing on how the unique properties of this metal oxide make it suitable for a range of different applications from thin film transistors, high mobility oxide interfaces, transparent conductive oxides, photoanodes photodetectors, chemical sensors, photocatalysts, superlattice electronics and more. The properties and deposition methods and their impact on functionality will be discussed alongside their role in sustainable optoelectronics for future devices.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic manipulation of terahertz spin-waves by spin-orbit torque in a canted antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically and numerically elucidate the electrical control over spin waves in antiferromagnetic materials (AFM) with biaxial anisotropies and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The spin wave dispersion in an AFM manifests as a bifurcated spectrum with distinct high-frequency and low-frequency bands. Utilizing a heterostructure comprised of platinum and the AFM, we demonstrate anisotropic control of spin-wave bands via spin currents with three-dimensional spin polarizations, encompassing both resonant and propagating wave modes. Moreover, leveraging the confined geometry, we explore the possibility of controlling spin waves within a spectral domain ranging from tens of gigahertz to sub-terahertz frequencies. The implications of our findings suggest the potential for developing a terahertz wave source with electrical tunability, thereby facilitating its incorporation into ultrafast, broadband, and wireless communication technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on aspect-ratio dependent optimization for specific on-resistance of three-dimensional high-k superjunction MOSFETs. The research introduces a Taylor modeling method, overcoming the computational limitations of the Bessel method. It also employs the Chynoweth model for more accurate breakdown voltage determination. The study provides a comparative analysis of four different superjunction structures, across five aspects: electric field, impact ionization integral, aspect ratio dependent optimization, charge imbalance effect and temperature. The findings offer valuable insights for the manufacturing guidance of superjunction structure selection</description>

      <title>Study of Group III-V Waveguides on Sapphire Platform for Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have been acknowledged as the promising platforms for the applications in data communication, Lidar in autonomous driving vehicles, innovative sensor technology, etc. Since the demonstration of optical components individually, integration of both electronics and photonics for functional devices on a common platform has been a key technology driver enhancing the stability and scalability of integrated photonic technologies. Recently, we proposed to use sapphire as a high-performance PIC platform, which enables a fully integrated solution to include a complete set of components with light source, modulator, light detection, passive devices, silicon on sapphire control circuit all-in-one sapphire platform to achieve high-performance low-cost mixed-signal optical links. In parallel to developing ac-tive components such as group III-V lasers on sapphire, in this work, the performance of group III-V straight waveguides on sapphire was systemically studied. The refractive indices contrast between GaAs, InP, GaSb, and sapphire are sufficiently high to achieve low loss over a broad optical wavelength. The calculated loss at wavelengths of 1330 nm, 1550 nm, and 2000 nm for the GaAs, InP, and GaSb rib waveguides are 0.32 dB/cm, 0.67 dB/cm, and 0.70 dB/cm, re-spectively. Since the fundamental element to construct all passive building blocks is the straight waveguide, results from this work would allow us to assess other basic passive building blocks.</description>

      <title>An air-spaced virtually imaged phased array with 94 MHz resolution for precision spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an air-spaced virtually imaged phased array (VIPA) spectrometer that resolves the modes of a mid-infrared frequency comb with a repetition rate of 250 MHz, without an optical filter cavity. With a record spectral resolution of 94 MHz for VIPA, the spectrometer enables precision molecular spectroscopy with high resolution, broad spectral coverage and fast data acquisition. We demonstrate the capabilities of the spectrometer by measuring the absorption spectra of molecular species generated in plasmas. Using plasmas of a mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen, and methane at a low pressure of 1.5 mbar, we obtained high-resolution spectra of methane, around 3017 cm$^{-1}$, as well as hydrogen cyanide and ammonia, around 3240 cm$^{-1}$, demonstrating a wide spectral coverage over 290 cm$^{-1}$ (equivalent to 8.7 THz). The spectrometer performance in terms of Allan-Werle deviation and noise-equivalent absorption is discussed. The air-spaced VIPA concept offers a compact and practical spectrometer that harnesses the full potential of a stabilized frequency comb, making it suitable for a wide range of high-precision spectroscopic applications.</description>

      <title>Noisy intermediate-scale quantum simulation of the one-dimensional wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We design and implement quantum circuits for the simulation of the one-dimensional wave equation on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer. The circuit depth of our approach scales as $O(n^{2})$ for $n$ qubits representing the solution on $2^{n}$ grid points, and leads to infidelities of $O(2^{-4n} t^{2})$ for simulation time $t$ assuming smooth initial conditions. By varying the qubit count we study the interplay between the algorithmic and physical gate errors to identify the optimal working point of minimum total error. Our approach to simulating the wave equation can be used with appropriate state preparation algorithms across different quantum processors and serve as an application-oriented benchmark.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Multiplexed Metasurfaces for Multi-Task Learning with All-Optical Diffractive Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffractive Neural Networks (DNNs) leverage the power of light to enhance computational performance in machine learning, offering a pathway to high-speed, low-energy, and large-scale neural information processing. However, most existing DNN architectures are optimized for single tasks and thus lack the flexibility required for the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks within a unified artificial intelligence platform. In this work, we utilize the polarization and wavelength degrees of freedom of light to achieve optical multi-task identification using the MNIST, FMNIST, and KMNIST datasets. Employing bilayer cascaded metasurfaces, we construct dual-channel DNNs capable of simultaneously classifying two tasks, using polarization and wavelength multiplexing schemes through a meta-atom library. Numerical evaluations demonstrate performance accuracies comparable to those of individually trained single-channel, single-task DNNs. Extending this approach to three-task parallel recognition reveals an expected performance decline yet maintains satisfactory classification accuracies of greater than 80% for all tasks. We further introduce a novel end-to-end joint optimization framework to redesign the three-task classifier, demonstrating substantial improvements over the meta-atom library design and offering the potential for future multi-channel DNN designs. Our study could pave the way for the development of ultrathin, high-speed, and high-throughput optical neural computing systems.</description>

      <title>PZT Optical Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04665v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical memristors represent a monumental leap in the fusion of photonics and electronics, heralding a new era of applications from neuromorphic computing to artificial intelligence. However, current technologies are hindered by complex fabrication, limited endurance, high optical loss or low modulation depth. For the first time, we reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss of &lt;2 dB/cm, high precision exceeding 6-bits, large modulation depth with an index change as large as 4.6x10-3. Additionally, these devices offer impressive stability, maintaining minimal wavelength variation for over three weeks and enduring more than 10,000 cycles, and require a mere 0.8 pJ of energy for non-volatile operation. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical modulation. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed (48 Gbps) and energy-efficient (450 fJ/bit) signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.</description>

      <title>On-chip Moir\'e Optical Skyrmion Clusters with Nanoscale Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological defects belonging to nontrivial homotopy classes in particle theory, and are recognized as a suitable unit in the high-density, low-dissipation microelectronic devices in condensed matter physics. Their remarkably stable topology has recently been observed in electromagnetic waves. For the evanescent fields near a surface, this has been realized so far only for elementary optical skyrmions, with a fixed skyrmion number. Here we introduce the concept of moir\'e optical skyrmion clusters, where multi-skyrmions are nested to form a large optical skyrmion cluster that is either crystallized or quasi-crystallized as a consequence of the twisted nanostructures. The rapid inverting of optical skyrmion number is achieved in the imperfectly aligned composite nanostructures. This moir\'e optical skyrmion interaction mechanism is described by a lattice model. Further, the nucleation and collapse of optical skyrmion are studied, where their nanoscale dynamics are revealed with a tiny change of the twist angle. The sudden reversal of the on-chip skyrmion can serve as a precise beacon of the relative alignment deviation between twisted composite nanostructures.</description>
