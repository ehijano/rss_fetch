      <title>Hamiltonian decompositions of the wreath product of hamiltonian decomposable digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We affirm most open cases of a conjecture that first appeared in Alspach et al. (1987) which stipulates that the wreath (lexicographic) product of two hamiltonian decomposable directed graphs is also hamiltonian decomposable. Specifically, we show that the wreath product of a hamiltonian decomposable directed graph $G$, such that $|V(G)|$ is even and $|V(G)|\geqslant 2$, with a hamiltonian decomposable directed graph $H$, such that $|V(H)| \geqslant 4$, is also hamiltonian decomposable except possibly when $G$ is a directed cycle and $H$ is a directed graph of odd order that admits a decomposition into $c$ directed hamiltonian cycle where $c$ is odd and $3\leqslant c \leqslant |V(H)|-2$.</description>

      <title>Dense halves in balanced 2-partition of K4-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A balanced 2-partition of a graph is a bipartition $A,A^c$ of $V(G)$ such that $|A|=|A^c|$. Balogh, Clemen, and Lidick\'y conjectured that for every $K_4$-free graph on $n$ (even) vertices, there exists a balanced 2-partition $A,A^c$ such that $\max\{e(A),e(A^c)\}\leq n^2/16$ edges. In this paper, we present a family of counterexamples to the conjecture and provide a new upper bound ($0.074n^2$) for every sufficiently large even integer $n$.</description>

      <title>Inertia and other properties of the matrix $\left[\beta(i,j)\right]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\pi(A)$, $\xi(A)$ and $\nu(A)$, respectively, denote the number of positive, zero and negative eigenvalues of the matrix $A$. Then the triplet $(\pi(A), \xi(A), \nu(A))$ is called the \emph{inertia} of $A$ and is denoted by $\textup{Inertia(A)}$. Let $\beta$ be the beta function. The inertia of the matrix $\left[\beta(i,j )\right]$ is shown to be $\left(\frac{n}{2},0,\frac{n}{2}\right)$ if $n$ is even, and $\left(\frac{n+1}{2},0,\frac{n-1}{2}\right)$ if $n$ is odd. %Its connections with Birkhoff-James orthogonality are given. It is also shown that $\left[\beta(i,j)\right]$ is Birkhoff-James orthogonal to the $n\times n$ identity matrix $I$ in the trace norm if and only if $n$ is even. %We prove that the inverse of $\left[{\beta(i,j)}\right]$ is an integer matrix. For $0&lt;\la_1&lt;\cdots&lt;\la_n, 0&lt;\mu_1&lt;\cdots&lt;\mu_n$, it is shown that the matrix $\left[(\beta(\la_i,\mu_j))^m\right]$ is non singular if $\mu_{i+1}-\mu_{i}\in \N$ for all $1\leq i \leq n-1$. It is also shown that if $\mu_{i+1}-\mu_i \in \N$ for $1\leq i\leq n-1$, then for $m\in \mathbb N$, the matrix $\left[\frac{1}{\beta(\la_i,\mu_j)^m}\right]$ is totally positive.</description>

      <title>Spectral radius of graphs of given size with forbidden a fan graph $F_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F_k=K_1\vee P_{k-1}$ be the fan graph on $k$ vertices. A graph is said to be $F_k$-free if it does not contain $F_k$ as a subgraph. Yu et al. in [arXiv:2404.03423] conjectured that for $k\geq2$ and $m$ sufficiently large, if $G$ is an $F_{2k+1}$-free or $F_{2k+2}$-free graph, then $\lambda(G)\leq \frac{k-1+\sqrt{4m-k^2+1}}{2}$ and the equality holds if and only if $G\cong K_k\vee\left(\frac{m}{k}-\frac{k-1}{2}\right)K_1$. Recently, Li et al. in [arXiv:2409.15918] showed that the above conjecture holds for $k\geq 3$. The only left case is for $k=2$, which corresponds to $F_5$ or $F_6$. Since the case of $F_5$ was solved by Yu et al. in [arXiv:2404.03423] and Zhang and Wang in [On the spectral radius of graphs without a gem, Discrete Math. 347 (2024) 114171]. So, one needs only to deal with the case of $F_6$. In this paper, we solve the only left case by determining the maximum spectral radius of $F_6$-free graphs with size $m\geq 88$, and the corresponding extremal graph.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there exist functions $f,g:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ such that for all nonnegative integers $k$ and $d$, for every graph $G$, either $G$ contains $k$ cycles such that vertices of different cycles have distance greater than $d$ in $G$, or there exists a subset $X$ of vertices of $G$ with $|X|\leq f(k)$ such that $G-B_G(X,g(d))$ is a forest, where $B_G(X,r)$ denotes the set of vertices of $G$ having distance at most $r$ from a vertex of $X$.</description>

      <title>Whitney Numbers of Rank-Metric Lattices and Code Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Whitney numbers of the first kind of rank-metric lattices, which are closely linked to the open problem of enumerating rank-metric codes having prescribed parameters. We apply methods from the theory of hyperovals and linear sets to compute these Whitney numbers for infinite families of rank-metric lattices. As an application of our results, we prove asymptotic estimates on the density function of certain rank-metric codes that have been conjectured in previous work.</description>

      <title>Restricted subgraphs of edge-colored graphs and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A properly edge-colored graph is a graph with a coloring of its edges such that no vertex is incident to two or more edges of the same color. A subgraph is called rainbow if all its edges have different colors. The problem of finding rainbow subgraphs or other restricted structures in edge-colored graphs has a long history, dating back to Euler's work on Latin squares. It has also proven to be a powerful method for studying several well-known questions in other areas.
  In this survey, we will provide a brief introduction to this topic, discuss several results in this area, and demonstrate their applications to problems in graph decomposition, additive combinatorics, theoretical computer science, and coding theory.</description>

      <title>The positive orthogonal Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pl\"ucker positive region $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,2k)$ of the orthogonal Grassmannian emerged as the positive geometry behind the ABJM scattering amplitudes. In this paper we initiate the study of the positive orthogonal Grassmannian $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,n)$ for general values of $k$ and $n$. We determine the boundary structure of the quadric $\mathrm{OGr}_+(1,n)$ in $\mathbb{P}_+^{n-1}$ and show that it is a positive geometry. We show that $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,2k+1)$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k+1,2k+2)$ and connect its combinatorial structure to matchings on $[2k+2]$. Finally, we show that in the case $n &gt; 2k+1$, the positroid cells of $\mathrm{Gr}_+(k,n)$ do not induce a CW cell decomposition of $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct growth bijections for bipolar oriented planar maps and for Schnyder woods. These give direct combinatorial proofs of several counting identities for these objects.
  Our method mainly uses two ingredients. First, a slit-slide-sew operation, which consists in slightly sliding a map along a well-chosen path. Second, the study of the orbits of natural rerooting operations on the considered classes of oriented maps.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the countable case of the Unfriendly Partition Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unfriendly Partition Problem asks whether it is possible to split the vertex set of an infinite graph $G$ into two parts so that every vertex has at least as many neighbors in the other part than on its own. Despite the uncountable counterexamples provided by Milner and Shelah in 1990, this question still has no solution for graphs on countably many vertices. Under this hypothesis, our main result claims that such a bipartition exists if the rays of $G$ do not pass through infinitely many vertices of finite degree and infinitely many vertices of infinite degree simultaneously. In particular, for the class of countable graphs, we generalize previous results due to Aharoni, Milner and Prikry and due to Bruhn, Diestel, Georgakopolous and Spr\"ussel.</description>

      <title>Stable Approximation Algorithms for Dominating Set and Independent Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Dominating set problem and Independent Set Problem for dynamic graphs in the vertex-arrival model. We say that a dynamic algorithm for one of these problems is $k$-stable when it makes at most $k$ changes to its output independent set or dominating set upon the arrival of each vertex. We study trade-offs between the stability parameter $k$ of the algorithm and the approximation ratio it achieves. We obtain the following results. 1. We show that there is a constant $\varepsilon^*&gt;0$ such that any dynamic $(1+\varepsilon^*)$-approximation algorithm the for Dominating set problem has stability parameter $\Omega(n)$, even for bipartite graphs of maximum degree 4. 2. We present algorithms with very small stability parameters for the Dominating set problem in the setting where the arrival degree of each vertex is upper bounded by $d$. In particular, we give a $1$-stable $(d+1)^2$-approximation algorithm, a $3$-stable $(9d/2)$-approximation algorithm, and an $O(d)$-stable $O(1)$-approximation algorithm. 3. We show that there is a constant $\varepsilon^*&gt;0$ such that any dynamic $(1+\varepsilon^*)$-approximation algorithm for the Independent Set Problem has stability parameter $\Omega(n)$, even for bipartite graphs of maximum degree $3$. 4. Finally, we present a $2$-stable $O(d)$-approximation algorithm for the Independent Set Problem, in the setting where the average degree of the graph is upper bounded by some constant $d$ at all times. We extend this latter algorithm to the fully dynamic model where vertices can also be deleted, achieving a $6$-stable $O(d)$-approximation algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We give Gelfand-Tsetlin crystals for the Kostant-Kumar modules for the finite simple Lie algebra of type A. Kostant-Kumar modules are cyclic submodules of the tensor product of two irreducible highest weight modules of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody Lie algebras. In this case (type A), we also provide a polytopal model for Kostant-Kumar modules in terms of BiKogan faces.</description>

      <title>Flexible realizations existence: NP-completeness on sparse graphs and algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the questions in Rigidity Theory is whether a realization of the vertices of a graph in the plane is flexible, namely, if it allows a continuous deformation preserving the edge lengths. A flexible realization of a connected graph in the plane exists if and only if the graph has a so called NAC-coloring, which is surjective edge coloring by two colors such that for each cycle either all the edges have the same color or there are at least two edges of each color. The question whether a graph has a NAC-coloring, and hence also the existence of a flexible realization, has been proven to be NP-complete. We show that this question is also NP-complete on graphs with maximum degree five and on graphs with the average degree at most $4+\varepsilon$ for every fixed $\varepsilon &gt;0$. The existence of a NAC-coloring is fixed parameter tractable when parametrized by treewidth. Since the only existing implementation of checking the existence of a NAC-coloring is rather naive, we propose new algorithms along with their implementation, which is significantly faster. We also focus on searching all NAC-colorings of a graph, since they provide useful information about its possible flexible realizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Locally Markov walks are natural generalizations of classical Markov chains, where instead of a particle moving independently of the past, it decides where to move next depending on the last action performed at the current location. We introduce the concept of locally Markov walks on finite graphs and investigate several basic properties. For a particular locally Markov walk - the uniform unicycle walk on the complete graph - we investigate the mixing time and we prove that it exhibits cutoff.</description>

      <title>Random permutations acting on $k$--tuples have near--optimal spectral gap for $k=\mathrm{poly}(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Friedman's theorem to show that, for any fixed $r$, the random $2r$--regular Schreier graphs depicting the action of $r$ random permutations of $[n]$ on $k_{n}$--tuples of distinct elements in $[n]$ are a.a.s. weakly Ramanujan, for any $k_{n}\leq n^{\frac{1}{12}-\epsilon}.$ Previously this was known only for $k$--tuples where $k$ is fixed. In fact, we prove the stronger result of strong convergence of random matrices in irreducible representations of $S_{n}$ of quasi--exponential dimension.
  We also give a new bound for the expected stable irreducible character of a random permutation obtained via a word map, showing that $\mathbb{E}\left[\chi^{\mu}\left(w(\sigma_{1},\dots,\sigma_{r})\right)\right]=O\left(n^{-k}\right)$, where $k$ is the number of boxes outside the first row of the Young diagram $\mu,$ solving one aspect of a conjecture of Hanany and Puder. We obtain this bound using an extension of Wise's $w$--cycle conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the order of 4-dimensional regular polytope numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of Kim's conjecture on regular polytopes of dimension four, which is a generalization of Waring's problem, we establish asymptotic formulas for representing any sufficiently large integer as a sum of numbers in the form of those regular 4-polytopes. Moreover, we are able to obtain a more general result of the asymptotics for any degree-four polynomial $f$ satisfying $f(0)=0$ and $f(1)=1$.</description>

      <title>The number of descendants in a preferential attachment graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the number $X^{(n)}$ of vertices that can be reached from the last added vertex $n$ via a directed path (the descendants) in the standard preferential attachment graph. In this model, vertices are sequentially added, each born with outdegree $m\ge 2$; the endpoint of each outgoing edge is chosen among previously added vertices with probability proportional to the current degree of the vertex plus some number $\rho$.
  We show that $X^{(n)}/n^\nu$ converges in distribution as $n\to\infty$, where $\nu$ depends on both $m$ and $\rho$, and the limiting distribution is given by a product of a constant factor and the $(1-\nu)$-th power of a Gamma(m/(m-1),1) variable. The proof uses a P\'olya urn representation of preferential attachment graphs, and the arguments of Janson (2024) where the same problem was studied in uniform attachment graphs. Further results, including convergence of all moments and analogues for the version with possible self-loops are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce two topological non-$\Sigma$ operad structures on planar line arrangements subject to a certain geometric order condition, ensuring a well-defined notion of particle ordering on a distinguished line. This is interpreted in terms of scattering diagrams in purely elastic (1+1)-dimensional theories. We discuss a possible approach to factorized scattering in operadic terms.</description>

      <title>Books, Hallways and Social Butterflies: A Note on Sliding Block Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recall the classical 15-puzzle, consisting of 15 sliding blocks in a $4\times 4$ grid. Famously, the configuration space of this puzzle consists of two connected components, corresponding to the odd and even permutations of the symmetric group $S_{15}$. In 1974, Wilson generalised sliding block puzzles beyond the $4\times 4$ grid to arbitrary graphs (considering $n-1$ sliding blocks on a graph with $n$ vertices), and characterised the graphs for which the corresponding configuration space is connected.
  In this work, we extend Wilson's characterisation to sliding block puzzles with an arbitrary number of blocks (potentially leaving more than one empty vertex). For any graph, we determine how many empty vertices are necessary to connect the corresponding configuration space, and more generally we provide an algorithm to determine whether any two configurations are connected. Our work may also be interpreted within the framework of "Friends and Strangers graphs", where empty vertices correspond to "social butterflies" and sliding blocks to "asocial" people.</description>

      <title>Laplacian eigenvalues of independence complexes via additive compound matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The independence complex of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is the simplicial complex $I(G)$ on vertex set $V$ whose simplices are the independent sets in $G$. We present new lower bounds on the eigenvalues of the $k$-dimensional Laplacian $L_k(I(G))$ in terms of the eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian $L(G)$. As a consequence, we show that for all $k\geq 0$, the dimension of the $k$-th reduced homology group (with real coefficients) of $I(G)$ is at most \[ \left| \left\{ 1\leq i_1&lt;\cdots&lt;i_{k+1}\leq |V| : \, \lambda_{i_1}+\lambda_{i_2}+\cdots+\lambda_{i_{k+1}} \geq |V|\right\}\right|,\] where $\lambda_1\geq\lambda_2\geq \cdots\geq \lambda_{|V|}=0$ are the eigenvalues of $L(G)$. In particular, if $k$ is the minimal number such that the sum of the $k$ largest eigenvalues of $L(G)$ is at least $|V|$, then $\tilde{H}_i(I(G);\mathbb{R})=0$ for all $i\leq k-2$. This extends previous results by Aharoni, Berger and Meshulam. Our proof relies on a relation between the $k$-dimensional Laplacian $L_k(I(G))$ and the $(k+1)$-th additive compound matrix of $L_0(I(G))$, which is an $\binom{n}{k+1}\times\binom{n}{k+1}$ matrix whose eigenvalues are all the possible sums of $k+1$ eigenvalues of the $0$-dimensional Laplacian. Our results apply also in the more general setting of vertex-weighted Laplacian matrices.</description>

Abstract: We consider a variation of Cops and Robber, introduced in [D. Cox and A. Sanaei, The damage number of a graph, [Aust. J. of Comb. 75(1) (2019) 1-16] where vertices visited by a robber are considered damaged and a single cop aims to minimize the number of distinct vertices damaged by a robber. Motivated by the interesting relationships that often emerge between input graphs and their Cartesian product, we study the damage number of the Cartesian product of graphs. We provide a general upper bound and consider the damage number of the product of two trees or cycles. We also consider graphs with small damage number.</description>

      <title>Assouad-Nagata dimension of minor-closed metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12273v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assouad-Nagata dimension addresses both large and small scale behaviors of metric spaces and is a refinement of Gromov's asymptotic dimension. A metric space $M$ is a minor-closed metric if there exists an (edge-)weighted graph $G$ satisfying a fixed minor-closed property such that the underlying space of $M$ is the vertex-set of $G$, and the metric of $M$ is the distance function in $G$. Minor-closed metrics naturally arise when removing redundant edges of the underlying graphs by using edge-deletion and edge-contraction. In this paper, we determine the Assouad-Nagata dimension of every minor-closed metric. Our main theorem simultaneously generalizes known results about the asymptotic dimension of $H$-minor free unweighted graphs and about the Assouad-Nagata dimension of complete Riemannian surfaces with finite Euler genus.</description>

      <title>Shift Graphs, Chromatic Number and Acyclic One-Path Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shift graphs, which were introduced by Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal, have been used to answer various questions in extremal graph theory. In this paper, we prove two new results using shift graphs and their induced subgraphs.
  1. Recently Girao [Combinatorica2023], showed that for every graph $F$ with at least one edge, there is a constant $c_F$ such that there are graphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number and the same clique number as $F$, in which every $F$-free induced subgraph has chromatic number at most $c_F$. We significantly improve the value of the constant $c_F$ for the special case where $F$ is the complete bipartite graph $K_{a,b}$. We show that any $K_{a,b}$-free induced subgraph of the triangle-free shift graph $G_{n,2}$ has chromatic number bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\log(a+b))$.
  2. An undirected simple graph $G$ is said to have the AOP Property if it can be acyclically oriented such that there is at most one directed path between any two vertices. We prove that the shift graph $G_{n,2}$ does not have the AOP property for all $n\geq 9$. Despite this, we construct induced subgraphs of shift graph $G_{n,2}$ with an arbitrarily high chromatic number and odd-girth that have the AOP property.
  Furthermore, we construct graphs with arbitrarily high odd-girth that do not have the AOP Property and also prove the existence of graphs with girth equal to $5$ that do not have the AOP property.</description>

      <title>Quadratic embedding constants of fan graphs and graph joins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a general formula for the quadratic embedding constant of a graph join $\bar{K}_m+G$, where $\bar{K}_m$ is the empty graph on $m\ge1$ vertices and $G$ is an arbitrary graph. Applying our formula to a fan graph $K_1+P_n$, where $K_1=\bar{K}_1$ is the singleton graph and $P_n$ is the path on $n\ge1$ vertices, we show that $\mathrm{QEC}(K_1+P_n)=-\tilde{\alpha}_n-2$, where $\tilde{\alpha}_n$ is the minimal zero of a new polynomial $\Phi_n(x)$ related to Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. Moreover, for an even $n$ we have $\tilde{\alpha}_n=\min\mathrm{ev}(A_n)$, where the right-hand side is the An minimal eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix $A_n$ of $P_n$. For an odd $n$ we show that $\min\mathrm{ev}(A_{n+1})\le\tilde{\alpha}_n&lt;\min\mathrm{ev}(A_n)$.</description>

      <title>Discrete Quantum Walks with Marked Vertices and Their Average Vertex Mixing Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the discrete quantum walk on a regular graph $X$ that assigns negative identity coins to marked vertices $S$ and Grover coins to the unmarked ones. We find combinatorial bases for the eigenspaces of the transtion matrix, and derive a formula for the average vertex mixing matrix $\AMM$.
  We then find bounds for entries in $\AMM$, and study when these bounds are tight. In particular, the average probabilities between marked vertices are lower bounded by a matrix determined by the induced subgraph $X[S]$, the vertex-deleted subgraph $X\backslash S$, and the edge deleted subgraph $X-E(S)$. We show this bound is achieved if and only if the marked vertices have walk-equitable neighborhoods in the vertex-deleted subgraph. Finally, for quantum walks attaining this bound, we determine when $\AMM[S,S]$ is symmetric, positive semidefinite or uniform.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the \emph{standard zero forcing number} $Z(G)$ and the \emph{positive semidefinite zero forcing number} $Z_+(G)$ are equal for all claw-free graphs $G$. This result resolves a conjecture proposed by the computer program \emph{TxGraffiti} and highlights a connection between these graph invariants in claw-free structures. As a corollary, we show that a graph $G$ is claw-free if and only if every induced subgraph $H \subseteq G$ satisfies $Z(H) = Z_+(H)$.</description>

The family $\mathcal{F}$ is called $s$-almost $t$-intersecting if $|\mathcal{D}_{\mathcal{F}}(F;t)|\leq s$ for each $F\in \mathcal{F}$.

      <description>arXiv:2207.12288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for joint ergodicity results of collections of sequences with respect to systems of commuting measure preserving transformations. Combining these results with a new technique that we call "seminorm smoothening", we settle several conjectures related to multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations with polynomial iterates. We show that the Host-Kra factor is characteristic for pairwise independent polynomials, and that under certain ergodicity conditions the associated ergodic averages converge to the product of integrals. Moreover, when the polynomials are linearly independent, we show that the rational Kronecker factor is characteristic and deduce Khintchine-type lower bounds for the related multiple recurrence problem. Finally, we prove a nil plus null decomposition result for multiple correlation sequences of commuting transformations in the case where the iterates are given by families of pairwise independent polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the maximal size of an increasing subset among points randomly sampled from certain probability densities. Kerov and Vershik's celebrated result states that the largest increasing subset among $N$ uniformly random points on $[0,1]^2$ has size asymptotically $2\sqrt{N}$. More generally, the order $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ still holds if the sampling density is continuous. In this paper we exhibit two sufficient conditions on the density to obtain a growth rate equivalent to any given power of $N$ greater than $\sqrt{N}$, up to logarithmic factors. Our proofs use methods of slicing the unit square into appropriate grids, and investigating sampled points appearing in each box.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Pieri formulas for Schur multiple zeta functions, which are generalizations of the Pieri formulas proved by Nakasuji and Takeda for hook type Schur multiple zeta functions. Moreover, we also prove the Littlewood-Richardson rule for Schur multiple zeta functions. In the course of their proofs, we regard the `truncated' version of Schur multiple zeta functions as series over $\mathrm{GL}(N)$ crystals to arrive at the Littlewood-Richardson rule for the Schur multiple zeta functions.</description>
