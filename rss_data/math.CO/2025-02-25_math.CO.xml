      <title>Hunting a rabbit is hard</title>

Abstract: In the Hunters and Rabbit game, $k$ hunters attempt to shoot an invisible rabbit on a given graph $G$. In each round, the hunters can choose $k$ vertices to shoot at, while the rabbit must move along an edge of $G$. The hunters win if at any point the rabbit is shot. The hunting number of $G$, denoted $h(G)$, is the minimum $k$ for which $k$ hunters can win, regardless of the rabbit's moves. The complexity of computing $h(G)$ has been the longest standing open problem concerning the game and has been posed as an explicit open problem by several authors. The first contribution of this paper resolves this question by establishing that computing $h(G)$ is NP-hard even for bipartite simple graphs. We also prove that the problem remains hard even when $h(G)$ is $O(n^{\epsilon})$ or when $n-h(G)$ is $O(n^{\epsilon})$, where $n$ is the order of $G$. Furthermore, we prove that it is NP-hard to additively approximate $h(G)$ within $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$. Finally, we give a characterization of graphs with loops for which $h(G)=1$ by means of forbidden subgraphs, extending a known characterization for simple graphs.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Tur\'an numbers for short brooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is rainbow-$F$-free if it admits a proper edge-coloring without a rainbow copy of $F$. The rainbow Tur\'an number of $F$, denoted $\mathrm{ex^*}(n,F)$, is the maximum number of edges in a rainbow-$F$-free graph on $n$ vertices. We determine bounds on the rainbow Tur\'an numbers of stars with a single edge subdivided twice; we call such a tree with $t$ total edges a $t$-edge \textit{broom} with length-$3$ handle, denoted by $B_{t,3}$. We improve the best known upper bounds on $\mathrm{ex^*}(n,B_{t,3})$ in all cases where $t \neq 2^s - 2$. Moreover, in the case where $t$ is odd and in a few cases when $t \equiv 0 \mod 4$, we provide constructions asymptotically achieving these upper bounds. Our results also demonstrate a dependence of $\mathrm{ex^*}(n,B_{t,3})$ on divisibility properties of $t$.</description>

      <title>Indicated list colouring game on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a list assignment $L$ for $G$, the indicated $L$-colouring game on $G$ is played by two players: Ann and Ben. In each round, Ann chooses an uncoloured vertex $v$, and Ben colours $v$ with a colour from $L(v)$ that is not used by its coloured neighbours. If all vertices are coloured, then Ann wins the game. Otherwise after a finite number of rounds, there remains an uncoloured vertex $v$ such that all colours in $L(v)$ have been used by its coloured neighbours, Ben wins. We say $G$ is indicated $L$-colourable if Ann has a winning strategy for the indicated $L$-colouring game on $G$. For a mapping $g: V(G) \to \mathbb{N}$,
  we say $G$ is indicated $g$-choosable if $G$ is indicated $L$-colourable for every list assignment $L$ with $|L(v)| \ge g(v)$ for each vertex $v$, and $G$ is indicated degree-choosable if $G$ is indicated $g$-choosable for $g(v) =d_G(v)$ (the degree of $v$).
  This paper proves that
  a graph $G$ is not indicated degree-choosable if and only if $G$ is an expanded Gallai-tree - a graph whose maximal connected induced subgraphs with no clique-cut are complete graphs or blow-ups of odd cycles, along with a technical condition (see Definition \ref{def-egt}).
  This leads to a linear-time algorithm that determines if a graph is indicated degree-choosable.
  A connected graph $G$ is called an IC-Brooks graph if its indicated chromatic number equals $\Delta(G)+1$. Every IC-Brooks graph is a regular expanded Gallai-tree. We show that if $r \le 3$, then every $r$-regular expanded Gallai-tree is an IC-Brooks graph. For $r \ge 4$, there are $r$-regular expanded Gallai-trees that are not IC-Brooks graphs. We give a characterization of IC-Brooks graphs, and present a linear-time algorithm that determines if a given graph of bounded maximum degree is an IC-Brooks graph.</description>

      <title>A survey on Hedetniemi's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1966, Hedetniemi conjectured that for any positive integer $n$ and graphs $G$ and $H$, if neither $G$ nor $H$ is $n$-colourable, then $G \times H$ is not $n$-colourable. This conjecture has received significant attention over the past half century, and was disproved by Shitov in 2019. Shitov's proof shows that Hedetniemi's conjecture fails for sufficiently large $n$. Shortly after Shitov's result, smaller counterexamples were found in a series of papers, and it is now known that Hedetniemi's conjecture fails for all $n \ge 4$, and holds for $n \le 3$. Hedetniemi's conjecture has inspired extensive research, and many related problems remain open. This paper surveys the results and problems associated with the conjecture, and explains the ideas used in finding counterexamples.</description>

      <title>The Lov\'asz number of random circulant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the behavior of the Lov\'asz number for dense random circulant graphs. The Lov\'asz number is a well-known semidefinite programming upper bound on the independence number. Circulant graphs, an example of a Cayley graph, are highly structured vertex-transitive graphs on integers modulo $n$, where the connectivity of pairs of vertices depends only on the difference between their labels. While for random circulant graphs the asymptotics of fundamental quantities such as the clique and the chromatic number are well-understood, characterizing the exact behavior of the Lov\'asz number remains open. In this work, we provide upper and lower bounds on the expected value of the Lov\'asz number and show that it scales as the square root of the number of vertices, up to a log log factor. Our proof relies on a reduction of the semidefinite program formulation of the Lov\'asz number to a linear program with random objective and constraints via diagonalization of the adjacency matrix of a circulant graph by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). This leads to a problem about controlling the norms of vectors with sparse Fourier coefficients, which we study using results on the restricted isometry property of subsampled DFT matrices.</description>

      <title>Integral Ricci Curvature for Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of integral Ricci curvature $I_{\kappa_0}$ for graphs, which measures the amount of Ricci curvature below a given threshold $\kappa_0$. We focus our attention on the Lin-Lu-Yau Ricci curvature. As applications, we prove a Bonnet-Myers-type diameter estimate, a Moore-type estimate on the number of vertices of a graph in terms of the maximum degree $d_M$ and diameter $D$, and a Lichnerowicz-type estimate for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Graph Laplacian, generalizing the results obtained by Lin, Lu, and Yau. All estimates are uniform, depending only on geometric parameters like $\kappa_0$, $I_{\kappa_0}$, $d_M$, or $D$, and do not require the graphs to be positively curved.</description>

      <title>On Geodesic Leech Labeling of Some Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f:E\rightarrow \{1,2,3,\dots\}$ be an edge labeling of $G$. The geodesic path number of $G$, $t_{gp}(G)$, is the number of geodesic paths in $G$. An edge labeling $f$ is called a geodesic Leech labeling, if the set of weights of the geodesic paths in $G$ is $\{1,2,3,\dots,t_{gp}(G)\}$, where the weight of a path $P$ is the sum of the labels assigned to the edges of $P$. A graph which admits a geodesic Leech labeling is called a geodesic Leech graph. Otherwise, we call it a non-geodesic Leech graph. In this paper, we prove that cycles $C_n$, $n \geq 5$ are non-geodesic Leech graphs. We also prove that there are at most three regular complete bipartite graphs that are geodesic Leech. We show that degree sequence cannot characterize geodesic Leech graphs. The geodesic path number of the wheel graph $W_n$ is obtained and the geodesic Leech labeling of $W_5$ and $W_6$ is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $r \ge 3$ be fixed and $G$ be an $n$-vertex graph. A long-standing conjecture of Gy{\H o}ri states that if $e(G) = t_{r-1}(n) + k$, where $t_{r-1}(n)$ denotes the number of edges of the Tur{\'a}n graph on $n$ vertices and $r - 1$ parts, then $G$ has at least $(2 - o(1))k/r$ edge disjoint $r$-cliques. We prove this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Universality of Polyhedral Linkages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar linkages are a rich area of study motivated by practical applications in engineering mechanisms. A central result is Kempe's Universality Theorem, which states that semi-algebraic sets can be realized by planar linkages. Polyhedral linkages are generalizations of planar linkages to higher dimensions, where the faces are required to be rigid. In this paper, we generalize Kempe's Universality Theorem to polyhedral linkages with an embedded construction in dimension three and above.</description>

      <title>Claw-free cubic graphs are (1, 1, 1, 3)-packing edge-colorable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a non-decreasing positive integer sequence $S = (s_{1}, \dots, s_{k})$, an $S$-packing edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is a partition of the edge set of $G$ into subsets $E_{1}, \dots, E_{k}$ such that for each $1 \leq i \leq k$, the distance between any two distinct edges $e_{1}, e_{2} \in E_{i}$ is at least $s_{i} + 1$. Hocquard et al. conjectured that cubic graphs, except for the Petersen and Tietze graphs, admit $(1, 1, 1, 3)$-packing edge-colorings. In this paper, we prove that every claw-free cubic graph admits such a coloring.</description>

      <title>Ellipsoidal designs and the Prouhet--Tarry--Escott problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of ellipsoidal design was first introduced by Pandey (2022) as a full generalization of spherical designs on the unit circle $S^1$. In this paper, we elucidate the advantage of examining the connections between ellipsoidal design and the two-dimensional Prouhet--Tarry--Escott (PTE) problem introduced by Alpers and Tijdeman (2007). We first provide a combinatorial criterion for the construction of solutions of the two-dimensional PTE problem from a pair of ellipsoidal designs. We give an arithmetic proof of the Stroud-type bound for ellipsoidal designs, and then establish a classification theorem for designs with equality. Such a classification result is closely related to an open question on the existence of rational spherical $4$-designs on $S^1$, discussed in Cui, Xia and Xiang (2019). We moreover discover a certain design structure in the Borwein solution of the classical one-dimensional PTE problem. We also give a two-dimensional extension of the Borwein solution, and then discuss connections to the Alpers--Tijdeman solution for the two-dimensional PTE problem.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Generating Function for $k$-Regular Partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a $k$-fold $q$-series as a generating function of $k$-regular partitions for each positive integer $k$. The $k=1$ case is one of Euler's $q$-series identities pertaining to the partitions into distinct parts. The construction is combinatorial. Although we find a connection to Bessel polynomials in the $k=2$ case, this note is certainly not a study of Bessel polynomials and their $q$-analogs.</description>

      <title>Toroidal graphs without $K_{5}^{-}$ and 6-cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cai et al.\ proved that a toroidal graph $G$ without $6$-cycles is $5$-choosable, and proposed the conjecture that $\textsf{ch}(G) = 5$ if and only if $G$ contains a $K_{5}$ [J. Graph Theory 65 (2010) 1--15], where $\textsf{ch}(G)$ is the choice number of $G$. However, Choi later disproved this conjecture, and proved that toroidal graphs without $K_{5}^{-}$ (a $K_{5}$ missing one edge) and $6$-cycles are $4$-choosable [J. Graph Theory 85 (2017) 172--186]. In this paper, we provide a structural description, for toroidal graphs without $K_{5}^{-}$ and $6$-cycles. Using this structural description, we strengthen Choi's result in two ways: (I) we prove that such graphs have weak degeneracy at most three (nearly $3$-degenerate), and hence their DP-paint numbers and DP-chromatic numbers are at most four; (II) we prove that such graphs have Alon-Tarsi numbers at most $4$. Furthermore, all of our results are sharp in some sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a mass partition problem, we are interested in finding equitable partitions of smooth measures in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this manuscript, we study the problem of finding simultaneous bisections of measures using scaled copies of a prescribed set $K$. We distinguish the problem when we are allowed to use scaled and translated copies of $K$ and the problem when we are allowed to use scaled isometric copies of $K$. These problems have only previously been studied if $K$ is a half-space or a Euclidean ball. We obtain positive results for simultaneous bisection of any $d+1$ masses for star-shaped compact sets $K$ with non-empty interior, where the conditions on the problem depend on the smoothness of the boundary of $K$. Additional proofs are included for particular instances of $K$, such as hypercubes and cylinders, answering positively a conjecture of Sober\'on and Takahashi. The proof methods are topological and involve new Borsuk--Ulam-type theorems.</description>

      <title>On Pancyclicity in a Mixed Model for Domination Reconfiguration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new model for domination reconfiguration is introduced which combines the properties of the preexisting token addition/removal (TAR) and token sliding (TS) models. The vertices of the TARS-graph correspond to the dominating sets of $G$, where two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are adjacent via either the TAR reconfiguration rule or the TS reconfiguration rule. While the domination reconfiguration graph obtained by using only the TAR rule (sometimes called the dominating graph) will never have a Hamilton cycle, we show that for some classes of graphs $G$, by adding a relatively small number of token sliding edges, the resulting graph is not only hamiltonian, but is in fact pancyclic. In particular, if the underlying graphs are trees, complete graphs, or complete multipartite graphs, their TARS-graphs will be pancyclic. We also provide pancyclicity results for TARS-graphs of graph unions and joins, and conclude by posing the question: Are all TARS-graphs pancyclic?</description>

      <title>Sharp Estimates for Large N Weingarten Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weingarten functions provide a tool for computing Haar measure matrix integrals of polynomials in the matrix entries. An important property of Weingarten functions, is their particularly simple large $N$ limits. In 2017 Benoit Collins and Sho Matsumoto studied when this limit holds for Weingarten functions associated to integrals of products of $2n$ matrix entries, as $n \to \infty$, together with the matrix size $N$. They showed that the large $N$ limit is uniformly achieved as long as $n=o(N^{4/7})$, a result which already has applications to strong asymptotic freeness. However, their result is not optimal. They conjectured that their result should actually hold up to $n=o(N^{2/3})$ which is optimal. We prove this conjecture for the matrix groups $G \in \{\mathrm{U}(N)$, $\mathrm{O}(N)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(N)\}$. The proof proceeds by introducing a Markov process on permutations (pairings) which we call the unitary (orthogonal) \textit{Weingarten process}. We believe this process may have further applications to the theory of Weingarten functions. We also prove two new bounds regarding the large $N$ limit of the Weingarten function in the regimes when $n=o(N^{4/5})$, and $n=o(N)$.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Dyadic Square Functions of indicator functions of sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any Borel measurable subset $A\subset [0,1]$, the inequality $\|S_{2}(\mathbbm{1}_{A})\|_{1} \geq I(|A|)$ holds, where $I$ denotes the Gaussian isoperimetric profile. This improves upon the classical lower bound $
\|S_{2}(\mathbbm{1}_{A})\|_{1} \gtrsim |A|(1-|A|) $ by a factor of $\sqrt{\log\frac{1}{|A|(1-|A|)}}$. In addition, we study lower bounds for the $\alpha$-norm of $S_1(\mathbbm{1}_{A})$, and we obtain a threshold behavior around $\alpha=1$. We show that $$ \|S_{1}(\mathbbm{1}_{A})\|_{1} \geq \min\{|A|, 1-|A|\}\log_{2}\frac{1}{\min\{|A|, 1-|A|\}}, $$ and that this bound is sharp at points $|A|=2^{-k}$ or $|A|=1-2^{-k}$ for every nonnegative integer $k$. For each fixed $\alpha\in (0,1)$, we further establish that $\|S_{1}(\mathbbm{1}_{A})\|_{\alpha} \geq \min\{|A|, 1-| A|\},$ with the decay rate $|A|$, as $|A|\to 0$, being optimal.</description>

      <title>A Purely Geometric Variant of the Gale--Berlekamp Switching Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16305v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the following variant of the Gale--Berlekamp switching game. Let $P$ be a set of n noncollinear points in the plane, each of them having weight $+1$ or $-1$. At each step, we pick a line $\ell$ passing through at least two points of $P$, and switch the sign of every point $p \in P\cap\ell$ to its opposite. The objective is to maximize the total weight of the elements of $P$. We show that one can always achieve that this quantity is at least $n/3$. Moreover, this can be attained by a polynomial time algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimal redundancy of function-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Function-correcting codes, introduced by Lenz, Bitar, Wachter-Zeh, and Yaakobi, protect specific function values of a message rather than the entire message. A central challenge is determining the optimal redundancy -- the minimum additional information required to recover function values amid errors. This redundancy depends on both the number of correctable errors $t$ and the structure of message vectors yielding identical function values. While prior works established bounds, key questions remain, such as the optimal redundancy for functions like Hamming weight and Hamming weight distribution, along with efficient code constructions. In this paper, we make the following contributions:
  (1) For the Hamming weight function, we improve the lower bound on optimal redundancy from $\frac{10(t-1)}{3}$ to $4t - \frac{4}{3}\sqrt{6t+2} + 2$. On the other hand, we provide a systematical approach to constructing explicit FCCs via a novel connection with Gray codes, which also improve the previous upper bound from $\frac{4t-2}{1 - 2\sqrt{\log{2t}/(2t)}}$ to $4t - \log{t}$. Consequently, we almost determine the optimal redundancy for Hamming weight function.
  (2) The Hamming weight distribution function is defined by the value of Hamming weight divided by a given positive integer $T$. Previous work established that the optimal redundancy is $2t$ when $T &gt; 2t$, while the case $T \le 2t$ remained unclear. We show that the optimal redundancy remains $2t$ when $T \ge t+1$. However, in the surprising regime where $T = o(t)$, we achieve near-optimal redundancy of $4t - o(t)$. Our results reveal a significant distinction in behavior of redundancy for distinct choices of $T$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or Wigner $3j$ symbols are known to be proportional to a $_3F_2(1)$ hypergeometric series, and Racah $6j$ coefficients to a $_4F_3(1)$. In general, however, non-trivial $9j$ symbols can not be expressed as a $_5F_4$. In this letter, we show, using the Dougall-Ramanujan identity, that special stretched $9j$ symbols can be reformulated as $_5F_4(1)$ hypergeometric series.</description>

      <title>On the Global Optimality of Fibonacci Lattices in the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the question of the optimality of Fibonacci lattices with respect to tensor product energies on the torus, most notably the periodic $L_2$-discrepancy, diaphony and the worst case error of the quasi-Monte Carlo integration over certain parametrized dominating mixed smoothness Sobolev spaces $H_p^d$ of periodic functions. We consider two methods for this question.
  First, a method based on Delsarte's LP-bound from coding theory which will give us, among others, the Fibonacci lattices as the natural candidates for optimal point sets. Second, we will adapt the continuous LP-bound on the sphere (and other spaces) to the torus to get optimality in the continuous setting.
  We conclude with a more in depth look at the $5$-point Fibonacci lattice, giving an effectively computable algorithm for checking if it is optimal and rigorously proving its optimality for quasi-Monte Carlo integration in the range $0 &lt; p \leq 11.66$. We also prove a result on the universal optimality of $3$ points in any dimension.
  The novelty of this approach is the application of LP-methods for tensor product energies in the torus and the systematic study of the simultaneous global optimality of periodic point sets for a class of tensor product potential functions.</description>

      <title>Lotuses as computational architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lotuses are certain types of finite contractible simplicial complexes, obtained by identifying vertices of polygons subdivided by diagonals. As we explained in a previous paper, each time one resolves a complex reduced plane curve singularity by a sequence of toroidal modifications with respect to suitable local coordinates, one gets a naturally associated lotus, which allows to unify the classical trees used to encode the combinatorial type of the singularity. In this paper we explain how to associate a lotus to each constellation of crosses, which is a finite constellation of infinitely near points endowed with compatible germs of normal crossings divisors with two components, and how this lotus may be seen as a computational architecture. Namely, if the constellation of crosses is associated to an embedded resolution of a complex reduced plane curve singularity $A$, one may compute progressively as vertex and edge weights on the lotus the log-discrepancies of the exceptional divisors, the orders of vanishing on them of the starting coordinates, the multiplicities of the strict transforms of the branches of $A$, the orders of vanishing of a defining function of $A$, the associated Eggers-Wall tree, the delta invariant and the Milnor number of $A$, etc. We illustrate these computations using three recurrent examples. Finally, we describe the changes to be done when one works in positive characteristic.</description>

Abstract: An oriented graph is said positively multiplicative when its adjacency matrix $A$ embeds in a matrix algebra admitting a basis $\mathsf{B}$ with nonnegative structure constants in which the matrix of the multiplication by $A$ coincides with $A$. The goal of this paper is to present basic properties of this notion and explain, through various simple examples, how it relates to highly non trivial problems like the combinatorial description of fusion rules, the description of the minimal boundary of graded graphs or the study of random walks on alcove tilings.</description>

Abstract: An edge colouring of a graph is called distinguishing if there is no non-trivial automorphism which preserves it. We prove that every at most countable, finite or infinite, connected regular graph of order at least $7$ admits a distinguishing edge colouring from any set of lists of length $2$. Furthermore, we show that the same holds for connected regular graphs of order $\kappa$ where $\kappa$ is a fixed point of the aleph hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Kneser graphs are Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03918v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For integers $k\geq 1$ and $n\geq 2k+1$, the Kneser graph $K(n,k)$ has as vertices all $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element ground set, and an edge between any two disjoint sets. It has been conjectured since the 1970s that all Kneser graphs admit a Hamilton cycle, with one notable exception, namely the Petersen graph $K(5,2)$. This problem received considerable attention in the literature, including a recent solution for the sparsest case $n=2k+1$. The main contribution of this paper is to prove the conjecture in full generality. We also extend this Hamiltonicity result to all connected generalized Johnson graphs (except the Petersen graph). The generalized Johnson graph $J(n,k,s)$ has as vertices all $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element ground set, and an edge between any two sets whose intersection has size exactly $s$. Clearly, we have $K(n,k)=J(n,k,0)$, i.e., generalized Johnson graph include Kneser graphs as a special case. Our results imply that all known natural families of vertex-transitive graphs defined by intersecting set systems have a Hamilton cycle, which settles an interesting special case of Lov\'asz' conjecture on Hamilton cycles in vertex-transitive graphs from 1970. Our main technical innovation is to study cycles in Kneser graphs by a kinetic system of multiple gliders that move at different speeds and that interact over time, reminiscent of the gliders in Conway's Game of Life, and to analyze this system combinatorially and via linear algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey chain of Andrews, Schilling and the author is extended to a four-parameter $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey tree. As main application of this tree, we prove the Kanade-Russell conjecture for a three-parameter family of Rogers-Ramanujan-type identities related to the principal characters of the affine Lie algebra $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$. Combined with known $q$-series results, this further implies an $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$-analogue of the celebrated Andrews-Gordon $q$-series identities. We also use the $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey tree to prove a Rogers-Selberg-type identity for the characters of the principal subspaces of $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$ indexed by arbitrary level-$k$ dominant integral weights $\lambda$. This generalises a result of Feigin, Feigin, Jimbo, Miwa and Mukhin for $\lambda=k\Lambda_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two families of hyperbolic polygons: ideal and ideal once-punctured, some of whose spikes are decorated with horoballs. We show that the arc complexes of these two families of surfaces, generated by edge-to-edge arcs and edge-to-decorated-spike arcs, are closed piecewise linear balls. This is proved in a completely combinatorial setting: compact polygons whose vertices are assigned red or blue colouring. In order to prove the ballness, we show that these simplicial complexes are pseudo-manifolds and use shellability to conclude. As a consequence, we parametrise weakly-lengthening deformations of the partially decorated hyperbolic polygons.</description>

      <title>The Pairing-Hamiltonian property in graph prisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph of even order, and consider $K_G$ as the complete graph on the same vertex set as $G$. A perfect matching of $K_G$ is called a pairing of $G$. If for every pairing $M$ of $G$ it is possible to find a perfect matching $N$ of $G$ such that $M \cup N$ is a Hamiltonian cycle of $K_G$, then $G$ is said to have the Pairing-Hamiltonian property, or PH-property, for short. In 2007, Fink [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 97] proved that for every $d\geq 2$, the $d$-dimensional hypercube $\mathcal{Q}_d$ has the PH-property, thus proving a conjecture posed by Kreweras in 1996. In this paper we extend Fink's result by proving that given a graph $G$ having the PH-property, the prism graph $\mathcal{P}(G)$ of $G$ has the PH-property as well. Moreover, if $G$ is a connected graph, we show that there exists a positive integer $k_0$ such that the $k^{\textrm{th}}$-prism of a graph $\mathcal{P}^k(G)$ has the PH-property for all $k \ge k_0$.</description>

Abstract: This is the second of a series of papers which aim towards a classification of edge-transitive maps of which the Euler characteristic and the edge number are coprime. This one carries out the classification work for arc-transitive maps with non-solvable automorphism groups, which together with the first one completes a description of arc-transitive maps with the Euler characteristic and the edge number coprime. The classification is involved with a construction of some new and interesting reversing maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove analogs of Brooks' Theorem for the list-distinguishing chromatic number of different classes of simple finite connected graphs. Moreover, we determine two upper bounds for the list-distinguishing chromatic number of a graph G in terms of the coloring number of G and the list-chromatic number of G. We also determine the list-distinguishing chromatic number for various families of graphs (for example: the book graphs).</description>

      <title>Brooks' type theorems for coloring parameters of locally finite graphs and Konig's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past, analogues to Brooks' theorem have been found for various parameters of graph coloring for infinite locally finite connected graphs in ZFC. We prove these theorems are not provable in ZF (i.e. the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice (AC)). Moreover, such theorems follow from Konig's Lemma (every infinite locally finite connected graph has a ray-a weak form of AC) in ZF. In ZF, we formulate new conditions for the existence of the distinguishing chromatic number, the distinguishing chromatic index, the total chromatic number, the total distinguishing chromatic number, the odd chromatic number, and the neighbor-distinguishing index in infinite locally finite connected graphs, which are equivalent to Konig's Lemma. In this direction, we strengthen a recent result of Stawiski from 2023.
  We also figured out the upper bound for list-distinguishing chromatic number for infinite graphs in ZFC (i.e. the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (AC)).</description>

      <title>Characterization of Circular-arc Graphs: II. McConnell Flipping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: McConnell [FOCS 2001] presented a flipping transformation from circular-arc graphs to interval graphs with certain patterns of representations. Beyond its algorithmic implications, this transformation is instrumental in identifying all minimal graphs that are not circular-arc graphs. We conduct a structural study of this transformation, and for $C_{4}$-free graphs, we achieve a complete characterization of these patterns. This characterization allows us, among other things, to identify all minimal chordal graphs that are not circular-arc graphs in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Circular-arc Graphs: III. Chordal Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify all minimal chordal graphs that are not circular-arc graphs, thereby resolving one of ``the main open problems'' concerning the structures of circular-arc graphs as posed by Dur{\'{a}}n, Grippo, and Safe in 2011. The problem had been attempted even earlier, and previous efforts have yielded partial results, particularly for claw-free graphs and graphs with an independence number of at most four. The answers turn out to have very simple structures: all the nontrivial ones belong to a single family. Our findings are based on a structural study of McConnell's flipping, which transforms circular-arc graphs into interval graphs with certain representation patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $n$ buttons and $n$ bulbs so that the $i$th button toggles the $i$th bulb and perhaps some other bulbs, we compute the sharp lower bound on the number of bulbs that can be lit regardless of the action of the buttons. In the previous article we dealt with the case where each button affects at most 2 or 3 bulbs. In the present article we give sharp lower bounds for up to 4 or 5 wires per switch, and we show that the sharp asymptotic bound for an arbitrary number of wires is $\frac12$. (Even if you've found their buttons, you can please no more than half the people all the time!)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build on the methods introduced by Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley, and Wachs, and further developed by Brauner and Friedmann, to construct additional classes of presentations of Specht modules. We obtain these presentations by defining a linear operator which is a symmetrized sum of dual Garnir relations on the space of column tabloids. Our presentations apply to the vast majority of shapes of Specht modules.</description>

Abstract: Let $E$ be a set in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ and $S$ be a set of maps from $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ to $\mathbb{F}_p^n$. We define \[ S (E) := \bigcup_{f\in S} f(E) = \left\lbrace f(x) \colon x\in E, f\in S \right\rbrace.\] In this paper, we establish sharp lower bounds on the size of $S(E)$ when $S$ consists of matrices from either the special linear group $SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ or the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_1(\mathbb{F}_p)$. Our proofs are based on novel results on algebraic incidence-type structures associated with these groups. We also discuss higher-dimensional generalizations.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for calculating the chromatic symmetric function (CSF) of a graph in chromatic-bases and the $m_\lambda$-basis. Our key contributions include a novel approach for calculating the CSF in chromatic-bases constructed from forests and an efficient method for determining the CSF in the $m_\lambda$-basis. As applications, we present combinatorial proofs for two known theorems that were originally established using algebraic techniques. Additionally, we demonstrate that an algorithm introduced by Aliste-Prieto, de Mier, Orellana, and Zamora can be viewed as a case of our proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arrangements of pseudohyperplanes are widely studied in computational geometry. A rich subclass of pseudohyerplane arrangements, which has gained more attention in recent years, is the so-called signotopes. Introduced by Manin and Schechtman (1989), the higher Bruhat order is a natural order of $r$-signotopes on $n$ elements, with the signotope corresponding to the cyclic arrangement as the minimal element. In this paper, we show that the lower (and by symmetry upper) levels of this higher Bruhat order contain the same number of elements for a fixed difference $n-r$. This result implies that given the difference $d=n-r$ and $p$, the number of one-element extensions of the cyclic arrangement of $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with at most $p$ points on one side of the extending pseudohyperplane does not depend on $n$, as long as $n \geq d + p$.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Algorithms to Solve the $(n,k)$-Complete Hidden Subset Sum Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hidden Subset Sum Problem (HSSP) is a significant NP-complete problem in number theory and combinatorics, with applications in cryptography and AI privacy. For the $(n,k)$-complete HSSP, where a target multiset must be recovered from its all $k$-subset sums, existing algorithms face limitations due to high complexity or intractability. This paper proposes two deterministic algorithms: a brute-force approach, and a novel method leveraging symmetric polynomials and Vieta's formulas with $O\left(\sum_{u=1}^n p(u,\leq k)^3+\binom{n}{k}n\right)$ complexity, where $ p(u,\leq k)$ counts the number of partitions of a positive integer $u$ into at most $k$ parts. The latter constructs an $n$-th degree polynomial via Vieta's formulas, whose roots correspond to the hidden multiset elements. Additionally, the discussion about the homogeneous symmetric polynomial rings is of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: This is one of a series of papers which aim towards a classification of edge-transitive maps of which the Euler characteristic and the edge number are coprime. This one establishes a framework and carries out the classification work for arc-transitive maps with solvable automorphism groups, which illustrates how the edge number impacts on the Euler characteristic for maps. The classification is involved with the constructions of various new and interesting arc-regular maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Whitney function of a q-matroid can be determined from the cloud and flock polynomials associated to the cyclic flats. These polynomials capture information about the corank (resp., nullity) of certain spaces whose cyclic core (resp., closure) is the given cyclic flat. Going one step further, we prove that the Whitney function, and in fact the cloud-flock lattice, are determined by the configuration of the q-matroid, which is the abstract lattice of cyclic flats together with the corank-nullity data. Furthermore, we show that the configuration and cloud-flock lattice behave well under duality and direct sums, whereas the Whitney function does not contain enough information to behave well under taking direct sums.</description>

Abstract: If $M$ is a matroid, then a simple matroid $M'$ with the same rank as $M$ is an adjoint of $M$ if there is an inclusion-reversing embedding $\phi$ of the lattice of flats of $M$ into the lattice of flats of $M'$ such that $\phi$ maps the hyperplanes of $M$ bijectively onto the points of $M'$. In this note, we provide a proof that the class of matroids with an adjoint is minor-closed.</description>

      <title>The least balanced graphs and trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a connected graph, the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix (often called the Perron vector) can be used to assign positive weights to the vertices. A natural way to measure the homogeneousness of this vector is by considering the ratio of its $\ell^1$ and $\ell^2$ norms.
  It is easy to see that the most balanced graphs in this sense (i.e., the ones with the largest ratio) are the regular graphs. What about the least balanced graphs with the smallest ratio? It was conjectured by R\"ucker, R\"ucker and Gutman that, for any given $n \geq 6$, among $n$-vertex connected graphs the smallest ratio is achieved by the complete graph $K_4$ with a single path $P_{n-4}$ attached to one of its vertices. In this paper we confirm this conjecture.
  We also verify the analogous conjecture for trees: for any given $n \geq 8$, among $n$-vertex trees the smallest ratio is achieved by the star graph $S_5$ with a path $P_{n-5}$ attached to its central vertex.</description>

      <title>Exact Phase Transitions for Stochastic Block Models and Reconstruction on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue to rigorously establish the predictions in ground breaking work in statistical physics by Decelle, Krzakala, Moore, Zdeborov\'a (2011) regarding the block model, in particular in the case of $q=3$ and $q=4$ communities.
  We prove that for $q=3$ and $q=4$ there is no computational-statistical gap if the average degree is above some constant by showing it is information theoretically impossible to detect below the Kesten-Stigum bound. The proof is based on showing that for the broadcast process on Galton-Watson trees, reconstruction is impossible for $q=3$ and $q=4$ if the average degree is sufficiently large. This improves on the result of Sly (2009), who proved similar results for regular trees for $q=3$. Our analysis of the critical case $q=4$ provides a detailed picture showing that the tightness of the Kesten-Stigum bound in the antiferromagnetic case depends on the average degree of the tree. We also prove that for $q\geq 5$, the Kestin-Stigum bound is not sharp.
  Our results prove conjectures of Decelle, Krzakala, Moore, Zdeborov\'a (2011), Moore (2017), Abbe and Sandon (2018) and Ricci-Tersenghi, Semerjian, and Zdeborov\'a (2019). Our proofs are based on a new general coupling of the tree and graph processes and on a refined analysis of the broadcast process on the tree.</description>

      <title>Causal Structure Learning in Directed, Possibly Cyclic, Graphical Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a directed graph $G^\star$ from observational data. We assume that the distribution which gives rise to the samples is Markov and faithful to the graph $G^\star$ and that there are no unobserved variables. We do not rely on any further assumptions regarding the graph or the distribution of the variables. Particularly, we allow for directed cycles in $G^\star$ and work in the fully non-parametric setting. Given the set of conditional independence statements satisfied by the distribution, we aim to find a directed graph which satisfies the same $d$-separation statements as $G^\star$. We propose a hybrid approach consisting of two steps. We first find a partially ordered partition of the vertices of $G^\star$ by optimizing a certain score in a greedy fashion. We prove that any optimal partition uniquely characterizes the Markov equivalence class of $G^\star$. Given an optimal partition, we propose an algorithm for constructing a graph in the Markov equivalence class of $G^\star$ whose strongly connected components correspond to the elements of the partition, and which are partially ordered according to the partial order of the partition. Our algorithm comes in two versions -- one which is provably correct and another one which performs fast in practice.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we establish a mathematical framework that utilizes concepts from graph theory to formalize the parity transformation, an encoding strategy for compiling optimization problems on quantum devices. We introduce the transformation as a mapping that encompasses all possible compiled hypergraphs and investigate its uniqueness properties in more detail. Specifically, by introducing so-called loop labelings, we derive an alternative expression of the preimage of any set of compiled hypergraphs under this encoding procedure when all equivalence classes of graphs are being considered. We then deduce equivalent conditions for the injectivity of the parity transformation on any subset of all equivalences classes of graphs. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate that the parity transformation is not an injective mapping, and also introduce an important class of physical layouts and their corresponding set of constraints whose preimage is uniquely determined. In addition, we provide an algorithm which is based on classical algorithms from theoretical computer science and computes a compiled physical layout in this class in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Weak recovery, hypothesis testing, and mutual information in stochastic block models and planted factor graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic block model is a canonical model of communities in random graphs. It was introduced in the social sciences and statistics as a model of communities, and in theoretical computer science as an average case model for graph partitioning problems under the name of the ``planted partition model.'' Given a sparse stochastic block model, the two standard inference tasks are: (i) Weak recovery: can we estimate the communities with non trivial overlap with the true communities? (ii) Detection/Hypothesis testing: can we distinguish if the sample was drawn from the block model or from a random graph with no community structure with probability tending to $1$ as the graph size tends to infinity?
  In this work, we show that for sparse stochastic block models, the two inference tasks are equivalent except at a critical point. That is, weak recovery is information theoretically possible if and only if detection is possible. We thus find a strong connection between these two notions of inference for the model. We further prove that when detection is impossible, an explicit hypothesis test based on low degree polynomials in the adjacency matrix of the observed graph achieves the optimal statistical power. This low degree test is efficient as opposed to the likelihood ratio test, which is not known to be efficient. Moreover, we prove that the asymptotic mutual information between the observed network and the community structure exhibits a phase transition at the weak recovery threshold.
  Our results are proven in much broader settings including the hypergraph stochastic block models and general planted factor graphs. In these settings we prove that the impossibility of weak recovery implies contiguity and provide a condition which guarantees the equivalence of weak recovery and detection.</description>

      <title>Beyond uniform cyclotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyclotomy, the study of cyclotomic classes and cyclotomic numbers, is an area of number theory first studied by Gauss. It has natural applications in discrete mathematics and information theory. Despite this long history, there are significant limitations to what is known explicitly about cyclotomic numbers, which limits the use of cyclotomy in applications. The main explicit tool available is that of uniform cyclotomy, introduced by Baumert, Mills and Ward in 1982. In this paper, we present an extension of uniform cyclotomy which gives a direct method for evaluating all cyclotomic numbers over $GF(q^n)$ of order dividing $(q^n-1)/(q-1)$, for any prime power $q$ and $n \geq 2$, which does not use character theory nor direct calculation in the field. This allows the straightforward evaluation of many cyclotomic numbers for which other methods are unknown or impractical. Our methods exploit connections between cyclotomy, Singer difference sets and finite geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that each set of $n\ge 2$ points in the plane in general position has a straight-line matching with at least $(5n+1)/27$ edges whose segments form a connected set, and such a matching can be computed in $O(n \log n)$ time. As an upper bound, we show that for some planar point sets in general position the largest matching whose segments form a connected set has $\lceil \frac{n-1}{3}\rceil$ edges. We also consider a colored version, where each edge of the matching should connect points with different colors.</description>

      <title>The Deletion Order and Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deletion order of a finitely generated Coxeter group W is a total order on the elements which, as is proved, is a refinement of the Bruhat order. This order is applied in [8] to construct Elnitsky tilings for any finite Coxeter group. Employing the deletion order, a corresponding normal form of an element w of W is defined which is shown to be the same as the normal form of w using right to left lexicographic ordering. Further results on the deletion order are obtained relating to the property of being Artinian and, when W is finite, its interplay with the longest element of W.</description>

      <title>Finite Dynamical Laminations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed several combinatorial notions about laminations some with clear implications for parameter space. We introduce a simplified class of laminations called finite dynamical laminations (FDL). In order to count FDL, we introduce sibling portraits, of which we provide a comprehensive counting theorem. We provide a characterization of which periodic polygons appear in invariant laminations. We introduce the pullback tree. The base of the pullback tree is a set of laminations, and we show that those laminations are proper and invariant and have a restriction on its critical leaves, so all laminations in the base of the pullback tree correspond to a polynomial. We define the generational FDL graph, and it provides a summary of the combinatorial information we provide about polynomial parameter space.</description>

      <title>On the MST-ratio: Theoretical Bounds and Complexity of Finding the Maximum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finite set of red and blue points in $\Rspace^d$, the MST-ratio is defined as the total length of the Euclidean minimum spanning trees of the red points and the blue points, divided by the length of the Euclidean minimum spanning tree of their union. The MST-ratio has recently gained attention due to its direct interpretation in topological models for studying point sets with applications in spatial biology. The maximum MST-ratio of a point set is the maximum MST-ratio over all proper colorings of its points by red and blue. We prove that finding the maximum MST-ratio of a given point set is NP-hard when the dimension is part of the input. Moreover, we present a quadratic-time $3$-approximation algorithm for this problem. As part of the proof, we show that, in any metric space, the maximum MST-ratio is smaller than $3$. Additionally, we study the average MST-ratio over all colorings of a set of $n$ points. We show that this average is always at least $\frac{n-2}{n-1}$, and for $n$ random points uniformly distributed in a $d$-dimensional unit cube, the average tends to $\sqrt[d]{2}$ in expectation as $n$ approaches infinity.</description>

      <title>Hyperplanes Avoiding Problem and Integer Points Counting in Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our work, we consider the problem of computing a vector $x \in Z^n$ of minimum $\|\cdot\|_p$-norm such that $a^\top x \not= a_0$, for any vector $(a,a_0)$ from a given subset of $Z^n$ of size $m$. In other words, we search for a vector of minimum norm that avoids a given finite set of hyperplanes, which is natural to call as the $\textit{Hyperplanes Avoiding Problem}$. This problem naturally appears as a subproblem in Barvinok-type algorithms for counting integer points in polyhedra. We show that:
  1) With respect to $\|\cdot\|_1$, the problem admits a feasible solution $x$ with $\|x\|_1 \leq (m+n)/2$, and show that such solution can be constructed by a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm with $O(n \cdot m)$ operations. Moreover, this inequality is the best possible. This is a significant improvement over the previous randomized algorithm, which computes $x$ with a guaranty $\|x\|_{1} \leq n \cdot m$. The original approach of A.~Barvinok can guarantee only $\|x\|_1 = O\bigl((n \cdot m)^n\bigr)$. To prove this result, we use a newly established algorithmic variant of the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz;
  2) The problem is NP-hard with respect to any norm $\|\cdot\|_p$, for $p \in \bigl(R_{\geq 1} \cup \{\infty\}\bigr)$.
  3) As an application, we show that the problem to count integer points in a polytope $P = \{x \in R^n \colon A x \leq b\}$, for given $A \in Z^{m \times n}$ and $b \in Q^m$, can be solved by an algorithm with $O\bigl(\nu^2 \cdot n^3 \cdot \Delta^3 \bigr)$ operations, where $\nu$ is the maximum size of a normal fan triangulation of $P$, and $\Delta$ is the maximum value of rank-order subdeterminants of $A$. As a further application, it provides a refined complexity bound for the counting problem in polyhedra of bounded codimension. For example, in the polyhedra of the Unbounded Subset-Sum problem.</description>

      <title>S-invariant and S-multinvariant functions and some symmetry groups of algebraic sieves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we introduced algebraic sieves, i.e. selection procedures on a given finite set to extract a particular subset. Such procedures are performed by finite groups acting on the set. They are called sieves because there are certain sets of numbers which, with appropriate groups, can select, for example, a set of primes, think of the famous Eratosthenes sieve. In this article we have given a general definition of algebraic sieves. And we also introduced the notion of invariant and multi-invariant functions, certain permutations on the sieve set which, in the invariant case, commute with the action of a given sieve-selecting group and the automorphism of that group, and multi-invariants which commute with all groups and their respective automorphisms. By means of such functions we have given symmetries on such sieves. In particular, we studied certain groups of symmetries of invariant functions. Then, using such notions, we studied a particular example, the Goldbach sieve, where the selector groups are dihedral groups and the selected set consists of the primes and, in some cases, the numbers $1$ and $N-1=p$, with $N$ being even and p prime, which satisfies the Goldbach conjecture for $N$. We have shown that one of these symmetry groups is isomorphic to a subgroup or affinity group of the ring of integers modulo N with N an integer even $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Paired Domination Problems on Circle and $k$-Polygon Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19473v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set $D \subseteq V$ is a dominating set of a graph $G$ if every vertex in $V - D$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$. A dominating set $D$ is a paired-dominating set if the subgraph of $G$ induced by $D$ contains a perfect matching. In this paper, we prove that determining the minimum paired-dominating set in circle graphs is NP-complete. We further present an $O(n(\frac{n}{k^2-k})^{2k^2-2k})$-time algorithm for finding the minimum paired-dominating set in $k$-polygon graphs, a subclass of circle graphs. Additionally, we refine the existing algorithm of Elmallah and Stewart for computing the minimum dominating set in $k$-polygon graphs, reducing its time complexity from $O(n^{4k^2+3})$ to $O(n^{3k-5})$, and further extend it to find the minimum total dominating set.</description>

      <title>Generalized Orthogonal de Bruijn and Kautz Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A de Bruijn sequence of order $k$ over a finite alphabet is a cyclic sequence with the property that it contains every possible $k$-sequence as a substring exactly once. Orthogonal de Bruijn sequences are collections of de Bruijn sequences of the same order, $k$, satisfying the joint constraint that every $(k+1)$-sequence appears as a substring in at most one of the sequences in the collection. Both de Bruijn and orthogonal de Bruijn sequences have found numerous applications in synthetic biology, although the latter remain largely unexplored in the coding theory literature. Here we study three relevant practical generalizations of orthogonal de Bruijn sequences where we relax either the constraint that every $(k+1)$-sequence appears exactly once, or that the sequences themselves are de Bruijn rather than balanced de Bruijn sequences. We also provide lower and upper bounds on the number of fixed-weight orthogonal de Bruijn sequences. The paper concludes with parallel results for orthogonal nonbinary Kautz sequences, which satisfy similar constraints as de Bruijn sequences except for only being required to cover all subsequences of length $k$ whose maximum runlength equals to one.</description>
