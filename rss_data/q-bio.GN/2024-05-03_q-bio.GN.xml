      <title>Cross-modality Matching and Prediction of Perturbation Responses with Labeled Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is now possible to conduct large scale perturbation screens with complex readout modalities, such as different molecular profiles or high content cell images. While these open the way for systematic dissection of causal cell circuits, integrated such data across screens to maximize our ability to predict circuits poses substantial computational challenges, which have not been addressed. Here, we extend two Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport methods to incorporate the perturbation label for cross-modality alignment. The obtained alignment is then employed to train a predictive model that estimates cellular responses to perturbations observed with only one measurement modality. We validate our method for the tasks of cross-modality alignment and cross-modality prediction in a recent multi-modal single-cell perturbation dataset. Our approach opens the way to unified causal models of cell biology.</description>

      <title>Modelling the nanopore sequencing process with Helicase HMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in nanopore sequencing technology, particularly the R10 nanopore from Oxford Nanopore Technology, have necessitated the development of improved data processing methods to utilize their potential for more than 9-mer resolution fully. The processing of the ion currents predominantly utilizes neural network-based methods known for their high basecalling accuracy but face developmental bottlenecks at higher resolutions. In light of this, we introduce the Helicase Hidden Markov Model (HHMM), a novel framework designed to incorporate the dynamics of the helicase motor protein alongside the nucleotide sequence during nanopore sequencing. This model supports the analysis of millions of distinct states, enhancing our understanding of raw ion currents and their alignment with nucleotide sequences. Our findings demonstrate the utility of HHMM not only as a potent visualization tool but also as an effective base for developing advanced basecalling algorithms. This approach offers a promising avenue for leveraging the full capabilities of emerging high-resolution nanopore sequencing technologies.</description>

      <title>RawHash2: Mapping Raw Nanopore Signals Using Hash-Based Seeding and Adaptive Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05771v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Summary: Raw nanopore signals can be analyzed while they are being generated, a process known as real-time analysis. Real-time analysis of raw signals is essential to utilize the unique features that nanopore sequencing provides, enabling the early stopping of the sequencing of a read or the entire sequencing run based on the analysis. The state-of-the-art mechanism, RawHash, offers the first hash-based efficient and accurate similarity identification between raw signals and a reference genome by quickly matching their hash values. In this work, we introduce RawHash2, which provides major improvements over RawHash, including a more sensitive quantization and chaining implementation, weighted mapping decisions, frequency filters to reduce ambiguous seed hits, minimizers for hash-based sketching, and support for the R10.4 flow cell version and various data formats such as POD5 and SLOW5. Compared to RawHash, RawHash2 provides better F1 accuracy (on average by 10.57% and up to 20.25%) and better throughput (on average by 4.0x and up to 9.9x) than RawHash. Availability and Implementation: RawHash2 is available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/RawHash. We also provide the scripts to fully reproduce our results on our GitHub page.</description>
