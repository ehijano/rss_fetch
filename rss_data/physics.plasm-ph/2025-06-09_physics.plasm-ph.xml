      <title>Investigation of Neoclassical Tearing Mode Detection by ECE Radiometry in Tokamak Reactors via Asymptotic Matching Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TJ toroidal tearing mode code is used to make realistic predictions of the electron cyclotron emission (ECE) signals generated by neoclassical tearing modes (NTMs) in an ITER-like tokamak plasma equilibrium. In the so-called "outer region'', which comprises the bulk of the plasma, helical harmonics of the magnetic field with the same toroidal mode number as the NTM, but different poloidal mode numbers, are coupled together by the Shafranov shifts and shaping of the equilibrium magnetic flux-surfaces. In the "inner region'', which is localized in the vicinity of the NTM rational surface, helical harmonics whose poloidal and toroidal mode numbers are in the same ratio as those of the NTM are coupled together nonlinearly to produce a radially asymmetric magnetic island chain. The solutions in the inner and outer regions are asymptotically matched to one another. The asymptotic matching process determines the overall magnetic structure of the NTM, as well as the global perturbation to the electron temperature caused by the mode. A simulated ECE diagnostic is developed that accounts for the downshifting and broadening in frequency of the signal due to the relativistic mass increase of the emitting electrons.</description>

      <title>Bennett Vorticity: Analytic solutions to a flowing, nonlinear, Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-pinch equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bennett profile is a classic form for the plasma number density of an equilibrium Z pinch that has been studied for almost a century by plasma physicists interested in nonlinear plasma pinch science, and fusion energy. By transferring the nonlinearity entirely from the number density to the plasma flow velocity the magnetic structure of the resulting flowing Z-pinch equilibrium remains unchanged whilst now being defined by a vortical flow which previously did not exist in the classic case. Due to the monotonic structure of the nonlinearities first derivative, this analytic equilibrium is investigated to determine its validity as a Shear-Flow Stabilized Z-Pinch</description>

      <title>Onset of Driven Collisionless Reconnection in Strongly Magnetized Pair Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the onset of driven collisionless reconnection and plasmoid formation in a magnetically dominated pair plasma, using 2D particle-in-cell simulations. Two force-free flux tubes of radius $R$ are initially pushed together with a prescribed velocity, forming a current sheet whose width shrinks until reconnection sets in. % Even in our largest simulation with $R\approx 1600$ plasma skin depths, the sheet thickness at reconnection onset is comparable to the skin depth. Plasmoid chains are seen to develop when the sheet aspect ratio $A\gtrsim30$. In the strongly magnetized limit, the onset of reconnection occurs in roughly $2$ to $6$ light-crossing times $R/c$, depending on the imposed driving timescale, which controls the duration of the linear tearing phase. In the subsequent nonlinear merging phase, the evolution becomes effectively independent of the initially imposed velocity, leading to magnetic energy dissipation consistent with a normalized reconnection rate $\sim 0.1$. Our results have important implications for explosive release of magnetic energy in magnetospheres of compact objects and their surroundings.</description>

      <title>Mean Force Emission Theory for Classical Bremsstrahlung in Electron-Ion Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the previously developed mean force emission theory to describe electron-ion plasmas. Results are compared to molecular dynamics simulations. The main extensions are to account for the attractive nature of electron-ion interactions and to model short-range quantum effects using the Kelbg potential. By reducing the electron-ion force inside the deBroglie wavelength, the Kelbg potential causes a decay at high frequencies and a decrease in magnitude of the low frequency bremsstrahlung spectrum. The attractive electron-ion interaction also allows for classically bound states that show up as peaks in the emission spectrum. Results show that the Kelbg potential can capture quantum modifications to classical Gaunt factors, but is limited in describing emission at very high frequencies. This work further supports the notion that there is a peak in emission near the plasma frequency at strong coupling that cannot be captured using the common Drude correction. Importantly, the linear response framework used to calculate the bremsstrahlung emission coefficient is related to both the absorption coefficient and the real part of the dynamic electrical conductivity. This means that the conclusions drawn from this study can be applied to these transport coefficients as well. Finally, this work compares the results with commonly used classical and quantum mechanical Gaunt factors, and discusses the impact of a Fermi-Dirac distribution of electrons on emission and why screening slightly reduces the bremsstrahlung power in weakly coupled and non-degenerate plasmas.</description>

      <title>Petrov-Galerkin model reduction for collisional-radiative argon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulation of nonequilibrium plasmas -- crucial to applications in electric propulsion, hypersonic re-entry, and astrophysical flows -- requires state-specific collisional-radiative (CR) kinetic models, but these come at a prohibitive computational cost. Traditionally, this cost has been mitigated through empirical or physics-based simplifications of the governing equations. However, such approaches often fail to retain the essential features of the original dynamics, particularly under strong nonequilibrium conditions. To address these limitations, we develop a Petrov-Galerkin reduced-order model (ROM) for CR argon plasma based on oblique projections that optimally balance the covariance of full-order state trajectories with that of the system's output sensitivities. This construction ensures that the ROM captures both the dominant energetic modes and the directions most relevant to input-output behavior. After offline training in a zero-dimensional setting using nonlinear forward and adjoint simulations, the ROM is coupled to a finite-volume solver and applied to one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) ionizing shock-tube problems. The ROM achieves a 3$\times$ reduction in state dimension and more than one order of magnitude savings in floating-point operations, while maintaining errors below 1% for macroscopic quantities. In both 1D and 2D, it robustly reproduces complex unsteady plasma features -- such as periodic fluctuations, electron avalanches, triple points, and cellular ionization patterns -- in contrast to standard ROM strategies, which become unstable or inaccurate under these challenging conditions. These results demonstrate that the proposed projection-based ROM enables substantial model compression while preserving key physical mechanisms in nonequilibrium plasma physics, paving the way for fast, reliable simulation of high-speed plasma flows.</description>

      <title>Effects of inert background gases and photo-illumination on three-color electromagnetically induced transparency of rubidium vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-color Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) of room-temperature Rb vapor in the presence of inert gases (Ar, Ne, and N$_2$) at 50~mTorr and 500~mTorr is investigated. The observed EIT lines shift and develop blue-detuned satellite lines, dependent on inert-gas species and pressure. The separations of the satellite from the main EIT lines are approximately pressure-independent, while their strength increases with inert-gas pressure. The satellite lines are attributed to hyperfine collisions of the intermediate $5D_{3/2}$ state. Further, analyzing the Stark effect of Rydberg levels, it is found that the inert gases suppress static electric fields in the vapor cells, which we induce by photo-illumination of the cell walls with an auxiliary 453-nm laser. In the work, we utilize Rydberg levels with principal quantum numbers $n$ = 25 and 50 and angular momenta $\ell$ = 3 up to 6, excited by the EIT lasers and optional radio-frequency dressing fields. The work is of interest in the spectroscopic study of mixed-species warm vapors, in sensing applications of Rydberg atoms in vapor cells, and in non-invasive electric-field diagnostics of low-pressure discharge plasma.</description>

      <title>Effect of interparticle fields and radiation reaction on beam dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17832v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of relativistic particles in an intense electromagnetic field can be described by the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation, where the adiation reaction (RR) is accounted for via a self-force, and interparticle fields are often neglected as an approximation. However, the inclusion of interparticle fields is necessary to ensure energy-momentum conservation, particularly during coherent emission. Here we present (i) an analytical proof showing that the energy-momentum conservation law of the Hamilton-Rohrlich-Dirac action, which is divergence free and describes a generic system of interacting charges, respects causality and provides physically sensible results; (ii) a simple generalization of the LL equation for many particles evaluated as a function of the total field, i.e., the sum of the external and interparticle fields. By performing first-principles numerical simulations of a neutral, relativistic bunch of electrons and positrons ($e^-/e^+$) colliding with a laser pulse, this theory is shown to satisfy energy-momentum conservation when interparticle fields and RR are simultaneously taken into account; and (iii) the combined effect of interparticle fields and RR primarily affects the tail of the particle energy distribution. Additionally, our first-principles simulations show that the effect of interparticle fields on beam energy loss becomes smaller when most of the radiated energy is incoherent.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent quasilinear theory for collisionless relaxation to universal quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent mystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven, inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for the secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to linear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that are collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the response matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to all orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in $N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core, and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor solutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state solution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white noise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal nature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more particles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the fluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated halo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ can either be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary condition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact subhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo profiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation described by a self-consistent QLT.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the hybrid piezo and pyroelectric nanogenerators performance by SiO2 nanowires confinement in poly(vinylidene fluoride)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of a novel flexible piezo/pyro-electric nanogenerator (PPNG) that combines a uniform film of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) infiltrated over vertically supported SiO2 nanowires (NWs) to enhance both piezoelectric and pyroelectric energy harvesting capabilities. The synthetic procedure involves a low-temperature multi-step approach, including the soft-template formation of SiO2 NWs on a flexible substrate, followed by the infiltration of a PVDF thin film (TF). The plasma-enabled fabrication of SiO2 NWs facilitated vertical alignment and precise control over the surface microstructure, density, and thickness of the confined nanostructures. These strategic structural systems promote the development of the most favourable electroactive \b{eta}- and {\gamma}-phases in the PVDF matrix. Notably, the electrical poling plays a major role in aligning the random dipoles of the PVDF macromolecular chain in a more ordered fashion to nucleate the amplified electroactive phases. As a proof-of-concept, the fabricated PPNG exhibited a significant improvement in the instantaneous piezoelectric output power density (P), ~ 9-fold amplification relative to its bare PVDF TF counterpart. Analogously, the pyroelectric coefficient (p) demonstrated a 4-fold superior performance with referenced PVDF TF based PPNG. Thus, the engineered system of SiO2 NWs@PVDF comprising PPNG offers a promising pathway toward multisource energy harvesting capabilities through efficient energy transduction at mechanical excitation frequencies of 10-12 Hz and across a temperature difference ({\Delta}T) of 9 to 22 K.</description>
