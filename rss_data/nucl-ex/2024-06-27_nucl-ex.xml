      <title>Anomalous soft photons: status and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report summarizes the work of the EMMI Rapid Reaction Task Force on "Real and Virtual Photon Production at Ultra-Low Transverse Momentum and Low Mass at the LHC". We provide an overview of the soft-photon puzzle, i.e., of the long-standing discrepancy between experimental data and predictions based on Low's soft-photon theorem, also referred to as "anomalous" soft photon production, and we review the current theoretical understanding of soft radiation and soft theorems. We also focus on low-mass dileptons as a tool for determining the electrical conductivity of the medium produced in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. We discuss how both topics can be addressed with the planned ALICE 3 detector at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Measurement of directed flow in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 19.6 and 27 GeV with the STAR Event Plane Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In heavy-ion collision experiments, the global collectivity of final-state particles can be quantified by anisotropic flow coefficients ($v_n$). The first-order flow coefficient, also referred to as the directed flow ($v_{1}$), describes the collective sideward motion of produced particles and nuclear fragments in heavy-ion collisions. It carries information on the very early stage of the collision, especially at large pseudorapidity ($\eta$), where it is believed to be generated during the nuclear passage time. Directed flow therefore probes the onset of bulk collective dynamics during thermalization, providing valuable experimental guidance to models of the pre-equilibrium stage. In 2018, the Event Plane Detector (EPD) was installed in STAR and used for the Beam Energy Scan phase-II (BES-II) data taking. The combination of EPD ($2.1 &lt;|\eta|&lt; 5.1$) and high-statistics BES-II data enables us to extend the $v_{1}$ measurement to the forward and backward $\eta$ regions. In this paper, we present the measurement of $v_{1}$ over a wide $\eta$ range in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 19.6 and 27 GeV using the STAR EPD. The results of the analysis at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$19.6 GeV exhibit excellent consistency with the previous PHOBOS measurement, while elevating the precision of the overall measurement. The increased precision of the measurement also revealed finer structures in heavy-ion collisions, including a potential observation of the first-order event-plane decorrelation. Multiple physics models were compared to the experimental results. Only a transport model and a three-fluid hybrid model can reproduce a sizable $v_{1}$ at large $\eta$ as was observed experimentally. The model comparison also indicates $v_{1}$ at large $\eta$ might be sensitive to the QGP phase transition.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Emulation of Flow in Heavy-Ion Collisions at Intermediate Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applications of new techniques in machine learning are speeding up progress in research in various fields. In this work, we construct and evaluate a deep neural network (DNN) to be used within a Bayesian statistical framework as a faster and more reliable alternative to the Gaussian Process (GP) emulator of an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) transport model simulator of heavy-ion reactions at intermediate beam energies. We found strong evidence of DNN being able to emulate the IBUU simulator's prediction on the strengths of protons' directed and elliptical flow very efficiently even with small training datasets and with accuracy about ten times higher than the GP. Limitations of our present work and future improvements are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Proton, deuteron and triton flow measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.4$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High precision measurements of flow coefficients $v_{n}$ ($n = 1 - 4$) for protons, deuterons and tritons relative to the first-order spectator plane have been performed in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.4$ GeV with the High-Acceptance Di-Electron Spectrometer (HADES) at the SIS18/GSI. Flow coefficients are studied as a function of transverse momentum $p_{t}$ and rapidity $y_{cm}$ over a large region of phase space and for several classes of collision centrality. A clear mass hierarchy is found for the slope of $v_{1}$, $d v_{1}/d y^{\prime}|_{y^{\prime} = 0}$ where $y^{\prime}$ is the scaled rapidity, and for $v_{2}$ at mid-rapidity. Scaling with the number of nucleons is observed for the $p_{t}$ dependence of $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$ at mid-rapidity, which is indicative for nuclear coalescence as the main process responsible for light nuclei formation. $v_{2}$ is found to scale with the initial eccentricity $\langle \epsilon_{2} \rangle$, while $v_{4}$ scales with $\langle \epsilon_{2} \rangle^{2}$ and $\langle \epsilon_{4} \rangle$. The multi-differential high-precision data on $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, and $v_{4}$ provides important constraints on the equation-of-state of compressed baryonic matter.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Methods to Determine the Fluence of Monoenergetic Neutrons in the Energy Range from 30 keV to 14.8 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary reference instruments for neutron fluence measurements used at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) are based on the primary standard for neutron measurements which is the differential neutron-proton scattering cross section. Such instruments require considerable effort for their operation and analysis. Therefore, routine measurements are carried out using a transfer instrument to facilitate the efficient provision of services to customers. A series of measurements was conducted to compare the transfer device to the primary reference instruments and ensure the traceability of neutron fluence measurements. This resulted in an improved characterization of the instrument and new analysis procedures.</description>

      <title>Analysis of neutron time-of-flight spectra with a Bayesian unfolding methodology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed an innovative methodology for obtaining the neutron energy distribution from a time-of-flight (TOF) measurement based on the iterative Bayesian unfolding method and accurate Monte Carlo simulations. This methodology has been validated through the analysis of a realistic virtual $\beta$-decay experiment, including the most relevant systematic effects in a real experiment. The proposed methodology allowed for obtaining accurate results over the energy range above the neutron detection threshold.</description>

      <title>Estimation of electric field in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We estimate the spacetime profile of the electric field in head-on heavy-ion collisions at intermediate collision energies $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = {\mathcal O}(3 \;-\; 10\;{\rm GeV})$. Using a hadronic cascade model (JAM; Jet AA Microscopic transport model), we numerically demonstrate that the produced field has strength $eE = {\mathcal O}((30 \;-\; 60\;{\rm MeV})^2)$, which is supercritical to the Schwinger limit of QED and is non-negligibly large compared even to the hadron/QCD scale, and survives for a long time $\tau = {\mathcal O}(10\;{\rm fm}/c)$ due to the baryon stopping. We show that the produced field is nonperturbatively strong in the sense that the nonperturbativity parameters (e.g., the Keldysh parameter) are sufficiently large. This is in contrast to high-energy collisions $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \gtrsim 100 \;{\rm GeV}$, where the field is extremely short-lived and hence is perturbative. Our results imply that the electromagnetic field may have phenomenological impacts on hadronic/QCD processes in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions and that heavy-ion collisions can be used as a new tool to explore strong-field physics in the nonperturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Evidence for polyimide redeposition and possible correlation with sparks in Gas Electron Multipliers working in CF$_4$ mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on aging processes of Gas Electron Multipliers (GEMs) is important to obtain insights on how to increase the detector's longevity, stability, and performance, as highlighted in the latest developments roadmap by the European Council of Future Accelerators (ECFA). One key aspect of the aging process is the deposit formation on the electrodes surfaces. In this work, through the analysis of the molecular content on the surface of a used GEM, we provide evidence for polyimide redeposition as a source of organic material contributing to the formation of insulating layers on the electrodes, which eventually lead to sparks and detector failure. Furthermore, we show that chromium, used to promote adhesion between copper and polyimide, in the device undergoes a diffusion process, effectively blurring the layered structure. We demonstrate the significance of surface-sensitive chemical analysis to investigate the surface deposits on electrodes of gaseous detectors and our results reveal the necessity of standardization and more stringent study protocols.</description>
