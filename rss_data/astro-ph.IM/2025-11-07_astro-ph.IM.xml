      <title>The Real-Time Data Processor Framework for Data Handling and Analysis of High-Energy Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implemented a real-time data processor (rta-dp) framework that can be used to develop real-time analysis pipelines and data handling systems to manage high-throughput data streams with distributed applications in the context of ground and space astrophysical projects and high-energy instruments. The rta-dp is based on the ZeroMQ in-memory communication framework to receive input data, share data between distributed processes, and send or receive commands and pipeline configuration. The rta-dp framework has a flexible architecture that allows the implementation of distributed analysis systems customized to the requirements of several scenarios. The rta-dp framework also provides monitoring capabilities for the running processes and sends housekeeping, logging, alarms, and informative messages that a monitoring process can acquire. We are using the rta-dp in several contexts, such as acquiring and processing data from X-ray detectors to the data quality system of the ASTRI Project, as well as reprocessing and archiving data.</description>

      <title>Event Reconstruction for Radio-Based In-Ice Neutrino Detectors with Neural Posterior Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos in the EeV range is the goal of current and future in-ice radio arrays at the South Pole and in Greenland. Here, we present a deep neural network that can reconstruct the main neutrino properties of interest from the raw waveforms recorded by the radio antennas: the neutrino direction, the energy of the particle shower induced by the neutrino interaction, and the event topology, thereby estimating the neutrino flavor. For the first time, we predict the full posterior PDF for the energy and direction reconstruction via neural posterior estimation utilizing conditional normalizing flows, enabling event-by-event uncertainty prediction. We improve over previous reconstruction algorithms and obtain a median resolution of 0.30 log(E) and 18 square degrees for a 'shallow' detector component and 0.08 log(E) and 28 square degrees for a 'deep' detector component for neutral current (NC) events at a shower energy of 1 EeV. This deep learning approach also allows us to reconstruct the more stochastic $\nu_e$ - charged current (CC) events. We quantify the impact of different antenna types and systematic uncertainties on the reconstruction and derive a goodness-of-fit score to test the compatibility of measured neutrino signals with the Monte Carlo simulations used to train the neural network.</description>

      <title>Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. II. Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the first stars in the Universe might be powered by Dark Matter (DM) annihilations, rather than nuclear fusion. Those objects, i.e. Dark stars (DS), offer a unique window into understanding DM via the observational study of the formation and evolution of the first stars and their Black Hole (BH) remnants. In \cite{NNSMDSPhot} (Paper~I) we introduced a feedforward neural network (FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize dark star {\it photometric} candidates in the early universe based on data taken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to identify {\it spectroscopic} dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST's NIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real data for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates recently identified in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar} and reconfirm that indeed \JADESeleven, \JADESzthirteen, \JADESfz, and \JADESfo have spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The main advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte Carlo parameter estimator used in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach introduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster than the traditional method used in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN model we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian uncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data for high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool for probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Cutana: A High-Performance Tool for Astronomical Image Cutout Generation at Petabyte Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euclid Quick Data Release 1 (Q1) encompasses 30 million sources across 63.1 square degrees, marking the beginning of petabyte-scale data delivery through Data Release 1 (DR1) and subsequent releases. Systematic exploitation of such datasets requires extracting millions of source-specific cutouts, yet standard tools like Astropy's Cutout2D process sources individually, creating bottlenecks for large catalogues. We introduce Cutana, a memory-efficient software tool optimised for batch processing in both local and cloud-native environments. Cutana employs vectorised NumPy operations to extract cutout batches simultaneously from FITS tiles, implements automated memory-aware scheduling, and supports both Zarr and FITS output formats with multiple common normalisation schemes (asinh, log, zscale). Cutana outperforms Astropy in all tested Q1 subset scenarios achieving near linear scaling and processing thousands of cutouts per second. On just four worker threads, Cutana can process all of Q1 in under four hours. The tool includes an ipywidget interface for parameter configuration and real-time monitoring. Integration with ESA Datalabs is underway for the Euclid DR1 release, with open-source release pending ESA open-source licensing processes.</description>

      <title>Making the most of pure parallels: Machine learning augmented photometric redshifts for sparse JWST filter sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) are an essential tool for galaxy evolution science with JWST. However, for deep surveys with more limited filter sets (i.e. $N_{\text{filt}} \sim6$) such as large pure parallel surveys, the most commonly used template-fitting based photo-$z$ approaches can yield highly confident but spurious results for high-$z$ populations of interest. The utility and legacy value of these datasets could therefore be negatively impacted. To address this challenge, we present an application of machine learning (ML) based photo-$z$ techniques to deep JWST photometric datasets. We employ two different ML algorithms, using Gaussian processes and nearest-neighbour estimates, alongside a more standard template fitting approach. We show that simple nearest-neighbour based estimates can provide more accurate photo-$z$s than template fitting out to $z\sim8$, as well as reducing the fraction of catastrophic outliers by a factor of $\sim2-3$. Additionally, `hybrid' estimates combining template and ML can yield further improvements in overall accuracy and reliability while retaining some ability to predict photo-$z$ out to $z &gt; 10$. The nearest-neighbour only or hybrid estimates can achieve photo-$z$s with robust scatter of $\sigma_{\text{NMAD}}\sim0.03-0.04$ and outlier fractions of $\sim3-10\%$ between $0 &lt; z \lesssim 8$ from just 6 NIRCam bands, with negligible additional computational costs compared to standard template fitting. Our methodology is easily adaptable to alternative datasets, filter combinations or training samples. Overall, our results highlight the potential for even simple ML techniques to enhance the scientific return of JWST pure parallel and wide-area surveys.</description>

      <title>Quadrature-witness readout for backscatter mitigation in gravitational-wave detectors limited by back-action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disturbances in gravitational wave (GW) observational data are often caused by non-stationary noise in the detector itself, such as back-scattering of laser stray light into the signal field. Unlike GW signals, non-stationary noise can appear in both the GW-signal quadrature and the orthogonal quadrature, which is usually not measured. Simultaneous sensing of this orthogonal quadrature provides a witness channel that can be used to reconstruct the disturbance in the signal quadrature enabling a subtraction of non-stationary noise. Here, we present the concept of quadrature witness that is compatible with frequency-dependent squeezing, which is already used to simultaneously reduce photon shot noise and photon radiation pressure noise. We demonstrate that implementing this approach in a GW detector could reduce noise caused by loud back-scatter events, thereby improving the overall sensitivity and robustness of GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Sequential Posterior Inference via Reuse for Gravitational-Wave Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Accelerated Sequential Posterior Inference via Reuse (ASPIRE), a broadly applicable framework that transforms existing posterior samples and Bayesian evidence estimates into unbiased results under alternative models without rerunning the original analysis. ASPIRE combines normalizing flows with a generalized Sequential Monte Carlo scheme, enabling efficient updates of existing results and reducing the computational cost of reanalyses by 4-10 times. This addresses a growing problem in gravitational-wave astronomy, where events must be repeatedly reanalyzed under different models or physical hypotheses. We show that ASPIRE reproduces full Bayesian results when switching waveform models or adding physical effects such as spin precession and orbital eccentricity. With this statistical robustness, ASPIRE turns repeated reanalyses into fast, reliable updatespaving the way for systematic studies of waveform systematics, scalable reanalyses across large event catalogs, and broadly applicable Bayesian reanalysis across other scientific domains.</description>

      <title>3D Non-LTE radiation transfer: theory and applications to stars, exoplanets, and kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the physical information about astrophysical objects is obtained via the analysis of their electromagnetic spectra. Observed data coupled with radiation transfer models in physical conditions representative of stars, planets, kilonovae, and ISM, yield constrains on their physical structure, gas flow dynamics at the surface, mass loss, and detailed chemical composition of the systems. All these core astrophysical parameters are just as reliable as the physical quality of the models that are employed for simulations of radiation transfer. Recent advances in multi-D transfer modeling with Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) in inhomogeneous time-dependent systems revealed systematic shortcomings of canonical models. Owing to major complexities of solving coupled multi-frequency RT equations in 3D geometry, a number of approximations have been introduced. This review presents an overview of the physical problem, standard solutions, and recent methodological advances. We also provide an overview of main results in the area of 3D NLTE radiation transfer and its applications to modeling diverse astrophysical environments, including FGKM type- and OBA-type stars, multi-epoch spectra of kilonovae, and atmospheres of rocky and gaseous exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Novel Numerical Methods for Accurate Space Thermal Analysis: Enforcing View Factors and Modeling Diffuse Reflectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate thermal analysis is crucial for modern spacecraft, driving demand for reliable modeling tools. This research advances space thermal modeling by improving the simulation accuracy and efficiency of radiative heat transfer, the dominant mode of heat exchange in space. To this end, we incorporate diffuse reflectivity using the Gebhart method, which computes radiative exchange factors (REFs) from geometric view factors. The view factors, obtained via Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT), require post-processing to mitigate statistical errors. Critically, existing correction schemes cannot simultaneously enforce closure and reciprocity for open systems. This research addresses this gap by proposing two novel enforcement methods: (i) a least-squares optimization with non-negativity rectification (NNR) and small positive value avoidance (SPVA), and (ii) an iterative enforcement algorithm. To ensure consistency across different discretization levels, this work also introduces the multi-node surface model relations to formalize the connection between sub-face, face, and node representations of view factors and REFs. A simple case study demonstrates a substantial reduction in mean absolute error (MAE): the least-squares method achieves an 81% MAE reduction, while the iterative method offers the best balance of accuracy (56% MAE reduction) and computational efficiency. A second case study shows that including diffuse reflections decreases the steady-state temperature of a plate by $4^{\circ}C$, reinforcing that reflected radiation reduces net absorption. This work introduces and validates computationally efficient methods for integrating diffuse reflectivity into space thermal analyses and for consistently coupling multi-node surface radiative models. The results enable more accurate and robust thermal predictions for spacecraft systems.</description>

      <title>Mitigating effects of nonlinearities in homodyne quadrature interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homodyne Quadrature interferometers (HoQI) are an interferometric displacement sensing scheme proven to have excellent noise performance, making them a strong candidate for sensing and control schemes in gravitational wave detector seismic isolation. Like many interferometric schemes, HoQIs are prone to nonlinear effects when measuring displacements. These nonlinearities, if left unsuppressed, would substantially limit the use cases of HoQIs. This paper first shows a means of measuring and quantifying nonlinearities using a working HoQI and a mechanical resonator. We then demonstrate a method for real-time correction of these nonlinearities and several approaches for accurately calibrating the correction technique. By correcting in real time, we remove one of the biggest obstacles to including HoQIs in upgrades to future gravitational wave detectors. Finally, we discuss how to post correct data from HoQIs, suppressing even further the nonlinearity-induced errors, broadening the appeal of such sensors to other applications where measurement data can be reconstructed after the fact. We demonstrate all of this on a working HoQI system and show the measured suppression of nonlinear effects from each of these methods. Our work makes HoQIs a more broadly applicable tool for displacement sensing.</description>

      <title>Artificial Precision Polarization Array: Sensitivity for the axion-like dark matter with clock satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approaches to searching for axion-like signals based on pulsars include observations with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and pulsar polarization arrays (PPAs). However, these methods are limited by observational uncertainties arising from multiple unknown and periodic physical effects, which substantially complicate subsequent data analysis. To mitigate these issues and improve data fidelity, we propose the Artificial Pulsar Polarization Arrays (APPA): a satellite network comprising multiple pulsed signal transmitters and a dedicated receiver satellite. In order to constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter $g_{a\gamma}$, we generate simulated observations using Monte Carlo methods to investigate APPA's sensitivity via two complementary approaches: Bayesian analysis and frequentist analysis. Simulations indicate that for axion mass $m_{a}\sim\mathcal{O}\big(10^{-22}-10^{-19}\big)$ eV, APPA yields a better upper limit on $g_{a\gamma}$ (at the 95\% confidence level) than conventional ground-based observations and achieves better detection sensitivity.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{unimpeded}$: A Public Grid of Nested Sampling Chains for Cosmological Model Comparison and Tension Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is central to modern cosmology, yet comprehensive model comparison and tension quantification remain computationally prohibitive for many researchers. To address this, we release $\texttt{unimpeded}$, a publicly available Python library and data repository providing pre-computed nested sampling and MCMC chains. We apply this resource to conduct a systematic analysis across a grid of eight cosmological models, including $\Lambda$CDM and seven extensions, and 39 datasets, including individual probes and their pairwise combinations. Our model comparison reveals that whilst individual datasets show varied preferences for model extensions, the base $\Lambda$CDM model is most frequently preferred in combined analyses, with the general trend suggesting that evidence for new physics is diluted when probes are combined. Using five complementary statistics, we quantify tensions, finding the most significant to be between DES and Planck (3.57$\sigma$) and SH0ES and Planck (3.27$\sigma$) within $\Lambda$CDM. We characterise the $S_8$ tension as high-dimensional ($d_G=6.62$) and resolvable in extended models, whereas the Hubble tension is low-dimensional and persists across the model space. Caution should be exercised when combining datasets in tension. The $\texttt{unimpeded}$ data products, hosted on Zenodo, provide a powerful resource for reproducible cosmological analysis and underscore the robustness of the $\Lambda$CDM model against the current compendium of data.</description>

      <title>On the Exoplanet Yield of Gaia Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-examine the expected yield of Gaia astrometric planet detections using updated models for giant-planet occurrence, the local stellar population, and Gaia's demonstrated astrometric precision. Our analysis combines a semi-analytic model that clarifies key scaling relations with more realistic Monte Carlo simulations. We predict $7{,}500 \pm 2{,}100$ planet discoveries in the 5-year dataset (DR4) and $120{,}000 \pm 22{,}000$ over the full 10-year mission (DR5), with the dominant error arising from uncertainties in giant-planet occurrence. We evaluate the sensitivity of these forecasts to the detection threshold and the desired precision for measurements of planet masses and orbital parameters. Roughly $1{,}900 \pm 540$ planets in DR4 and $38{,}000 \pm 7{,}300$ planets in DR5 should have masses and orbital periods determined to better than $20$%. Most detections will be super-Jupiters ($3$ - $13 M_{\rm J}$) on $2$ - $5$AU orbits around GKM-type stars ($0.4$ - $1.3 M_\odot$) within $500$ pc. Unresolved binary stars will lead to spurious planet detections, but we estimate that genuine planets will outnumber them by a factor of $5$ or more. An exception is planets around M-dwarfs with $a &lt; 1$AU, for which the false-positive rate is expected to be about $50$%. To support community preparation for upcoming data releases, we provide mock catalogs of Gaia exoplanets and planet-impostor binaries.</description>

      <title>Broadband Low-Resolution Spectrograph - SpectrumMate LR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and application of SpectrumMate LR, a broadband, low-resolution spectrograph for small telescope use. SpectrumMate LR is designed to offer affordable, accessible spectroscopic capabilities for amateur astronomers and educators, inspired by the need for versatile instruments in amateur and educational settings. Utilising a 300 grooves/mm grating, 80 mm collimator and objective lenses, SpectrumMate LR is optimised to perform analyses across the visible spectrum, enabling users to classify stars by spectral type, measure stellar temperatures, and test filter transmission ranges. Tests demonstrate SpectrumMate LR's ability to capture accurate spectral data, validating its efficacy in observing both celestial and terrestrial light sources. This instrument fills a niche for cost-effective spectroscopy, empowering a broader audience to engage in detailed observational astronomy.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15315v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the DC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to mimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data, illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification. Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its effects.</description>

      <title>Stellar Spectroscopy Using Diffraction Grating, CMOS Monochrome Sensor, and Reflecting Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design and testing of a compact, low-cost stellar spectrometer developed for undergraduate and outreach applications. The instrument employs a 600 lines/mm diffraction grating, a CMOS monochrome sensor, and a 3D-printed mount integrated with reflecting telescopes. Calibration was performed using helium emission sources in the laboratory and Vega as a spectrophotometric standard, supported by a custom Python-based image-processing pipeline for wavelength calibration and spectral stacking. The spectrometer successfully recorded usable spectra of bright stars including Vega, Sirius, Procyon, Capella, and Betelgeuse, covering spectral types A through M. The results demonstrate that meaningful stellar spectroscopy can be achieved with accessible, low-cost equipment, providing a practical framework for student-led astronomical instrumentation projects.</description>

      <title>The first year of LISA Galactic foreground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic white-dwarf binaries play a central role in the inference model for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna. In this manuscript, we employ the $\texttt{bahamas}$ codebase to characterize, in a global-fit fashion, the reconstruction of the Galactic foreground during the first year of observation. To account for its statistical properties, we represent the data in time--frequency domain, and characterize the effectiveness of multiple approaches, e.g. statistically viable likelihoods, sampling schemes, segmentation widths, and gaps density. Our analysis yields consistent results across, with overwhelming evidence in favor of a non-stationary model in less than a month of data. Moreover, we show robustness against the presence of additional extragalactic foregrounds, and test the suitability of our approximations on the more complex simulated data in the $\textit{Yorsh}$ data challenge.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Agreement between Radio and Fluorescence Measurements of the Depth of Maximum of Extensive Air Showers at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show, for the first time, radio measurements of the depth of shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$) of air showers induced by cosmic rays that are compared to measurements of the established fluorescence method at the same location. Using measurements at the Pierre Auger Observatory we show full compatibility between our radio and the previously published fluorescence data set, and between a subset of air showers observed simultaneously with both radio and fluorescence techniques, a measurement setup unique to the Pierre Auger Observatory. Furthermore, we show radio $X_\text{max}$ resolution as a function of energy and demonstrate the ability to make competitive high-resolution $X_\text{max}$ measurements with even a sparse radio array. With this, we show that the radio technique is capable of cosmic-ray mass composition studies, both at Auger and at other experiments.</description>

      <title>Radio Measurements of the Depth of Air-Shower Maximum at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA), part of the Pierre Auger Observatory, is currently the largest array of radio antenna stations deployed for the detection of cosmic rays, spanning an area of $17$ km$^2$ with 153 radio stations. It detects the radio emission of extensive air showers produced by cosmic rays in the $30-80$ MHz band. Here, we report the AERA measurements of the depth of the shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$), a probe for mass composition, at cosmic-ray energies between $10^{17.5}$ to $10^{18.8}$ eV, which show agreement with earlier measurements with the fluorescence technique at the Pierre Auger Observatory. We show advancements in the method for radio $X_\text{max}$ reconstruction by comparison to dedicated sets of CORSIKA/CoREAS air-shower simulations, including steps of reconstruction-bias identification and correction, which is of particular importance for irregular or sparse radio arrays. Using the largest set of radio air-shower measurements to date, we show the radio $X_\text{max}$ resolution as a function of energy, reaching a resolution better than $15$ g cm$^{-2}$ at the highest energies, demonstrating that radio $X_\text{max}$ measurements are competitive with the established high-precision fluorescence technique. In addition, we developed a procedure for performing an extensive data-driven study of systematic uncertainties, including the effects of acceptance bias, reconstruction bias, and the investigation of possible residual biases. These results have been cross-checked with air showers measured independently with both the radio and fluorescence techniques, a setup unique to the Pierre Auger Observatory.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive spectro-polarimetric and timing analysis of twelve black hole X-ray binaries, namely Cyg X-1, 4U 1630-47, Cyg X-3, LMC X-1, 4U 1957+115, LMC X-3, Swift J1727.8-1613, GX 339-4, Swift J151857.0-572147, IGR J17091-3624, MAXI J1744-294 and GRS 1915+105, using quasi-simultaneous observations from {\it{IXPE}}, {\it{NICER}}, {\it{NuSTAR}}, and {\it{AstroSat}}. Timing analyses reveal type-B and type-C Quasi-periodic Oscillations across different spectral states, often associated with episodic radio ejections. Broadband ($0.7-60$ keV) spectral modeling, employing disc, Comptonization, and reflection components, reveals degeneracies in constraining disc-corona geometries. Polarimetric measurements in $2-8$ keV band detect significant polarization degrees (PDs) ranging from $3-20.6\%$ ($1.2-21.4\%$) in harder (softer) states, with moderate to strong energy dependence, except for LMC X$-1$, Swift J$151857.0-572147$, and MAXI J1744$-$294, where no significant polarization is detected. We report polarization detections of Cyg X$-3$ (PD $\sim 21.4\%$, SIMS), LMC X$-3$ (PD $\sim 2.4\%$, HSS) and IGR J$17091-3624$ (PD $\sim 9\%$, LHS) using recent {\it IXPE} observations. A positive correlation is found between PD and Comptonized photon fraction ($cov_{\rm frac}$), while an anti-correlation is observed with disc-to-Comptonized flux ratio ($F_{\rm ratio}$) across spectral states. Combined timing, spectral, and polarimetric results, together with constraints from radio jet observations, suggest a radially extended corona within a truncated disc for Cyg X$-1$, Swift J$1727.8-1613$, IGR J$17091-3624$, and GX $339-4$, whereas the disc-corona geometry remains poorly constrained for 4U $1957+115$, LMC X$-3$, and 4U $1630-47$. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding accretion geometries and highlight prospects for future X-ray polarimetric studies.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Cartography II: completing galaxy catalogs for gravitational-wave cosmology</title>

Abstract: The dark siren method exploits the complementarity between gravitational-wave binary coalescence signals and galaxy catalogs originating from the same regions of space. However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation. The inference results can be reproduced through our publicly available code base light.</description>

      <title>Order-by-order Modeling of Exoplanet Radial Velocity Data</title>

Abstract: Precise radial velocity (RV) measurements are a crucial tool for exoplanet discovery and characterization. Today, the majority of these measurements are derived from Echelle spectra in the optical wavelength region using cross-correlation techniques. Although for certain stars these approaches can produce RVs with sub-1 m~s$^{-1}$ measurement errors, for many others, we are now in a regime where instrumental precision is fundamentally below the intrinsic RV variations of the star that result from astrophysical processes that can be correlated in both time and wavelength. We explore new methods for measuring exoplanet orbital parameters that take advantage of the fact that RV data sets are fundamentally multi-wavelength. By analyzing NEID extremely precise radial velocity (EPRV) data of three known exoplanet systems, we show that fitting a single Keplerian model to multi-wavelength RVs can produce a factor of 1.5 -- 6.8 better $M_p \sin i$ uncertainties compared to fitting RVs that are derived from a weighted average across wavelength.</description>
