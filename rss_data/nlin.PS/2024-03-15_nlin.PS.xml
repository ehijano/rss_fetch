      <title>On the speed of propagation in Turing patterns for reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates transient wave dynamics in Turing pattern formation, focusing on waves emerging from localised disturbances. While the traditional focus of diffusion-driven instability has primarily centred on stationary solutions, considerable attention has also been directed towards understanding spatio-temporal behaviours, particularly the propagation of patterning from localised disturbances. We analyse these waves of patterning using both the well-established marginal stability criterion and weakly nonlinear analysis with envelope equations. Both methods provide estimates for the wave speed but the latter method, in addition, approximates the wave profile and amplitude. We then compare these two approaches analytically near a bifurcation point and reveal that the marginal stability criterion yields exactly the same estimate for the wave speed as the weakly nonlinear analysis. Furthermore, we evaluate these estimates against numerical results for Schnakenberg and CDIMA (chlorine dioxide-iodine-malonic acid) kinetics. In particular, our study emphasises the importance of the characteristic speed of pattern propagation, determined by diffusion dynamics and a complex relation with the reaction kinetics in Turing systems. This speed serves as a vital parameter for comparison with experimental observations, akin to observed pattern length scales. Furthermore, more generally, our findings provide systematic methodologies for analysing transient wave properties in Turing systems, generating insight into the dynamic evolution of pattern formation.</description>

      <title>Soliton Frequency Combs in Elastomer Membrane-Cavity Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solitons, arising from nonlinear wave-matter interactions, stand out for their intrinsic stability during wave propagation and exceptional spectral characteristics. Their applications span diverse physical systems, including telecommunications, atomic clocks, and precise measurements. In recent years, significant strides have been made in developing cavity-optomechanics based approaches to generate optical frequency combs (FCs). In this study, we present an innovative approach, never explored before, that leverages elastomer membrane (EM)-cavity optomechanics to achieve the generation of soliton FCs, a highly sought-after phenomenon in the realm of nonlinear wave-matter interactions. Our method represents a significant breakthrough due to its streamlined simplicity, relying on a single continuous-wave (CW) laser pump and an externally applied acoustic wave exciting an EM-cavity, which gives rise to phonons, quantized vibrational energy states intrinsic to the elastomer's crystalline lattice structure. The mechanical resonator and electromagnetic cavity resonance are parametrically coupled within the microwave frequency range, collectively orchestrate the process of soliton FCs formation with remarkable efficiency. Numerical simulations and experimental observations demonstrate the emergence of multiple stable localized opto-mechanical wave packets, characterized by a narrow pulses time-domain response. Crucially, by setting the acoustic wave frequency to match the natural frequency of the EM resonator, the solitons' teeth are precisely spaced, and the EM's motion is significantly amplified, giving rise to a Kerr medium. The successful realization of optomechanical stable solitons represents a monumental advancement with transformative potential across various fields, including quantum computing and spectroscopy.</description>
