      <title>A Stream Pipeline Framework for Digital Payment Programming based on Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital payments play a pivotal role in the burgeoning digital economy. Moving forward, the enhancement of digital payment systems necessitates programmability, going beyond just efficiency and convenience, to meet the evolving needs and complexities. Smart contract platforms like Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) networks and blockchains support programmable digital payments. However, the prevailing paradigm of programming payment logics involves coding smart contracts with programming languages, leading to high costs and significant security challenges. A novel and versatile method for payment programming on DLTs was presented in this paper - transforming digital currencies into token streams, then pipelining smart contracts to authorize, aggregate, lock, direct, and dispatch these streams efficiently from source to target accounts. By utilizing a small set of configurable templates, a few specialized smart contracts could be generated, and support most of payment logics through configuring and composing them. This approach could substantially reduce the cost of payment programming and enhance security, self-enforcement, adaptability, and controllability, thus hold the potential to become an essential component in the infrastructure of digital economy.</description>

      <title>Returns and Order Flow Imbalances: Intraday Dynamics and Macroeconomic News Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the interaction between returns and order flow imbalances in the S&amp;P 500 E-mini futures market using a structural VAR model identified through heteroskedasticity. The model is estimated at one-second frequency for each 15-minute interval, capturing both intraday variation and endogeneity due to time aggregation. We find that macroeconomic news announcements sharply reshape price-flow dynamics: price impact rises, flow impact declines, return volatility spikes, and flow volatility falls. Pooling across days, both price and flow impacts are significant at the one-second horizon, with estimates broadly consistent with stylized limit-order-book predictions. Impulse responses indicate that shocks dissipate almost entirely within a second. Structural parameters and volatilities also exhibit pronounced intraday variation tied to liquidity, trading intensity, and spreads. These results provide new evidence on high-frequency price formation and liquidity, highlighting the role of public information and order submission in shaping market quality.</description>
