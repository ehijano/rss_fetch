      <title>Methods of Fitting experimental data in several amplifiers for single spot radiometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single spot radiometers are widely used to estimate temperature of body heated by high temperature, specially blast furnace, glass fusion, boiler of power plant, and so on. In previous papers on single spot radiometer a heated body was deduced according to interpolation functions between heated body temperature and photocurrent, which had previously measured. However, fitting functions required for current-to-voltage converter, non-inverting amplifier, and logarithmic amplifier have never reported. Therefore, in this paper the fitting functions are reported that can obtain the relationship between radiance temperatures of a body and outputs of amplifiers in single spot radiometer.</description>

      <title>IoT-Driven System for Continuous Monitoring of Heart Disease Patients Post-Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthcare technology has advanced with the development of an IoT-based real-time monitoring system for post-operative heart disease patients. This system integrates advanced sensor technologies with cloud-connected platforms to continuously track vital signs, enabling more effective post-operative care. The system employs the HW-827 Heart Rate Sensor and DS18B20 Temperature Sensor, integrated with an ESP32 for wireless connectivity, to collect real-time data. Data was collected from 20 participants in each of the following categories: healthy individuals, pre-operative heart disease patients, and post-operative heart disease patients. The results revealed distinct physiological variations across the groups. Healthy individuals maintained stable temperatures (mean 36.3{\deg}C), while post-operative patients exhibited slightly elevated temperatures (mean 36.6{\deg}C). Heart rate analysis indicated higher rates in pre-operative (mean 87.8 bpm) and post-operative patients (mean 82.0 bpm) compared to healthy individuals (mean 72.4 bpm). ECG analysis showed elevated readings in pre-operative patients (mean 0.16 mV) compared to healthy individuals (mean 0.10 mV) and post-operative patients (mean 0.12 mV). Statistical analyses, including ANOVA tests, confirmed significant differences among the groups in terms of temperature (F(2, 12) = 4.57, p &lt; 0.05), heart rate (F(2, 12) = 5.91, p &lt; 0.01), and ECG readings (F(2, 12) = 3.24, p &lt; 0.05). This study demonstrates the potential of IoT technologies in enhancing post-operative care through continuous monitoring and data-driven insights. It emphasizes the role of real-time patient data in improving personalized healthcare management.</description>

      <title>First Linearity and Stability Characterization for CZT Detection System in a e$^+$e$^-$ Collider Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11294v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SIDDHARTA-2 collaboration built a new cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT, CdZnTe)-based X-ray detection system, used for the first time in the DA$\Phi$NE electron-positron collider at INFN-LNF. The aim of this work is to show that these detectors present optimal long- and short-term linearity and stability to perform precise spectroscopic measurements in a collider environment. The spectra used as references for calibration are reported, and the results about the linearity and stability studies are presented. It is also discussed and showed what is the proper function to describe all the effects that alter the Gaussian shape in semiconductors, particularly evident in the CZT case. Good residuals and resolutions were obtained for all the calibrations. In a test run with the source and the collider beam on, it was demonstrated that the calibrations made with beam off are optimal also when the beam is on, and the actual systematics in a physics run were estimated. These promising results show the potentialities of this detector in the high rate environment of a particle collider, and pave the way for the use of CZT detectors in kaonic atoms researches and in accelerators, with applications for particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Fiber Orientation Analysis of Carbon Fiber Sheet Molding Compounds using Polarization Imaging and X-Ray Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the quality inspection of carbon fiber sheet molding compounds, polarization imaging is a promising alternative to more established methods like computed tomography, since it is cheaper, faster, and provides a larger field-of-view. For uni- and bidirectional carbon fiber reinforced composite materials, machine vision cameras with on-chip polarized image sensors have been successfully validated for visualizing fiber orientation. Although this imaging technique is already being applied to multidirectional materials, to our knowledge, it has not yet been validated for such materials. In this paper, fiber orientations obtained by angle of linear polarization images (AOLP) of commercially available pressed carbon fiber sheet molding compound materials are compared with orientations estimated from computed tomography scans. The fiber orientations in the computed tomography images are estimated using the maximal response of anisotropic Gaussian filters and the deviation between orientations estimated from polarization and computed tomography images is calculated. Both imaging methods showed encouraging visual similarity, but also notable numerical differences, which are discussed in depth. Moreover, it is shown that the surface layer fiber orientation is representative of the fiber orientation through the entire specimen.</description>

      <title>Crossed laser phase plates for transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For decades since the development of phase-contrast optical microscopy, an analogous approach has been sought for maximizing the image contrast of weakly-scattering objects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The recent development of the laser phase plate (LPP) has demonstrated that an amplified, focused laser standing wave can provide stable, tunable phase shift to the high-energy electron beam, thus achieving phase-contrast TEM. With the proof-of-concept experimental demonstrations of the LPP now completed, in this paper we explore how the design can be further improved by tailoring its properties to the needs of biological imaging. In particular, we introduce the approach of crossed laser phase plates (XLPP): two laser standing waves intersecting in the diffraction plane of the TEM, rather than a single beam as in the current LPP. We provide a theoretical model for the XLPP inside the microscope and use simulations to quantify its effect on image formation. We find that the XLPP offers a path to increase information transfer by the microscope at low spatial frequencies while also suppressing the ghost images formed by Kapitza-Dirac diffraction of the electron beam by the laser beam. We also demonstrate a simple acquisition scheme, enabled by the XLPP, which further suppresses unwanted diffraction effects. The results of this study chart the course for future developments of LPP hardware.</description>

      <title>An experimental demonstration of neuromorphic sensing of chemical species using electro-optical reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A chemical discrimination system based on photonic reservoir computing is demonstrated experimentally for the first time. The system is inspired by the way humans perceive and process visual sensory information. The electro-optical reservoir computing system is a photonic analogue of the human nervous system with the read-out layer acting as the 'brain', and the sensor that of the human eye. A task-specific optimisation of the system is implemented, and the performance of the system for the discrimination between three chemicals is presented. The results are compared to the previously published numerical simulation. This publication provides a feasibility assessment and a demonstration of a practical realisation of photonic reservoir computing for a new neuromorphic sensing system - the next generation sensor with a built-in 'intelligence' which can be trained to 'understand' and to make a real time sensing decision based on the training data.</description>

      <title>Projected background and sensitivity of AMoRE-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AMoRE-II aims to search for neutrinoless double beta decay with an array of 423 Li$_2$$^{100}$MoO$_4$ crystals operating in the cryogenic system as the main phase of the Advanced Molybdenum-based Rare process Experiment (AMoRE). AMoRE has been planned to operate in three phases: AMoRE-pilot, AMoRE-I, and AMoRE-II. AMoRE-II is currently being installed at the Yemi Underground Laboratory, located approximately 1000 meters deep in Jeongseon, Korea. The goal of AMoRE-II is to reach up to $T^{0\nu\beta\beta}_{1/2}$ $\sim$ 6 $\times$ 10$^{26}$ years, corresponding to an effective Majorana mass of 15 - 29 meV, covering all the inverted mass hierarchy regions. To achieve this, the background level of the experimental configurations and possible background sources of gamma and beta events should be well understood. We have intensively performed Monte Carlo simulations using the GEANT4 toolkit in all the experimental configurations with potential sources. We report the estimated background level that meets the 10$^{-4}$counts/(keV$\cdot$kg$\cdot$yr) requirement for AMoRE-II in the region of interest (ROI) and show the projected half-life sensitivity based on the simulation study.</description>
