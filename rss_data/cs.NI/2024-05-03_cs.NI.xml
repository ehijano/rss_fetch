      <title>A Novel Wideband and Wide Beam High Gain Unidirectional Dipole Antenna for Next Generation WLAN Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel wideband and widebeam unidirectional magneto-electric (ME) dipole antenna for Wi-Fi-7 (5.18-7.125GHz) applications is presented. The element is printed on low-cost substrate and is showing wide-band characteristics with impedance matching over 50% of fractional bandwidth. A tilted ME antenna with a tilted parasitic scatterer is radiating across wide frequency, while meeting over 100{\deg} angular width in both E-plane and H-plane across the wide bandwidth from 5GHz to &gt;8GHz. Adding one parasitic scatterer on each side of dipole, broaden bandwidth of the antenna as well.</description>

      <title>Multi-User Multi-Application Packet Scheduling for Application-Specific QoE Enhancement Based on Knowledge-Embedded DDPG in 6G RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly growing diversity of concurrent applications from both different users and same devices calls for application-specific Quality of Experience (QoE) enhancement of future wireless communications. Achieving this goal relies on application-specific packet scheduling, as it is vital for achieving tailored QoE enhancement by realizing the application-specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements and for optimal perceived QoE values. However, the intertwining diversified QoE perception mechanisms, fairness among concurrent applications, and the impact of network dynamics inevitably complicate tailored packet scheduling. To achieve concurrent application-specific QoE enhancement, the problem of multi-user multi-application packet scheduling in downlink 6G radio access network (RAN) is first formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem in this paper. For solving this problem, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based solution is proposed. However, due to the high dimensionalities of both the state and action spaces, the trained DDPG agents might generate decisions causing unnecessary resource waste. Hence, a knowledge embedding method is proposed to adjust the decisions of the DDPG agents according to human insights. Extensive experiments are conducted, which demonstrate the superiority of DDPG-based packet schedulers over baseline algorithms and the effectiveness of the proposed knowledge embedding technique.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Q-Learning-Based Opportunistic Communication for MEC-Enhanced Vehicular Crowdsensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on MEC-enhanced, vehicle-based crowdsensing systems that rely on devices installed on automobiles. We investigate an opportunistic communication paradigm in which devices can transmit measured data directly to a crowdsensing server over a 4G communication channel or to nearby devices or so-called Road Side Units positioned along the road via Wi-Fi. We tackle a new problem that is how to reduce the cost of 4G while preserving the latency. We propose an offloading strategy that combines a reinforcement learning technique known as Q-learning with Fuzzy logic to accomplish the purpose. Q-learning assists devices in learning to decide the communication channel. Meanwhile, Fuzzy logic is used to optimize the reward function in Q-learning. The experiment results show that our offloading method significantly cuts down around 30-40% of the 4G communication cost while keeping the latency of 99% packets below the required threshold.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Semantic Communication Networks: Architecture, Security, and Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication, emerging as a breakthrough beyond the classical Shannon paradigm, aims to convey the essential meaning of source data rather than merely focusing on precise yet content-agnostic bit transmission. By interconnecting diverse intelligent agents (e.g., autonomous vehicles and VR devices) via semantic communications, the semantic communication networks (SemComNet) supports semantic-oriented transmission, efficient spectrum utilization, and flexible networking among collaborative agents. Consequently, SemComNet stands out for enabling ever-increasing intelligent applications, such as autonomous driving and Metaverse. However, being built on a variety of cutting-edge technologies including AI and knowledge graphs, SemComNet introduces diverse brand-new and unexpected threats, which pose obstacles to its widespread development. Besides, due to the intrinsic characteristics of SemComNet in terms of heterogeneous components, autonomous intelligence, and large-scale structure, a series of critical challenges emerge in securing SemComNet. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date survey of SemComNet from its fundamentals, security, and privacy aspects. Specifically, we first introduce a novel three-layer architecture of SemComNet for multi-agent interaction, which comprises the control layer, semantic transmission layer, and cognitive sensing layer. Then, we discuss its working modes and enabling technologies. Afterward, based on the layered architecture of SemComNet, we outline a taxonomy of security and privacy threats, while discussing state-of-the-art defense approaches. Finally, we present future research directions, clarifying the path toward building intelligent, robust, and green SemComNet. To our knowledge, this survey is the first to comprehensively cover the fundamentals of SemComNet, alongside a detailed analysis of its security and privacy issues.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Trade-off between Throughput and Reliability in a Bluetooth Low Energy Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Bluetooth Low Energy in low-range Internet of Things systems is growing exponentially. Similar to other wireless communication protocols, throughput and reliability are two key performance metrics in Bluetooth Low Energy communications. However, electromagnetic interference from various sources can heavily affect the performance of wireless devices, leading to dropped throughput and unreliable communication. Therefore, there is a need for both theoretical and practical studies capable of quantifying the BLE communication performance, e.g. throughput and reliability, subject to interference. In this paper, a mathematical model to predict throughput of a BLE connection under interference is derived first, and linked to the reliability model we developed in [1]. After that, extensive practical experiments are performed in various scenarios to sufficiently validate the theoretical results from both models. Finally, the trade-off between throughput and reliability is investigated through the validated models to give some inside properties of BLE communications. The similarity between the theoretical results and the experimental ones highlights the accuracy of the proposed throughput and reliability models. Hence, the two models can be used to explore the performance of various BLE designs or deployments from diverse perspectives.</description>

      <title>Core QUIC: Enabling Dynamic, Implementation-Agnostic Protocol Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While applications quickly evolve, Internet protocols do not follow the same pace. There are two root causes for this. First, extending protocol with cleartext control plane is usually hindered by various network devices such as middleboxes. Second, such extensions usually require support from all participating entities, but often these run different implementations, leading to the chicken-and-egg deployment issue. The recently standardized QUIC protocol paved the way for dealing with the first concern by embedding encryption by design. However, it attracted so much interest that there is now a large heterogeneity in QUIC implementations, hence amplifying the second problem.
  To get rid of these deployment issues and to enable inter-operable, implementation-independent innovation at transport layer, we propose a paradigm shift called Core QUIC. While Core QUIC keeps compliant with the standardized QUIC protocol, it enforces implementation architecture such that any Core QUIC-supporting participant can be extended with the same, generic bytecode. To achieve this, Core QUIC defines a standardized representation format of common QUIC structures on which plugins running in a controlled environment can operate to extend the underlying host implementation. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by making two implementations Core QUIC-compliant. Then, we show that we can extend both with the same plugin code over several use cases.</description>

      <title>Controlling Communications Quality in V2V Platooning: a TSN-like Slot-Based Scheduler Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected vehicles, facilitated by Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, play a key role in enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency. However, V2V communications primarily rely on wireless protocols, such as Wi-Fi, that require additional collision avoidance mechanisms to better ensure bounded latency and reliability in critical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to address the challenge of message collision in V2V platooning through a slotted-based solution inspired by Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), which is gaining momentum for in-vehicle networks. To this end, we present a controller, named TSNCtl, operating at the application level of the vehicular communications stack. TSNCtl employs a finite state machine (FSM) to manage platoon formation and slot-based scheduling for message dissemination. The reported evaluation results, based on the OMNeT++ simulation framework and INET library, demonstrate the effectiveness of TSNCtl in reducing packet collisions across various scenarios. Specifically, our experiments reveal a significant reduction in packet collisions compared to the CSMA-CA baseline used in traditional Wi-Fi-based protocols (e.g., IEEE 802.11p): for instance, with slot lengths of 2 ms, our solution achieves an average collision rate under 1%, compared to up to 50% for the baseline case.</description>

      <title>A Framework for the Systematic Assessment of Anomaly Detectors in Time-Sensitive Automotive Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connected cars are susceptible to cyberattacks. Security and safety of future vehicles highly depend on a holistic protection of automotive components, of which the time-sensitive backbone network takes a significant role. These onboard Time-Sensitive Networks (TSNs) require monitoring for safety and -- as versatile platforms to host Network Anomaly Detection Systems (NADSs) -- for security. Still a thorough evaluation of anomaly detection methods in the context of hard real-time operations, automotive protocol stacks, and domain specific attack vectors is missing along with appropriate input datasets. In this paper, we present an assessment framework that allows for reproducible, comparable, and rapid evaluation of detection algorithms. It is based on a simulation toolchain, which contributes configurable topologies, traffic streams, anomalies, attacks, and detectors. We demonstrate the assessment of NADSs in a comprehensive in-vehicular network with its communication flows, on which we model traffic anomalies. We evaluate exemplary detection mechanisms and reveal how the detection performance is influenced by different combinations of TSN traffic flows and anomaly types. Our approach translates to other real-time Ethernet domains, such as industrial facilities, airplanes, and UAVs.</description>

      <title>Closed-form congestion control via deep symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As mobile networks embrace the 5G era, the interest in adopting Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to handle challenges in ultra-low-latency and high throughput scenarios increases. Simultaneously, the advent of packetized fronthaul networks imposes demanding requirements that traditional congestion control mechanisms cannot accomplish, highlighting the potential of RL-based congestion control algorithms. Although learning RL policies optimized for satisfying the stringent fronthaul requirements is feasible, the adoption of neural network models in real deployments still poses some challenges regarding real-time inference and interpretability. This paper proposes a methodology to deal with such challenges while maintaining the performance and generalization capabilities provided by a baseline RL policy. The method consists of (1) training a congestion control policy specialized in fronthaul-like networks via reinforcement learning, (2) collecting state-action experiences from the baseline, and (3) performing deep symbolic regression on the collected dataset. The proposed process overcomes the challenges related to inference-time limitations through closed-form expressions that approximate the baseline performance (link utilization, delay, and fairness) and which can be directly implemented in any programming language. Finally, we analyze the inner workings of the closed-form expressions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Privacy Issues in Mission Critical Communication: Navigating 5G and Beyond Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mission critical communication (MCC) involves the exchange of information and data among emergency services, including the police, fire brigade, and other first responders, particularly during emergencies, disasters, or critical incidents. The widely-adopted TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio)-based communication for mission critical services faces challenges including limited data capacity, coverage limitations, spectrum congestion, and security concerns. Therefore, as an alternative, mission critical communication over cellular networks (4G and 5G) has emerged. While cellular-based MCC enables features like real-time video streaming and high-speed data transmission, the involvement of network operators and application service providers in the MCC architecture raises privacy concerns for mission critical users and services. For instance, the disclosure of a policeman's location details to the network operator raises privacy concerns. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work considers the privacy issues in mission critical system with respect to 5G and upcoming technologies. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse the 3GPP standardised MCC architecture within the context of 5G core network concepts and assess the privacy implications for MC users, network entities, and MC servers. The privacy analysis adheres to the deployment strategies in the standard for MCC. Additionally, we explore emerging 6G technologies, such as off-network communications, joint communication and sensing, and non-3GPP communications, to identify privacy challenges in MCC architecture. Finally, we propose privacy controls to establish a next-generation privacy-preserving MCC architecture.</description>

      <title>Delay and Overhead Efficient Transmission Scheduling for Federated Learning in UAV Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the wireless scheduling design to coordinate the transmissions of (local) model parameters of federated learning (FL) for a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The overall goal of the proposed design is to realize the FL training and aggregation processes with a central aggregator exploiting the sensory data collected by the UAVs but it considers the multi-hop wireless network formed by the UAVs. Such transmissions of model parameters over the UAV-based wireless network potentially cause large transmission delays and overhead. Our proposed framework smartly aggregates local model parameters trained by the UAVs while efficiently transmitting the underlying parameters to the central aggregator in each FL global round. We theoretically show that the proposed scheme achieves minimal delay and communication overhead. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared to other baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agile beam management is key for providing seamless millimeter wave (mm-wave) connectivity given the site-specific spatio-temporal variations of the mm-wave channel. Leveraging non radio frequency (RF) sensor inputs for environment awareness, e.g. via machine learning (ML) techniques, can greatly enhance RF-based beam steering. To overcome the lack of diverse publicly available multi-modal mm-wave datasets for the design and evaluation of such novel beam steering approaches, we demonstrate our software-defined radio multi-band mm-wave measurement platform which integrates multi-modal sensors towards environment-aware beam management.</description>

      <title>WHALE-FL: Wireless and Heterogeneity Aware Latency Efficient Federated Learning over Mobile Devices via Adaptive Subnetwork Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a popular distributed learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) over mobile devices fosters numerous applications, while their practical deployment is hindered by participating devices' computing and communication heterogeneity. Some pioneering research efforts proposed to extract subnetworks from the global model, and assign as large a subnetwork as possible to the device for local training based on its full computing and communications capacity. Although such fixed size subnetwork assignment enables FL training over heterogeneous mobile devices, it is unaware of (i) the dynamic changes of devices' communication and computing conditions and (ii) FL training progress and its dynamic requirements of local training contributions, both of which may cause very long FL training delay. Motivated by those dynamics, in this paper, we develop a wireless and heterogeneity aware latency efficient FL (WHALE-FL) approach to accelerate FL training through adaptive subnetwork scheduling. Instead of sticking to the fixed size subnetwork, WHALE-FL introduces a novel subnetwork selection utility function to capture device and FL training dynamics, and guides the mobile device to adaptively select the subnetwork size for local training based on (a) its computing and communication capacity, (b) its dynamic computing and/or communication conditions, and (c) FL training status and its corresponding requirements for local training contributions. Our evaluation shows that, compared with peer designs, WHALE-FL effectively accelerates FL training without sacrificing learning accuracy.</description>

      <title>An Online Gradient-Based Caching Policy with Logarithmic Complexity and Regret Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The commonly used caching policies, such as LRU or LFU, exhibit optimal performance only for specific traffic patterns. Even advanced Machine Learning-based methods, which detect patterns in historical request data, struggle when future requests deviate from past trends. Recently, a new class of policies has emerged that makes no assumptions about the request arrival process. These algorithms solve an online optimization problem, enabling continuous adaptation to the context. They offer theoretical guarantees on the regret metric, which is the gap between the gain of the online policy and the gain of the optimal static cache allocation in hindsight. Nevertheless, the high computational complexity of these solutions hinders their practical adoption. In this study, we introduce a groundbreaking gradient-based online caching policy, the first to achieve logarithmic computational complexity relative to catalog size along with regret guarantees. This means our algorithm can efficiently handle large-scale data while minimizing the performance gap between real-time decisions and optimal hindsight choices. As requests arrive, our policy dynamically adjusts the probabilities of including items in the cache, which drive cache update decisions. Our algorithm's streamlined complexity is a key advantage, enabling its application to real-world traces featuring millions of requests and items. This is a significant achievement, as traces of this scale have been out of reach for existing policies with regret guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, our experimental results show for the first time that the regret guarantees of gradient-based caching policies bring significant benefits in scenarios of practical interest.</description>

Abstract: Optical backbone networks are required to be highly dynamic in supporting requests with flexible bandwidth granularities to cope with the demands of new broadband wireless and fixed access networks. To provide this flexibility, services are offered by taking requested bandwidth profile into consideration, instead of assigning a fixed amount of bandwidth to each request. New techniques are developed for the resource management of the elastic optical networks to realize services with a specified bandwidth profile, consisting of minimum, average, and maximum required number of spectrum slots, in addition to holding time. In this work, two new schemes are proposed to realize such services, exploiting a probabilistic spectrum partitioning approach. This new probabilistic spectrum partitioning scheme is devised to enhance the chance of accommodating requests and consequently lower request blocking probability. It enforces different probabilities to contributing spectrum partitions in a certain service realization. Taking advantage of this probabilistic spectrum partitioning and a profile-based routing, we introduce two multistage spectrum assignment methods to make a certain lightpath meet the requested service profile constraints, considering the time-weighted average of the assigned spectrum slots. The results indicate that our algorithms can successfully realize the requests with the probability of 0.993 for the offered loads less than 400 erlang.</description>

      <title>Open RAN-empowered V2X Architecture: Challenges, Opportunities, and Research Directions</title>

Abstract: Advances in the automotive industry and the ever-increasing demand for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are pushing for a new epoch of networked wireless systems. Vehicular communications, or Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), are expected to be among the main actors of the future beyond 5G and 6G networks. However, the challenging application requirements, the fast variability of the vehicular environment, and the harsh propagation conditions of high frequencies call for sophisticated control mechanisms to ensure the success of such a disruptive technology. While traditional Radio Access Networks (RAN) lack the flexibility to support the required control primitives, the emergent concept of Open RAN (O-RAN) appears as an ideal enabler of V2X communication orchestration. However, effectively integrating the two ecosystems is still an open issue. This paper discusses possible integration strategies, highlighting the challenges and opportunities of leveraging O-RAN to enable real-time V2X control. Additionally, we enrich our discussion with potential research directions stemming from the current state-of-the-art, and we provide preliminary simulation results that validate the effectiveness of the proposed integration.</description>

      <title>Why E.T. Can't Phone Home: A Global View on IP-based Geoblocking at VoWiFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11759</link>

Abstract: In current cellular network generations (4G, 5G) the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) plays an integral role in terminating voice calls and short messages. Many operators use VoWiFi (Voice over Wi-Fi, also Wi-Fi calling) as an alternative network access technology to complement their cellular coverage in areas where no radio signal is available (e.g., rural territories or shielded buildings). In a mobile world where customers regularly traverse national borders, this can be used to avoid expensive international roaming fees while journeying overseas, since VoWiFi calls are usually invoiced at domestic rates. To not lose this revenue stream, some operators block access to the IMS for customers staying abroad.
  This work evaluates the current deployment status of VoWiFi among worldwide operators and analyzes existing geoblocking measures on the IP layer by measuring connectivity from over 200 countries. We show that a substantial share (IPv4: 14.6%, IPv6: 65.2%) of operators implement geoblocking at the DNS- or VoWiFi protocol level, and highlight severe drawbacks in terms of emergency calling service availability.</description>

      <title>FlagVNE: A Flexible and Generalizable Reinforcement Learning Framework for Network Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12633</link>

Abstract: Virtual network embedding (VNE) is an essential resource allocation task in network virtualization, aiming to map virtual network requests (VNRs) onto physical infrastructure. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution to this problem. However, existing RL-based VNE methods are limited by the unidirectional action design and one-size-fits-all training strategy, resulting in restricted searchability and generalizability. In this paper, we propose a FLexible And Generalizable RL framework for VNE, named FlagVNE. Specifically, we design a bidirectional action-based Markov decision process model that enables the joint selection of virtual and physical nodes, thus improving the exploration flexibility of solution space. To tackle the expansive and dynamic action space, we design a hierarchical decoder to generate adaptive action probability distributions and ensure high training efficiency. Furthermore, to overcome the generalization issue for varying VNR sizes, we propose a meta-RL-based training method with a curriculum scheduling strategy, facilitating specialized policy training for each VNR size. Finally, extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of FlagVNE across multiple key metrics. Our code is available at GitHub (https://github.com/GeminiLight/flag-vne).</description>
