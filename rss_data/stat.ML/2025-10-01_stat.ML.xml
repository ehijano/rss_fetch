      <title>Neural Optimal Transport Meets Multivariate Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for conditional vector quantile regression (CVQR) that combines neural optimal transport with amortized optimization, and apply it to multivariate conformal prediction. Classical quantile regression does not extend naturally to multivariate responses, while existing approaches often ignore the geometry of joint distributions. Our method parametrizes the conditional vector quantile function as the gradient of a convex potential implemented by an input-convex neural network, ensuring monotonicity and uniform ranks. To reduce the cost of solving high-dimensional variational problems, we introduced amortized optimization of the dual potentials, yielding efficient training and faster inference. We then exploit the induced multivariate ranks for conformal prediction, constructing distribution-free predictive regions with finite-sample validity. Unlike coordinatewise methods, our approach adapts to the geometry of the conditional distribution, producing tighter and more informative regions. Experiments on benchmark datasets show improved coverage-efficiency trade-offs compared to baselines, highlighting the benefits of integrating neural optimal transport with conformal prediction.</description>

      <title>Fair Classification by Direct Intervention on Operating Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop new classifiers under group fairness in the attribute-aware setting for binary classification with multiple group fairness constraints (e.g., demographic parity (DP), equalized odds (EO), and predictive parity (PP)). We propose a novel approach, applicable to linear fractional constraints, based on directly intervening on the operating characteristics of a pre-trained base classifier, by (i) identifying optimal operating characteristics using the base classifier's group-wise ROC convex hulls and (ii) post-processing the base classifier to match those targets. As practical post-processors, we consider randomizing a mixture of group-wise thresholding rules subject to minimizing the expected number of interventions. We further extend our approach to handle multiple protected attributes and multiple linear fractional constraints. On standard datasets (COMPAS and ACSIncome), our methods simultaneously satisfy approximate DP, EO, and PP with few interventions and a near-oracle drop in accuracy; comparing favorably to previous methods.</description>

      <title>One-shot Conditional Sampling: MMD meets Nearest Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How can we generate samples from a conditional distribution that we never fully observe? This question arises across a broad range of applications in both modern machine learning and classical statistics, including image post-processing in computer vision, approximate posterior sampling in simulation-based inference, and conditional distribution modeling in complex data settings. In such settings, compared with unconditional sampling, additional feature information can be leveraged to enable more adaptive and efficient sampling. Building on this, we introduce Conditional Generator using MMD (CGMMD), a novel framework for conditional sampling. Unlike many contemporary approaches, our method frames the training objective as a simple, adversary-free direct minimization problem. A key feature of CGMMD is its ability to produce conditional samples in a single forward pass of the generator, enabling practical one-shot sampling with low test-time complexity. We establish rigorous theoretical bounds on the loss incurred when sampling from the CGMMD sampler, and prove convergence of the estimated distribution to the true conditional distribution. In the process, we also develop a uniform concentration result for nearest-neighbor based functionals, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we show that CGMMD performs competitively on synthetic tasks involving complex conditional densities, as well as on practical applications such as image denoising and image super-resolution.</description>

      <title>Conservative Decisions with Risk Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In binary classification applications, conservative decision-making that allows for abstention can be advantageous. To this end, we introduce a novel approach that determines the optimal cutoff interval for risk scores, which can be directly available or derived from fitted models. Within this interval, the algorithm refrains from making decisions, while outside the interval, classification accuracy is maximized. Our approach is inspired by support vector machines (SVM), but differs in that it minimizes the classification margin rather than maximizing it. We provide the theoretical optimal solution to this problem, which holds important practical implications. Our proposed method not only supports conservative decision-making but also inherently results in a risk-coverage curve. Together with the area under the curve (AUC), this curve can serve as a comprehensive performance metric for evaluating and comparing classifiers, akin to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. To investigate and illustrate our approach, we conduct both simulation studies and a real-world case study in the context of diagnosing prostate cancer.</description>

      <title>Coupling Generative Modeling and an Autoencoder with the Causal Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider inferring the causal effect of a treatment (intervention) on an outcome of interest in situations where there is potentially an unobserved confounder influencing both the treatment and the outcome. This is achievable by assuming access to two separate sets of control (proxy) measurements associated with treatment and outcomes, which are used to estimate treatment effects through a function termed the em causal bridge (CB). We present a new theoretical perspective, associated assumptions for when estimating treatment effects with the CB is feasible, and a bound on the average error of the treatment effect when the CB assumptions are violated. From this new perspective, we then demonstrate how coupling the CB with an autoencoder architecture allows for the sharing of statistical strength between observed quantities (proxies, treatment, and outcomes), thus improving the quality of the CB estimates. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in relation to the state-of-the-art methodology for proxy measurements.</description>

      <title>When Langevin Monte Carlo Meets Randomization: Non-asymptotic Error Bounds beyond Log-Concavity and Gradient Lipschitzness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient sampling from complex and high dimensional target distributions turns out to be a fundamental task in diverse disciplines such as scientific computing, statistics and machine learning. In this paper, we revisit the randomized Langevin Monte Carlo (RLMC) for sampling from high dimensional distributions without log-concavity. Under the gradient Lipschitz condition and the log-Sobolev inequality, we prove a uniform-in-time error bound in $\mathcal{W}_2$-distance of order $O(\sqrt{d}h)$ for the RLMC sampling algorithm, which matches the best one in the literature under the log-concavity condition. Moreover, when the gradient of the potential $U$ is non-globally Lipschitz with superlinear growth, modified RLMC algorithms are proposed and analyzed, with non-asymptotic error bounds established. To the best of our knowledge, the modified RLMC algorithms and their non-asymptotic error bounds are new in the non-globally Lipschitz setting.</description>

      <title>Test time training enhances in-context learning of nonlinear functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time training (TTT) enhances model performance by explicitly updating designated parameters prior to each prediction to adapt to the test data. While TTT has demonstrated considerable empirical success, its theoretical underpinnings remain limited, particularly for nonlinear models. In this paper, we investigate the combination of TTT with in-context learning (ICL), where the model is given a few examples from the target distribution at inference time. We analyze this framework in the setting of single-index models $y=\sigma_*(\langle \beta, \mathbf{x} \rangle)$, where the feature vector $\beta$ is drawn from a hidden low-dimensional subspace. For single-layer transformers trained with gradient-based algorithms and adopting TTT, we establish an upper bound on the prediction risk. Our theory reveals that TTT enables the single-layer transformers to adapt to both the feature vector $\beta$ and the link function $\sigma_*$, which vary across tasks. This creates a sharp contrast with ICL alone, which is theoretically difficult to adapt to shifts in the link function. Moreover, we provide the convergence rate with respect to the data length, showing the predictive error can be driven arbitrarily close to the noise level as the context size and the network width grow.</description>

      <title>Sharpness of Minima in Deep Matrix Factorization: Exact Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the geometry of the loss landscape near a minimum is key to explaining the implicit bias of gradient-based methods in non-convex optimization problems such as deep neural network training and deep matrix factorization. A central quantity to characterize this geometry is the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the loss, which measures the sharpness of the landscape. Currently, its precise role has been obfuscated because no exact expressions for this sharpness measure were known in general settings. In this paper, we present the first exact expression for the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the squared-error loss at any minimizer in general overparameterized deep matrix factorization (i.e., deep linear neural network training) problems, resolving an open question posed by Mulayoff &amp; Michaeli (2020). To complement our theory, we empirically investigate an escape phenomenon observed during gradient-based training near a minimum that crucially relies on our exact expression of the sharpness.</description>

      <title>Graph Distribution-valued Signals: A Wasserstein Space Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for graph signal processing (GSP) that models signals as graph distribution-valued signals (GDSs), which are probability distributions in the Wasserstein space. This approach overcomes key limitations of classical vector-based GSP, including the assumption of synchronous observations over vertices, the inability to capture uncertainty, and the requirement for strict correspondence in graph filtering. By representing signals as distributions, GDSs naturally encode uncertainty and stochasticity, while strictly generalizing traditional graph signals. We establish a systematic dictionary mapping core GSP concepts to their GDS counterparts, demonstrating that classical definitions are recovered as special cases. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through graph filter learning for prediction tasks, supported by experimental results.</description>

      <title>BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories under Spatio-Temporal Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a formal active learning methodology for guiding the placement of Lagrangian observers to infer time-dependent vector fields -- a key task in oceanography, marine science, and ocean engineering -- using a physics-informed spatio-temporal Gaussian process surrogate model. The majority of existing placement campaigns either follow standard `space-filling' designs or relatively ad-hoc expert opinions. A key challenge to applying principled active learning in this setting is that Lagrangian observers are continuously advected through the vector field, so they make measurements at different locations and times. It is, therefore, important to consider the likely future trajectories of placed observers to account for the utility of candidate placement locations. To this end, we present BALLAST: Bayesian Active Learning with Look-ahead Amendment for Sea-drifter Trajectories. We observe noticeable benefits of BALLAST-aided sequential observer placement strategies on both synthetic and high-fidelity ocean current models.</description>

      <title>Non-Vacuous Generalization Bounds: Can Rescaling Invariances Help?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in understanding generalization is to obtain non-vacuous guarantees that go beyond worst-case complexity over data or weight space. Among existing approaches, PAC-Bayes bounds stand out as they can provide tight, data-dependent guarantees even for large networks. However, in ReLU networks, rescaling invariances mean that different weight distributions can represent the same function while leading to arbitrarily different PAC-Bayes complexities. We propose to study PAC-Bayes bounds in an invariant, lifted representation that resolves this discrepancy. This paper explores both the guarantees provided by this approach (invariance, tighter bounds via data processing) and the algorithmic aspects of KL-based rescaling-invariant PAC-Bayes bounds.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap of Metropolis-within-Gibbs under log-concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Metropolis-within-Gibbs (MwG) algorithm is a widely used Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for sampling from high-dimensional distributions when exact conditional sampling is intractable. We study MwG with Random Walk Metropolis (RWM) updates, using proposal variances tuned to match the target's conditional variances. Assuming the target $\pi$ is a $d$-dimensional log-concave distribution with condition number $\kappa$, we establish a spectral gap lower bound of order $\mathcal{O}(1/\kappa d)$ for the random-scan version of MwG, improving on the previously available $\mathcal{O}(1/\kappa^2 d)$ bound. This is obtained by developing sharp estimates of the conductance of one-dimensional RWM kernels, which can be of independent interest. The result shows that MwG can mix substantially faster with variance-adaptive proposals and that its mixing performance is just a constant factor worse than that of the exact Gibbs sampler, thus providing theoretical support to previously observed empirical behavior.</description>

      <title>An Orthogonal Learner for Individualized Outcomes in Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting individualized potential outcomes in sequential decision-making is central for optimizing therapeutic decisions in personalized medicine (e.g., which dosing sequence to give to a cancer patient). However, predicting potential outcomes over long horizons is notoriously difficult. Existing methods that break the curse of the horizon typically lack strong theoretical guarantees such as orthogonality and quasi-oracle efficiency. In this paper, we revisit the problem of predicting individualized potential outcomes in sequential decision-making (i.e., estimating Q-functions in Markov decision processes with observational data) through a causal inference lens. In particular, we develop a comprehensive theoretical foundation for meta-learners in this setting with a focus on beneficial theoretical properties. As a result, we yield a novel meta-learner called DRQ-learner and establish that it is: (1) doubly robust (i.e., valid inference under the misspecification of one of the nuisances), (2) Neyman-orthogonal (i.e., insensitive to first-order estimation errors in the nuisance functions), and (3) achieves quasi-oracle efficiency (i.e., behaves asymptotically as if the ground-truth nuisance functions were known). Our DRQ-learner is applicable to settings with both discrete and continuous state spaces. Further, our DRQ-learner is flexible and can be used together with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., neural networks). We validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments, thereby showing that our meta-learner outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Pretrain-Test Task Alignment Governs Generalization in In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a central capability of Transformer models, but the structures in data that enable its emergence and govern its robustness remain poorly understood. In this work, we study how the structure of pretraining tasks governs generalization in ICL. Using a solvable model for ICL of linear regression by linear attention, we derive an exact expression for ICL generalization error in high dimensions under arbitrary pretraining-testing task covariance mismatch. This leads to a new alignment measure that quantifies how much information about the pretraining task distribution is useful for inference at test time. We show that this measure directly predicts ICL performance not only in the solvable model but also in nonlinear Transformers. Our analysis further reveals a tradeoff between specialization and generalization in ICL: depending on task distribution alignment, increasing pretraining task diversity can either improve or harm test performance. Together, these results identify train-test task alignment as a key determinant of generalization in ICL.</description>

      <title>Estimating Dimensionality of Neural Representations from Finite Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global dimensionality of a neural representation manifold provides rich insight into the computational process underlying both artificial and biological neural networks. However, all existing measures of global dimensionality are sensitive to the number of samples, i.e., the number of rows and columns of the sample matrix. We show that, in particular, the participation ratio of eigenvalues, a popular measure of global dimensionality, is highly biased with small sample sizes, and propose a bias-corrected estimator that is more accurate with finite samples and with noise. On synthetic data examples, we demonstrate that our estimator can recover the true known dimensionality. We apply our estimator to neural brain recordings, including calcium imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and fMRI data, and to the neural activations in a large language model and show our estimator is invariant to the sample size. Finally, our estimators can additionally be used to measure the local dimensionalities of curved neural manifolds by weighting the finite samples appropriately.</description>

      <title>Anomaly detection by partitioning of multi-variate time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant improvement in anomaly detection performance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Double Descent in Machine Learning: Insights from Tree-Based Models Applied to a Genomic Prediction Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical learning theory describes a well-characterised U-shaped relationship between model complexity and prediction error, reflecting a transition from underfitting in underparameterised regimes to overfitting as complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work, we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity (e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour.

      <title>How Effective Are Time-Series Models for Rainfall Nowcasting? A Comprehensive Benchmark for Rainfall Nowcasting Incorporating PWV Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning. However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation, temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/RainfallBench-A710.</description>

      <title>MAESTRO : Adaptive Sparse Attention and Robust Learning for Multimodal Dynamic Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large (making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra- and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4% and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches, respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement. Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent with Large Step Sizes: Chaos and Fractal Convergence Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases, such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.</description>

Abstract: We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot navigation task, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a continuous-valued observation space with bounded continuous-valued actions. Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching with Semidiscrete Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points $(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned, on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT) solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly, which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle. Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring $O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.</description>

      <title>Meta-Router: Bridging Gold-standard and Preference-based Evaluations in Large Language Model Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model (LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off between cost and quality.</description>

      <title>Optimal Nuisance Function Tuning for Estimating a Doubly Robust Functional under Proportional Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the asymptotically optimal tuning parameter choice in ridge regression for estimating nuisance functions of a statistical functional that has recently gained prominence in conditional independence testing and causal inference. Given a sample of size $n$, we study estimators of the Expected Conditional Covariance (ECC) between variables $Y$ and $A$ given a high-dimensional covariate $X \in \mathbb{R}^p$. Under linear regression models for $Y$ and $A$ on $X$ and the proportional asymptotic regime $p/n \to c \in (0, \infty)$, we evaluate three existing ECC estimators and two sample splitting strategies for estimating the required nuisance functions. Since no consistent estimator of the nuisance functions exists in the proportional asymptotic regime without imposing further structure on the problem, we first derive debiased versions of the ECC estimators that utilize the ridge regression nuisance function estimators. We show that our bias correction strategy yields $\sqrt{n}$-consistent estimators of the ECC across different sample splitting strategies and estimator choices. We then derive the asymptotic variances of these debiased estimators to illustrate the nuanced interplay between the sample splitting strategy, estimator choice, and tuning parameters of the nuisance function estimators for optimally estimating the ECC. Our analysis reveals that prediction-optimal tuning parameters (i.e., those that optimally estimate the nuisance functions) may not lead to the lowest asymptotic variance of the ECC estimator -- thereby demonstrating the need to be careful in selecting tuning parameters based on the final goal of inference. Finally, we verify our theoretical results through extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Transformers through the lens of support-preserving maps between measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity, proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work, we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand, these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type, for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with a Vlasov flow.</description>

      <title>BaB-prob: Branch and Bound with Preactivation Splitting for Probabilistic Verification of Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models, respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to high-dimensional input problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain shift by selectively querying human annotations at deployment, but existing methods use heuristic uncertainty measures and suffer from low data selection efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage, a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/tingyushi/CPATTA.</description>

      <title>Online Decision Making with Generative Action Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones, further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action spaces.</description>

      <title>Learning to Reason as Action Abstractions with Scalable Mid-Training RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Asynchronous Multi-player Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times, and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$, where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its applicability to real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Informed Asymmetric Actor-Critic: Leveraging Privileged Signals Beyond Full-State Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are both practical and theoretically sound.</description>

      <title>EVODiff: Entropy-aware Variance Optimized Diffusion Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\% (from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

      <title>Sandbagging in a Simple Survival Bandit Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of frontier model evaluations.</description>

      <title>EnScale: Temporally-consistent multivariate generative downscaling via proper scoring rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The practical use of future climate projections from global circulation models (GCMs) is often limited by their coarse spatial resolution, requiring downscaling to generate high-resolution data. Regional climate models (RCMs) provide this refinement, but are computationally expensive. To address this issue, machine learning models can learn the downscaling function, mapping coarse GCM outputs to high-resolution fields. Among these, generative approaches aim to capture the full conditional distribution of RCM data given coarse-scale GCM data, which is characterized by large variability and thus challenging to model accurately. We introduce EnScale, a generative machine learning framework that emulates the full GCM-to-RCM map by training on multiple pairs of GCM and corresponding RCM data. It first adjusts large-scale mismatches between GCM and coarsened RCM data, followed by a super-resolution step to generate high-resolution fields. Both steps employ generative models optimized with the energy score, a proper scoring rule. Compared to state-of-the-art ML downscaling approaches, our setup reduces computational cost by about one order of magnitude. EnScale jointly emulates multiple variables -- temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind -- spatially consistent over an area in Central Europe. In addition, we propose a variant EnScale-t that enables temporally consistent downscaling. We establish a comprehensive evaluation framework across various categories including calibration, spatial structure, extremes, and multivariate dependencies. Comparison with diverse benchmarks demonstrates EnScale's strong performance and computational efficiency. EnScale offers a promising approach for accurate and temporally consistent RCM emulation.</description>

      <title>Staged Event Trees for Transparent Treatment Effect Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Average and conditional treatment effects are fundamental causal quantities used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments in various critical applications, including clinical settings and policy-making. Beyond the gold-standard estimators from randomized trials, numerous methods have been proposed to estimate treatment effects using observational data. In this paper, we provide a novel characterization of widely used causal inference techniques within the framework of staged event trees, demonstrating their capacity to enhance treatment effect estimation. These models offer a distinct advantage due to their interpretability, making them particularly valuable for practical applications. We implement classical estimators within the framework of staged event trees and illustrate their capabilities through both simulation studies and real-world applications. Furthermore, we showcase how staged event trees explicitly and visually describe when standard causal assumptions, such as positivity, hold, further enhancing their practical utility.</description>

      <title>ACE: Adapting sampling for Counterfactual Explanations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier. Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable changes.</description>

      <title>Vector-Valued Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces for Neural Networks and Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in characterizing the function spaces underlying neural networks. While shallow and deep scalar-valued neural networks have been linked to scalar-valued reproducing kernel Banach spaces (RKBS), $\R^d$-valued neural networks and neural operator models remain less understood in the RKBS setting. To address this gap, we develop a general definition of vector-valued RKBS (vv-RKBS), which inherently includes the associated reproducing kernel. Our construction extends existing definitions by avoiding restrictive assumptions such as symmetric kernel domains, finite-dimensional output spaces, reflexivity, or separability, while still recovering familiar properties of vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (vv-RKHS). We then show that shallow $\R^d$-valued neural networks are elements of a specific vv-RKBS, namely an instance of the integral and neural vv-RKBS. To also explore the functional structure of neural operators, we analyze the DeepONet and Hypernetwork architectures and demonstrate that they too belong to an integral and neural vv-RKBS. In all cases, we establish a Representer Theorem, showing that optimization over these function spaces recovers the corresponding neural architectures.</description>

      <title>The Dragon Hatchling: The Missing Link between the Transformer and Models of the Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between computing systems and the brain has served as motivation for pioneering theoreticians since John von Neumann and Alan Turing. Uniform, scale-free biological networks, such as the brain, have powerful properties, including generalizing over time, which is the main barrier for Machine Learning on the path to Universal Reasoning Models.
  We introduce `Dragon Hatchling' (BDH), a new Large Language Model architecture based on a scale-free biologically inspired network of \$n\$ locally-interacting neuron particles. BDH couples strong theoretical foundations and inherent interpretability without sacrificing Transformer-like performance.
  BDH is a practical, performant state-of-the-art attention-based state space sequence learning architecture. In addition to being a graph model, BDH admits a GPU-friendly formulation. It exhibits Transformer-like scaling laws: empirically BDH rivals GPT2 performance on language and translation tasks, at the same number of parameters (10M to 1B), for the same training data.
  BDH can be represented as a brain model. The working memory of BDH during inference entirely relies on synaptic plasticity with Hebbian learning using spiking neurons. We confirm empirically that specific, individual synapses strengthen connection whenever BDH hears or reasons about a specific concept while processing language inputs. The neuron interaction network of BDH is a graph of high modularity with heavy-tailed degree distribution. The BDH model is biologically plausible, explaining one possible mechanism which human neurons could use to achieve speech.
  BDH is designed for interpretability. Activation vectors of BDH are sparse and positive. We demonstrate monosemanticity in BDH on language tasks. Interpretability of state, which goes beyond interpretability of neurons and model parameters, is an inherent feature of the BDH architecture.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fairness-Performance Pareto Front Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a well known intrinsic trade-off between the fairness of a representation and the performance of classifiers derived from the representation. Due to the complexity of optimisation algorithms in most modern representation learning approaches, for a given method it may be non-trivial to decide whether the obtained fairness-performance curve of the method is optimal, i.e., whether it is close to the true Pareto front for these quantities for the underlying data distribution.
  In this paper we propose a new method to compute the optimal Pareto front, which does not require the training of complex representation models. We show that optimal fair representations possess several useful structural properties, and that these properties enable a reduction of the computation of the Pareto Front to a compact discrete problem. We then also show that these compact approximating problems can be efficiently solved via off-the shelf concave-convex programming methods.
  Since our approach is independent of the specific model of representations, it may be used as the benchmark to which representation learning algorithms may be compared. We experimentally evaluate the approach on a number of real world benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>Complexity Analysis of Normalizing Constant Estimation: from Jarzynski Equality to Annealed Importance Sampling and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an unnormalized probability density $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-V}$, estimating its normalizing constant $Z=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\mathrm{e}^{-V(x)}\mathrm{d}x$ or free energy $F=-\log Z$ is a crucial problem in Bayesian statistics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning. It is challenging especially in high dimensions or when $\pi$ is multimodal. To mitigate the high variance of conventional importance sampling estimators, annealing-based methods such as Jarzynski equality and annealed importance sampling are commonly adopted, yet their quantitative complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. We take a first step toward a non-asymptotic analysis of annealed importance sampling. In particular, we derive an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\beta^2{\mathcal{A}}^2}{\varepsilon^4}\right)$ for estimating $Z$ within $\varepsilon$ relative error with high probability, where $\beta$ is the smoothness of $V$ and $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the action of a curve of probability measures interpolating $\pi$ and a tractable reference distribution. Our analysis, leveraging Girsanov theorem and optimal transport, does not explicitly require isoperimetric assumptions on the target distribution. Finally, to tackle the large action of the widely used geometric interpolation, we propose a new algorithm based on reverse diffusion samplers, establish a framework for analyzing its complexity, and empirically demonstrate its efficiency in tackling multimodality.</description>

      <title>A Review on Riemannian Metric Learning: Closer to You than You Imagine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Riemannian metric learning is an emerging field in machine learning, unlocking new ways to encode complex data structures beyond traditional distance metric learning. While classical approaches rely on global distances in Euclidean space, they often fall short in capturing intrinsic data geometry. Enter Riemannian metric learning: a powerful generalization that leverages differential geometry to model the data according to their underlying Riemannian manifold. This approach has demonstrated remarkable success across diverse domains, from causal inference and optimal transport to generative modeling and representation learning. In this review, we bridge the gap between classical metric learning and Riemannian geometry, providing a structured and accessible overview of key methods, applications, and recent advances. We argue that Riemannian metric learning is not merely a technical refinement but a fundamental shift in how we think about data representations. Thus, this review should serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in exploring Riemannian metric learning and convince them that it is closer to them than they might imagine-both in theory and in practice.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Diffusion Model in High Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curse of Dimensionality is an unavoidable challenge in statistical probability models, yet diffusion models seem to overcome this limitation, achieving impressive results in high-dimensional data generation. Diffusion models assume that they can learn the statistical quantities of the underlying probability distribution, enabling sampling from this distribution to generate realistic samples. But is this really how they work? We argue not, based on the following observations: 1) In high-dimensional sparse scenarios, the fitting target of the diffusion model's objective function degrades from a weighted sum of multiple samples to a single sample, which we believe hinders the model's ability to effectively learn essential statistical quantities such as posterior, score, or velocity field. 2) Most inference methods can be unified within a simple framework which involves no statistical concepts, aligns with the degraded objective function, and provides an novel and intuitive perspective on the inference process.</description>

      <title>Fast Likelihood-Free Parameter Estimation for L\'evy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: L\'evy processes are widely used in financial modeling due to their ability to capture discontinuities and heavy tails, which are common in high-frequency asset return data. However, parameter estimation remains a challenge when associated likelihoods are unavailable or costly to compute. We propose a fast and accurate method for L\'evy parameter estimation using the neural Bayes estimation (NBE) framework -- a simulation-based, likelihood-free approach that leverages permutation-invariant neural networks to approximate Bayes estimators. We contribute new theoretical results, showing that NBE results in consistent estimators whose risk converges to the Bayes estimator under mild conditions. Moreover, through extensive simulations across several L\'evy models, we show that NBE outperforms traditional methods in both accuracy and runtime, while also enabling two complementary approaches to uncertainty quantification. We illustrate our approach on a challenging high-frequency cryptocurrency return dataset, where the method captures evolving parameter dynamics and delivers reliable and interpretable inference at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. NBE provides a scalable and practical solution for inference in complex financial models, enabling parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification over an entire year of data in just seconds. We additionally investigate nearly a decade of high-frequency Bitcoin returns, requiring less than one minute to estimate parameters under the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Copula Based Supervised Filter for Feature Selection in Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective feature selection is critical for building robust and interpretable predictive models, particularly in medical applications where identifying risk factors in the most extreme patient strata is essential. Traditional methods often focus on average associations, potentially overlooking predictors whose importance is concentrated in the tails of the data distribution. In this study, we introduce a novel, computationally efficient supervised filter method that leverages the Gumbel copula's upper-tail dependence coefficient to rank features based on their tendency to be simultaneously extreme with a positive outcome. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of this method against four standard baselines (Mutual Information, mRMR, ReliefF, and L1/Elastic-Net) using four distinct classifiers on two diabetes datasets: a large-scale public health survey (CDC, N=253,680) and a classic clinical benchmark (PIMA, N=768). Our analysis included comprehensive statistical tests, permutation importance, and robustness checks. On the CDC dataset, our method was the fastest selector and reduced the feature space by approximately 52% while maintaining predictive performance statistically indistinguishable from a model using all features. On the PIMA dataset, our method's feature ranking yielded the single best-performing model, achieving the highest ROC-AUC of all tested configurations. Across both datasets, the Gumbel-upper-tail dependence coefficient selector consistently identified clinically coherent and impactful predictors. We conclude that feature selection via upper-tail dependence is a powerful, efficient, and interpretable new tool for developing risk models in public health and clinical medicine.</description>

      <title>TADA: Improved Diffusion Sampling with Training-free Augmented Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating high-fidelity images but typically suffer from inefficient sampling. Many solver designs and noise scheduling strategies have been proposed to dramatically improve sampling speeds. In this paper, we introduce a new sampling method that is up to $186\%$ faster than the current state of the art solver for comparative FID on ImageNet512. This new sampling method is training-free and uses an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. The key to our method resides in using higher-dimensional initial noise, allowing to produce more detailed samples with less function evaluations from existing pretrained diffusion models. In addition, by design our solver allows to control the level of detail through a simple hyper-parameter at no extra computational cost. We present how our approach leverages momentum dynamics by establishing a fundamental equivalence between momentum diffusion models and conventional diffusion models with respect to their training paradigms. Moreover, we observe the use of higher-dimensional noise naturally exhibits characteristics similar to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Finally, we demonstrate strong performances on a set of representative pretrained diffusion models, including EDM, EDM2, and Stable-Diffusion 3, which cover models in both pixel and latent spaces, as well as class and text conditional settings.

      <title>Regret Analysis of Posterior Sampling-Based Expected Improvement for Bayesian Optimization</title>

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for optimizing an expensive-to-evaluate black-box function. In particular, the effectiveness of expected improvement (EI) has been demonstrated in a wide range of applications. However, theoretical analyses of EI are limited compared with other theoretically established algorithms. This paper analyzes a randomized variant of EI, which evaluates the EI from the maximum of the posterior sample path. We show that this posterior sampling-based random EI achieves the sublinear Bayesian cumulative regret bounds under the assumption that the black-box function follows a Gaussian process. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>MIBoost: A Gradient Boosting Algorithm for Variable Selection After Multiple Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical learning methods for automated variable selection, such as LASSO, elastic nets, or gradient boosting, have become increasingly popular tools for building powerful prediction models. Yet, in practice, analyses are often complicated by missing data. The most widely used approach to address missingness is multiple imputation, which involves creating several completed datasets. However, there is an ongoing debate on how to perform model selection in the presence of multiple imputed datasets. Simple strategies, such as pooling models across datasets, have been shown to have suboptimal properties. Although more sophisticated methods exist, they are often difficult to implement and therefore not widely applied. In contrast, two recent approaches modify the regularization methods LASSO and elastic nets by defining a single loss function, resulting in a unified set of coefficients across imputations. Our key contribution is to extend this principle to the framework of component-wise gradient boosting by proposing MIBoost, a novel algorithm that employs a uniform variable-selection mechanism across imputed datasets. Simulation studies suggest that our approach yields prediction performance comparable to that of these recently proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Improving Shampoo and SOAP via Kullback-Leibler Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shampoo and its efficient variant, SOAP, use structured second-moment estimation and have attracted growing interest for their effectiveness in training neural networks (NNs). In practice, Shampoo requires step-size grafting with Adam to achieve competitive performance. SOAP mitigates this by applying Adam in Shampoo's eigenbasis and further reducing per-iteration runtime. However, reliance on Adam introduces additional memory overhead in both methods. Prior theoretical interpretations have primarily examined their estimation schemes using the Frobenius norm. Motivated by the natural correspondence between the second moment and a covariance matrix, we reinterpret the estimation procedures in Shampoo and SOAP as instances of covariance estimation through the lens of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization. This perspective reveals a previously overlooked theoretical limitation and motivates principled improvements to their design. Building on the KL perspective, we propose practical estimation schemes -- $\textbf{KL-Shampoo}$ and $\textbf{KL-SOAP}$ -- that match or exceed the performance of Shampoo and SOAP for pre-training various NNs while maintaining SOAP-level per-iteration runtime. Notably, KL-Shampoo does not rely on Adam to achieve superior performance, thereby avoiding the associated memory overhead. Surprisingly, KL-Shampoo consistently outperforms the other methods in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Max-Sliced Wasserstein Distance and its use for GANs</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.05877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial nets (GANs) and variational auto-encoders have significantly improved our distribution modeling capabilities, showing promise for dataset augmentation, image-to-image translation and feature learning. However, to model high-dimensional distributions, sequential training and stacked architectures are common, increasing the number of tunable hyper-parameters as well as the training time. Nonetheless, the sample complexity of the distance metrics remains one of the factors affecting GAN training. We first show that the recently proposed sliced Wasserstein distance has compelling sample complexity properties when compared to the Wasserstein distance. To further improve the sliced Wasserstein distance we then analyze its `projection complexity' and develop the max-sliced Wasserstein distance which enjoys compelling sample complexity while reducing projection complexity, albeit necessitating a max estimation. We finally illustrate that the proposed distance trains GANs on high-dimensional images up to a resolution of 256x256 easily.</description>

      <title>A unified error analysis for randomized low-rank approximation with application to data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized algorithms have proven to perform well on a large class of numerical linear algebra problems. Their theoretical analysis is critical to provide guarantees on their behaviour, and in this sense, the stochastic analysis of the randomized low-rank approximation error plays a central role. Indeed, several randomized methods for the approximation of dominant eigen- or singular modes can be rewritten as low-rank approximation methods. However, despite the large variety of algorithms, the existing theoretical frameworks for their analysis rely on a specific structure for the covariance matrix that is not adapted to all the algorithms. We propose a unified framework for the stochastic analysis of the low-rank approximation error in Frobenius norm for centered and non-standard Gaussian matrices. Under minimal assumptions on the covariance matrix, we derive accurate bounds both in expectation and probability. Our bounds have clear interpretations that enable us to derive properties and motivate practical choices for the covariance matrix resulting in efficient low-rank approximation algorithms. The most commonly used bounds in the literature have been demonstrated as a specific instance of the bounds proposed here, with the additional contribution of being tighter. Numerical experiments related to data assimilation further illustrate that exploiting the problem structure to select the covariance matrix improves the performance as suggested by our bounds.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Targeted Cause Discovery via Learning from Simulated Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning approach for inferring causal variables of a target variable from observations. Our focus is on directly inferring a set of causal factors without requiring full causal graph reconstruction, which is computationally challenging in large-scale systems. The identified causal set consists of all potential regulators of the target variable under experimental settings, enabling efficient regulation through intervention. To achieve this, we train a neural network using supervised learning on simulated data to infer causality. By employing a subsampled-ensemble inference strategy, our approach scales with linear complexity in the number of variables, efficiently scaling up to thousands of variables. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance in identifying causal relationships within large-scale gene regulatory networks, outperforming existing methods that emphasize full-graph discovery. We validate our model's generalization capability across out-of-distribution graph structures and generating mechanisms, including gene regulatory networks of E. coli and the human K562 cell line. Implementation codes are available at https://github.com/snu-mllab/Targeted-Cause-Discovery.</description>

      <title>Performance of the empirical median for location estimation in heteroscedastic settings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of the empirical median for location estimation in heteroscedastic settings. Specifically, we consider independent symmetric real-valued random variables that share a common but unknown location parameter while having different and unknown scale parameters. Estimation under heteroscedasticity arises naturally in many practical situations and has recently attracted considerable attention. In this work, we analyze the empirical median as an estimator of the common location parameter and derive matching non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds on its estimation error. These results fully characterize the behavior of the empirical median in heteroscedastic settings, clarifying both its robustness and its intrinsic limitations and offering a precise understanding of its performance in modern settings where data quality may vary across sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Inverse Drum Machine, a novel approach to Drum Source Separation that leverages an analysis-by-synthesis framework combined with deep learning. Unlike recent supervised methods that require isolated stem recordings for training, our approach is trained on drum mixtures with only transcription annotations. IDM integrates Automatic Drum Transcription and One-shot Drum Sample Synthesis, jointly optimizing these tasks in an end-to-end manner. By convolving synthesized one-shot samples with estimated onsets, akin to a drum machine, we reconstruct the individual drum stems and train a Deep Neural Network on the reconstruction of the mixture. Experiments on the StemGMD dataset demonstrate that IDM achieves separation quality comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods that require isolated stems data.</description>

      <title>SelfReflect: Can LLMs Communicate Their Internal Answer Distribution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The common approach to communicate a large language model's (LLM) uncertainty is to add a percentage number or a hedging word to its response. But is this all we can do? Instead of generating a single answer and then hedging it, an LLM that is fully transparent to the user needs to be able to reflect on its internal belief distribution and output a summary of all options it deems possible, and how likely they are. To test whether LLMs possess this capability, we develop the SelfReflect metric, an information-theoretic distance between a given summary and a distribution over answers. In interventional and human studies, we find that SelfReflect indicates even slight deviations, yielding a fine measure of faithfulness between a summary string and an LLM's actual internal distribution over answers. With SelfReflect, we make a resounding negative observation: modern LLMs are, across the board, incapable of revealing what they are uncertain about, neither through reasoning, nor chains-of-thoughts, nor explicit finetuning. However, we do find that LLMs are able to generate faithful summaries of their uncertainties if we help them by sampling multiple outputs and feeding them back into the context. This simple approach shines a light at the universal way of communicating LLM uncertainties whose future development the SelfReflect score enables.</description>

Abstract: Linear TD($\lambda$) is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms for policy evaluation. Previously, convergence rates are typically established under the assumption of linearly independent features, which does not hold in many practical scenarios. This paper instead establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rates for linear TD($\lambda$) operating under arbitrary features, without making any algorithmic modification or additional assumptions. Our results apply to both the discounted and average-reward settings. To address the potential non-uniqueness of solutions resulting from arbitrary features, we develop a novel stochastic approximation result featuring convergence rates to the solution set instead of a single point.</description>

      <title>On Fitting Flow Models with Large Sinkhorn Couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and $n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs. These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a. Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Flatness After All?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent literature generalization in deep learning has examined the relationship between the curvature of the loss function at minima and generalization, mainly in the context of overparameterized neural networks. A key observation is that "flat" minima tend to generalize better than "sharp" minima. While this idea is supported by empirical evidence, it has also been shown that deep networks can generalize even with arbitrary sharpness, as measured by either the trace or the spectral norm of the Hessian. In this paper, we argue that generalization could be assessed by measuring flatness using a soft rank measure of the Hessian. We show that when an exponential family neural network model is exactly calibrated, and its prediction error and its confidence on the prediction are not correlated with the first and the second derivative of the network's output, our measure accurately captures the asymptotic expected generalization gap. For non-calibrated models, we connect a soft rank based flatness measure to the well-known Takeuchi Information Criterion and show that it still provides reliable estimates of generalization gaps for models that are not overly confident. Experimental results indicate that our approach offers a robust estimate of the generalization gap compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>IMPACT: Importance-Aware Activation Space Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across many domains but are difficult to deploy in resource-constrained settings due to their size. Low-rank weight matrix compression is a popular strategy for reducing model size, typically by minimizing weight reconstruction error under the assumption that weights are low-rank. However, this assumption often does not hold in LLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a shift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.
  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions contribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm performance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware activation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their impact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that considers both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a closed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the eigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This enables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy. Experiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to 48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>The Serial Scaling Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While machine learning has advanced through massive parallelization, we identify a critical blind spot: some problems are fundamentally sequential. These "inherently serial" problems-from mathematical reasoning to physical simulations to sequential decision-making-require sequentially dependent computational steps that cannot be efficiently parallelized. We formalize this distinction in complexity theory, and demonstrate that current parallel-centric architectures face fundamental limitations on such tasks. Then, we show for first time that diffusion models despite their sequential nature are incapable of solving inherently serial problems. We argue that recognizing the serial nature of computation holds profound implications on machine learning, model design, and hardware development.</description>

      <title>BOOST: Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition Function Selection Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of Bayesian optimization (BO), a highly sample-efficient method for expensive black-box problems, is critically governed by the selection of its hyperparameters, including the kernel and acquisition functions. This presents a significant practical challenge: an inappropriate combination can lead to poor performance and wasted evaluations. While individual improvements to kernel functions (e.g., tree-based kernels, deep kernel learning) and acquisition functions (e.g., multi-step lookahead, tree-based planning) have been actively explored, the joint and autonomous selection of the best pair has been largely overlooked, forcing practitioners to rely on heuristics or costly manual tuning.
  We propose BOOST (Bayesian Optimization with Optimal Kernel and Acquisition Function Selection Technique), a novel framework that automates this selection. BOOST utilizes a lightweight, offline evaluation stage to predict the performance of various kernel-acquisition pairs and identify the most promising pair before committing to expensive evaluations.
  Using K-means clustering, BOOST first selects initial subsets from previously observed data-in-hand and prepares all possible kernel-acquisition pairs from user-chosen candidates. For each pair, BOOST conducts internal BO runs starting with the initial subset, evaluating how many iterations are required to find the target value within the remaining data, thereby identifying the pair with the best retrospective performance for future optimization.
  Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world hyperparameter optimization tasks demonstrate that BOOST consistently outperforms standard BO with fixed hyperparameters and state-of-the-art adaptive methods, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness in diverse problem landscapes.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Mixture Model with unknown diagonal covariances via continuous sparse regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the statistical estimation of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) with unknown diagonal covariances from independent and identically distributed samples. We employ the Beurling-LASSO (BLASSO), a convex optimization framework that promotes sparsity in the space of measures, to simultaneously estimate the number of components and their parameters. Our main contribution extends the BLASSO methodology to multivariate GMMs with component-specific unknown diagonal covariance matrices-a significantly more flexible setting than previous approaches requiring known and identical covariances. We establish non-asymptotic recovery guarantees with nearly parametric convergence rates for component means, diagonal covariances, and weights, as well as for density prediction. A key theoretical contribution is the identification of an explicit separation condition on mixture components that enables the construction of non-degenerate dual certificates-essential tools for establishing statistical guarantees for the BLASSO. Our analysis leverages the Fisher-Rao geometry of the statistical model and introduces a novel semi-distance adapted to our framework, providing new insights into the interplay between component separation, parameter space geometry, and achievable statistical recovery.</description>

      <title>Graph Coloring for Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby potentially reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce SON-GOKU, a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated, and the grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, multi-task learning will improve model performance rather than impede it. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers. We provide extensive theory showing why grouping and sequential updates improve multi-task learning, with guarantees on descent, convergence, and accurately identifying what tasks conflict or align.</description>

      <title>Painless Activation Steering: An Automated, Lightweight Approach for Post-Training Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks; we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8% on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.</description>

      <title>Ringleader ASGD: The First Asynchronous SGD with Optimal Time Complexity under Data Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asynchronous stochastic gradient methods are central to scalable distributed optimization, particularly when devices differ in computational capabilities. Such settings arise naturally in federated learning, where training takes place on smartphones and other heterogeneous edge devices. In addition to varying computation speeds, these devices often hold data from different distributions. However, existing asynchronous SGD methods struggle in such heterogeneous settings and face two key limitations. First, many rely on unrealistic assumptions of similarity across workers' data distributions. Second, methods that relax this assumption still fail to achieve theoretically optimal performance under heterogeneous computation times. We introduce Ringleader ASGD, the first asynchronous SGD algorithm that attains the theoretical lower bounds for parallel first-order stochastic methods in the smooth nonconvex regime, thereby achieving optimal time complexity under data heterogeneity and without restrictive similarity assumptions. Our analysis further establishes that Ringleader ASGD remains optimal under arbitrary and even time-varying worker computation speeds, closing a fundamental gap in the theory of asynchronous optimization.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Sparsity via $D$-Gating: Simple and Versatile Structured Penalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose $D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the $L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.</description>

      <title>Explore-Execute Chain: Towards an Efficient Structured Reasoning Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency, limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and reinforces the determinism of execution. This decomposition enables an efficient test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches 58.1% accuracy using &lt;10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods (e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating planning from execution.

      <description>arXiv:2509.24076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture density.</description>

      <title>AuON: A Linear-time Alternative to Semi-Orthogonal Momentum Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon, improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

      <title>Interpretable Kernel Representation Learning at Scale: A Unified Framework Utilizing Nystr\"om Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation. KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses, and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency. Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate through dedicated analysis.</description>
