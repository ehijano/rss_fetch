      <title>Spatiotemporal Gaussian Optimization for 4D Cone Beam CT Reconstruction from Sparse Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), four-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography (4D-CBCT) is critical for assessing tumor motion during a patients breathing cycle prior to beam delivery. However, generating 4D-CBCT images with sufficient quality requires significantly more projection images than a standard 3D-CBCT scan, leading to extended scanning times and increased imaging dose to the patient. To address these limitations, there is a strong demand for methods capable of reconstructing high-quality 4D-CBCT images from a 1-minute 3D-CBCT acquisition. The challenge lies in the sparse sampling of projections, which introduces severe streaking artifacts and compromises image quality. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging spatiotemporal Gaussian representation for 4D-CBCT reconstruction from sparse projections, achieving a balance between streak artifact reduction, dynamic motion preservation, and fine detail restoration. Each Gaussian is characterized by its 3D position, covariance, rotation, and density. Two-dimensional X-ray projection images can be rendered from the Gaussian point cloud representation via X-ray rasterization. The properties of each Gaussian were optimized by minimizing the discrepancy between the measured projections and the rendered X-ray projections. A Gaussian deformation network is jointly optimized to deform these Gaussian properties to obtain a 4D Gaussian representation for dynamic CBCT scene modeling. The final 4D-CBCT images are reconstructed by voxelizing the 4D Gaussians, achieving a high-quality representation that preserves both motion dynamics and spatial detail.

      <title>Positronium Lifetime Imaging with the Biograph Vision Quadra using 124I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Measuring the ortho-positronium (oPs) lifetime in human tissue bears the potential of adding clinically relevant information about the tissue microenvironment to conventional positron emission tomography (PET). Through phantom measurements, we investigate the voxel-wise measurement of oPs lifetime using a commercial long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET scanner. Methods: We prepared four samples with mixtures of Amberlite XAD4, a porous polymeric adsorbent, and water and added between 1.12 MBq and 1.44 MBq of $^{124}$I. The samples were scanned in two different setups: once with a couple of centimeters between each sample (15 minutes scan time) and once with all samples taped together (40 minutes scan time). For each scan, we determine the oPs lifetime for the full samples and at the voxel level. The voxel sizes under consideration are $10.0^3$ mm$^3$, $7.1^3$ mm$^3$ and $4.0^3$ mm$^3$. Results: Amberlite XAD4 allows the preparation of samples with distinct oPs lifetime. Using a Bayesian fitting procedure, the oPs lifetimes in the whole samples are $2.52 \pm 0.03$ ns, $2.37\pm 0.03$ ns, $2.27\pm0.04$ ns and $1.82\pm 0.02$ ns, respectively. The voxel-wise oPs lifetime fits showed that even with $4.0^3$ mm$^3$ voxels the samples are clearly distinguishable and a central voxels have good count statistics. However, the situation with the samples close together remains challenging with respect to the spatial distinction of regions with different oPs lifetimes. Conclusion: Our study shows that positronium lifetime imaging on a commercial LAFOV PET/CT should be feasible under clinical conditions using $^{124}$I.</description>

      <title>Enhancing kidney quality assessment: Power Doppler during normothermic machine perfusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: Marginal donor kidneys are increasingly used for transplantation to overcome organ shortage. This study aims to investigate the additional value of Power Doppler (PD) imaging in kidney quality assessment during normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). Methods: Porcine kidneys (n=22) retrieved from a local slaughterhouse underwent 2 hours of NMP. Based on creatinine clearance (CrCl) and oxygen consumption (VO2), the kidneys were classified as functional (n=7) and non-functional (n=15) kidneys. PD imaging was performed at 30, 60, and 120 minutes, and PD metrics, including vascularization index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascularization flow index (VFI) were calculated. Renal blood flow (RBF), CrCl, and VO2 were measured at the same time points during NMP. The metrics were compared utilizing correlation analysis. Results: FI and VFI moderately correlated with CrCl (r=0.537, p&lt;0.0001; r=0.536, p&lt;0.0001, respectively), while VI strongly correlated with VO2 (r=0.839, p&lt;0.0001). At 120 minutes, PD metrics demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing functional from non-functional kidneys, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.943 for VI, 0.924 for FI, and 0.943 for VFI. Cutoff values of 17% for VI, 50 a.u. for FI, and 9 a.u. for VFI provided 100% specificity and 73% sensitivity to identify non-functional kidneys, with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 82%. Baseline kidney biopsies showed moderate acute tubular necrosis in both groups with no significant differences. Conclusions: PD metrics strongly correlate with renal viability and effectively differentiate functional from non-functional kidneys. PD imaging can be a valuable alternative to RBF during NMP for kidney assessment.</description>

      <title>Extending the time-over-threshold calibration of Timepix3 for spatial-resolved ion spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid pixel detectors have a well-established array of applications ranging from particle physics to life sciences. The small dimensions of Timepix3 as well as its relatively low energetic expenses make it an intriguing option additionally for ion detection in nuclear physics experiments, as it reveals simultaneously precise temporal, spatial and energetic properties of recorded events from nuclear reactions. Currently, a limiting factor is the electronics behavior at high input charge resulting in improper energy determination of incident heavier ions. While the low-energy per-pixel calibration of Timepix3 is normally performed with the use of photons of up to 60 keV, the characteristic linear range permits a correct extrapolation up to only 150 keV/pixel. We developed a global per-pixel energy correction method involving the use of short-ranged accelerated ions and spectroscopic alpha sources, to suitably extend the energy determination capability of Timepix3 for nuclear ion spectroscopy experiments, where spatial and temporal precision of recorded events are equally crucial. It was found that upon applying this correction, the reliable per-pixel energy range has been increased from the original 150 keV to at least 1.1 MeV, while maintaining the relative energy resolution to better than 2.5% for stopped protons of up to 1.9 MeV and better than 3.1% for alpha particles of 5.5 MeV. Furthermore, to demonstrate the spatial resolution of Timepix3 detectors with silicon sensors, we present alpha-radiography measurements from which we extract the modulation transfer function (MTF) and produce real-world biological sample images.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation from the IFCN-endorsed ITRUSST Consortium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-intensity Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation (TUS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique enabling cortical and deep brain targeting with unprecedented spatial accuracy. Given the high rate of adoption by new users with varying levels of expertise and interdisciplinary backgrounds, practical guidelines are needed to ensure state-of-the-art TUS application and reproducible outcomes. Therefore, the International Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation Safety and Standards (ITRUSST) consortium has formed a subcommittee, endorsed by the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology (IFCN), to develop recommendations for best practice in TUS applications in humans. The practical guide presented here provides a brief introduction into ultrasound physics and sonication parameters. It explains the requirements of TUS lab equipment and transducer selection and discusses experimental design and procedures alongside potential confounds and control conditions. Finally, the guide elaborates on essential steps of application planning for stimulation safety and efficacy, as well as considerations when combining TUS with neuroimaging, electrophysiology, or other brain stimulation techniques. We hope that this practical guide to TUS will assist both novice and experienced users in planning and conducting high-quality studies and provide a solid foundation for further advancements in this promising field.</description>

      <title>A three-stage method for reconstructing multiple coefficients in coupled photoacoustic and diffuse optical imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies inverse problems in quantitative photoacoustic tomography with additional optical current data supplemented from diffuse optical tomography. We propose a three-stage image reconstruction method for the simultaneous recovery of the absorption, diffusion, and Gr\"uneisen coefficients. We demonstrate, through numerical simulations, that: (i) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is known, the addition of the optical measurements allows a more accurate reconstruction of the scattering and absorption coefficients; and (ii) when the Gr\"uneisen coefficient is not known, the addition of optical current measurements allows us to reconstruct uniquely the Gr\"uneisen, the scattering and absorption coefficients. Numerical simulations based on synthetic data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea.</description>
