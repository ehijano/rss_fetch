      <title>Spin dynamics of an easy-plane Dirac spin liquid in a frustrated XY model: Application to honeycomb cobaltates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has shown that the honeycomb lattice spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_3$ XY model, with nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic exchange $J_1$ and frustration induced by third-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange $J_3$, may be relevant to a wide range of cobaltate materials. We explore a variational Monte Carlo study of Gutzwiller projected wavefunctions for this model and show that an easy-plane Dirac spin liquid (DSL) is a viable `parent' state for the competing magnetic orders observed in these materials, including ferromagnetic, zig-zag, spiral, and double zig-zag orders at intermediate frustration, and show that such broken symmetry states can be easily polarized by a weak in-plane magnetic field consistent with experiments. We formulate a modified parton theory for such frustrated spin models, and explore the potential instabilities of the DSL due to residual parton interactions within a random phase approximation (RPA), both at zero magnetic field and in a nonzero in-plane field. The broken symmetry states which emerge in the vicinity of this Dirac spin liquid include ferromagnetic, zig-zag, and incommensurate spiral orders, with a phase diagram which is consistent with VMC and density matrix renormalization group studies. We calculate the dynamical spin response of the easy-plane DSL, including RPA corrections, near the boundary of the ordered states, and present results for THz spectroscopy and inelastic neutron scattering, at zero field as well as in an in-plane magnetic field, and discuss experimental implications.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Model of Magnons in Double-Layered Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of the double-layered antiferromagnets and their magnonic properties are investigated by considering two model systems, the linear chain (LC) and more complex chain of railroad trestle (RT) geometry, and a real example of chromium nitride CrN. The spin-paired order ($\cdots{+}{+}{-}{-}\cdots$) in LC requires an alternation of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions, while analogous spin-paired order in RT can be stable even for all magnetic exchange interactions being AFM. The rock-salt structure of CrN evokes clear magnetic frustration since Cr atoms in face-centered cubic lattice form links to twelve nearest neighbors all equivalent and AFM. Nonetheless, the magnetostructural transition to an orthorhombically distorted phase below $T_\text{N} = 287~\text{K}$ leads to a diversification of Cr-Cr links, which suppresses the frustration and allows for stable double-layered AFM order of CrN. Based on $\textit{ab initio}$ calculated exchange parameters, the magnon spectra and temperature evolution of ordered magnetic moments are derived.</description>

      <title>Infinite Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators for non-equilibrium quantum impurity problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An emergent numerical approach to solve quantum impurity problems is to encode the impurity path integral as a matrix product state. For time-dependent problems, the cost of this approach generally scales with the evolution time. Here we consider a common non-equilibrium scenario where an impurity, initially in equilibrium with a thermal bath, is driven out of equilibrium by a time-dependent force term. Despite that there is no time-translational invariance in the problem, we show that we could still make full use of the infinite matrix product state technique, resulting in a method whose cost is essentially independent of the evolution time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in the integrable case against exact diagonalization, and against existing calculations on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour in the general case. Our method could be a very competitive method for studying long-time non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, and be potentially used as an efficient impurity solver in the non-equilibrium dynamical mean field theory.</description>

      <title>Bullet pressure-cell design for neutron scattering experiments with horizontal magnetic fields and dilution temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simultaneous application of high magnetic fields and high pressures for controlling magnetic ground states is important for testing our understanding of many-body quantum theory. However, the implementation for neutron scattering experiments presents a technical challenge. To overcome this challenge we present an optimized pressure-cell design with a novel bullet shape, which is compatible with horizontal-field magnets, in particular the high-field magnet operating at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin. The cell enabled neutron diffraction and spectroscopy measurements with the combination of three extreme conditions: high pressures, high magnetic fields, and dilution temperatures, simultaneously reaching 0.7 GPa, 25.9 T, and 200 mK. Our results demonstrate the utility of informed material choices and the efficiency of finite-element analysis for future pressure-cell designs to be used in combination with magnetic fields and dilution temperatures for neutron scattering purposes.</description>

      <title>Structural characterization of the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals have a variety of intriguing physical properties, including topologically protected electronic states that coexist with conducting states. Possible exploitation of topologically protected states in a conducting material is promising for technological applications. Weyl semimetals that form in a non-centrosymmetric structure that also contain magnetic moments may host a variety of emergent phenomena that cannot be seen in magnetic, centrosymmetric Weyl materials. It can be difficult to distinguish definitively between a centrosymmetric structure and one of its non-centrosymmetric subgroups with standard powder X-ray diffractometers in cases where two atoms in the compound have nearly the same atomic number, as is the case for the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe. In these cases, a careful single-crystal neutron diffraction experiment with high-angle reflections provides complimentary information to X-ray diffraction and definitively resolves any ambiguity between centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric crystal structures. Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements on the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe confirms that its structure is non-centrosymmetric, described by space group 109 $\left(I4_1md\right)$ rather than the centrosymmetric space group 141 $\left(I4_1/amd\right)$. There are many high-angle reflections in the data set that give clear, physically intuitive evidence that CeGaGe forms with $I4_1md$ symmetry since Bragg planes of these reflections can contain Ga with no Ge or vice versa whereas the Bragg planes for a structure with $I4_1/amd$ symmetry would have a mix of Ga and Ge. Further, in some crystals we have studied, there is clear evidence for a structural transition from body-centered $I4_1md$ symmetry to primitive $P4_3$ and/or $P4_1$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Real-space chirality from crystalline topological defects in the Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that certain crystalline topological defects in the gapless Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid model generate a chirality that depends in a universal manner on their emergent flux. Focusing on 5-7 dislocations as building blocks, consisting of pentagon and heptagon disclinations, we identify the Kitaev bond label configurations that preserve solvability. By defining and computing multiple formulations of local Chern markers we find that the 5 and 7 lattice defects host a contribution to real-space chirality, which we dub "Chern charge" or $\mathcal{Q_M}$. The sign of this local Chern charge obeys $\text{sgn}({\mathcal{Q_M}}) = - i ~ \text{sgn}(F) W$ where $F$ is the disclination Frank angle and $W = \pm i$ is its emergent-gauge-field flux. We show that lattice curvature and torsion can interplay with the surrounding gapless background to modify the $\mathcal{Q_M}$ profile and magnitude, but that the sign of $\mathcal{Q_M}$ is set by local properties of the defect, enabling the identification of Chern charges.</description>

      <title>Cost optimized ab initio tensor network state methods: industrial perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce efficient solutions to optimize the cost of tree-like tensor network state method calculations when an expensive GPU-accelerated hardware is utilized. By supporting a main powerful compute node with additional auxiliary, but much cheaper nodes to store intermediate, precontracted tensor network scratch data, the IO time can be hidden behind the computation almost entirely without increasing memory peak. Our solution is based on the different bandwidths of the different communication channels, like NVLink, PCIe, InfiniBand and available storage media, which are utilized on different layers of the algorithm. This simple heterogeneous multiNode solution via asynchronous IO operation has the potential to minimize IO overhead, resulting in maximum performance rate for the main compute unit. In addition, we introduce an in-house developed massively parallel protocol to serialize and deserialize block sparse matrices and tensors, reducing data communication time tremendously. Performance profiles are presented for the spin adapted ab initio density matrix renormalization group method for corresponding U(1) bond dimension values up to 15400 on the active compounds of the FeMoco with complete active space (CAS) sizes of up to 113 electrons in 76 orbitals [CAS(113, 76)].</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous reduction-annealing effects on the electron-doped cuprate superconductor revealed by micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04790v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of the protect-annealing method has extended the superconductivity of the electron-doped cuprate Pr$_{1.3-x}$La$_{0.7}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ (PLCCO) into lower Ce concentrations, while the superconducting volume fraction decreases with underdoping. Employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with a micro-focused beam, we investigated the electronic structure of protect-annealed PLCCO ($x=0.08$) with small superconducting volume fraction. Significant spatial variation of Fermi surface area and shape was observed, suggesting inhomogeneity in electron concentrations and the pseudogap that competes with superconductivity. By performing measurements at dozens of different sample positions, negative and non-monotonic correlation was found between the electron concentration and pseudogap magnitude. The established correlation illustrates a systematic annealing dependence of the electronic structure where a pseudogap abruptly opens with insufficient oxygen reduction.</description>

      <title>Instability of the charge density wave in Kagome magnet FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome metals show rich competing quantum phases due to geometry frustration, flat bands, many-body effects, and non-trivial topology. Recently, a novel charge density wave (CDW) was discovered deep inside the antiferromagnetic phase of FeGe, attracting intense attention due to close relation with magnetism. Here, via a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), we find the 2*2 CDW in FeGe is very fragile and can be readily disrupted into the initial 1*1 phase; Small sqrt3*sqrt3 CDW puddles are found to coexist with the 2*2 CDW in as-grown samples, and can also be induced in the intermediate process of CDW disruption, which will eventually transform into the initial 1*1 phase. Moreover, an exotic intermediate CDW state and standalone CDW nuclei appear unexpectedly during the disruption process. Our first-principle calculations find equal softening of a flat optical phonon mode in a large momentum region around the CDW wave vector, corresponding to numerous competing CDWs with close energies. This might lead to strong instability of the CDW ground state, responsible for STM observations. Our findings provide more novel experimental aspects to understand the CDW in FeGe and suggest FeGe-like Kagome metals are ideal platforms for studying the physics of competing CDW instabilities.</description>

      <title>Hasse Diagrams for Gapless SPT and SSB Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss (1+1)d gapless phases with non-invertible global symmetries, also referred to as categorical symmetries. This includes gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, known as gapless SPT (or gSPT) phases; and gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped spontaneous symmetry broken (SSB) phases, that we refer to as gapless SSB (or gSSB) phases. We fit these gapless phases, along with gapped SPT and SSB phases, into a phase diagram describing possible deformations connecting them. This phase diagram is partially ordered and defines a so-called Hasse diagram. Based on these deformations, we identify gapless phases exhibiting symmetry protected criticality, that we refer to as intrinsically gapless SPT (igSPT) and intrinsically gapless SSB (igSSB) phases. This includes the first examples of igSPT and igSSB phases with non-invertible symmetries. Central to this analysis is the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where each phase corresponds to a condensable algebra in the Drinfeld center of the symmetry category. On a mathematical note, gSPT phases are classified by functors between fusion categories, generalizing the fact that gapped SPT phases are classified by fiber functors; and gSSB phases are classified by functors from fusion to multi-fusion categories. Finally, our framework can be applied to understand gauging of trivially acting non-invertible symmetries, including possible patterns of decomposition arising due to such gaugings.</description>

      <title>Exact deconfined gauge structures in the higher-spin Yao-Lee model: a quantum spin-orbital liquid with spin fractionalization and non-Abelian anyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-integrable higher spin Kitaev honeycomb model has an exact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure, which exclusively identifies quantum spin liquid (QSL) in the half-integer spin Kitaev model. But its constraints for the integer-spin Kitaev model are much limited, and even trivially gapped insulators cannot be excluded. The physical implications of exact $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure, especially $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes, in integer-spin models remain largely unexplored. In this Letter, we theoretically show that a spin-S Yao-Lee model (a spin-orbital model with SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry) possesses a topologically-nontrivial quantum spin-orbital liquid (QSOL) ground state for any spin (both integer and half-integer spin) by constructing exact deconfined fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges. We further show that the conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ flux can also demonstrate the intriguing spin fractionalization phenomena in the nonabelian topological order phase of the spin-1 Yao-Lee model. Its deconfined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortex excitation carries fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ quantum number in the low-energy subspace, which is also an nonabelian anyon. Our exact manifestation of spin fractionalization in an integer-spin model is rather rare in previous studies, and is absent in the Kitaev honeycomb model.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>

Abstract: I review the formalism of patch bosonization of Fermi surfaces, with a focus on the problem of a two-dimensional metal at a quantum critical point. I argue that this formalism is fundamentally inapplicable to the problem, except in synthetic limits. One such limit is the small-$N$ limit, which was already discussed in early studies of the problem; a similar but slightly less unphysical large-$N$ limit is proposed. I show that it is at least formally possible to construct perturbative expansions around these synthetic limits. However, I argue that nonperturbative effects become important when $N\sim1$.</description>

      <title>Temperature evolution of the Fermi surface of the FeSe monolayer on SrTiO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of superconductivity in the FeSe monolayer on SrTiO$_3$ remains one of the unresolved mysteries in condensed-matter physics. Here by investigation of the temperature evolution of the dynamic charge response of FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ we infer that the response of the monolayer itself is nearly temperature independent. This indicates a constant Fermi surface over a wide range of temperature, in stark contrast to that of the bulk FeSe and other Fe-based superconductors. Our results, which manifest the peculiarity of the electronic structure of the FeSe monolayer, may help for a microscopic understanding of the superconductivity in Fe-chalcogenide monolayers on oxide surfaces in general.</description>

      <title>Duality Constraints on Thermal Spectra of 3d Conformal Field Theories and 4d Quasinormal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal spectra of correlation functions in holographic 3d large-N conformal field theories (CFTs) correspond to quasinormal modes of classical gravity and other fields in asymptotically anti-de Sitter black hole spacetimes. Using general properties of such spectra along with constraints imposed by the S-duality (or the particle-vortex duality), we derive a spectral duality relation that all such spectra must obey. Its form is universal in that each such relation (expressed as an infinite product over QNMs) only depends on a single function of a spatial wavevector that corresponds to the bulk algebraically special frequencies. In the process, we also derive a new sum rule constraining products over QNMs. The spectral duality relation, which imposes an infinite set of constraints on the QNMs, is then investigated and a number of well-known holographic examples that demonstrate its validity are examined. Our results also allow us to understand several new aspects of the pole-skipping phenomenon.</description>

      <title>The Fock-space landscape of many-body localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article reviews recent progress in understanding the physics of many-body localisation (MBL) in disordered and interacting quantum many-body systems, from the perspective of ergodicity breaking on the associated Fock space. This approach to MBL is underpinned by mapping the dynamics of the many-body system onto that of a fictitious single particle on the high-dimensional, correlated and disordered Fock-space graph; yet, as we elaborate, the problem is fundamentally different from that of conventional Anderson localisation on high-dimensional or hierarchical graphs. We discuss in detail the nature of eigenstate correlations on the Fock space, both static and dynamic, and in the ergodic and many-body localised phases as well as in the vicinity of the MBL transition. The latter in turn sheds light on the nature of the transition, and motivates a scaling theory for it in terms of Fock-space based quantities. We also illustrate how these quantities can be concretely connected to real-space observables. An overview is given of several analytical and numerical techniques which have proven important in developing a comprehensive picture. Finally, we comment on some open questions in the field of MBL where the Fock-space approach is likely to prove insightful.</description>

      <title>Topological orbital Hall effect caused by skyrmions and antiferromagnetic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological Hall effect is a hallmark of topologically non-trivial magnetic textures such as magnetic skyrmions. It quantifies the transverse electric current once an electric field is applied and occurs as a consequence of the emergent magnetic field of the skyrmion. Likewise, an orbital magnetization is generated. Here we show that the charge currents are orbital polarized even though the conduction electrons couple to the skyrmion texture via their spin. The topological Hall effect is accompanied by a topological orbital Hall effect even for s electrons without spin-orbit coupling. As we show, antiferromagnetic skyrmions and antiferromagnetic bimerons that have a compensated emergent field, exhibit a topological orbital Hall conductivity that is not accompanied by charge transport and can be orders of magnitude larger than the topological spin Hall conductivity. Skyrmionic textures serve as generators of orbital currents that can transport information and give rise to considerable orbital torques.</description>

      <title>Magnetically-controlled Vortex Dynamics in a Ferromagnetic Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic superconductors are exceptionally rare because the strong ferromagnetic exchange field usually destroys singlet superconductivity. EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, an iron-based superconductor with a maximum critical temperature of $\sim$25 K, is a unique material that exhibits full coexistence with ferromagnetic order below $T_\mathrm{FM} \approx 19$ K. The interplay between the two leads to a narrowing of ferromagnetic domains at higher temperatures and the spontaneous nucleation of vortices/antivortices at lower temperatures. Here we demonstrate how the underlying magnetic structure directly controls the superconducting vortex dynamics in applied magnetic fields. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ we observe a pronounced temperature-dependent peak in both the coercivity and the creep activation energy, the latter becoming rapidly suppressed in large applied magnetic fields. We attribute this behaviour to the formation of vortex polarons arising from the unique interaction between free vortices and magnetic stripe domains. We present a theoretical description of the properties of vortex polarons that explains our main observations, showing how they lead to vortex trapping and an attractive vortex-vortex interaction at short distances. In stark contrast, strong magnetic irreversibility at low temperatures is linked to a critical current governed by giant flux creep over an activation barrier for vortex-antivortex annihilation near domain walls. Our work reveals unexplored new routes for the magnetic enhancement of vortex pinning with particularly important applications in high-current conductors for operation at high magnetic fields.</description>
