      <title>Do the unvaccinated disproportionately harm the vaccinated in a respiratory pandemic?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A parameter $\psi$ was recently defined and introduced into the epidemiological modelling scientific literature, and is being accepted. The said parameter was used to argue that there was a disproportionate risk of infection incurred by vaccinated persons due to contacts with unvaccinated persons during the declared COVID-19 pandemic. Opposing published results show that, in general, there is virtually never a disproportionate risk to the vaccinated from the unvaccinated during a respiratory pandemic. Here, we show that the newly introduced vaccinology parameter $\psi$ is incorrectly defined and that the conclusions of disproportionate risk are not valid. Specifically, we prove that the originating authors Fisman et al. (2022, 2024) incorrectly defined and applied the parameter $\psi$. Their application would imply that the said risk increases with increasing segregation from the unvaccinated (up to complete segregation), increases with increasing vaccination coverage (up to complete coverage) and increases with increasing vaccine efficacy (up to perfect vaccine efficacy), which is impossible. Use of the erroneous parameter $\psi$ has the potential to encourage unnecessarily aggressive public health policies and interventions.</description>

      <title>Spatial structure facilitates evolutionary rescue by drug resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacterial populations often have complex spatial structures, which can impact their evolution. Here, we study how spatial structure affects the evolution of antibiotic resistance in a bacterial population. We consider a minimal model of spatially structured populations where all demes (i.e., subpopulations) are identical and connected to each other by identical migration rates. We show that spatial structure can facilitate the survival of a bacterial population to antibiotic treatment, starting from a sensitive inoculum. Specifically, the bacterial population can be rescued if antibiotic resistant mutants appear and are present when drug is added, and spatial structure can impact the fate of these mutants and the probability that they are present. Indeed, the probability of fixation of neutral or deleterious mutations providing drug resistance is increased in smaller populations. This promotes local fixation of resistant mutants in the structured population, which facilitates evolutionary rescue by drug resistance in the rare mutation regime. Once the population is rescued by resistance, migrations allow resistant mutants to spread in all demes. Our main result that spatial structure facilitates evolutionary rescue by antibiotic resistance extends to more complex spatial structures, and to the case where there are resistant mutants in the inoculum.</description>

      <title>Bernstein duality revisited: frequency-dependent selection, coordinated mutation and opposing environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the long-term behavior of a class of $\Lambda$-Wright--Fisher processes incorporating frequency-dependent selection, coordinated (bidirectional) selection, as well as individual and coordinated mutation. Our primary analytical tool is Bernstein duality, a generalization of moment duality. We introduce the corresponding dual process and establish the relevant duality relation. Without mutation, this work complements earlier studies that employed moment duality, Siegmund duality or other methods to classify the long-term behavior of similar processes. Notably, the current analysis encompasses parameter regimes that model bidirectional selection, a scenario that has proven challenging to analyze using moment duality. In the presence of mutation, we establish the ergodic properties of the process.</description>
