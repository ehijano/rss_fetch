      <title>Determining cell population size from cell fraction in cell plasticity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the size of cell populations is crucial for understanding biological processes such as growth, injury repair, and disease progression. Often, experimental data offer information in the form of relative frequencies of distinct cell types, rather than absolute cell counts. This emphasizes the need to devise effective strategies for estimating absolute cell quantities from fraction data. In response to this challenge, we present two computational approaches grounded in stochastic cell population models: the first-order moment method (FOM) and the second-order moment method (SOM). These methods explicitly establish mathematical mappings from cell fraction to cell population size using moment equations of the stochastic models. Notably, our investigation demonstrates that the SOM method obviates the requirement for a priori knowledge of the initial population size, highlighting the utility of incorporating variance details from cell proportions. The robustness of both the FOM and SOM methods was analyzed from different perspectives. Additionally, we extended the application of the FOM and SOM methods to various biological mechanisms within the context of cell plasticity models. Our methodologies not only assist in mitigating the inherent limitations of experimental techniques when only fraction data is available for detecting cell population size, but they also offer new insights into utilizing the stochastic characteristics of cell population dynamics to quantify interactions between different biomasses within the system.</description>

      <title>Impact of phylogeny on the inference of functional sectors from protein sequence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical analysis of multiple sequence alignments of homologous proteins has revealed groups of coevolving amino acids called sectors. These groups of amino-acid sites feature collective correlations in their amino-acid usage, and they are associated to functional properties. Modeling showed that natural selection on an additive functional trait of a protein is generically expected to give rise to a functional sector. These modeling results motivated a principled method, called ICOD, which is designed to identify functional sectors, as well as mutational effects, from sequence data. However, a challenge for all methods aiming to identify sectors from multiple sequence alignments is that correlations in amino-acid usage can also arise from the mere fact that homologous sequences share common ancestry, i.e. from phylogeny. Here, we generate controlled synthetic data from a minimal model comprising both phylogeny and functional sectors. We use this data to dissect the impact of phylogeny on sector identification and on mutational effect inference by different methods. We find that ICOD is most robust to phylogeny, but that conservation is also quite robust. Next, we consider natural multiple sequence alignments of protein families for which deep mutational scan experimental data is available. We show that in this natural data, conservation and ICOD best identify sites with strong functional roles, in agreement with our results on synthetic data. Importantly, these two methods have different premises, since they respectively focus on conservation and on correlations. Thus, their joint use can reveal complementary information.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Molecular Moieties through Hierarchical Graph Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have emerged in very recent years as a powerful tool for supporting in silico Virtual Screening. In this work we present a GNN which uses Graph Convolutional architectures to achieve very accurate multi-target screening. We also devised a hierarchical Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique to catch information directly at atom, ring, and whole molecule level by leveraging the message passing mechanism. In this way, we find the most relevant moieties involved in bioactivity prediction. Results: We report a state-of-the-art GNN classifier on twenty Cyclin-dependent Kinase targets in support of VS. Our classifier outperforms previous SOTA approaches proposed by the authors. Moreover, a CDK1-only high-sensitivity version of the GNN has been designed to use our explainer in order to avoid the inherent bias of multi-class models. The hierarchical explainer has been validated by an expert chemist on 19 approved drugs on CDK1. Our explainer provided information in accordance to the docking analysis for 17 out of the 19 test drugs. Conclusion: Our approach is a valid support for shortening both the screening and the hit-to-lead phase. Detailed knowledge about the molecular substructures that play a role in the inhibitory action, can help the computational chemist to gain insights into the pharmacophoric function of the molecule also for repurposing purposes. Scientific Contribution Statement: The core scientific innovation of our work is the use of a hierarchical XAI approach on a GNN trained for a ligand-based VS task. The application of the hierarchical explainer allows for eliciting also structural information...</description>
