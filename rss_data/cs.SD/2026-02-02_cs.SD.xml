      <title>An Effective Energy Mask-based Adversarial Evasion Attacks against Misclassification in Speaker Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evasion attacks pose significant threats to AI systems, exploiting vulnerabilities in machine learning models to bypass detection mechanisms. The widespread use of voice data, including deepfakes, in promising future industries is currently hindered by insufficient legal frameworks. Adversarial attack methods have emerged as the most effective countermeasure against the indiscriminate use of such data. This research introduces masked energy perturbation (MEP), a novel approach using power spectrum for energy masking of original voice data. MEP applies masking to small energy regions in the frequency domain before generating adversarial perturbations, targeting areas less noticeable to the human auditory model. The study primarily employs advanced speaker recognition models, including ECAPA-TDNN and ResNet34, which have shown remarkable performance in speaker verification tasks. The proposed MEP method demonstrated strong performance in both audio quality and evasion effectiveness. The energy masking approach effectively minimizes the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) degradation, indicating that minimal perceptual distortion occurs to the human listener despite the adversarial perturbations. Specifically, in the PESQ evaluation, the relative performance of the MEP method was 26.68% when compared to the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and iterative FGSM.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Speech Representation Aggregation in Speech Enhancement: A Phonetic Mutual Information Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent speech enhancement (SE) models increasingly leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) representations for their rich semantic information. Typically, intermediate features are aggregated into a single representation via a lightweight adaptation module. However, most SSL models are not trained for noise robustness, which can lead to corrupted semantic representations. Moreover, the adaptation module is trained jointly with the SE model, potentially prioritizing acoustic details over semantic information, contradicting the original purpose. To address this issue, we first analyze the behavior of SSL models on noisy speech from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we measure the mutual information (MI) between the corrupted SSL representations and the corresponding phoneme labels, focusing on preservation of linguistic contents. Building upon this analysis, we introduce the linguistic aggregation layer, which is pre-trained to maximize MI with phoneme labels (with optional dynamic aggregation) and then frozen during SE training. Experiments show that this decoupled approach improves Word Error Rate (WER) over jointly optimized baselines, demonstrating the benefit of explicitly aligning the adaptation module with linguistic contents.</description>

      <title>A Semantically Consistent Dataset for Data-Efficient Query-Based Universal Sound Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query-based universal sound separation is fundamental to intelligent auditory systems, aiming to isolate specific sources from mixtures. Despite recent advances, existing methods continue to suffer from residual interference in complex acoustic scenes. This performance limitation stems largely from a data bottleneck: in-the-wild datasets contain weak labels and severe co-occurrence of events. These flaws induce models to learn spurious correlations between background noise and target categories instead of robust acoustic features. To address this, we propose an automated pipeline that eliminates co-occurrence of events by mining high-purity single-event segments from in-the-wild datasets via a semantically consistent synthesis protocol. Utilizing this pipeline, we constructed Hive, a high-quality synthetic dataset comprising 2.4k hours of raw audio. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-the-art model SAM-Audio which was trained on a huge dataset $\sim$500 times larger than Hive, certain open-source models trained on Hive achieve competitive separation accuracy and perceptual quality. Moreover, these models exhibited remarkable zero-shot generalization on out-of-distribution evaluation benchmarks. These findings highlight that prioritizing purity of supervised signals enables significant data efficiency, offering a new paradigm for training robust auditory foundation models with reduced computational costs. Code and dataset are available at https://shandaai.github.io/Hive.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Rewarding LALMs for Expressive Role-Play TTS via Mean Continuation Log-Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have extended Text-to-Speech (TTS) to interactive role-play scenarios, which demand high expressiveness and strict adherence to role-play instructions. However, existing models struggle to maintain stylistic consistency with character profiles and scene descriptions across multi-turn dialogues. A critical bottleneck is the lack of objective metrics for quantifying speaking style. To bridge this gap, we propose Mean Continuation Log-Probability (MCLP) as both an evaluation metric and a reward signal, validated on LALM-based Role-Play TTS (RP-TTS) tasks. Critically, we leverage the In-Context Learning capability of pre-trained LALMs to formulate MCLP via a continuation log-probability prediction. This metric quantifies stylistic consistency by measuring the likelihood of the ground-truth speech conditioned on the generated speech. Furthermore, we employ MCLP as a reinforcement learning reward to enhance the style alignment between generated speech and Role-Play instructions. To facilitate evaluation, we construct an RP-TTS dataset with rich scene and character annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong LALM baselines on both objective and subjective metrics.</description>

      <title>How Far Can Pretrained LLMs Go in Symbolic Music? Controlled Comparisons of Supervised and Preference-based Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music often shares notable parallels with language, motivating the use of pretrained large language models (LLMs) for symbolic music understanding and generation. Despite growing interest, the practical effectiveness of adapting instruction-tuned LLMs to symbolic music remains insufficiently characterized. We present a controlled comparative study of finetuning strategies for ABC-based generation and understanding, comparing an off-the-shelf instruction-tuned backbone to domain-adapted variants and a music-specialized LLM baseline. Across multiple symbolic music corpora and evaluation signals, we provide some insights into adaptation choices for symbolic music applications. We highlight the domain adaptation vs.~preserving prior information tradeoff as well as the distinct behaviour of metrics used to measure the domain adaptation for symbolic music.</description>

      <title>Towards Explicit Acoustic Evidence Perception in Audio LLMs for Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech deepfake detection (SDD) focuses on identifying whether a given speech signal is genuine or has been synthetically generated. Existing audio large language model (LLM)-based methods excel in content understanding; however, their predictions are often biased toward semantically correlated cues, which results in fine-grained acoustic artifacts being overlooked during the decisionmaking process. Consequently, fake speech with natural semantics can bypass detectors despite harboring subtle acoustic anomalies; this suggests that the challenge stems not from the absence of acoustic data, but from its inadequate accessibility when semantic-dominant reasoning prevails. To address this issue, we investigate SDD within the audio LLM paradigm and introduce SDD with Auditory Perception-enhanced Audio Large Language Model (SDD-APALLM), an acoustically enhanced framework designed to explicitly expose fine-grained time-frequency evidence as accessible acoustic cues. By combining raw audio with structured spectrograms, the proposed framework empowers audio LLMs to more effectively capture subtle acoustic inconsistencies without compromising their semantic understanding. Experimental results indicate consistent gains in detection accuracy and robustness, especially in cases where semantic cues are misleading. Further analysis reveals that these improvements stem from a coordinated utilization of semantic and acoustic information, as opposed to simple modality aggregation.</description>

      <title>Hearing is Believing? Evaluating and Analyzing Audio Language Model Sycophancy with SYAUDIO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALMs) have recently shown strong capabilities in unified reasoning over speech, sound, and natural language; yet they inherit behavioral issues observed in Large Language Models, including sycophancy--the tendency to agree with user assertions even when they contradict objective evidence. While sycophancy has been extensively studied in text and vision-language models, its manifestation in audio-conditioned reasoning remains largely unexplored, despite the need for ALMs to rely on auditory cues such as acoustic events, speaker characteristics, and speech rate. To address this gap, we introduce SYAUDIO, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating sycophancy in ALMs, consisting of 4,319 audio questions spanning Audio Perception, Audio Reasoning, Audio Math, and Audio Ethics. Built upon established audio benchmarks and augmented with TTS-generated arithmetic and moral reasoning tasks, SYAUDIO enables systematic evaluation across multiple domains and sycophancy types with carefully verified data quality. Furthermore, we analyze audio-specific sycophancy under realistic conditions involving noise and rate, and demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning with chain-of-thought data is an effective mitigation strategy for reducing sycophantic behavior in ALMs.</description>

      <title>DIFFA-2: A Practical Diffusion Large Language Model for General Audio Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large audio language models (LALMs) such as Qwen-2.5-Omni have achieved strong performance on audio understanding and interaction, but scaling them remains costly in data and computation, and strictly sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently been shown to make effective use of limited training data, and prior work on DIFFA indicates that replacing an AR backbone with a diffusion counterpart can substantially improve audio understanding under matched settings, albeit at a proof-of-concept scale without large-scale instruction tuning, preference alignment, or practical decoding schemes. We introduce DIFFA-2, a practical diffusion-based LALM for general audio understanding. DIFFA-2 upgrades the speech encoder, employs dual semantic and acoustic adapters, and is trained with a four-stage curriculum that combines semantic and acoustic alignment, large-scale supervised fine-tuning, and variance-reduced preference optimization, using only fully open-source corpora. Experiments on MMSU, MMAU, and MMAR show that DIFFA-2 consistently improves over DIFFA and is competitive to strong AR LALMs under practical training budgets, supporting diffusion-based modeling is a viable backbone for large-scale audio understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/NKU-HLT/DIFFA.git.</description>

      <title>Attention Isn't All You Need for Emotion Recognition:Domain Features Outperform Transformers on the EAV Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22161v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of multimodal emotion recognition using the EAV dataset, investigating whether complex attention mechanisms improve performance on small datasets. We implement three model categories: baseline transformers (M1), novel factorized attention mechanisms (M2), and improved CNN baselines (M3). Our experiments show that sophisticated attention mechanisms consistently underperform on small datasets. M2 models achieved 5 to 13 percentage points below baselines due to overfitting and destruction of pretrained features. In contrast, simple domain-appropriate modifications proved effective: adding delta MFCCs to the audio CNN improved accuracy from 61.9% to 65.56% (+3.66pp), while frequency-domain features for EEG achieved 67.62% (+7.62pp over the paper baseline). Our vision transformer baseline (M1) reached 75.30%, exceeding the paper's ViViT result (74.5%) through domain-specific pretraining, and vision delta features achieved 72.68% (+1.28pp over the paper CNN). These findings demonstrate that for small-scale emotion recognition, domain knowledge and proper implementation outperform architectural complexity.</description>

      <title>Proliferating series by Jean Barraqu\'e: a study and classification in mathematical terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barraqu\'e's proliferating series give an interesting turn on the concept of classic serialism by creating a new invariant when it comes to constructing the series: rather than the intervals between consecutive notes, what remains unaltered during the construction of the proliferations of the given base series is the permutation of the notes which happens between two consecutive series, that is to say, the transformation of the order of the notes in the series. This presents new possibilities for composers interested in the serial method, given the fact that the variety of intervals obtained by this method is far greater than that of classic serialism. In this manuscript, we will study some unexplored possibilities that the proliferating series offer from a mathematical point of view, which will allow composers to gain much more familiarity with them and potentially result in the creation of pieces that take serialism to the next level.</description>

      <title>MIRRORTALK: Forging Personalized Avatars Via Disentangled Style and Hierarchical Motion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing personalized talking faces that uphold and highlight a speaker's unique style while maintaining lip-sync accuracy remains a significant challenge. A primary limitation of existing approaches is the intrinsic confounding of speaker-specific talking style and semantic content within facial motions, which prevents the faithful transfer of a speaker's unique persona to arbitrary speech. In this paper, we propose MirrorTalk, a generative framework based on a conditional diffusion model, combined with a Semantically-Disentangled Style Encoder (SDSE) that can distill pure style representations from a brief reference video. To effectively utilize this representation, we further introduce a hierarchical modulation strategy within the diffusion process. This mechanism guides the synthesis by dynamically balancing the contributions of audio and style features across distinct facial regions, ensuring both precise lip-sync accuracy and expressive full-face dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MirrorTalk achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of lip-sync accuracy and personalization preservation.</description>

      <title>Streaming Speech Recognition with Decoder-Only Large Language Models and Latency Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated the potential of decoderonly large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, enabling streaming recognition within this framework remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a novel streaming ASR approach that integrates a read/write policy network with monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA) to dynamically segment speech embeddings. These segments are interleaved with label sequences during training, enabling seamless integration with the LLM. During inference, the audio stream is buffered until the MoChA module triggers a read signal, at which point the buffered segment together with the previous token is fed into the LLM for the next token prediction. We also introduce a minimal-latency training objective to guide the policy network toward accurate segmentation boundaries. Furthermore, we adopt a joint training strategy in which a non-streaming LLM-ASR model and our streaming model share parameters. Experiments on the AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 Mandarin benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms recent streaming ASR baselines, achieving character error rates of 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively. The latency optimization results in a 62.5% reduction in average token generation delay with negligible impact on recognition accuracy</description>

      <title>Compact Hypercube Embeddings for Fast Text-based Wildlife Observation Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale biodiversity monitoring platforms increasingly rely on multimodal wildlife observations. While recent foundation models enable rich semantic representations across vision, audio, and language, retrieving relevant observations from massive archives remains challenging due to the computational cost of high-dimensional similarity search. In this work, we introduce compact hypercube embeddings for fast text-based wildlife observation retrieval, a framework that enables efficient text-based search over large-scale wildlife image and audio databases using compact binary representations. Building on the cross-view code alignment hashing framework, we extend lightweight hashing beyond a single-modality setup to align natural language descriptions with visual or acoustic observations in a shared Hamming space. Our approach leverages pretrained wildlife foundation models, including BioCLIP and BioLingual, and adapts them efficiently for hashing using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on large-scale benchmarks, including iNaturalist2024 for text-to-image retrieval and iNatSounds2024 for text-to-audio retrieval, as well as multiple soundscape datasets to assess robustness under domain shift. Results show that retrieval using discrete hypercube embeddings achieves competitive, and in several cases superior, performance compared to continuous embeddings, while drastically reducing memory and search cost. Moreover, we observe that the hashing objective consistently improves the underlying encoder representations, leading to stronger retrieval and zero-shot generalization. These results demonstrate that binary, language-based retrieval enables scalable and efficient search over large wildlife archives for biodiversity monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>CALM: Joint Contextual Acoustic-Linguistic Modeling for Personalization of Multi-Speaker ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CALM, a joint Contextual Acoustic-Linguistic Modeling framework for multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR). In personalized AI scenarios, the joint availability of acoustic and linguistic cues naturally motivates the integration of target-speaker conditioning with contextual biasing in overlapping conversations. CALM implements this integration in an end-to-end framework through speaker embedding-driven target-speaker extraction and dynamic vocabulary-based contextual biasing. We evaluate CALM on simulated English (LibriSpeechMix) and Japanese (Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese mixtures, CSJMix). On two-speaker mixtures, CALM reduces biased word error rate (B-WER) from 12.7 to 4.7 on LibriSpeech2Mix and biased character error rate (B-CER) from 16.6 to 8.4 on CSJMix2 (eval3), demonstrating the effectiveness of joint acoustic-linguistic modeling across languages. We additionally report results on the AMI corpus (IHM-mix condition) to validate performance on standardized speech mixtures.</description>

      <title>EmoShift: Lightweight Activation Steering for Enhanced Emotion-Aware Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving precise and controllable emotional expression is crucial for producing natural and context-appropriate speech in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. However, many emotion-aware TTS systems, including large language model (LLM)-based designs, rely on scaling fixed emotion embeddings or external guidance, limiting their ability to model emotion-specific latent characteristics. To address this gap, we present EmoShift, a lightweight activation-steering framework incorporating a EmoSteer layer, which learns a steering vector for each target emotion in the output embedding space to capture its latent offset and maintain stable, appropriate expression across utterances and categories. With only 10M trainable parameters,less than 1/30 of full fine-tuning, EmoShift outperforms zero-shot and fully fine-tuned baselines in objective and subjective evaluations, enhancing emotional expressiveness while preserving naturalness and speaker similarity. Further analysis confirms the proposed EmoSteer layer's effectiveness and reveals its potential for controllable emotional intensity in speech synthesis.</description>

      <title>DiffuSpeech: Silent Thought, Spoken Answer via Unified Speech-Text Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current speech language models generate responses directly without explicit reasoning, leading to errors that cannot be corrected once audio is produced. We introduce \textbf{``Silent Thought, Spoken Answer''} -- a paradigm where speech LLMs generate internal text reasoning alongside spoken responses, with thinking traces informing speech quality. To realize this, we present \method{}, the first diffusion-based speech-text language model supporting both understanding and generation, unifying discrete text and tokenized speech under a single masked diffusion framework. Unlike autoregressive approaches, \method{} jointly generates reasoning traces and speech tokens through iterative denoising, with modality-specific masking schedules. We also construct \dataset{}, the first speech QA dataset with paired text reasoning traces, containing 26K samples totaling 319 hours. Experiments show \method{} achieves state-of-the-art speech-to-speech QA accuracy, outperforming the best baseline by up to 9 points, while attaining the best TTS quality among generative models (6.2\% WER) and preserving language understanding (66.2\% MMLU). Ablations confirm that both the diffusion architecture and thinking traces contribute to these gains.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fixed Frames: Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural audio codecs are at the core of modern conversational speech technologies, converting continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens that can be processed by LLMs. However, existing codecs typically operate at fixed frame rates, allocating tokens uniformly in time and producing unnecessarily long sequences. In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs.</description>

      <title>Location-Oriented Sound Event Localization and Detection with Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) combines the Sound Event Detection (SED) with the corresponding Direction Of Arrival (DOA). Recently, adopted event oriented multi-track methods affect the generality in polyphonic environments due to the limitation of the number of tracks. To enhance the generality in polyphonic environments, we propose Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization for SELD (SMRL-SELD). SMRL-SELD segments the 3D spatial space, mapping it to a 2D plane, and a new regression localization loss is proposed to help the results converge toward the location of the corresponding event. SMRL-SELD is location-oriented, allowing the model to learn event features based on orientation. Thus, the method enables the model to process polyphonic sounds regardless of the number of overlapping events. We conducted experiments on STARSS23 and STARSS22 datasets and our proposed SMRL-SELD outperforms the existing SELD methods in overall evaluation and polyphony environments.</description>

      <title>BNMusic: Blending Environmental Noises into Personalized Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However, misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work, we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

      <title>FLM-Audio: Natural Monologues Improves Native Full-Duplex Chatbots via Dual Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Full-duplex dialog models aim to listen and speak simultaneously, delivering rapid responses to dynamic user input. Among different solutions to full-duplexity, a native solution merges multiple channels in each time step, achieving the lowest latency. However, prevailing designs break down the textual monologue sentences for word-level alignment with audio streams, which degrades language modeling abilities. To help address this issue, we introduce "contiguous monologues", which are composed by continuous sentences and "waiting" intervals, mimicking human-like cognitive behavior in dialogs. We find a proper training paradigm to be critical for semantically aligning contiguous monologues with audio. To this end, we develop a "dual" training paradigm that alternates the position of the monologues, either leading or trailing the audio, across different training stages. A combination of our contiguous monologue and dual training strategy is applied in developing FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog chatbot with native full-duplexity. As confirmed by experimental results, FLM-Audio achieves superior response qualities and chatting experiences while requiring significantly less training data.</description>

      <title>Impact of Phonetics on Speaker Identity in Adversarial Voice Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial perturbations in speech pose a serious threat to automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker verification by introducing subtle waveform modifications that remain imperceptible to humans but can significantly alter system outputs. While targeted attacks on end-to-end ASR models have been widely studied, the phonetic basis of these perturbations and their effect on speaker identity remain underexplored. In this work, we analyze adversarial audio at the phonetic level and show that perturbations exploit systematic confusions such as vowel centralization and consonant substitutions. These distortions not only mislead transcription but also degrade phonetic cues critical for speaker verification, leading to identity drift. Using DeepSpeech as our ASR target, we generate targeted adversarial examples and evaluate their impact on speaker embeddings across genuine and impostor samples. Results across 16 phonetically diverse target phrases demonstrate that adversarial audio induces both transcription errors and identity drift, highlighting the need for phonetic-aware defenses to ensure the robustness of ASR and speaker recognition systems.</description>

      <title>Thinking in cocktail party: Chain-of-Thought and reinforcement learning for target speaker automatic speech recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Target Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition (TS-ASR) aims to transcribe the speech of a specified target speaker from multi-speaker mixtures in cocktail party scenarios. Recent advancement of Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) has already brought some new insights to TS-ASR. However, significant room for optimization remains for the TS-ASR task within the LALMs architecture. While Chain of Thoughts (CoT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven effective in certain speech tasks, TS-ASR, which requires the model to deeply comprehend speech signals, differentiate various speakers, and handle overlapping utterances is particularly well-suited to a reasoning-guided approach. Therefore, we propose a novel framework that incorporates CoT and RL training into TS-ASR for performance improvement. A novel CoT dataset of TS-ASR is constructed, and the TS-ASR model is first trained on regular data and then fine-tuned on CoT data. Finally, the model is further trained with RL using selected data to enhance generalized reasoning capabilities. Experiment results show a significant improvement of TS-ASR performance with CoT and RL training, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed CoT and RL training methods adapted for the TS-ASR task.</description>

      <title>CompSpoof: A Dataset and Joint Learning Framework for Component-Level Audio Anti-spoofing Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Component-level audio Spoofing (Comp-Spoof) targets a new form of audio manipulation where only specific components of a signal, such as speech or environmental sound, are forged or substituted while other components remain genuine. Existing anti-spoofing datasets and methods treat an utterance or a segment as entirely bona fide or entirely spoofed, and thus cannot accurately detect component-level spoofing. To address this, we construct a new dataset, CompSpoof, covering multiple combinations of bona fide and spoofed speech and environmental sound. We further propose a separation-enhanced joint learning framework that separates audio components apart and applies anti-spoofing models to each one. Joint learning is employed, preserving information relevant for detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline, highlighting the necessity of separate components and the importance of detecting spoofing for each component separately. Datasets and code are available at: https://github.com/XuepingZhang/CompSpoof.</description>

      <title>DDSC: Dynamic Dual-Signal Curriculum for Data-Efficient Acoustic Scene Classification under Domain Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic scene classification (ASC) suffers from device-induced domain shift, especially when labels are limited. Prior work focuses on curriculum-based training schedules that structure data presentation by ordering or reweighting training examples from easy-to-hard to facilitate learning; however, existing curricula are static, fixing the ordering or the weights before training and ignoring that example difficulty and marginal utility evolve with the learned representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Dynamic Dual-Signal Curriculum (DDSC), a training schedule that adapts the curriculum online by combining two signals computed each epoch: a domain-invariance signal and a learning-progress signal. A time-varying scheduler fuses these signals into per-example weights that prioritize domain-invariant examples in early epochs and progressively emphasize device-specific cases. DDSC is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and introduces no additional inference overhead. Under the official DCASE 2024 Task~1 protocol, DDSC consistently improves cross-device performance across diverse ASC baselines and label budgets, with the largest gains on unseen-device splits.</description>

      <title>TopSeg: A Multi-Scale Topological Framework for Data-Efficient Heart Sound Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning approaches for heart-sound (PCG) segmentation built on time-frequency features can be accurate but often rely on large expert-labeled datasets, limiting robustness and deployment. We present TopSeg, a topological representation-centric framework that encodes PCG dynamics with multi-scale topological features and decodes them using a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) with an order- and duration-constrained inference step. To evaluate data efficiency and generalization, we train exclusively on PhysioNet 2016 dataset with subject-level subsampling and perform external validation on CirCor dataset. Under matched-capacity decoders, the topological features consistently outperform spectrogram and envelope inputs, with the largest margins at low data budgets; as a full system, TopSeg surpasses representative end-to-end baselines trained on their native inputs under the same budgets while remaining competitive at full data. Ablations at 10% training confirm that all scales contribute and that combining H_0 and H_1 yields more reliable S1/S2 localization and boundary stability. These results indicate that topology-aware representations provide a strong inductive bias for data-efficient, cross-dataset PCG segmentation, supporting practical use when labeled data are limited.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Frameworks for Unsupervised Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses unsupervised diffusion-based single-channel speech enhancement (SE). Prior work in this direction combines a score-based diffusion model trained on clean speech with a Gaussian noise model whose covariance is structured by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). This combination is used within an iterative expectation-maximization (EM) scheme, in which a diffusion-based posterior-sampling E-step estimates the clean speech. We first revisit this framework and propose to explicitly model both speech and acoustic noise as latent variables, jointly sampling them in the E-step instead of sampling speech alone as in previous approaches. We then introduce a new unsupervised SE framework that replaces the NMF noise prior with a diffusion-based noise model, learned jointly with the speech prior in a single conditional score model. Within this framework, we derive two variants: one that implicitly accounts for noise and one that explicitly treats noise as a latent variable. Experiments on WSJ0-QUT and VoiceBank-DEMAND show that explicit noise modeling systematically improves SE performance for both NMF-based and diffusion-based noise priors. Under matched conditions, the diffusion-based noise model attains the best overall quality and intelligibility among unsupervised methods, while under mismatched conditions the proposed NMF-based explicit-noise framework is more robust and suffers less degradation than several supervised baselines.</description>

      <title>LLM-ForcedAligner: A Non-Autoregressive and Accurate LLM-Based Forced Aligner for Multilingual and Long-Form Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forced alignment (FA) predicts start and end timestamps for words or characters in speech, but existing methods are language-specific and prone to cumulative temporal shifts. The multilingual speech understanding and long-sequence processing abilities of speech large language models (SLLMs) make them promising for FA in multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech settings. However, directly applying the next-token prediction paradigm of SLLMs to FA results in hallucinations and slow inference. To bridge the gap, we propose LLM-ForcedAligner, reformulating FA as a slot-filling paradigm: timestamps are treated as discrete indices, and special timestamp tokens are inserted as slots into the transcript. Conditioned on the speech embeddings and the transcript with slots, the SLLM directly predicts the time indices at slots. During training, causal attention masking with non-shifted input and label sequences allows each slot to predict its own timestamp index based on itself and preceding context, with loss computed only at slot positions. Dynamic slot insertion enables FA at arbitrary positions. Moreover, non-autoregressive inference is supported, avoiding hallucinations and improving speed. Experiments across multilingual, crosslingual, and long-form speech scenarios show that LLM-ForcedAligner achieves a 69%~78% relative reduction in accumulated averaging shift compared with prior methods. Checkpoint and inference code are available at https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-ASR.</description>

      <title>Text-only adaptation in LLM-based ASR through text denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adapting automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on large language models (LLMs) to new domains using text-only data is a significant yet underexplored challenge. Standard fine-tuning of the LLM on target-domain text often disrupts the critical alignment between speech and text modalities learned by the projector, degrading performance. We introduce a novel text-only adaptation method that emulates the audio projection task by treating it as a text denoising task. Our approach thus trains the LLM to recover clean transcripts from noisy inputs. This process effectively adapts the model to a target domain while preserving cross-modal alignment. Our solution is lightweight, requiring no architectural changes or additional parameters. Extensive evaluation on two datasets demonstrates up to 22.1% relative improvement, outperforming recent state-of-the-art text-only adaptation methods.</description>

Abstract: Objective assessment of source-separation systems still mismatches subjective human perception, especially when leakage and self-distortion interact. We introduce the Perceptual Separation (PS) and Perceptual Match (PM), the first pair of measures that functionally isolate these two factors. Our intrusive method begins with generating a bank of fundamental distortions for each reference waveform signal in the mixture. Distortions, references, and their respective system outputs from all sources are then independently encoded by a pre-trained self-supervised learning model. These representations are aggregated and projected onto a manifold via diffusion maps, which aligns Euclidean distances on the manifold with dissimilarities of the encoded waveforms. On this manifold, the PM measures the Mahalanobis distance from each output to its attributed cluster that consists of its reference and distortions embeddings, capturing self-distortion. The PS accounts for the Mahalanobis distance of the output to the attributed and to the closest non-attributed clusters, quantifying leakage. Both measures are differentiable and granular, operating at a resolution as low as 50 frames per second. We further derive, for both measures, deterministic error radius and non-asymptotic, high-probability confidence intervals (CIs). Experiments on English, Spanish, and music mixtures show that the PS and PM nearly always achieve the highest linear correlation coefficients with human mean-opinion scores than 14 competitors, reaching as high as 86.36% for speech and 87.21% for music. We observe, at worst, an error radius of 1.39% and a probabilistic 95% CI of 12.21% for these coefficients, which improves reliable and informed evaluation. Using mutual information, the measures complement each other most as their values decrease, suggesting they are jointly more informative as system performance degrades.</description>

      <title>Are Modern Speech Enhancement Systems Vulnerable to Adversarial Attacks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning approaches for speech enhancement are becoming increasingly expressive, enabling ever more powerful modifications of input signals. In this paper, we demonstrate that this expressiveness introduces a vulnerability: advanced speech enhancement models can be susceptible to adversarial attacks. Specifically, we show that adversarial noise, carefully crafted and psychoacoustically masked by the original input, can be injected such that the enhanced speech output conveys an entirely different semantic meaning. We experimentally verify that contemporary predictive speech enhancement models can indeed be manipulated in this way. Furthermore, we highlight that diffusion models with stochastic samplers exhibit inherent robustness to such adversarial attacks by design.</description>

      <title>SynthCloner: Synthesizer-style Audio Transfer via Factorized Codec with ADSR Envelope Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic synthesizer sounds are controlled by parameter settings that yield complex timbral characteristics and ADSR envelopes, making synthesizer-style audio transfer particularly challenging. Recent approaches to timbre transfer often rely on spectral objectives or implicit style matching, offering limited control over envelope shaping. Moreover, public synthesizer datasets rarely provide diverse coverage of timbres and ADSR envelopes. To address these gaps, we present SynthCloner, a factorized codec model that disentangles audio into three attributes: ADSR envelope, timbre, and content. This separation enables expressive audio transfer with independent control over these attributes. Additionally, we introduce SynthCAT, a new synthesizer dataset with a task-specific rendering pipeline covering 250 timbres, 120 ADSR envelopes, and 100 MIDI sequences. Experiments show that SynthCloner outperforms baselines on both objective and subjective metrics, while enabling independent attribute control. The code, model checkpoint, and audio examples are available at https://buffett0323.github.io/synthcloner/.</description>

      <title>Speech Emotion Recognition with ASR Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) plays a pivotal role in understanding human communication, enabling emotionally intelligent systems, and serving as a fundamental component in the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, deploying SER in real-world, spontaneous, and low-resource scenarios remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of emotional expression and the limitations of current speech and language technologies. This thesis investigates the integration of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) into SER, with the goal of enhancing the robustness, scalability, and practical applicability of emotion recognition from spoken language.</description>

      <title>Qwen3-ASR Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this report, we introduce Qwen3-ASR family, which includes two powerful all-in-one speech recognition models and a novel non-autoregressive speech forced alignment model. Qwen3-ASR-1.7B and Qwen3-ASR-0.6B are ASR models that support language identification and ASR for 52 languages and dialects. Both of them leverage large-scale speech training data and the strong audio understanding ability of their foundation model Qwen3-Omni. We conduct comprehensive internal evaluation besides the open-sourced benchmarks as ASR models might differ little on open-sourced benchmark scores but exhibit significant quality differences in real-world scenarios. The experiments reveal that the 1.7B version achieves SOTA performance among open-sourced ASR models and is competitive with the strongest proprietary APIs while the 0.6B version offers the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Qwen3-ASR-0.6B can achieve an average TTFT as low as 92ms and transcribe 2000 seconds speech in 1 second at a concurrency of 128. Qwen3-ForcedAligner-0.6B is an LLM based NAR timestamp predictor that is able to align text-speech pairs in 11 languages. Timestamp accuracy experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the three strongest force alignment models and takes more advantages in efficiency and versatility. To further accelerate the community research of ASR and audio understanding, we release these models under the Apache 2.0 license.</description>
