      <title>Parametric resonance, chaos and spatial structure in the Lotka-Volterra model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Lotka-Volterra model for predator-prey competition with a finite carrying capacity that varies periodically in time, modeling seasonal variations in nutrients or food resources. In the absence of time variability, the ordinary differential equations have an equilibrium point that represents coexisting predators and prey. The time dependence removes this equilibrium solution, but the equilibrium point is restored by allowing the predation rate also to vary in time. This equilibrium can undergo a parametric resonance instability, leading to subharmonic and harmonic time-periodic behavior, which persists even when the predation rate is constant. We also find period-doubling bifurcations and chaotic dynamics. If we allow the population densities to vary in space as well as time, introducing diffusion into the model, we find that variations in space diffuse away when the underlying dynamics is periodic in time, but spatiotemporal structure persists when the underlying dynamics is chaotic. We interpret this as a competition between diffusion, which makes the population densities homogeneous in space, and chaos, where sensitive dependence on initial conditions leads to different locations in space following different trajectories in time. Patterns and spatial structure are known to enhance resilience in ecosystems, suggesting that chaotic time-dependent dynamics arising from seasonal variations in carrying capacity and leading to spatial structure, might also enhance resilience.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Quantum Coherent Superradiant States in Relation to Exciton-Phonon Interactions and the Fundamental Soliton in Hybrid Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of macroscopic coherent quantum states at room temperature is crucial in modern quantum technologies. In light of recent experiments demonstrating high-temperature superfluorescence in hybrid perovskite thin films, in this work we investigate the stability of the superradiant state concerning exciton-phonon interactions. We focused on a quasi-2D Wannier exciton interacting with longitudinal optical (LO) phonons in polar crystals, as well as with acoustic phonons. Our study leads to the derivation of nonlinear equations in the coordinate space that govern the exciton wavefunction's coefficient in the single-exciton basis for the lowest exciton state, which translates to the complex-valued polarization. The resulting equations take the form of a 2D nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. We perform a linear stability analysis of the plane wave solutions for the equations in question, which allows us to establish stability criteria. This analysis is particularly important for evaluating the stability of the superradiant state in the considered quasi-2D structures, as the superradiant state represents a specific case of the plane wave solution. Our findings indicate that, when the exciton interacts with LO phonons, a plane wave solution is modulationally stable, provided that the square of its amplitude does not exceed a critical intensity value defined by the exciton-LO phonon interaction parameters. Furthermore, interactions between the exciton and acoustic phonons reduce the intensity of modulationally stable waves compared to the case without such interactions. Our analytical results are corroborated by numerical calculations. We also numerically solve the 2D nonlocal NLS equation in the polar coordinates and obtain its fundamental soliton solution, which is stable.</description>

      <title>Novel reaction-diffusion PDE model for fingerprint-like pattern emergence via the Schnakenberg mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fingerprint analysis and fingerprint identification have been the most widely used tools for human identification. To this day, various models have been proposed to explain how fingerprints are formed, ranging from the fibroblast model, which focuses on cell-collagen interactions, to the buckling of thin layers model, both yielding significant results. In this work, we present a reaction-diffusion model of Schnakenberg type, featuring an anisotropic diffusion matrix that follows the ridge orientations supplied by other traditional fingerprint-generation models, and notably yet allows minutiae -- i.e. characteristic microstructures embedded in fingerprints -- to emerge. The statistical analysis of the minutiae distribution in a randomly generated fingerprint collection is consistent with observations in real fingerprints. The model can numerically generate fingerprint-like patterns corresponding to the four basic classifications -- arches, ulnar loops, radial loops, and whorls -- as well as a variety of derived forms. The generated patterns emerge on a convex domain that mimics the geometry of a fingertip, exhibiting the diverse types of minutiae typically analyzed in fingerprint identification and showing strong agreement with those observed in human fingerprints. This model also provides insight into how levels of certainty in human identification can be achieved when based on minutiae positions. All the algorithms are implemented in an open source software named GenCHSin.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-induced activity patterns of active-inactive clusters in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present activity patterns consisting of active and inactive clusters of synchronized nodes in networks. We call a cluster active if nodes in it have nonzero velocity and inactive vice versa. The simultaneous invariance of active and inactive clusters poses a challenge because fluctuations from active clusters must cancel out for a desired cluster to be inactive. With the help of permutation symmetries in network topology and selecting dynamics on top such that internal dynamics and coupling functions are odd functions in the phase space, we demonstrate that such a combination of structure and dynamics exhibits (stable) invariant patterns consisting of active and inactive clusters. Symmetry breaking of synchronized clusters creates active clusters that are in antisynchrony with each other, resulting in the cancellation of fluctuations for clusters connected with these antisynchronous clusters. Furthermore, as the coupling between nodes changes, active clusters lose their activity at different coupling values, and the network transitions from one activity pattern to another. Numerical simulations have been presented for networks of Van der Pol and Stuart-Landau oscillators. We extend the master stability approach to these patterns and provide stability conditions for their existence.</description>

      <title>Bistability of travelling waves and wave-pinning states in a mass-conserved reaction-diffusion system: From bifurcations to implications for actin waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12213</link>

Abstract: Eukaryotic cells demonstrate a wide variety of dynamic patterns of filamentous actin (F-actin) and its regulators. Some of these patterns play important roles in cell functions, such as distinct motility modes, which motivate this study. We devise a mass-conserved reaction-diffusion model for active and inactive Rho-GTPase and F-actin in the cell cortex. The mass-conserved Rho-GTPase system promotes F-actin, which feeds back to inactivate the former. We study the model on a 1D periodic domain (edge of thin sheet-like cell) using bifurcation theory in the framework of spatial dynamics, complemented with numerical simulations. Among several discussed bifurcations, the analysis centers on the study of the codimension-2 long wavelength and finite wavenumber Hopf instability, in which we describe a rich structure of steady wave-pinning states (a.k.a. mesas, obeying the Maxwell construction), propagating coherent solutions (fronts and excitable pulses), and travelling and standing waves, all distinguished by mass conservation regimes and classified by domain sizes. Specifically, we highlight the unexpected conditions for bistability between steady wave-pinning and travelling wave states on moderate domain sizes, i.e., unfolding through domain length. These results uncover and exemplify possible mechanisms of coexistence, robustness, and transitions between distinct cellular motility modes, including directed migration, turning, and ruffling. More broadly, the results indicate that non-gradient reaction-diffusion models comprising mass conservation have distinct pattern formation mechanisms that motivate further investigations, such as the unfolding of codimension-3 instabilities and T-points.</description>
