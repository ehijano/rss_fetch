      <title>Five Circles: Real Analysis Theorems equivalent to Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an exposition of the work of O. Riemenschneider about five ''circles'' of implications relating real analysis theorems each equivalent to the Dedekind completeness of the real field. These circles cover five elements of real function theory: convergence, connectedness, differentiability, compactness and integration.</description>

      <title>Gender and assessment in mathematics: a comparative study of managing assessment episodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article focuses on the differences in mathematics performance between girls and boys visible from the first four months of compulsory schooling in the French education system. The influence of gender stereotypes in the evaluation practices of teachers and the threat of the gender stereotype on student performance are questioned. To obtain answers, a comparative study of management of evaluative episodes is proposed based on different theoretical tools.</description>

      <title>AI for Mathematics: Progress, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI for Mathematics (AI4Math) has emerged as a distinct field that leverages machine learning to navigate mathematical landscapes historically intractable for early symbolic systems. While mid-20th-century symbolic approaches successfully automated formal logic, they faced severe scalability limitations due to the combinatorial explosion of the search space. The recent integration of data-driven approaches has revitalized this pursuit. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of AI4Math, highlighting its primary focus on developing AI models to support mathematical research. Crucially, we emphasize that this is not merely the application of AI to mathematical activities; it also encompasses the development of stronger AI systems where the rigorous nature of mathematics serves as a premier testbed for advancing general reasoning capabilities. We categorize existing research into two complementary directions: problem-specific modeling, involving the design of specialized architectures for distinct mathematical tasks, and general-purpose modeling, focusing on foundation models capable of broader reasoning, retrieval, and exploratory workflows. We conclude by discussing key challenges and prospects, advocating for AI systems that go beyond facilitating formal correctness to enabling the discovery of meaningful results and unified theories, recognizing that the true value of a proof lies in the insights and tools it offers to the broader mathematical landscape.</description>

      <title>Observing rurality of a geographical area from road graph geometry -- a qualitative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze the Finnish road network as a graph in order to measure whether the "rurality" or "urbanity" of an area correlates with local geometrical properties of the graph. Our primary motivation is the observation that the road systems in rural areas look similar to hyperbolic graphs, while in large cities they resemble more the Cayley graph of $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We do not aim for a comprehensive analysis, but rather wish to demonstrate that this observation can be measured and analyzed through looking at various "hyperbolicity measures" of randomly sampled geodesic triangles in the road graph.</description>

      <title>Research projects and Moscow Mathematical Conference for high school students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shares some experience in advanced mathematical education. We show how a high school student can be naturally and gradually introduced to basic steps of scientific research: developing intuition by finding and correcting mistakes through discussions and writing a paper, (transparent) anonymous peer review, recognition and award. We show that most of this can be done in research projects not aiming at scientific novelty. We share the experience (both principles and examples) of the Moscow Mathematical Conference of High School Students.</description>
