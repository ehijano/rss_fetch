      <title>Enhancing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm in systems with large condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers an exponential speedup in system size for treating linear equations of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ on quantum computers when compared to their traditional counterparts, it faces a challenge related to the condition number ($\mathcal{\kappa}$) scaling of the $A$ matrix. In this work, we address the issue by introducing the post-selection-improved HHL (Psi-HHL) approach that involves a simple yet effective modification of the HHL algorithm to extract a feature of $|x\rangle$, and which leads to achieving optimal behaviour in $\mathcal{\kappa}$ (linear scaling) for large condition number situations. This has the important practical implication of having to use substantially fewer shots relative to the traditional HHL algorithm. We carry out two sets of simulations, where we go up to 26-qubit calculations, to demonstrate the ability of Psi-HHL to handle situations involving large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ matrices via: (a) a set of toy matrices, for which we go up to size $64 \times 64$ and $\mathcal{\kappa}$ values of up to $\approx$ 1 million, and (b) a deep-dive into quantum chemistry, where we consider matrices up to size $256 \times 256$ that reach $\mathcal{\kappa}$ of about 466. The molecular systems that we consider are Li$_{\mathrm{2}}$, RbH, and CsH. Although the feature of $|x\rangle$ considered in our examples is an overlap between the input and output states of the HHL algorithm, our approach is general and can be applied in principle to any transition matrix element involving $|x\rangle$.</description>

      <title>Energy Transport Among Highly-Polarized Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A static electric field of a few V/cm shifts the energy levels of ultracold Rydberg atoms in a magneto-optical trap. For a given principle quantum number, most of the energy levels are nearly degenerate at zero field and fan out with increasing field to form a manifold. We excite Rydberg atoms to energy levels near the center of the manifold, where the spacing is nearly harmonic, and allow them to exchange energy via resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We measure the time evolution as energy spreads away from the center of the manifold, which reveals that the system fails to thermalize for long interaction times. A computational model that includes only a few essential features of the system qualitatively agrees with this result.</description>

      <title>Final state interactions for high energy scattering off atomic electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the scattering of high energy leptons off bound atomic electrons focusing primarily on final state interactions i.e., the exchange of virtual photons between the outgoing energetic electron, and the heavy residual charged "debris" in the final state. These effects are inherently absent from calculations for a free electron at rest. Coulomb exchanges are enhanced by the large number of electrons in the atomic debris, and are unsuppressed by non-relativistic velocities in the debris. We find that these exchanges can be resummed using operator methods, and cancel at the level of the cross section until at least $O(\alpha^3)$. Furthermore, we argue that both final {\it and} initial state Coulomb exchanges (enhanced by the number of electrons in the atom) do not affect the cross section until at least $O(\alpha^3)$. Transverse photon couplings to non relativistic electrons are proportional to their small velocities, and rotational invariance suppresses their contribution to $O(\alpha^3)$. Our results are relevant for precision experiments involving neutrinos, electrons, positrons, and muons scattering off of atomic electrons in a fixed target.</description>

      <title>Spin noise spectroscopy of an alignment-based atomic magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) are revolutionising the task of magnetic-field sensing due to their extremely high sensitivity combined with technological improvements in miniaturisation which have led to compact and portable devices. OPMs can be based on spin-oriented or spin-aligned atomic ensembles which are spin-polarized through optical pumping with circular or linear polarized light, respectively. Characterisation of OPMs and the dynamical properties of their noise is important for applications in real-time sensing tasks. In our work, we experimentally perform spin noise spectroscopy of an alignment-based magnetometer. Moreover, we propose a stochastic model that predicts the noise power spectra exhibited by the device when, apart from the strong magnetic field responsible for the Larmor precession of the spin, white noise is applied in the perpendicular direction aligned with the pumping-probing beam. By varying the strength of the noise applied as well as the linear-polarisation angle of incoming light, we verify the model to accurately predict the heights of the Larmor-induced spectral peaks and their corresponding line-widths. Our work paves the way for alignment-based magnetometers to become operational in real-time sensing tasks.</description>

      <title>Strong-Field Ionization Phenomena Revealed by Quantum Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the photoionization dynamics of atoms subjected to intense, ultrashort laser pulses through the use of quantum trajectories. This method provides a unique and consistent framework for examining electron dynamics within a time-dependent potential barrier. Our findings demonstrate that quantum trajectories offer additional insights into several key aspects of strong-field ionization, including the transition between ionization regimes, non-adiabatic effects under the barrier, the impact of the shape of the electronic potential, and the efficiency of over-the-barrier ionization.</description>

      <title>Tunneling dynamics of $^{164}$Dy supersolids and droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tunneling dynamics of a magnetic $^{164}$Dy quantum gas in an elongated or pancake skewed double-well trap is investigated with a time-dependent extended Gross-Pitaevskii approach. Upon lifting the energy offset, different tunneling regimes can be identified. In the elongated trap and for sufficiently large offset, the different configurations exhibit collective macroscopic tunneling. For smaller offset, partial reflection from and transmission through the barrier lead to density accumulation in both wells, and eventually to tunneling-locking. One can also reach the macroscopic self-trapping regime for increasing relative dipolar interaction strength, while tunneling vanishes for large barrier heights. A richer dynamical behavior is observed for the pancake-like trap. For instance, the supersolid maintains its shape, while the superfluid density gets distorted signifying the emergence of peculiar excitation patterns in the macroscopic tunneling regime. The findings reported here may offer new ways to probe distinctive dynamical features in the supersolid and droplet regimes.</description>
