      <title>On the number of non-degenerate canalizing Boolean functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canalization is a key organizing principle in complex systems, particularly in gene regulatory networks. It describes how certain input variables exert dominant control over a function's output, thereby imposing hierarchical structure and conferring robustness to perturbations. Degeneracy, in contrast, captures redundancy among input variables and reflects the complete dominance of some variables by others. Both properties influence the stability and dynamics of discrete dynamical systems, yet their combinatorial underpinnings remain incompletely understood. Here, we derive recursive formulas for counting Boolean functions with prescribed numbers of essential variables and given canalizing properties. In particular, we determine the number of non-degenerate canalizing Boolean functions -- that is, functions for which all variables are essential and at least one variable is canalizing. Our approach extends earlier enumeration results on canalizing and nested canalizing functions. It provides a rigorous foundation for quantifying how frequently canalization occurs among random Boolean functions and for assessing its pronounced over-representation in biological network models, where it contributes to both robustness and to the emergence of distinct regulatory roles.</description>

      <title>The Strong Birthday Problem Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Strong Birthday Problem (SBP) introduced in [1]. The problem is stated as follows: what is the minimum number of people we have to choose so that everyone has a shared birthday with probability at least 1/2? We derive recurrence relations to compute the probability, and further show a nice connection to the associated Stirling numbers of the second kind to derive additional recurrences. We implement the recurrences using dynamic programming as well as compute the values using the combinatorial formula, and provide numerical results.</description>

      <title>Tensor decomposition beyond uniqueness, with an application to the minrank problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a generalization to Jennrich's uniqueness theorem for tensor decompositions in the undercomplete setting. Our uniqueness theorem is based on an alternative definition of the standard tensor decomposition, which we call matrix-vector decomposition. Moreover, in the same settings in which our uniqueness theorem applies, we also design and analyze an efficient randomized algorithm to compute the unique minimum matrix-vector decomposition (and thus a tensor rank decomposition of minimum rank).
  As an application of our uniqueness theorem and our efficient algorithm, we show how to compute all matrices of minimum rank (up to scalar multiples) in certain generic vector spaces of matrices.</description>

      <title>Bijections Between Smirnov Words and Hamiltonian Cycles in Complete Multipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a bijective correspondence between Smirnov words with balanced letter multiplicities and Hamiltonian paths in complete $m$-partite graphs $K_{n,n,\ldots,n}$. This bijection allows us to derive closed inclusion-exclusion formulas for the number of Hamiltonian cycles in such graphs. We further extend the enumeration to the generalized nonuniform case $K_{n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_m}$. We also provide an asymptotic analysis based on Stirling's approximation, which yields compact factorial expressions and logarithmic expansions describing the growth of the number of Hamiltonian cycles in the considered graphs. Our approach unifies the combinatorial study of adjacency-constrained words and the enumeration of Hamiltonian cycles within a single analytical framework.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion: When Is the Diameter Bound Necessary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study when the diameter bound s is essential for the tractability of the s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion problem. Given a graph G = (V, E) and integers k and s, the goal is to delete at most k edges so that every connected component of the resulting graph has diameter at most s. This problem generalizes Cluster Edge Deletion (s = 1) and captures distance-bounded clustering tasks.
  Montecchiani et al. (Information and Computation, 2023) proved that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by s + tw(G) and asked whether dependence on s is necessary. We answer negatively by showing W[1]-hardness when parameterized by pathwidth (and hence by treewidth), proving that s cannot in general be dropped. On the positive side, we show FPT algorithms parameterized by treedepth, neighborhood diversity, or cluster vertex deletion number, extending results of Italiano et al. (Algorithmica, 2023) and Komusiewicz and Uhlmann (SOFSEM, 2011). We also show that no polynomial kernel exists when parameterized by vertex cover number, even for s = 2.
  Classically, the problem is NP-hard on split graphs for s = 2, complementing the polynomial case s = 1. We give an FPT bicriteria approximation scheme running in f(k, 1/epsilon) * n^{O(1)} that outputs a set of at most k deletions whose components have diameter at most (1 + epsilon)s. Finally, we introduce a directed generalization, s-Club Cluster Arc Deletion, extending the undirected case to reachability distances, and show it is W[1]-hard in parameter k even on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).</description>

      <title>Larger holes as narrower degree distributions in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the analysis of loops is not so much because of the complications, it has already been found that heuristically enhancing loops decreases the variance of degree distributions for improving the robustness of connectivity. While many real scale-free networks are known to contain shorter loops such as triangles, it remains to investigate the distributions of longer loops in more wide class of networks. We find a relation between narrower degree distributions and longer loops in investigating the lengths of the shortest loops in various networks with continuously changing degree distributions, including three typical types of realistic scale-free networks, classical Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, and regular networks. In particular, we show that narrower degree distributions contain longer shortest loops, as a universal property in a wide class of random networks. We suggest that the robustness of connectivity is enhanced by constructing long loops of O(log N).</description>
