      <title>Machine-Learning Classification of Neutron-Star Matter Composition from Macroscopic and Oscillation Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic composition of neutron star interiors remains uncertain, with possible scenarios including nucleonic matter, hyperonic matter, dark matter admixed cores, and strange self-bound matter. Traditional constraints on the equation of state rely on Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff modelling and comparison with multimessenger observations, but machine learning provides a complementary pathway by learning composition dependent patterns directly from astrophysically accessible observables. This work presents a compact supervised learning framework for EOS family classification using stellar properties derived from TOV modelling, asteroseismology, and gravitational wave descriptors. A labelled dataset of neutron star configurations spanning four EOS families (nucleonic, strange matter, dark matter admixed, and hyperonic) is constructed using seven input features: gravitational mass, radius, fundamental f mode frequency, quadrupole moment, redshift, damping time, and characteristic strain. A multilayer perceptron is trained to infer the underlying matter composition. On a held out test set, the classifier achieves an accuracy of 97.4 percent with strong class wise precision and recall. Permutation based feature importance analysis shows that oscillation related quantities, especially the f mode frequency and damping time, dominate the discriminatory power, while mass and radius provide secondary support. Residual misclassifications occur in physically intuitive regions where different EOS families produce partially overlapping macroscopic signatures. These results show that lightweight neural models can reliably identify EOS family fingerprints from a modest set of observables, providing a reproducible baseline for future extensions incorporating Bayesian uncertainty and observational posteriors from NICER and gravitational wave events.</description>

      <title>COBIPLANE: A Systematic Search for Compact Binary Millisecond Pulsars at Low Galactic Latitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the main results obtained from the COmpact BInary Pulsar search in the low-LAtitude NEighborhood (COBIPLANE), an optical photometric survey designed to find new `spider' binary millisecond pulsars. We conducted observations targeting 30 unidentified sources from the 4FGL-DR3 Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) catalog, selected for their pulsar-like $\gamma$-ray properties. Extending to Galactic latitudes as low as $\pm3^{\circ}$, this survey reaches closer to the Galactic plane than its predecessor survey, the COmpact BInary PULsar SEarch (COBIPULSE). We report the discovery of five optical variables coincident with the localizations of 4FGL J0821.5-1436, 4FGL J1517.9-5233, 4FGL J1639.3-5146, 4FGL J1748.8-3915, and 4FGL J2056.4+3142. These systems show optical flux modulation at the presumed orbital periods of $0.41576(6) \ \mathrm{d}$, $0.305(2) \ \mathrm{d}$, $0.204(7) \ \mathrm{d}$, $0.3(2) \ \mathrm{d}$, and $0.4395(1) \ \mathrm{d}$, respectively, and photometric temperatures of $4000$--$6000 \ \mathrm{K}$, consistent with the companion stars of `redback' subtype of spider pulsar binaries. Based on their optical light curve shapes and X-ray properties characteristic for spider systems -- namely, a luminosity of $1.5 \times 10^{32} \ (D / 3.9 \ \mathrm{kpc})^2 \ \mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ($0.3$--$10 \ \mathrm{keV}$) for 4FGL J1748.8-3915, and upper limits of $\sim10^{31}$--$10^{33} \ \mathrm{erg} \ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ ($0.2$--$12 \ \mathrm{keV}$) for the others -- we classify these sources as new spider candidate systems.</description>

      <title>A secondary orbiter under collisions with an accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of stellar orbits in dense stellar systems and nuclear star clusters (NSC) with an embedded supermassive black hole (SMBH) is governed a complex interplay of different forces. In particular, star--star gravitational collisions (relaxation), physical collisions between stars, and the hydrodynamical interaction with any surrounding gaseous environment, such as an accretion disk. These processes influence the stellar distribution, the feeding of the central black hole, and the generation of observable phenomena. Furthermore, the self-gravity of the accretion medium modulates the long-term evolution, adding significant complexity to the system's dynamics. By employing elementary arguments we outline the mentioned influences in their mutual competition.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Accretion Disks with Magnetically Driven Winds: Green's Function Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Green's function solutions for a geometrically thin, one-dimensional Keplerian accretion disk that includes angular momentum extraction and mass loss due to magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) winds. The disk viscosity is assumed to vary radially as $\nu \propto r^{n}$. We derive solutions for three types of boundary conditions applied at the inner radius $r_{\rm in}$: (i) zero torque, (ii) zero mass accretion rate, and (iii) finite torque and finite accretion rate, and investigate the time evolution of a disk with an initial surface density represented by a Dirac-delta function. The mass accretion rate at the inner radius decays with time as $t^{-3/2}$ for $n = 1$ at late times in the absence of winds under the zero-torque condition, consistent with Lynden-Bell \&amp; Pringle (1974), while the presence of winds leads to a steeper decay. All boundary conditions yield identical asymptotic time evolution for the accretion and wind mass-loss rates, though their radial profiles differ near $r_{\rm in}$. Applying our solutions to protoplanetary disks, we find that the disk follows distinct evolutionary tracks in the accretion rate-disk mass plane depending on $\psi$, a dimensionless parameter that regulates the strength of the vertical stress driving the wind, with the disk lifetime decreasing as $\psi$ increases due to enhanced wind-driven mass loss. The inner boundary condition influences the evolution for $\psi &lt; 1$ but becomes negligible at higher $\psi$, indicating that strong magnetically driven winds dominate and limit mass inflow near the boundary. Our Green's function solutions offer a general framework to study the long-term evolution of accretion disks with magnetically driven winds.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning approaches to dispersion measure estimation for fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, mostly millisecond-duration transients of extragalactic origin whose emission mechanisms remain unknown. As FRB signals propagate through ionized media, they experience frequency-dependent delays quantified by the dispersion measure (DM), a key parameter for inferring source distances and local plasma conditions. Accurate DM estimation is therefore essential for characterizing FRB sources and testing physical models, yet current dedispersion methods can be computationally intensive and prone to human bias. In this proof-of-concept study, we develop and benchmark three deep-learning architectures, a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a fine-tuned ResNet-50, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, for automated DM estimation. All models are trained and validated on a large set of synthetic FRB dynamic spectra generated using CHIME/FRB-like specifications. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest accuracy and stability while maintaining low computational cost across the investigated DM range. Although trained on simulated data, these models can be fine-tuned on real CHIME/FRB observations and extended to future facilities, offering a scalable pathway toward real-time, data-driven DM estimation in large FRB surveys.</description>

      <title>SSC Radiation in the ICMART Model: Spectral Simulations and Application to the Record-Breaking GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents simulations of the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) spectrum within the Internal-Collision-induced Magnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. We investigate how key parameters like the magnetization $\sigma_0$ shape the broadband spectral energy distribution by regulating the electron distribution and magnetic field strength. The overall spectrum typically comprises two components: synchrotron radiation peaking at $E_{\rm p}$ with a low-energy spectral index $\alpha$ between -1 and -1.5, and an SSC component peaking at $E_{\rm ssc}$. At high energies, Klein-Nishina suppression causes an exponential cutoff. The flux ratio Y between these components is critical: when Y is small, the SSC peak can be suppressed. Spectral features of the synchrotron component reveal the underlying physical conditions: harder spectra with $\alpha\sim-1$ indicate a large Y parameter and strong KN suppression. We find a positive correlation between Y and $\sigma_0$, contrasting with internal shock model predictions. Applied to GRB 221009A, our model suggests $\sigma_0\leq20$ can reproduce the MeV-TeV observations. This study underscores the value of combined MeV-TeV observations in probing GRB emission mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Accretion Properties in Mrk 1040 using long-term X-ray Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive long-term, multi-epoch spectral and timing study of the Seyfert 1 Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) Mrk~1040, utilizing X-ray observations spanning from 2009 to 2024 ($\sim$15 years). The source exhibits pronounced spectral and temporal variability, indicative of transitions between different accretion regimes in the vicinity of the central supermassive black hole. The earlier reported soft excess is re-examined within a uniform, physically motivated multi-epoch framework. We confirm the presence of this soft excess in the 2009 observation, where it is well described by a warm, extended Comptonizing corona with $kT_{\rm e,warm} \sim 0.26$~keV and a radial extent of $R_{\rm warm} \sim 30~r_g$. In subsequent epochs, the soft excess is not statistically significant, possibly due to a combination of enhanced ionized absorption, intrinsic weakening of the warm Comptonizing region, or partial truncation of the inner disc. A strong correlation between the soft and hard X-ray fluxes suggests a common physical origin for both components, likely within a multi-layered Comptonizing structure that evolved into a compact and thermally stable corona after 2013. The observed spectral variability, together with changes in the Fe~K$\alpha$ line strength, reflects the evolving coronal geometry and accretion flow dynamics. Variations in the intrinsic column density ($N_H$) further indicate that Mrk~1040 is embedded within a clumpy, dynamically variable absorber responding to changes in the accretion rate. Using the TCAF model, we estimate the black hole mass as $M_{\rm BH} = (4.50 \pm 1.62) \times 10^7~M_\odot$, consistent with previous estimates.</description>

      <title>A Seyfert galaxy as a hidden counterpart to a neutrino-associated blazar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin and production mechanisms of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos remain open questions in multimessenger astronomy. Previous studies have hinted at a possible linear correlation between the hard X-ray and high-energy neutrino emission in active galactic nuclei. New \textit{NuSTAR} observations, first presented here, reveal that blazar PKS 1424+240, located within a prominent IceCube neutrino hotspot, is far fainter in hard X-rays than expected from this trend. Motivated by this apparent ambiguity, we identify the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 5610, also coincident with the hotspot, whose unabsorbed hard X-ray flux exceeds that of PKS 1424+240 by about an order of magnitude. When the local IceCube neutrino flux is apportioned between the two AGN in proportion to their hard X-ray emission, both align with the previously suggested X-ray-neutrino correlation. This suggests that certain IceCube hotspots may be unresolved blends of multiple AGN, and supports a multimessenger scenario in which high-energy neutrinos and hard X-rays originate from the same hadronic interactions, with the X-ray emission produced through cascade reprocessing.</description>

      <title>Abundance Stratification in Type Iax SN 2020rea with TARDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the 1D Monte Carlo-based radiative transfer code TARDIS, we investigate the spectral evolution of the Type Iax supernova (SN) 2020rea from -7 days before to +21 days after maximum light. Our best-fit models indicate stratified, velocity-dependent abundances at early times, successfully reproducing most observed spectral features. As the SN evolves, the ejecta transition from a layered to a more homogeneous composition, posing an alternative to pure deflagration models that predict fully mixed ejecta. These results highlight the need for further investigation, as current pure deflagration models cannot fully explain the origin or spectral properties of Type Iax SNe like SN 2020rea.</description>

      <title>H.E.S.S. detection and multi-wavelength study of the $z \sim$ 1 blazar PKS 0346$-$27</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PKS 0346-27 is a Low Synchrotron Peaked (LSP) blazar at redshift 0.991. The very-high-energy (VHE, E &gt; 100 GeV) spectra of blazars are always affected by $\gamma\gamma$ absorption by the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) and subsequently, no blazars have been detected in VHE $\gamma$-rays at redshifts exceeding 1. Extending the redshift range of VHE-detected blazars to $z \gtrsim 1$ will yield insights into the cosmological evolution of both the VHE blazar population and the EBL. This is the goal of a target-of-opportunity (ToO) programme by H.E.S.S. to observe flaring high-redshift ($z \gtrsim 1$) blazars. We report on H.E.S.S. ToO and multi-wavelength observations of the blazar PKS\,0346$-$27. Along with H.E.S.S., simultaneous data from {\it Fermi}-LAT, {\it Swift} (XRT and UVOT), and ATOM have been analysed and modelled using single-zone leptonic and hadronic models. PKS~0346-27 has been detected by H.E.S.S at a significance of 6.3$\sigma$ during one night, on 3 November 2021, while for other nights before and after this day, upper limits on the VHE flux are determined. No evidence for intra-night $\gamma$-ray variability has been found. A flare in high-energy (HE, $E &gt; 100$~MeV) $\gamma$-rays detected by {\it Fermi}-LAT preceded the H.E.S.S. detection by 2 days. A fit with a single-zone emission model to the contemporaneous spectral energy distribution during the detection night was possible with a proton-synchrotron-dominated hadronic model, requiring a proton-kinetic-energy-dominated jet power temporarily exceeding the source's Eddington limit, although alternative (e.g. multi-zone) models can not be ruled out. A one-zone leptonic model is, in principle, also able to fit the flare-state SED, however, requiring implausible parameter choices, in particular, extreme Doppler and bulk Lorentz factors of $\gtrsim 80$.</description>

      <title>Improved lanthanide constraints for the kilonova AT 2017gfo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of the kilonova AT 2017gfo provide a unique opportunity to identify signatures from individual heavy elements freshly synthesised via the {\it r}-process, the nucleosynthetic channel responsible for producing $\sim$half of all trans-iron-group elements. Limitations in the available atomic data have historically hampered comprehensive line identification studies; however, renewed interest has led to the generation of improved (more complete and accurately calibrated) line lists for {\it r}-process species. Here we demonstrate the utility of such data, by exploiting newly generated line lists for the lanthanides to model the photospheric-phase 3.4d X-shooter spectrum of AT 2017gfo with the radiative transfer tool \textsc{tardis}. We find the data can only be reproduced by invoking a substantially diminished lanthanide mass fraction ($X_{\textsc{ln}}$) than that proposed by previous studies. Specifically, our model necessitates $X_{\textsc{ln}} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-3}$, a value $20 \times$ lower than previously claimed. This substantial reduction in $X_{\textsc{ln}}$ is driven by our inclusion of much more complete lanthanide line information that enables better estimation of their total contribution to the observations. We encourage future modelling works to exploit all atomic data advances, and also encourage continued efforts to generate the necessary data for the remaining {\it r}-process species of interest.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the transition from thermal to non-thermal emission in the prompt emission of GRB 161117A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 161117A is a long-duration GRB with three main overlapping peaks. By analyzing the time-resolved spectra of its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi mission, we find that the spectral evolution shows a transition from thermal (single BB) to hybrid (PL$+$BB), and finally to non-thermal (Band and CPL) emissions. Such a transition suggests that the jet composition of GRB 161117A should be changed from a fireball to a Poynting-flux-dominated jet. The bulk Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{\rm ph}$), radii ($R_{\rm ph}$ and $R_{0}$), magnetization factor at the central engine ($\sigma_0$), and dimensionless entropy ($\eta$) of the outflow can be inferred by invoking the observed quasi-thermal component within two models (e.g., pure fireball and hybrid). It is found that $\Gamma_{\rm ph}$ seems to be tracking with the light curve, and $R_{0}$ remains a constant at $\sim$ $10^{8}$ cm. The low magnetization ($1+\sigma_0 \sim$ 1) and high dimensionless entropy ($\eta \gg$ 1) during the first seven time-intervals suggest to be a pure fireball outflow. Moreover, we also estimate the lower limit of magnetization parameter at the photosphere radius ($\sigma_{\rm ph}\sim 1.4$ and 0.75) for late phase via the non-thermal spectra, and it indicates that the particle acceleration mechanism is dominated by internal shocks rather than magnetic dissipation processes. Finally, the $\nu \bar{\nu}$ annihilation mechanism of NDAF model to explain the thermal emission of GRB 161117A is also discussed.</description>

      <title>The role of PSR J0614-3329 in defining the high-density matter at Neutron star cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how astrophysical observations from NICER and GW data constrain the matter properties at high densities, with a primary focus on the recent PSR J0614-3329 data. We have constructed three distinct classes of an ensemble of agnostic equation of state by speed of sound parametrisation. Bayesian inference is then employed to constrain the EoS construction parameters-namely, the squared speed of sound and chemical potential at each interpolation segment-using the observational data. Both the NICER and GW constraints hint towards a smoother EoS where PT occurs late, significantly reducing the maximum mass of NS. Also, the maximum-mass and maximum-compact sequences are distinctly different, as the former allows for the maximally stiff EoS to maximise the star mass. In contrast, the latter prefers a softer low-density and stiffer high-density EoS to maximise the compactness. The Bayesian analysis demonstrates that the observational bounds are effective in significantly constraining the low-density region of the equation of state. It is also seen that the astrophysical bound prefers the phase transition in the intermediate-density range and also prefers a small density jump for a discontinuous equation of state.</description>

      <title>Searching for Periodicity in FRB 20240114A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FRB 20240114A is extraordinarily active, and therefore presents an opportunity to search for the periodicity predicted by magnetar models of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB). Zhang, et al. (2025) observed 11,553 bursts, including 3196 on MJD 60381 (March 12, 2024). We find no significant peak in the periodogram of those bursts, which occur within 15628 s, short enough that even with a characteristic slowing age of 1 year a signal with period $\ge 0.1\,$s it would not significantly dephase within the observation. Introducing modulation artificially shows that an amplitude of 0.15 would have been detected robustly. Implications for magnetar models of FRB are briefly considered.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Study of FRB20201124A with the uGMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from multi-epoch observations of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20201124A with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) during its active phase between 8 May and 28 May 2021. The bursts exhibit significant morphological diversity, including multiple sub-bursts, downward frequency drifts, and intrinsic widths ranging from 1.032 - 32.159 ms. Bursts were detected in both Band 4 (550 - 950 MHz) and Band 5 (1060 - 1460 MHz), with the last Band 5 burst occurring on 24 May, while Band 4 activity persisted until 28 May, indicating a frequency-dependent decline. Consecutive bursts were observed with separations of 16.7 - 291.5 ms, revealing short repetition intervals or potential sub-second quasi-periodicity. The waiting-time and energy distributions are bimodal, suggesting at least two distinct emission timescales and energy modes. Burst fluence ranges from 1.72 - 78.47 Jy ms, and the cumulative fluence distribution follows a broken power law. Multi-frequency analysis further shows closely spaced burst pairs across Band 4 and Band 5, with sub-second offsets of 1.08 - 1.15 s, and no strict simultaneity with contemporaneous FAST detections. These findings demonstrate that FRB 20201124A exhibits closely spaced, patchy, multi-frequency emission with frequency-dependent activity, highlighting the complex and dynamic nature of repeating FRBs.</description>

      <title>The role of particle feedback on particle acceleration in magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous process in astrophysical plasmas and an efficient mechanism for particle acceleration. Using 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with a co-evolving fluid-particle framework, we investigate how particle feedback affects reconnection and acceleration. Our simulations demonstrate that particle feedback to the fluid amplifies shear flows within magnetic islands, which strengthens the convective electric field and thereby boosts particle acceleration. This mechanism results in a higher maximum particle energy and a harder non-thermal energy spectrum. The guide field suppresses both the increase in gas internal energy and particle acceleration. These findings highlight the complex interplay between feedback, guide fields, and reconnection dynamics.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Anisotropies in PTA Observations: Analytical Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reported evidence for an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) from pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has motivated searches for extrinsic and intrinsic anisotropies. Kinematic anisotropies may arise as a consequence of a boosted observer moving with respect to the frame in which the GWB appears isotropic. In this work, we present an analytical toolbox to describe the effects of kinematic anisotropies on the overlap reduction function. Our analytical results differ from previous findings at the quadrupole order and are detailed in three appendices. For the first time, we also derive the corresponding auto-correlation using two approaches, taking the pulsar distances to be infinite or finite, respectively. Our formulas can be used in forecasts or Bayesian analysis pipelines.</description>

      <title>Connecting disc-corona physics and ionised outflows in AGN in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline a science case for next-generation wide-field spectroscopic surveys aimed at connecting the physics of the accretion disc and X-ray corona in active galactic nuclei (AGN) with the properties of their nebular regions and circumgalactic medium (CGM). We focus on the non-linear Lx-Luv relation and on deviations from this canonical coupling encoded in $\Delta \alpha_{OX}$, the offset of the optical-to-X-ray index from the mean relation, and propose to use broad and narrow line emission and CGM nebulae as calorimeters of the ionising SED to trace different accretion "states". We propose an observational strategy based on rest-frame UV/optical spectroscopy of $\sim 10^{4}-10^{5}$ AGN, a time-domain reverberation-mapping tier for a well-defined subsample, coordinated X-ray coverage, and wide-field IFU mapping of CGM emission (including H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$). From these goals we derive requirements for a future ESO facility in the 2040s: a dedicated, wide-field, high-multiplex optical-NIR spectroscopic telescope with time-domain flexibility and arcmin-scale IFU capability.</description>

      <title>Sommerfeld Enhancement from Background Force and the Galactic Center GeV Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of background-induced forces on dark matter (DM) annihilation and their implications for indirect detection. In the presence of a finite number density of background particles, loop-level interactions can generate an effective force that is significantly enhanced relative to the vacuum case. We construct a two-component DM model in which the dominant component is a fermionic particle $\chi$ and the subdominant component is an ultralight pseudoscalar particle $\phi$. The annihilation of $\chi$ proceeds through the p-wave channel and produces gamma-ray emission. The finite density of $\phi$ particles induces a background-enhanced force between $\chi$ particles, leading to a sizable Sommerfeld enhancement of the annihilation. We show that a viable region of parameter space in this model can account for the gamma-ray excess observed in the Galactic Center using Fermi-LAT data. The background-induced force substantially amplifies the Sommerfeld enhancement and thus enlarges the parameter space capable of explaining the excess, highlighting the importance of background effects in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Impact of Anisotropy on Neutron Star Structure and Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of pressure anisotropy on the structural and geometric properties of neutron stars within general relativity, focusing primarily on the phenomenological Bowers-Liang (BL) model, and comparing selected results with a quasi-local prescription. Using the SLy equation of state, we explore how anisotropic stresses modify global observables such as the mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, compactness, and tidal deformability over a broad range of anisotropy parameters. We find that moderate positive anisotropy can increase the maximum supported mass up to approximately $2.4\;M_\odot$ and enhance stellar compactness by up to $20\%$ relative to isotropic configurations, while remaining broadly consistent with current NICER and gravitational-wave constraints.
  To probe the internal gravitational field, we compute curvature invariants including the Ricci scalar, the Ricci tensor contraction, the Kretschmann scalar, and the Weyl scalar. We show that curvature measures directly tied to the matter distribution exhibit a strong sensitivity to anisotropy, whereas the Weyl curvature remains comparatively insensitive, reflecting its role as a measure of the free gravitational field. Within the phenomenological BL framework, the maximum compactness increases with anisotropy and reaches values as high as $\mathcal{C}_{\max}\approx 0.25$-$0.38$ for $\lambda_{\rm BL}\in[-4,+4]$, although the physical realizability of such highly compact configurations depends sensitively on the underlying anisotropy mechanism. A comparison with the quasi-local model highlights the strong model dependence of anisotropic effects, underscoring both the potential significance and the limitations of phenomenological anisotropy prescriptions in modeling strong-field neutron-star interiors.</description>

      <title>The sun as colliding beam, betatron cosmic ray factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of cosmic ray production within the solar system (not extra-galactic) is presented. The sun's time variable magnetic flux linkage makes the sun (as well, perhaps, as Jupiter) a natural, all-purpose, betatron storage ring, with semi-infinite acceptance aperture, capable of storing and accelerating counter-circulating, opposite-sign, colliding beams.
  The puzzle of how positrons and anti-protons can be well represented at all energies, is explained, initially, by the low energy capture of particles of either sign by the sun's magnetic dipole field. Later, as the magnetic field bending has become negligible compared to the gravitational bending, both positive and negative beams will have survived the gradual transition from predominantly magnetic to predominantly gravitational bending. Later, anti-particles produced in QED beam-beam collisions of sufficiently high energy, are also accelerated.
  The high quality of cosmic ray data collected over recent decades, at steadily increasing energies, especially by the International Space Station (ISS), make the study of cosmic ray production mechanisms both timely and essential.
  The paper describes how longitudinal electric fields, explained by the Parker solar wind theory can enable the sun to serve as a ``booster'' accelerator of cosmic rays, increasing the maximum cosmic ray energies enough to produce the observed 13 orders of magnitude maximum particle energy and the energy flux needed to maintain the observed cosmic ray atmosphere equilibrium within the solar system.
  A steady state mechanism is described, based on semi-quantitative discussion of a relativistic Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, according to which the highest energy cosmic rays observed can have been produced by the Parker longitudinal electric field component, during fractionally brief, but periodic, circular or semi-circular turns centered on the sun.</description>

      <title>Turbulence-Driven Corrugation of Collisionless Fast-Magnetosonic Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless fast-magnetosonic shocks are often treated as smooth, planar boundaries, yet observations point to organized corrugation of the shock surface. A plausible driver is upstream turbulence. Broadband fluctuations arriving at the front can continually wrinkle it, changing the local shock geometry and, in turn, conditions for particle injection and radiation. We develop a linear-MHD formulation that treats the shock as a moving interface rather than a fixed boundary. In this approach the shock response can be summarized by an effective impedance determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot base state and the shock geometry, while the upstream turbulence enters only through its statistics. This provides a practical mapping from an assumed incident spectrum to the corrugation amplitude, its drift along the surface, and a coherence scale set by weak damping or leakage. The response is largest when the transmitted downstream fast mode propagates nearly parallel to the shock in the shock frame, which produces a Lorentzian-type enhancement controlled by the downstream normal group speed. We examine how compression, plasma $\beta$, and obliquity affect these corrugation properties and discuss implications for fine structure in heliospheric and supernova-remnant shock emission.</description>

Abstract: We examine Sommerfeld enhancement in dark matter annihilation as a potential origin of the halo-like gamma-ray excess near $E_\gamma \simeq 20$ GeV reported by Totani. A minimal model with a light CP-even scalar mediator naturally produces a velocity-dependent annihilation cross section consistent with thermal freeze-out, the Milky Way excess, and limits from dwarf spheroidal galaxies.</description>

      <title>Difference between quark stars and neutron stars in universal relations and their effect on gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the $f$-mode frequency and tidal overlap of quark stars using the full general relativity method. We verify the universal relations obtained from conventional neutron stars in the case of quark stars and explore the cases with different values of parameters of the quark star equation of state. Since quark stars have significantly smaller radii compared to neutron stars in the low mass range, the relation between the tidal defomability and $f$-mode frequency times radius is different for neutron stars and quark stars. This difference has an impact on dynamical tide, which is the lowest-order effect we know of that can distinguish quark stars and neutron stars from the gravitational wave during the inspiral phase. We calculate the tidal dephasing caused by this effect in the post-Newtonian method and find that it can not be detected even by the next-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Model-independent search of gravitational wave echoes in LVK data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave echoes offer a unique probe of the near-horizon structure of astrophysical black holes, beyond the standard ''black hole spectroscopy''. Theoretical waveform predictions, however, remain uncertain, motivating robust searches that avoid specific echo modeling. We present a model-independent search framework targeting long-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs) expected from strong interior reflection. By employing a generalized phase-marginalized likelihood that coherently combines data for each QNM across a detector network, our method enhances sensitivity to the signals. To handle real detector noise, we implement an optimized notching procedure to suppress instrumental spectral lines and refine the Bayesian parameter settings. We validate the performance of this framework using injection studies on O1 background data, demonstrating reliable signal recovery in realistic noise conditions. We then apply this method to three binary black hole merger events with high ringdown signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) from observing runs O1 to O4: GW150914, GW231226, and the recently detected GW250114. No statistically significant evidence for postmerger echoes is found. Consequently, we derive 90% upper limits on the network SNR and the average amplitude of the long-lived QNMs, setting the first model-independent constraints on late-time echo signatures from LVK data.</description>

      <title>LUNCH: A Lightweight Unified Deep-Learning Framework for General Transients Classification in High-Energy Time-Domain Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing data volume of high-energy space monitors necessitates real-time, automated transient classification for multi-messenger follow-up. Conventional methods rely on empirical features like hardness ratios and reliable localization, which are not always precisely available during early detection. We developed the Lightweight Unified Neural Classifier for High-energy Transients (LUNCH) - an end-to-end deep-learning framework that performs general transient classification directly from raw multi-band light curves, eliminating the need for background subtraction or source localization. Its dual-scale architecture fuses long- and short-scale temporal evolution adaptively. Evaluated on 15 years of Fermi/GBM triggers, the optimal model achieves 97.23% accuracy when trained on complete energy spectra. A lightweight version using only three broad energy bands retains 95.07% accuracy, demonstrating that coarse spectral information fused with temporal context enables robust discrimination. The system significantly outperforms the GBM in-flight classifier on three months of independent test data. Feature visualization reveals well-separated class clusters, confirming physical interpretability. LUNCH combines high accuracy, low computational cost, and instrument-agnostic inputs, offering a practical solution for real-time in-flight processing that enables timely triggers for immediate multi-wavelength and multi-messenger follow-up observations in future time-domain missions.</description>

      <title>TTC: Transformer-based TDE Classifier for the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Transformer-based Tidal disruption events (TDE) Classifier (\texttt{TTC}), specifically designed to operate effectively with both real-time alert streams and archival data of the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). It aims to minimize the reliance on external catalogs and find TDE candidates from pure light curves, which is more suitable for finding TDEs in faint and distant galaxies. \texttt{TTC} consists of two key modules that can work independently: (1) A light curve parametric fitting module and (2) a Transformer (\texttt{Mgformer})-based classification network. The training of the latter module and evaluation for each module utilize a light curve dataset of 7413 spectroscopically classified transients from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The \texttt{Mgformer}-based module is superior in performance and flexibility. Its representative recall and precision values are 0.79 and 0.76, respectively, and can be modified by adjusting the threshold. It can also efficiently find TDE candidates within 30 days from the first detection. For comparison, the parametric fitting module yields values of 0.72 and 0.40, respectively, while it is $&gt;$10 times faster in average speed. Hence, the setup of modules allows a trade-off between performance and time, as well as precision and recall. \texttt{TTC} has successfully picked out all spectroscopically identified TDEs among ZTF transients in a real-time classification test, and selected $\sim$20 TDE candidates in the deep field survey data of WFST. The discovery rate will greatly increase once the differential database for the wide field survey is ready.</description>

      <title>Loop-Level Lepton Flavor Violation and Diphoton Signals in the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The left-right symmetric model (LRSM) could not only restore parity of the weak interaction, but also provide natural explanations of the tiny active neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanisms. The $SU(2)_R$-breaking scalar $H_3$ can induce lepton flavor violating (LFV) effects in the minimal version of LRSM at the 1-loop order, originating from the mixing of heavy right-handed neutrinos. If $H_3$ is light, say below the GeV scale, it will lead to rich signals, e.g. the LFV muon and tauon decays $\ell_\beta \to \ell_\alpha + X$ ($X$ being either visible or invisible final states) and the anomalous supernova signatures. Combined with the diphoton coupling of $H_3$, the right-handed scale $v_R$ is excluded up to $2\times10^9$ GeV. In the future, the $v_R$ scale can be probed up to $5\times10^9$ GeV in high-precision muon experiments, and further up to $6\times10^{11}$ GeV by supernova observations.</description>

      <title>Feeling Blue: Constructing a Robust SALT3 UV Template and Constraining its Redshift Dependency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming cosmological surveys will obtain numerous rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) observations of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), yet there is concern about how standardizable SNe Ia are in the UV. In this work, we train a robust optical--UV SED model for SNe Ia (SALT3-UV) with the open-source model-training software $\texttt{SALTshaker}$. We incorporate a spectroscopic UV data sample from HST, including 67 UV spectra from 18 nearby SNe Ia. Unlike previous training spectra, the HST spectra have sufficiently precise calibration that they do not require additional warping to match coincident photometric data. Additionally, while including this new SN Ia sample necessitates incorporating auxiliary photometric data from ZTF and ATLAS that have insufficient calibration for cosmological analyses, the improvements in the calibration of these data is anticipated in the near future. Compared to the previous SALT3-K21 model, the SALT3-UV model shows a significant improvement in the UV down to $2000\mathring{\text{A}}$, with over a threefold improvement in model uncertainty and a more physically accurate continuum and line features. We further evaluate potential redshift evolution in the UV template by separating the UV training sample into low- and high-$z$ subsamples. Our results reveal a non-negligible $\gtrsim 0.05$ mag difference between low- and high-$z$ SALT3-UV models in the $g-$band at $z\gtrsim0.5$ and the $u-$band at $z\gtrsim0.2$. We demonstrate that, if confirmed, such evolution could lead to a few-percent bias in the measurement of $w$ if high-$z$ rest-frame UV data are included in future cosmological surveys such as LSST and $\textit{Roman}$.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetised Discontinuity on Diffusive Shock Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of magnetic fields and diffusion mechanisms on the energy spectra of particles accelerated via diffusive shock acceleration. We analyse magnetised shock jump conditions and demonstrate how magnetisation and angular dependence modify upstream and downstream velocities, which enter the transport equation within a Monte Carlo simulation framework. We consider constant, momentum-dependent, and pitch-angle-dependent diffusion coefficients to assess their influence on particle acceleration. Our results show that magnetic fields enhance particle confinement and facilitate more efficient energy gain. In the absence of magnetisation, particle spectra tend to be steeper due to rapid escape and weaker scattering effects, whereas magnetised shocks systematically produce flatter spectra across all diffusion models. Among them, pitch-angle-dependent diffusion leads to the strongest spectral flattening, underscoring its role in sustaining extended acceleration. It is also seen that an increased upstream pressure, associated with enhanced magnetic turbulence, broadens the spectral range by improving particle scattering efficiency and enabling multiple shock crossings. As the shock inclination angle increases, the velocity contrast between upstream and downstream regions diminishes, modulating the spatial extent of the acceleration zone. Notably, pitch-angle-dependent diffusion remains robust under varying shock conditions, ensuring sustained acceleration.</description>

      <title>Observation of the $\gamma$-ray Emission from W43 with LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we report the detection of the very-high-energy (VHE, $ 100{\rm\ GeV} &lt; E &lt; 100{\rm\ TeV} $) and ultra-high-energy (UHE, $E &gt; 100\rm\ TeV$) $\gamma$-ray emissions from the direction of the young star-forming region W43, observed by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observation (LHAASO). The extended $\gamma$-ray source was detected with a significance of ${\sim}16\,\sigma$ by KM2A and ${\sim}17\,\sigma$ by WCDA, respectively. The angular extension of this $\gamma$-ray source is about 0.5 degrees, corresponding to a physical size of about 50 pc. We discuss the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission and possible cosmic ray acceleration in the W43 region using multi-wavelength data. Our findings suggest that W43 is likely another young star cluster capable of accelerating cosmic rays (CRs) to at least several hundred TeV.</description>

      <title>Deep view of Composite SNR CTA1 with LHAASO in $\gamma$-rays up to 300 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray source 1LHAASO J0007+7303u is positionally associated with the composite SNR CTA1 that is located at high Galactic Latitude $b\approx 10.5^\circ$. This provides a rare opportunity to spatially resolve the component of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) and supernova remnant (SNR) at UHE. This paper conducted a dedicated data analysis of 1LHAASO J0007+7303u using the data collected from December 2019 to July 2023. This source is well detected with significances of 21$\sigma$ and 17$\sigma$ at 8$-$100 TeV and $&gt;$100 TeV, respectively. The corresponding extensions are determined to be 0.23$^{\circ}\pm$0.03$^{\circ}$ and 0.17$^{\circ}\pm$0.03$^{\circ}$. The emission is proposed to originate from the relativistic electrons and positrons accelerated within the PWN of PSR J0007+7303. The energy spectrum is well described by a power-law with an exponential cutoff function $dN/dE = (42.4\pm4.1)(\frac{E}{20\rm\ TeV})^{-2.31\pm0.11}\exp(-\frac{E}{110\pm25\rm\ TeV})$ $\rm\ TeV^{-1}\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}$in the energy range from 8 TeV to 300 TeV, implying a steady-state parent electron spectrum $dN_e/dE_e\propto (\frac{E_e}{100\rm\ TeV})^{-3.13\pm0.16}\exp[(\frac{-E_e}{373\pm70\rm\ TeV})^2]$ at energies above $\approx 50 \rm\ TeV$. The cutoff energy of the electron spectrum is roughly equal to the expected current maximum energy of particles accelerated at the PWN terminal shock. Combining the X-ray and gamma-ray emission, the current space-averaged magnetic field can be limited to $\approx 4.5\rm\ \mu G$. To satisfy the multi-wavelength spectrum and the $\gamma$-ray extensions, the transport of relativistic particles within the PWN is likely dominated by the advection process under the free-expansion phase assumption.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-Energy Gamma-ray Emission Associated with Black Hole-Jet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes (BH), one of the most intriguing objects in the universe, can manifest themselves through electromagnetic radiation initiated by the accretion flow. Some stellar-mass BHs drive relativistic jets when accreting matter from their companion stars, forming microquasars. Non-thermal emission from the radio to tera-electronvolt (TeV) gamma-ray band has been observed from microquasars, indicating the acceleration of relativistic particles. Here we report detection of four microquasars (SS 433, V4641 Sgr, GRS 1915+105, MAXI J1820+070) of spectrum extending to the ultrahigh-energy (UHE; photon energy $E&gt;100$ TeV) band and one microquasar (Cygnus X-1) of spectrum approaching 100 TeV, using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Notably, the total emission associated with SS 433 cannot be interpreted with a single leptonic component. In the UHE band, its emission is in spatial coincidence with a giant atomic cloud, which is consistent with a hadronic origin. An elongated source is discovered from V4641 Sgr with the spectrum continuing up to 800 TeV. The detection of UHE gamma rays demonstrates that accreting BHs and their environments can operate as extremely efficient accelerators of particles out of 1 peta-electronvolt (PeV), suggesting microquasars to be important contributors to Galactic cosmic rays especially around the `knee' region.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Nature of HAWC J1844-034 with Fermi-LAT Data Analysis and Multi-wavelength Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extended ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray source HAWC J1844-034 is closely associated with two other sources, HAWC J1843-032 and HWC J1846-025. Moreover, other gamma-ray observatories like H.E.S.S., LHAASO, and Tibet AS$_{\gamma}$ have detected UHE gamma-ray sources whose spatial positions coincide with the position of HAWC J1844-034. The UHE gamma-ray data from several observatories help analyse the spectral features of this source in detail at TeV energies. Of the four pulsars near HAWC J1844-034, PSR J1844-0346 is closest to it and possibly supplies the cosmic-ray leptons to power this source. We have analysed the Fermi-LAT data to explore this source's morphology and identify its spectral feature in the Fermi-LAT energy band. After removing the contribution of the pulsar to the gamma-ray spectral energy distribution by pulsar phased analysis, we have obtained upper limits on the photon flux and identified the GeV counterpart PS J1844.2-0342 in the Fermi-LAT energy band with more than 5$\sigma$ significance, which may be a pulsar wind nebula (PWN). Finally, the multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution is modeled, assuming HAWC J1844-034 is a PWN.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave probes of particle dark matter: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02607v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various theories of dark matter predict distinctive astrophysical signatures in gravitational-wave sources that could be observed by ground- and space-based laser interferometers. Different candidates-including axions, dark photons, macroscopic dark matter, WIMPs, and dark-matter spikes-may appear in interferometer data via their coupling to gravity or the Standard Model, altering the measured gravitational-wave strain in distinct ways. Despite their differences, these candidates share two key features: (1) they can be probed through their effects on gravitational waves from inspiraling compact objects, isolated black holes, and neutron stars, or via direct interactions with detectors, and (2) their signatures likely persist far longer than the seconds-long mergers detected today, necessitating new data analysis methods beyond matched filtering. This review outlines these dark matter candidates, their observational signatures, and approaches for their detection.</description>

      <title>NLTE spectral modelling for a carbon-oxygen and helium white-dwarf merger as a Ca-rich transient candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out NLTE (non local thermodynamic equilibrium) radiative transfer simulations to determine whether explosion during the merger of a carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) with a helium (He) WD can reproduce the characteristic Ca II/[Ca II] and He I lines observed in Ca-rich transients. Our study is based on a 1D representation of a hydrodynamic simulation of a 0.6 $M_{\odot}$ CO + 0.4 $M_{\odot}$ He WD merger. We calculate both photospheric and nebular-phase spectra including treatment for non-thermal electrons, as is required for accurate modelling of He I and [Ca II]. Consistent with Ca-rich transients, our simulation predicts a nebular spectrum dominated by emission from [Ca II] 7291, 7324 angstrom and the Ca II near-infrared (NIR) triplet. The photospheric-phase synthetic spectrum also exhibits a strong Ca II NIR triplet, prominent optical absorption due to He I 5876 angstrom and He I 10830 angstrom in the NIR, as is commonly observed for Ca-rich transients. Overall, our results therefore suggest that CO+He WD mergers are a promising channel for Ca-rich transients. However, the current simulation overpredicts some He I features, in particular both He I 6678 and 7065 angstrom and shows a significant contribution from Ti II, which results in a spectral energy distribution that is substantially redder than most Ca-rich transients at peak. Additionally the Ca II nebular emission features are too broad. Future work should investigate if these discrepancies can be resolved by considering full 3D models and exploring a range of CO+He WD binary configurations.</description>

      <title>Study of Ultra-High-Energy Gamma-Ray Source 1LHAASO J0056+6346u and Its Possible Origins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a dedicated study of the newly discovered extended UHE $\gamma$-ray source 1LHAASO J0056+6346u. Analyzing 979 days of LHAASO-WCDA data and 1389 days of LHAASO-KM2A data, we observed a significant excess of $\gamma$-ray events with both WCDA and KM2A. Assuming a point power-law source with a fixed spectral index, the significance maps reveal excesses of ${\sim}12.65\,\sigma$, ${\sim}22.18\,\sigma$, and ${\sim}10.24\,\sigma$ in the energy ranges of 1--25 TeV, 25--100 TeV, and $&gt; 100$ TeV, respectively. We use a 3D likelihood algorithm to derive the morphological and spectral parameters, and the source is detected with significances of $12.65\,\sigma$ by WCDA and $25.27\,\sigma$ by KM2A. The best-fit positions derived from WCDA and KM2A data are (R.A. = $13.96^\circ\pm0.09^\circ$, Decl. = $63.92^\circ\pm0.05^\circ$) and (R.A. = $14.00^\circ\pm0.05^\circ$, Decl. = $63.79^\circ\pm0.02^\circ$), respectively. The angular size ($r_{39}$) of 1LHAASO J0056+6346u is $0.34^\circ\pm0.04^\circ$ at 1--25 TeV and $0.24^\circ\pm0.02^\circ$ at $&gt; 25$ TeV. The differential flux of this UHE $\gamma$-ray source can be described by an exponential cutoff power-law function: $(2.67\pm0.25) \times 10^{-15} (E/20\,\text{TeV})^{-1.97\pm0.10} e^{-E/(55.1\pm7.2)\,\text{TeV}} \,\text{TeV}^{-1}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$. To explore potential sources of $\gamma$-ray emission, we investigated the gas distribution around 1LHAASO J0056+6346u. 1LHAASO J0056+6346u is likely to be a TeV PWN powered by an unknown pulsar, which would naturally explain both its spatial and spectral properties. Another explanation is that this UHE $\gamma$-ray source might be associated with gas content illuminated by a nearby CR accelerator, possibly the SNR candidate G124.0+1.4.</description>

      <title>Search for Lorentz Invariance Violation with spectral lags of GRB 190114C using profile likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) by re-analyzing the spectral lag data for GRB 190114C \rthis{from Fermi-GBM} using frequentist analysis, where we deal with the astrophysical nuisance parameters using profile likelihood. For this use case, we find a global minima for the $\chi^2$ as a function of energy scale of LIV ($E_{QG}$), well below the Planck scale. The best-fit $1\sigma$ central intervals for $E_{QG}$ are given by $2.81^{+0.50}_{-0.37}\times 10^{14}$ GeV and $9.85^{+0.84}_{-0.60}\times 10^{5}$ GeV for linear and quadratic LIV, respectively, and agree with the Bayesian estimates obtained so far in a previous work. Therefore, the results from the frequentist analysis of GRB 190114C agree with Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Setting limits on blazar-boosted dark matter with xenon-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-phase xenon time-projection chambers achieve optimal sensitivity to dark matter in the mass range from about 10 to 1000~GeV/$c^{2}$. However, sub-GeV dark-matter particles do not produce nuclear recoils above detection thresholds in these detectors. Blazar-boosted dark matter provides a way to overcome this limitation: relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei can accelerate light dark matter in their host-galaxy halos to energies capable of producing detectable nuclear-recoil signals in xenon-based detectors on Earth. We present the first blazar-boosted dark-matter search that incorporates full detector-response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the blazar TXS 0506+056. We model dark matter-proton scattering in the jet environment, tracing the full process from acceleration in the jet to the detector response on Earth, and we investigate the impact of the host-galaxy dark-matter density profile on the predicted signals. We set model-dependent exclusion regions on the dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section for dark matter with mass $m_\chi \simeq 1~\mathrm{MeV}$. Using XENON1T data, the excluded cross-section range spans approximately $5.8\times10^{-31}$ to $6.3\times10^{-29}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, while LZ effective-field-theory searches exclude cross sections between $9.9\times10^{-32}$ and $2.5\times10^{-28}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Our results show that astrophysical uncertainties -- particularly those associated with the dark-matter distribution near the supermassive black hole -- are the dominant limitation of this search, rather than detector-related effects. The resulting limits are therefore model-dependent and should be regarded as exploratory, highlighting both the potential and the present theoretical uncertainties of blazar-boosted dark matter as a probe of light dark matter.</description>

      <title>Explaining the Origin of TeV Gamma Rays from M87 During High and Low States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of very high-energy gamma-rays from M87 can provide crucial insights into particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in jets. The recent observations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) detector extend the energy range of TeV gamma-ray astronomy, and also the variability study to the TeV energy domain. We have modelled the low state and flare state multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions of M87 within a time-dependent framework. In our model, the low state gamma-ray flux results from the emissions from the sub-parsec and the kilo-parsec scale jets of M87, whereas the flare state gamma-ray flux is mainly produced in the sub-parsec scale jet. We have shown that the spectral and temporal features of the TeV gamma-ray spectrum of M87 are consistent with this two-zone model, where the contribution from the sub-parsec scale jet significantly increases during the flare state.</description>

      <title>Effects of Coronal Mass Ejection on PSR J1022+1001 and Possible Mode Change of PSR J2145-0750 in the InPTA DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) has recently published its second data release (DR2), comprising the timing analysis of seven years of data on 27 millisecond pulsars (MSPs), observed simultaneously in the 300-500 MHz (band 3) and 1260-1460 MHz (band 5), using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). The low-frequency data, particularly in band 3, is highly sensitive to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations, which can be imprints of some astrophysical phenomena (scientific outliers). Here, we analyze the two outliers of possible astrophysical origin coming from the band 3 DM time series of two pulsars: PSR J1022+1001, with an ecliptic latitude of -0.06 degree, and PSR J2145-0750, one of the brightest MSPs, with multi-component profile morphology. Our study reveals compelling evidence for a coronal mass ejection (CME) event traced in the data of PSR J1022+1001, and reports evidence for a potential mode-changing event in PSR J2145-0750. By contrasting these two cases, we show that DM fluctuations due to CME interacions and intrinsic mode-changing events produce distinct observational signatures, enabling a physically informed classification of scientific outliers in PTA datasets. Extending the analyses presented here to the full sample of InPTA-DR2 pulsars is expected to reveal additional CME events, and possible mode-changing events. Such detections will not only improve our understanding of solar and pulsar magnetospheric plasma interactions but will also enable more accurate modelling of DM variations, leading to improved pulsar timing solutions, which are crucial for high-precision Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) science.</description>

      <title>A Precessing, Magnetically Dominated, Structured Jet Powering the Hour-scale Quasiperiodic GRB 250702B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRB 250702B shows ultra-long, episodic prompt activity (three hard gamma-ray episodes over ~ 3.2 h with quasi-regular spacing P~ 2825 s preceded by a soft X-ray flare about one day earlier. We interpret these phenomena with a unified scenario in which a stellar-mass black hole accretes from a massive, misaligned debris disk and launches a magnetically dominated, precessing, structured (spine-sheath) jet. The engine "clock" arises from Lense-Thirring precession of the outer annulus of a geometrically thick inner torus at r ~ 250-300 rg, while the hard spectra reflect magnetic-reconnection dissipation in the spine. A slightly off-axis viewing geometry resolves the apparent opening-angle tension without invoking late energy injection. "Missing" pulses in the second/third cycles occur naturally when low-amplitude nutation causes the beaming cone to miss the line of sight. The model yields concrete, falsifiable predictions, providing a self-consistent explanation of GRB 250702B's radiative and outflow anomalies.</description>

      <title>Detection of disk-jet co-precession in a tidal disruption event</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theories and simulations predict that intense spacetime curvature near black holes bends the trajectories of light and matter, driving disk and jet precession under relativistic torques. However, direct observational evidence of disk-jet co-precession remains elusive. Here, we report the most compelling case to date: a tidal disruption event (TDE) exhibiting unprecedented 19.6-day quasi-periodic variations in both X-rays and radio, with X-ray amplitudes exceeding an order of magnitude. The nearly synchronized X-ray and radio variations suggest a shared mechanism regulating the emission regions. We demonstrate that a disk-jet Lense-Thirring precession model successfully reproduces these variations while requiring a low-spin black hole. This study uncovers previously uncharted short-term radio variability in TDEs, highlights the transformative potential of high-cadence radio monitoring, and offers profound insights into disk-jet physics.</description>

      <title>Cosmogenic Origin of KM3-230213A: Delayed Gamma-Ray Emission from A Cosmic-Ray Transient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The highest-energy cosmic neutrino detected by the ARCA detector of KM3NeT has reignited the quest to pinpoint the sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs; $E\gtrsim 0.1$ EeV). By uncovering the associated multimessenger signals, we investigate the origin of the 220 PeV $\nu_\mu$ event KM3-230213A from an unknown transient that accelerated cosmic rays to $\sim 10$ EeV. Unlike an astrophysical origin, where the $\nu_\mu$ is produced inside the source, here we consider UHECR protons that escape the source interact with the cosmic background radiation, producing a PeV-EeV cosmogenic neutrino spectrum. The secondary $e^\pm$ and $\gamma$-rays initiate an electromagnetic cascade, resulting in a cosmogenic $\gamma$-ray spectrum. The latter peaks at a delayed time of $\gtrsim 10^4$ years compared to the light travel time from the transient to observer, due to deflection of charged particles in the extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF). Our results shed light on the nature of the UHECR source for the $\nu_\mu$ event and provide crucial insights into the detection of multi-TeV $\gamma$-rays of cosmogenic origin from similar past cosmological transients. Using the $\gamma$-ray sensitivity of currently operating and next-generation imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, the flux and time-delay distribution can constrain the source distance. We further show that the detection of such a $\gamma$-ray signal above the background depends on the EGMF strength. Together with the non-detection of coincident spatial or temporal photon counterparts at the current epoch, this detection is the first compelling candidate for a sub-EeV cosmogenic neutrino.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Properties of GRB Accreting Magnetar with $R/I$ Evolutionary Effects Using \emph{Swift}/XRT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central engine of some long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with X-ray plateau. In this work, we used a universal correlation between initial spin period ($P_0$) and surface magnetic field ($B_p$) of newborn magnetar based on an LGRB sample in \cite{Lan2025} to explore the propeller properties of accreting magnetars with $R/I$ evolutionary effects. We found that $B_p-P_0$ relation is approximately consistent with $B_p\propto P_{\rm eq}^{7/6}$. Here $P_{\rm eq}$ is equilibrium spin period in magnetic propeller model. The $B_p-P_0$ relation indicates that $P_0$ may not be true initial spin period of newborn magnetar but had reached an equilibrium spin period via fallback accretion in propeller model. The magnetar accretion rate in our LGRBs is in range of $\dot{M}\sim10^{-5}-10^{-2} M_{\odot} \rm s^{-1}$ by incorporating $R/I$ evolutionary effects and using the transition relation between gravitational mass $M_g$ and baryonic mass $M_b$ in different equations of state. Such accretion rates ensure that the accreting magnetars in our sample survive until reaching the equilibrium spin period, and the accretion rate is one order of magnitude lower compared to the statistical results in \cite{Stratta2018} and \cite{Linweili2020}, which used constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario. We suggested that adopting a constant $R/I/M_g$ scenario for modeling propeller regime in accreting magnetar results in a higher mass accretion rate, which may impair our understanding of the physical nature and its surroundings of accreting magnetar, and low-metallicity progenitors can provide enough material to satisfy the accretion requirements of newborn accreting magnetar in LGRBs.</description>

      <title>The Polarized X-ray Universe: Insights and Discoveries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization is one of the fundamental natures of electromagnetic radiation. The detection of polarization or polarized photons from distant X-ray radiating systems (such as X-ray binaries (XBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), pulsars, and stars) complements the timing, spectral, and imagining analysis to better understand the physical mechanisms taking place in these sources. Polarization has enhanced the understanding of the internal geometry of these systems and their vicinity. Polarized X-rays can be generated either directly through non-thermal physical processes in the presence of a magnetic field(B) or through the scattering of unpolarized thermal radiation within plasma structures such as an accretion disk. X-ray polarization can measure the two important independent parameters, the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) of the X-ray photons. These parameters are crucial as they reveal the characteristics of particles in such a strong magnetic and gravitational field. In this chapter, we have discussed (i) the basic idea of polarization, (ii) some distant sources radiating polarized X-ray photons, (iii) missions dedicated to observing polarized X-ray photons, and (iv) recent breakthroughs and upcoming missions.</description>

      <title>Long-term monitoring of repeating FRB 20220912A with the uGMRT at low radio frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some repeating FRBs exhibit occasional extreme repetition rates, but very few show a sustained high activity level. One such hyperactive repeater is FRB 20220912A, which was discovered by CHIME/FRB Collaboration on 2022 September 12. Here, we present results from a long-term monitoring campaign of FRB 20220912A using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in the frequency range from 300 to 750 MHz. Over the course of nearly two years, we detected a total of 643 bursts in this frequency range. The source exhibited extreme activity for a few months after its discovery and sustained its active phase for over 500 days, with unsystematic modulations in the activity during this phase. The cumulative energy distributions in both bands show a break, consistent with other active repeaters like FRB 20121102A, FRB 202011124A, etc., suggesting common underlying emission mechanisms. Moreover, we show that the energy distribution shape for FRB 20220912A remains broadly same across a large range of frequencies and over time. Overall, the extended high activity, estimated total energy output, persistent power-law tails in the energy distributions, and the lack of detectable short timescale periodicity favor progenitor models invoking young dynamic magnetars, potentially emitting pulses across large rotation phase ranges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extract the equation of state of hot quark matter from a holographic 2+1 flavor QCD model, which could form the core of a stable compact star. By adding a thin hadron shell, a new type of hybrid star is constructed. With the temperature serving as a parameter, the EoS varies and we obtain stable stars with mass ranging from about 5 to 30 solar masses, and the maximum compactness around 0.2. The I-Love-Q-C relations are further discussed, and compared with the neutron star cases. These compact stars are candidates for black hole mimickers, which could be observed by gravitational waves and distinguished by properties like nonzero tidal Love number and electromagnetic signals.</description>

Abstract: Microlensing events provide a unique way to detect and measure the masses of isolated, non-luminous objects, particularly dark stellar remnants. Under certain conditions, it is possible to measure the mass of these objects using photometry alone, specifically when a microlensing light curve displays a finite source (FS) effect. This effect generally occurs in highly magnified light curves, i.e. when the source and the lens are very well aligned. In this study, we analyse Gaia Alerts and Gaia Data Release 3 datasets, identifying four moderate-to-high-magnification microlensing events without a discernible FS effect. The absence of this effect suggests a large Einstein radius, implying substantial lens masses. In each event, we constrained the FS effect, and therefore established lower limits for the angular Einstein radius and lens mass. Additionally, we used the DarkLensCode software to obtain the mass, distance, and brightness distribution for the lens based on the Galactic model. Our analysis established lower mass limits of $\sim 0.7$ $M_{\odot}$ for one lens and $\sim 0.3-0.5$ $M_{\odot}$ for two others. A DarkLensCode analysis supports these findings, estimating lens masses in the range of $\sim 0.42-1.70$ $M_{\odot}$ and dark lens probabilities exceeding 80%. These results strongly indicate that the lenses are stellar remnants, such as white dwarfs or neutron stars. While further investigations are required to confirm the nature of these lenses, we demonstrate a straightforward yet effective approach to identifying stellar remnant candidates.</description>

      <title>Probing Right Handed Neutrino assisted Reheating with Gravitational Waves and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a non-instantaneous reheating period in the early Universe, where the inflaton field decays exclusively to right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of these RHNs into Standard Model particles not only drives the transition to a radiation-dominated era but also generates the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. In this typical reheating scenario, gravitational waves (GWs) can be produced during inflaton decay, both through bremsstrahlung and inflaton scattering processes. While GW production via bremsstrahlung dominates near the end of the reheating phase, inflaton scattering leads to a non-negligible GW contribution near the maximum temperature of the Universe. The combined GW spectrum from both decay and scattering processes lies within the sensitivity range of proposed resonant cavity experiments. This framework thus offers a compelling and unified approach to addressing neutrino mass generation, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis, and probing the dynamics of a non-instantaneous reheating era.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic helicity flux density for radiative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the helicity flux density is distinguished from magnetic helicity by analysing Hopf solitons. The electromagnetic (EM) helicity flux and the magnetic helicity are Chern-Simons terms at different hypersurfaces. We find the helicity flux density for a point charge moving with an acceleration, extending the Li\'enard-Wiechert angular distribution of radiant power. We also derive the multipole expansion of the helicity flux density, generalizing the Larmor's formula for the radiant power. These formulae have been applied to discuss the helicity flux density in several toy models such as circular and helical motion as well as soft bremsstrahlung. We also comment on the potential applications of the EM helicity flux density to pulsar systems.</description>

      <title>Importance of relativistic pericenter precession in identifying the presence of a third body near eccentric binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical processes can produce gravitational wave (GW) sources with significant orbital eccentricity. These binaries emit bursts of gravitational radiation during each pericenter passage. In isolated systems, the intrinsic timing of these bursts is solely determined by the properties of the binary. The presence of a nearby third body perturbs the system and alters the burst timing. Accurately modeling such perturbations therefore offers a novel approach to detecting the presence of a nearby companion. Existing timing models account for Newtonian dynamics and leading-order radiation reaction effects but neglect the higher order post-Newtonian (PN) contributions to the inner binary. In this paper, we present an improved timing model that incorporates conservative PN corrections that lead to the precession of the binary's pericenter. We find that these PN corrections significantly impact the binary's orbital evolution and the timing of the GW burst. In particular, 1PN precession gives rise to distinctive modulation features in the binary's semilatus rectum and eccentricity. These modulations encode valuable information about the presence and properties of the third body, including its mass and distance. Furthermore, unmodeled 1PN effects significantly bias the tertiary's mass and distance. Finally we assess the detectability of GW bursts from such perturbed systems and demonstrate that the inclusion of PN corrections is crucial for accurately capturing the orbital dynamics of hierarchical triples.</description>

      <title>On the maximum compactness of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stellar compactness, that is, the dimensionless ratio between the mass and radius of a compact star, $\mathcal{C} := M/R$, plays a fundamental role in characterising the gravitational and nuclear-physics aspects of neutron stars. Yet, because the compactness depends sensitively on the unknown equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter, the simple question: ``how compact can a neutron star be?'' remains unanswered. To address this question, we adopt a statistical approach and consider a large number of parameterised EOSs that satisfy all known constraints from nuclear theory, perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and astrophysical observations. Next, we conjecture that, for any given EOS, the maximum compactness is attained by the star with the maximum mass of the sequence of nonrotating configurations. While we can prove this conjecture for a rather large class of solutions, its general proof is still lacking. However, the evidence from all of the EOSs considered strongly indicates that it is true in general. Exploiting the conjecture, we can concentrate on the compactness of the maximum-mass stars and show that an upper limit appears for the maximum compactness and is given by $\mathcal{C}_{\rm max} = 1/3$. Importantly, this upper limit is essentially independent of the stellar mass and a direct consequence of perturbative-QCD constraints.</description>

      <title>Net Charge Accretion in Magnetized Kerr Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22356v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the charging process of a rotating Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$ immersed in a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically uniform magnetic field of strength $B_{0}$. In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal "saturation charge" $Q_{\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the "attracted" charge exceeds the upper bound for the "repelled" one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\mathrm{w}}$.</description>

      <title>Can the 3 neutrino masses really be found using SN 1987A data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09971v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino masses remain a significant unsolved problem in physics and their nonzero value proves the Standard Model is incomplete. Currently, the values of the three masses only have upper limits from cosmology and experiments like KATRIN. This paper shows that the SN 1987A neutrino data can remarkably yield values for the three neutrino masses, and not merely upper limits. Although this seemingly preposterous idea was suggested a dozen years ago by the author, here it is demonstrated in a much more convincing manner with many new elements, including a stronger statistical treatment, and a thorough explanation of why the method used to find the three masses from supernova SN 1987A neutrino data really works. The key to finding the three neutrino masses is realizing why three normally accepted assumptions are unjustified, The three rejected assumptions are:(a) the 5-hr early LSD (Mont Blanc) neutrinos are unrelated to SN 1987A, (b) any neutrino masses $m_k&gt;1 eV/c^2$ cannot be reconciled with upper limits on the ``effective mass" from KATRIN and other data, and (c) the spread in neutrino emission times from SN 1987A data is too great for the method to work. A particularly crucial piece of evidence supporting the claim made in the paper's title involves a recent negative KATRIN result finding an absence of sterile neutrinos.</description>
