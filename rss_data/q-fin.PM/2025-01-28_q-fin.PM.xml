      <title>NEAT Algorithm-based Stock Trading Strategy with Multiple Technical Indicators Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we applied the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to stock trading using multiple technical indicators. Our approach focused on maximizing earning, avoiding risk, and outperforming the Buy &amp; Hold strategy. We used progressive training data and a multi-objective fitness function to guide the evolution of the population towards these objectives. The results of our study showed that the NEAT model achieved similar returns to the Buy &amp; Hold strategy, but with lower risk exposure and greater stability. We also identified some challenges in the training process, including the presence of a large number of unused nodes and connections in the model architecture. In future work, it may be worthwhile to explore ways to improve the NEAT algorithm and apply it to shorter interval data in order to assess the potential impact on performance.</description>

      <title>Advancing Portfolio Optimization: Adaptive Minimum-Variance Portfolios and Minimum Risk Rate Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the Adaptive Minimum-Variance Portfolio (AMVP) framework and the Adaptive Minimum-Risk Rate (AMRR) metric, innovative tools designed to optimize portfolios dynamically in volatile and nonstationary financial markets. Unlike traditional minimum-variance approaches, the AMVP framework incorporates real-time adaptability through advanced econometric models, including ARFIMA-FIGARCH processes and non-Gaussian innovations. Empirical applications on cryptocurrency and equity markets demonstrate the proposed framework's superior performance in risk reduction and portfolio stability, particularly during periods of structural market breaks and heightened volatility. The findings highlight the practical implications of using the AMVP and AMRR methodologies to address modern investment challenges, offering actionable insights for portfolio managers navigating uncertain and rapidly changing market conditions.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data for Portfolios: A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03993v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation methods have always been instrumental in finance, and data-driven methods with minimal model specification, commonly referred to as generative models, have attracted increasing attention, especially after the success of deep learning in a broad range of fields. However, the adoption of these models in financial applications has not kept pace with the growing interest, probably due to the unique complexities and challenges of financial markets. This paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of generative models, particularly in portfolio and risk management. To this end, we begin by presenting theoretical results on the importance of initial sample size, and point out the potential pitfalls of generating far more data than originally available. We then highlight the inseparable nature of model development and the desired use case by touching on a paradox: generic generative models inherently care less about what is important for constructing portfolios (in particular the long-short ones). Based on these findings, we propose a pipeline for the generation of multivariate returns that meets conventional evaluation standards on a large universe of US equities while being compliant with stylized facts observed in asset returns and turning around the pitfalls we previously identified. Moreover, we insist on the need for more delicate evaluation methods, and suggest, through an example of mean-reversion strategies, a method designed to identify poor models for a given application based on regurgitative training, i.e. retraining the model using the data it has itself generated, which is commonly referred to in statistics as identifiability.</description>
