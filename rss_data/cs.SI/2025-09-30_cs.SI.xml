      <title>CrediBench: Building Web-Scale Network Datasets for Information Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online misinformation poses an escalating threat, amplified by the Internet's open nature and increasingly capable LLMs that generate persuasive yet deceptive content. Existing misinformation detection methods typically focus on either textual content or network structure in isolation, failing to leverage the rich, dynamic interplay between website content and hyperlink relationships that characterizes real-world misinformation ecosystems. We introduce CrediBench: a large-scale data processing pipeline for constructing temporal web graphs that jointly model textual content and hyperlink structure for misinformation detection. Unlike prior work, our approach captures the dynamic evolution of general misinformation domains, including changes in both content and inter-site references over time. Our processed one-month snapshot extracted from the Common Crawl archive in December 2024 contains 45 million nodes and 1 billion edges, representing the largest web graph dataset made publicly available for misinformation research to date. From our experiments on this graph snapshot, we demonstrate the strength of both structural and webpage content signals for learning credibility scores, which measure source reliability. The pipeline and experimentation code are all available here, and the dataset is in this folder.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Graph Embeddings and Louvain Algorithm for Unsupervised Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel community detection method that integrates the Louvain algorithm with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), enabling the discovery of communities without prior knowledge. Compared to most existing solutions, the proposed method does not require prior knowledge of the number of communities. It enhances the Louvain algorithm using node embeddings generated by a GNN to capture richer structural and feature information. Furthermore, it introduces a merging algorithm to refine the results of the enhanced Louvain algorithm, reducing the number of detected communities. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one that improves the Louvain algorithm using GNNs for community detection. The improvement of the proposed method was empirically confirmed through an evaluation on real-world datasets. The results demonstrate its ability to dynamically adjust the number of detected communities and increase the detection accuracy in comparison with the benchmark solutions.</description>

      <title>Node Classification via Simplicial Interaction with Augmented Maximal Clique Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering higher-order interactions allows for a more comprehensive understanding of network structures beyond simple pairwise connections. While leveraging all cliques in a network to handle higher-order interactions is intuitive, it often leads to computational inefficiencies due to overlapping information between higher-order and lower-order cliques. To address this issue, we propose an augmented maximal clique strategy. Although using only maximal cliques can reduce unnecessary overlap and provide a concise representation of the network, certain nodes may still appear in multiple maximal cliques, resulting in imbalanced training data. Therefore, our augmented maximal clique approach selectively includes some non-maximal cliques to mitigate the overrepresentation of specific nodes and promote more balanced learning across the network. Comparative analyses on synthetic networks and real-world citation datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms approaches based on pairwise interactions, all cliques, or only maximal cliques. Finally, by integrating this strategy into GNN-based semi-supervised learning, we establish a link between maximal clique-based methods and GNNs, showing that incorporating higher-order structures improves predictive accuracy. As a result, the augmented maximal clique strategy offers a computationally efficient and effective solution for higher-order network learning.</description>

      <title>MASH: A Multiplatform and Multimodal Annotated Dataset for Societal Impact of Hurricane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural disasters cause multidimensional threats to human societies, with hurricanes exemplifying one of the most disruptive events that not only caused severe physical damage but also sparked widespread discussion on social media platforms. Existing datasets for studying societal impacts of hurricanes often focus on outdated hurricanes and are limited to a single social media platform, failing to capture the broader societal impact in today's diverse social media environment. Moreover, existing datasets annotate visual and textual content of the post separately, failing to account for the multimodal nature of social media posts. To address these gaps, we present a multiplatform and Multimodal Annotated Dataset for Societal Impact of Hurricane (MASH) that includes 98,662 relevant social media data posts from Reddit, X, TikTok, and YouTube. In addition, all relevant social media data posts are annotated in a multimodal approach that considers both textual and visual content on three dimensions: humanitarian classes, bias classes, and information integrity classes. To our best knowledge, MASH is the first large-scale, multi-platform, multimodal, and multi-dimensionally annotated hurricane dataset. We envision that MASH can contribute to the study of hurricanes' impact on society, such as disaster severity classification, public sentiment analysis, disaster policy making, and bias identification.</description>

      <title>Robustness of One-to-Many Interdependent Higher-order Networks Against Cascading Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the real world, the stable operation of a network is usually inseparable from the mutual support of other networks. In such an interdependent network, a node in one layer may depend on multiple nodes in another layer, forming a complex one-to-many dependency relationship. Meanwhile, there may also be higher-order interactions between multiple nodes within a layer, which increases the connectivity within the layer. However, existing research on one-to-many interdependence often neglects intra-layer higher-order structures and lacks a unified theoretical framework for inter-layer dependencies. Moreover, current research on interdependent higher-order networks typically assumes idealized one-to-one inter-layer dependencies, which does not reflect the complexity of real-world systems. These limitations hinder a comprehensive understanding of how such networks withstand failures. Therefore, this paper investigates the robustness of one-to-many interdependent higher-order networks under random attacks. Depending on whether node survival requires at least one dependency edge or multiple dependency edges, we propose four inter-layer interdependency conditions and analyze the network's robustness after cascading failures induced by random attacks. Using percolation theory, we establish a unified theoretical framework that reveals how higher-order interaction structures within intra-layers and inter-layer coupling parameters affect network reliability and system resilience. Additionally, we extend our study to partially interdependent hypergraphs. We validate our theoretical analysis on both synthetic and real-data-based interdependent hypergraphs, offering insights into the optimization of network design for enhanced reliability.</description>

      <title>Community detection robustness of graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly widely used for community detection in attributed networks. They combine structural topology with node attributes through message passing and pooling. However, their robustness or lack of thereof with respect to different perturbations and targeted attacks in conjunction with community detection tasks is not well understood. To shed light into latent mechanisms behind GNN sensitivity on community detection tasks, we conduct a systematic computational evaluation of six widely adopted GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, Graph- SAGE, DiffPool, MinCUT, and DMoN. The analysis covers three perturbation categories: node attribute manipulations, edge topology distortions, and adversarial attacks. We use element-centric similarity as the evaluation metric on synthetic benchmarks and real-world citation networks. Our findings indicate that supervised GNNs tend to achieve higher baseline accuracy, while unsupervised methods, particularly DMoN, maintain stronger resilience under targeted and adversarial pertur- bations. Furthermore, robustness appears to be strongly influenced by community strength, with well-defined communities reducing performance loss. Across all models, node attribute perturba- tions associated with targeted edge deletions and shift in attribute distributions tend to cause the largest degradation in community recovery. These findings highlight important trade-offs between accuracy and robustness in GNN-based community detection and offer new insights into selecting architectures resilient to noise and adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Discrete Geofence Design Using Binary Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geofences have attracted significant attention in the design of spatial and virtual regions for managing and engaging spatiotemporal events. By using geofences to monitor human activity across their boundaries, content providers can create spatially triggered events that include notifications about points of interest within a geofence by pushing spatial information to the devices of users. Traditionally, geofences were hand-crafted by providers. In addition to the hand-crafted approach, recent advances in collecting human mobility data through mobile devices can accelerate the automatic and data-driven design of geofences, also known as the geofence design problem. Previous approaches assume circular shapes; thus, their flexibility is insufficient, and they can only handle geofence-based applications for large areas with coarse resolutions. A challenge with using circular geofences in urban and high-resolution areas is that they often overlap and fail to align with political district boundaries and road segments, such as one-way streets and median barriers. In this study, we address the problem of extracting arbitrary shapes as geofences from human mobility data to mitigate this problem. In our formulation, we cast the existing optimization problems for circular geofences to 0-1 integer programming problems to represent arbitrary shapes. Although 0-1 integer programming problems are computationally hard, formulating them as quadratic (unconstrained) binary optimization problems enables efficient approximation of optimal solutions, because this allows the use of specialized quadratic solvers, such as the quantum annealing, and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We then develop and compare different formulation methods to extract discrete geofences. We confirmed that our new modeling approach enables flexible geofence design.</description>

      <title>Research in Medicine: Journal ranking vs. Interdisciplinarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interdisciplinary research is critical for innovation and addressing complex societal issues. We characterise the interdisciplinary knowledge structure of PubMed research articles in medicine as correlation networks of medical concepts and compare the interdisciplinarity of articles between high-ranking (impactful) and less high-ranking (less impactful) medical journals. We found that impactful medical journals tend to publish research that are less interdisciplinary than less impactful journals. Observing that they bridge distant knowledge clusters in the networks, we find that cancer-related research can be seen as one of the main drivers of interdisciplinarity in medical science. Using signed difference networks, we also investigate the clustering of deviations between high and low impact journal correlation networks. We generally find a mild tendency for strong link differences to be adjacent. Furthermore, we find topic clusters of deviations that shift over time. In contrast, topic clusters in the original networks are static over time and can be seen as the core knowledge structure in medicine. Overall, journals and policymakers should encourage initiatives to accommodate interdisciplinarity within the existing infrastructures to maximise the potential patient benefits from IDR.</description>

      <title>Network Inequality through Preferential Attachment, Triadic Closure, and Homophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inequalities in social networks arise from linking mechanisms, such as preferential attachment (connecting to popular nodes), homophily (connecting to similar others), and triadic closure (connecting through mutual contacts). While preferential attachment mainly drives degree inequality and homophily drives segregation, their three-way interaction remains understudied. This gap limits our understanding of how network inequalities emerge. Here, we introduce PATCH, a network growth model combining the three mechanisms to understand how they create disparities among two groups in synthetic networks. Extensive simulations confirm that homophily and preferential attachment increase segregation and degree inequalities, while triadic closure has countervailing effects: conditional on the other mechanisms, it amplifies population-wide degree inequality while reducing segregation and between-group degree disparities. We demonstrate PATCH's explanatory potential on fifty years of Physics and Computer Science collaboration and citation networks exhibiting persistent gender disparities. PATCH accounts for these gender disparities with the joint presence of preferential attachment, moderate gender homophily, and varying levels of triadic closure. By connecting mechanisms to observed inequalities, PATCH shows how their interplay sustains group disparities and provides a framework for designing interventions that promote more equitable social networks.</description>

      <title>Understanding How Network Geometry Influences Diffusion Processes in Complex Networks: A Focus on Cryptocurrency Blockchains and Critical Infrastructure Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides essential insights into how diffusion processes unfold in complex networks, with a focus on cryptocurrency blockchains and infrastructure networks. The structural properties of these networks, such as hub-dominated, heavy-tailed topology, network motifs, and node centrality, significantly influence diffusion speed and reach. Using epidemic diffusion models, specifically the Kertesz threshold model and the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model, we analyze key factors affecting diffusion dynamics. To assess the uncertainty in the fraction of infected nodes over time, we employ bootstrap confidence intervals, while Bayesian credible intervals are constructed to quantify parameter uncertainties in the SI models. Our findings reveal substantial variations across different network types, including Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi networks, Geometric Random Graphs, and Delaunay Triangulation networks, emphasizing the role of network architecture in failure propagation. We identify that network motifs are crucial in diffusion. We highlight that hub-dominated networks, which dominate blockchain ecosystems, provide resilience against random failures but remain vulnerable to targeted attacks, posing significant risks to network stability. Furthermore, centrality measures such as degree, betweenness, and clustering coefficient strongly influence the transmissibility of diffusion in both blockchain and critical infrastructure networks.</description>

      <title>Community Analysis of Social Virtual Reality Based on Large-Scale Log Data of a Commercial Metaverse Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study quantitatively analyzes the structural characteristics of user communities within Social Virtual Reality (Social VR) platforms supporting head-mounted displays (HMDs), based on large-scale log data. By detecting and evaluating community structures from data on substantial interactions (defined as prolonged co-presence in the same virtual space), we found that Social VR platforms tend to host numerous, relatively small communities characterized by strong internal cohesion and limited inter-community connections. This finding contrasts with the large-scale, broadly connected community structures typically observed in conventional Social Networking Services (SNS). Furthermore, we identified a user segment capable of mediating between communities, despite these users not necessarily having numerous direct connections. We term this user segment `community hoppers' and discuss their characteristics. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the community structures that emerge within the unique communication environment of Social VR and the roles users play within them.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Homophily in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of problematic papers in the field of non-coding RNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the surge in retractions has been accompanied by numerous papers receiving comments that raise concerns about their reliability. The prevalence of problematic papers undermines the reliability of scientific research and threatens the foundation of evidence-based medicine. In this study,we focus on the field of non-coding RNA(ncRNA) as a case study to explore the typical characteristics of problematic papers from various perspectives, aiming to provide insights for addressing large-scale fraudulent publications. Research on under-investigated ncRNAs is more likely to yield problematic papers. These problematic papers often exhibit significant textual similarity, and many others sharing this similarity also display suspicious instances of image duplication. Healthcare institutions are particularly prone to publishing problematic papers, especially those with a low publication volume. Most problematic papers are found in a limited number of journals, and many journals inadequately address the commented papers. Our findings suggest that numerous problematic papers may still remain unidentified. The revealed characteristics offer valuable insights for formulating strategies to address the issue of fraudulent papers at scale.</description>

      <title>Metric Representations of Network Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:1911.00164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks are structures that encode relationships between pairs of elements or nodes. However, there is no imposed connection between these relationships, i.e., the relationship between two nodes can be independent of every other one in the network, and need not be defined for every possible pair of nodes. This is not true for metric spaces, where the triangle inequality imposes conditions that must be satisfied by triads of distances in the space, and these distances must be defined for every pair of nodes. In this paper, we study how to project networks into q-metric spaces, a generalization of metric spaces that encompasses a larger class of structured representations. In order to do this, we encode as axioms two intuitively desirable properties of the mentioned projections. We show that there is only one way of projecting networks onto q-metric spaces satisfying these axioms. Moreover, for the special case of (regular) metric spaces, this method boils down to computing the shortest path between every node and, for the case of ultrametric spaces, it coincides with single linkage hierarchical clustering. Furthermore, we show that the projection method satisfies two properties of practical relevance: optimality, which enables its utilization for the efficient estimation of combinatorial optimization problems, and nestedness, which entails consistency of the structure induced when projecting onto different q-metric spaces. Finally, we illustrate how metric projections can be used to efficiently search networks aided by metric trees.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Analysis of the Nostr Social Network: Decentralization, Availability, and Replication Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nostr is a decentralized social network launched in 2022, emphasizing high availability and censorship resistance. Since launching, it has gained substantial attention, boasting over 100 million posts. Nostr resembles a micro-blogging service like Twitter but with distinct underlying infrastructure. Nostr introduces the concept of relays, which act as open storage servers that receive, store, and distribute user posts. Each user is uniquely identified by a public key, ensuring authenticity of posts through digital signatures. Users are able to securely replicate and retrieve posts through multiple relays, which frees them from single-server reliance and enhances post availability, thereby attempting to make Nostr censorship resistant. However, this aggressive design also presents challenges, such as the overhead required for extensive post replication and the difficulty in obtaining a global view of post replication locations, which remain unexplored or unaddressed. This necessitates a thorough understanding of the Nostr ecosystem; therefore, we conduct the first large-scale study on this topic. Our study focuses on two key aspects: Nostr relays and post replication strategies. We find that Nostr achieves superior decentralization compared to traditional Fediverse applications. However, relay availability remains a challenge, where financial sustainability (particularly for free-to-use relays) emerges as a contributing factor. We also find that the replication of posts across relays enhances censorship-resistance but introduces significant overhead. To address this, we propose two improvements: one to control the number of post replications, and another to reduce the overhead during post retrieval. Via a data-driven evaluation, we demonstrate their ability to reduce overhead without negatively impacting post availability under the simulated scenarios.</description>

      <title>SALM: A Multi-Agent Framework for Language Model-Driven Social Network Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary approaches to agent-based modeling (ABM) of social systems have traditionally emphasized rule-based behaviors, limiting their ability to capture nuanced dynamics by moving beyond predefined rules and leveraging contextual understanding from LMs of human social interaction. This paper presents SALM (Social Agent LM Framework), a novel approach for integrating language models (LMs) into social network simulation that achieves unprecedented temporal stability in multi-agent scenarios. Our primary contributions include: (1) a hierarchical prompting architecture enabling stable simulation beyond 4,000 timesteps while reducing token usage by 73%, (2) an attention-based memory system achieving 80% cache hit rates (95% CI [78%, 82%]) with sub-linear memory growth of 9.5%, and (3) formal bounds on personality stability. Through extensive validation against SNAP ego networks, we demonstrate the first LLM-based framework capable of modeling long-term social phenomena while maintaining empirically validated behavioral fidelity.</description>

      <title>Identifying Group Anchors in Real-World Group Interactions Under Label Scarcity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group interactions occur in various real-world contexts, e.g., co-authorship, email communication, and online Q&amp;A. In each group, there is often a particularly significant member, around whom the group is formed. Examples include the first or last author of a paper, the sender of an email, and the questioner in a Q&amp;A session. In this work, we discuss the existence of such individuals in real-world group interactions. We call such individuals group anchors and study the problem of identifying them. First, we introduce the concept of group anchors and the identification problem. Then, we discuss our observations on group anchors in real-world group interactions. Based on our observations, we develop AnchorRadar, a fast and effective method for group anchor identification under realistic settings with label scarcity, i.e., when only a few groups have known anchors. AnchorRadar is a semi-supervised method using information from groups both with and without known group anchors. Finally, through extensive experiments on thirteen real-world datasets, we demonstrate the empirical superiority of AnchorRadar over various baselines w.r.t. accuracy and efficiency. In most cases, AnchorRadar achieves higher accuracy in group anchor identification than all the baselines, while using 10.2$\times$ less training time than the fastest baseline and 43.6$\times$ fewer learnable parameters than the most lightweight baseline on average.</description>

      <title>Network inference via process motifs for lagged correlation in linear stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge for causal inference from time-series data is the trade-off between computational feasibility and accuracy. Motivated by process motifs for lagged covariance in an autoregressive model with slow mean-reversion, we propose to infer networks of causal relations via pairwise edge measure (PEMs) that one can easily compute from lagged correlation matrices. Motivated by contributions of process motifs to covariance and lagged variance, we formulate two PEMs that correct for confounding factors and for reverse causation. To demonstrate the performance of our PEMs, we consider network interference from simulations of linear stochastic processes, and we show that our proposed PEMs can infer networks accurately and efficiently. Specifically, for slightly autocorrelated time-series data, our approach achieves accuracies higher than or similar to Granger causality, transfer entropy, and convergent crossmapping -- but with much shorter computation time than possible with any of these methods. Our fast and accurate PEMs are easy-to-implement methods for network inference with a clear theoretical underpinning. They provide promising alternatives to current paradigms for the inference of linear models from time-series data, including Granger causality, vector-autoregression, and sparse inverse covariance estimation.</description>

      <title>Differential Encoding for Improved Representation Learning over Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining the message-passing paradigm with the global attention mechanism has emerged as an effective framework for learning over graphs. The message-passing paradigm and the global attention mechanism fundamentally generate node embeddings based on information aggregated from a node's local neighborhood or from the whole graph. The most basic and commonly used aggregation approach is to take the sum of information from a node's local neighbourhood or from the whole graph. However, it is unknown if the dominant information is from a node itself or from the node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes). Therefore, there exists information lost at each layer of embedding generation, and this information lost could be accumulated and become more serious when more layers are used in the model. In this paper, we present a differential encoding method to address the issue of information lost. The idea of our method is to encode the differential representation between the information from a node's neighbours (or the rest of the graph nodes) and that from the node itself. The obtained differential encoding is then combined with the original aggregated local or global representation to generate the updated node embedding. By integrating differential encodings, the representational ability of generated node embeddings is improved. The differential encoding method is empirically evaluated on different graph tasks on seven benchmark datasets. The results show that it is a general method that improves the message-passing update and the global attention update, advancing the state-of-the-art performance for graph representation learning on these datasets.</description>

      <title>UniTraj: Learning a Universal Trajectory Foundation Model from Billion-Scale Worldwide Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building a universal trajectory foundation model is a promising solution to address the limitations of existing trajectory modeling approaches, such as task specificity, regional dependency, and data sensitivity. Despite its potential, data preparation, pre-training strategy development, and architectural design present significant challenges in constructing this model. Therefore, we introduce UniTraj, a Universal Trajectory foundation model that aims to address these limitations through three key innovations. First, we construct WorldTrace, an unprecedented dataset of 2.45 million trajectories with billions of GPS points spanning 70 countries, providing the diverse geographic coverage essential for region-independent modeling. Second, we develop novel pre-training strategies--Adaptive Trajectory Resampling and Self-supervised Trajectory Masking--that enable robust learning from heterogeneous trajectory data with varying sampling rates and quality. Finally, we tailor a flexible model architecture to accommodate a variety of trajectory tasks, effectively capturing complex movement patterns to support broad applicability. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior scalability, adaptability, and generalization, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal yet non-exclusive training resource.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Laplacian matrix aiming to enable the construction of spectral convolutional networks and to extend the signal processing applications for directed graphs. Our proposal is inspired by a Haar-like transformation and produces a Hermitian matrix which is not only in one-to-one relation with the adjacency matrix, preserving both direction and weight information, but also enjoys desirable additional properties like scaling robustness, sensitivity, continuity, and directionality. We take a theoretical standpoint and support the conformity of our approach with the spectral graph theory. Then, we address two use-cases: graph learning (by introducing HaarNet, a spectral graph convolutional network built with our Haar-Laplacian) and graph signal processing. We show that our approach gives better results in applications like weight prediction and denoising on directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Cost-Aware Opinion Dynamics in Multi-Agents Systems under Malicious Agent Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many MASs, links to malicious agents cannot be severed immediately. Under these conditions, averaging-only consensus mechanisms typically lack sufficient resistance, leaving the system vulnerable to harmful deviations. To address this challenge, this brief leverages the Boomerang Effect from sociology, which drives normal agents to firmly reject malicious inputs, although this strategy may appear overly cautious. Thus, this brief emphasizes the necessity of acknowledging the resulting trade-off between cost and convergence speed in practice. To address this, the additional costs induced by Boomerang-style fusion is analyzed and a cost aware evolution rate adjustment mechanism is proposed. Multi-robot simulations demonstrate that this mechanism suppresses excess costs while maintaining resilience to extremist disruptions and ensuring stable convergence, enabling MAS to efficiently develop in a ethical order.</description>

      <title>From Occasional to Steady: Habit Formation Insights From a Comprehensive Fitness Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regular exercise is widely recognized as a cornerstone of health, yet sustaining consistent exercise habits remains challenging. Understanding the factors that influence the formation of these habits is crucial for developing effective interventions. This study utilizes data from Mars Athletic Club, T\"urkiye's largest sports chain, to investigate the dynamics of gym attendance and habit formation. The general problem addressed by this study is identifying the critical periods and factors that contribute to the successful establishment of consistent exercise routines among gym-goers. We show that specific periods of attendance are most crucial for habit formation. By developing a survival metric based on gym attendance patterns, we pinpoint these key phases and segment members into distinct clusters based on their visit patterns. Our analysis reveals significant differences in how various subgroups respond to interventions, such as group classes, personal trainer sessions, and visiting different clubs. Using causal inference analysis, we demonstrate that personalized guidance and social dynamics are key drivers of sustained long-term engagement. By systematically examining these variables and considering the specific characteristics of different clusters, our research highlights the importance of a tailored, multi-dimensional approach to promoting exercise habits, which integrates social dynamics, personalized guidance, and strategic interventions to sustain long-term engagement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the defining features of complex networks is the connectivity properties that we observe emerging from local interactions. Recently, hypergraphs have emerged as a versatile tool to model networks with non-dyadic, higher-order interactions. Nevertheless, the connectivity properties of real-world hypergraphs remain largely understudied. In this work we introduce path size as a measure to characterise higher-order connectivity and quantify the relevance of non-dyadic ties for efficient shortest paths in a diverse set of empirical networks with and without temporal information. By comparing our results with simple randomised null models, our analysis presents a nuanced picture, suggesting that non-dyadic ties are often central and are vital for system connectivity, while dyadic edges remain essential to connect more peripheral nodes, an effect which is particularly pronounced for time-varying systems. Our work contributes to a better understanding of the structural organisation of systems with higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Steering the Herd: A Framework for LLM-based Control of Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms increasingly serve as information mediators--from social media feeds and targeted advertising to the increasing ubiquity of LLMs. This engenders a joint process where agents combine private, algorithmically-mediated signals with learning from peers to arrive at decisions. To study such settings, we introduce a model of controlled sequential social learning in which an information-mediating planner (e.g. an LLM) controls the information structure of agents while they also learn from the decisions of earlier agents. The planner may seek to improve social welfare (altruistic planner) or to induce a specific action the planner prefers (biased planner). Our framework presents a new optimization problem for social learning that combines dynamic programming with decentralized action choices and Bayesian belief updates.
  We prove the convexity of the value function and characterize the optimal policies of altruistic and biased planners, which attain desired tradeoffs between the costs they incur and the payoffs they earn from induced agent choices. Notably, in some regimes the biased planner intentionally obfuscates the agents' signals. Even under stringent transparency constraints--information parity with individuals, no lying or cherry-picking, and full observability--we show that information mediation can substantially shift social welfare in either direction. We complement our theory with simulations in which LLMs act as both planner and agents. Notably, the LLM planner in our simulations exhibits emergent strategic behavior in steering public opinion that broadly mirrors the trends predicted, though key deviations suggest the influence of non-Bayesian reasoning consistent with the cognitive patterns of both humans and LLMs trained on human-like data. Together, we establish our framework as a tractable basis for studying the impact and regulation of LLM information mediators.</description>

      <title>Scalable Graph Generative Modeling via Substructure Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been predominantly driven by message-passing, where node representations are iteratively updated via local neighborhood aggregation. Despite their success, message-passing suffers from fundamental limitations -- including constrained expressiveness, over-smoothing, over-squashing, and limited capacity to model long-range dependencies. These issues hinder scalability: increasing data size or model size often fails to yield improved performance. To this end, we explore pathways beyond message-passing and introduce Generative Graph Pattern Machine (G$^2$PM), a generative Transformer pre-training framework for graphs. G$^2$PM represents graph instances (nodes, edges, or entire graphs) as sequences of substructures, and employs generative pre-training over the sequences to learn generalizable and transferable representations. Empirically, G$^2$PM demonstrates strong scalability: on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark, it continues to improve with model sizes up to 60M parameters, outperforming prior generative approaches that plateau at significantly smaller scales (e.g., 3M). In addition, we systematically analyze the model design space, highlighting key architectural choices that contribute to its scalability and generalization. Across diverse tasks -- including node/link/graph classification, transfer learning, and cross-graph pretraining -- G$^2$PM consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing a compelling foundation for scalable graph learning. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/G2PM.</description>
