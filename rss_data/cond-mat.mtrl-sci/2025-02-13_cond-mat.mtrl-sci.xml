      <title>Iterative charge equilibration for fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLP) allow to perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with about the same accuracy as electronic structure calculations provided that the selected model is able to capture the relevant physics of the system. For systems exhibiting long-range charge transfer, fourth-generation MLPs need to be used, which take global information about the system and electrostatic interactions into account. This can be achieved in a charge equilibration (QEq) step, but the direct solution (dQEq) of the set of linear equations results in an unfavorable cubic scaling with system size making this step computationally demanding for large systems. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that is based on the iterative solution of the charge equilibration problem (iQEq) to determine the atomic partial charges. We have implemented the iQEq method, which scales quadratically with system size, in the parallel molecular dynamics software LAMMPS for the example of a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential (4G-HDNNP) intended to be used in combination with the n2p2 library. The method itself is general and applicable to many different types of fourth-generation MLPs. An assessment of the accuracy and the efficiency is presented for a benchmark system of FeCl$_3$ in water.</description>

      <title>Local doping of an oxide semiconductor by voltage-driven splitting of anti-Frenkel defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered oxides exhibit high ionic mobility and chemical flexibility, attracting interest as cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries and the pairing of hydrogen production and carbon capture. Recently, layered oxides emerged as highly tunable semiconductors. For example, by introducing anti-Frenkel defects, the electronic hopping conductance in hexagonal manganites was increased locally by orders of magnitude. Here, we demonstrate local acceptor and donor doping in Er(Mn,Ti)O$_3$, facilitated by the splitting of such anti-Frenkel defects under applied d.c. voltage. By combining density functional theory calculations, scanning probe microscopy, atom probe tomography, and scanning transmission electron microscopy, we show that the oxygen defects readily move through the layered crystal structure, leading to nano-sized interstitial-rich (p-type) and vacancy-rich (n-type) regions. The resulting pattern is comparable to dipolar npn-junctions and stable on the timescale of days. Our findings reveal the possibility of temporarily functionalizing oxide semiconductors at the nanoscale, giving additional opportunities for the field of oxide electronics and the development of transient electronics in general.</description>

      <title>The Augmented Potential Method: Multiscale Modeling Toward a Spectral Defect Genome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modeling of solute chemistry at low-symmetry defects in materials is historically challenging, due to the computation cost required to evaluate thermodynamic properties from first principles. Here, we offer a hybrid multiscale approach called the augmented potential method that connects the chemical flexibility and near-quantum accuracy of a universal machine learning potential at the site of the defect, with the computational speed of a long-range classical potential implemented away from the defect site in a buffer zone. The method allows us to rapidly compute distributions of grain boundary segregation energy for 1,050 binary alloy pairs (including Ag, Al, Au, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, Nb, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ta and V, W solvent), creating a database for polycrystalline grain boundary segregation. This database is ~5x larger than previously published spectral compilations, and yet has improved accuracy. The approach can also address problems far beyond the reach of any other method, such as handling bcc Fe-based alloys, or the complex solute-solute interactions in random polycrystals. The approach thus paves a pathway toward a complete defect genome in crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Grain Boundary Segregation Spectra from a Generalized Machine-learning Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling solute segregation to grain boundaries at near first-principles accuracy is a daunting task, particularly at finite concentrations and temperatures that require accurate assessments of solute-solute interactions and excess vibrational entropy of segregation that are computationally intensive. Here, we apply a generalized machine learning potential for 16 elements, including Ag, Al, Au, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Pd, Pt, Ta, Ti, V, W and Zr, to provide a self-consistent spectral database for all of these energetic components in of 240 binary alloy polycrystals. The segregation spectra of Al-based alloys are validated against past quantum-accurate simulations and show improved predictive ability with some existing atom probe tomography experimental data.</description>

      <title>Phonon vibrational and transport properties of SnSe/SnS superlattice at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural stability and phonon properties of SnSe/SnS superlattices at finite temperatures have been studied using machine learning force field molecular dynamics and the anharmonic phonon approach. The vertical SnSe/SnS superlattice undergoes a phase transition from the Pnma phase to a novel P4/nmm phase at finite temperatures, which is different from the high-temperature Cmcm phase of the SnSe and SnS systems. The stability of P4/nmm phase is determined by molecular dynamics trajectories and anharmonic phonon dispersion relations. The imaginary modes of TO modes at the q=M(1/2,1/2,0) point of the P4/nmm phase in harmonic approximation become rigid at elevated temperatures. An analysis of phonon power spectra upon temperature also confirms the dynamic stabilization. The P4/nmm phase has higher symmetry than the Pnma phase, and the phase transition between them is accompanied by competition between the Jahn-Teller effect and phonon anharmonicity. Unlike the anisotropic distribution of Sn-Se/S bonds in the Pnma phase, the P4/nmm phase forms chemical bonds with similar bond lengths both in-plane and interlayer, and their resonance effect can significantly enhance phonon scattering. The calculated phonon density of states and lifetime is strongly temperature dependent, demonstrating the heavy anharmonicity in the SnSe/SnS system. The P4/nmm phase has an extremely low lattice thermal conductivity, close to the experimental values of SnSe and SnS. Moreover, with the reduction of band gap and the enhancement of band degeneracy near the Fermi level, the P4/nmm phase exhibits superior electronic transport properties and significantly enhanced response to infrared and visible light. This makes it show great potential in thermoelectric and photovoltaic applications.</description>

      <title>The chemisorption thermodynamics of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on AFM UO$_2$ surfaces unraveled by DFT+U-D3 study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unraveling the adsorption mechanism and thermodynamics of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on uranium dioxide surfaces is critical for the nuclear fuel storage and uranium corrosion. Based on the first-principles DFT+U-D3 calculations, we carefully test the effect of antiferromagnetic order arrangements on the thermodynamic stability of UO$_2$ surfaces and propose the 1k AFM surface computational model. The chemisorption states of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on UO$_2$ (111) surface, suggested by previous experiments, are accurately calculated for the first time. The adsorption properties of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on UO$_2$(111) and (110) surfaces are discussed in detail to reveal the different interaction mechanisms. Combined with ab initio atomistic thermodynamics method, we systematically calculate the chemisorption phase diagram and isotherm of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on UO$_2$ surfaces. Due to the different intermolecular interactions, the monolayer and multilayer adsorption models are identified for O$_2$ and H$_2$O, respectively. This study has comprehensively revealed the different adsorption mechanisms of O$_2$ and H$_2$O on UO$_2$ surfaces, bridging the electronic structure calculations to the interpretation of experimental results and providing a solid foundation for future theoretical studies of uranium corrosion mechanism in humid air.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth and transport properties of a metallic altermagnet CrSb on a GaAs (001) substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A newly identified class of magnetic materials called altermagnets has attracted much attention due to the practical properties of spin-splitting bands akin to ferromagnets and small compensated magnetization akin to antiferromagnets. These features make them promising candidates for applications in spintronics devices. Among candidate materials, CrSb is promising due to its high ordering temperature (705 K) and large spin-splitting energy; however, it is predicted that tuning the N\'eel vector requires additional symmetry breaking or a change in the easy magnetization axis. While applying epitaxial strain can modulate the symmetry, the selection of substrates with closely matched lattice constants for heteroepitaxial growth is limited for altermagnets, which generally have low crystal symmetry. Therefore, exploring the heteroepitaxial growth of altermagnet thin films on well-established, dissimilar crystal systems is valuable. (001)-oriented III-V semiconductors, which share group-V elements with the overgrown CrSb, offer an ideal platform because they are expected to have material compatibility with stable interfaces, as well as tunability of the buffer layer's bandgap and lattice constant by varying the atomic composition of their group-III and group-V atoms. In this study, we have achieved the molecular beam epitaxial growth of a CrSb ($\bar{1}10$) thin film on a GaAs (001) substrate by inserting thin FeSb ($\bar{1}10$) / AlAs (001) buffer layers. The in-plane epitaxial relationship is found to be CrSb [110] $\|$ GaAs [110] and CrSb [001] $\|$ GaAs [$\bar{1}10$], and epitaxial strain is also confirmed. We also characterized the magneto-transport properties of the grown CrSb thin film. Although the obtained conductivity tensors are mainly explained by a multi-carrier model, not by an anomalous Hall effect, this model reveals the presence of high-mobility electron and hole carriers.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Deuterium Separation in van der Waals Gap Engineered Vermiculite Quantum Sieves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for nuclear energy grows, enriching deuterium from hydrogen mixtures has become more important. However, traditional methods are either very energy-intensive because they require extremely cold temperatures, or they don't separate deuterium (D2) from regular hydrogen (H2) very well, with a D2/H2 selectivity of about 0.71. To achieve efficient deuterium separation at room temperature, we need materials with very tiny spaces, on an atomic scale. For the first time, we've successfully created a material with spaces just about 2.1 angstroms wide, which is similar in size to the wavelength of hydrogen isotopes at room temperature. This allows for efficient deuterium separation, with a much higher D2/H2 selectivity of about 2.20, meaning the material can separate deuterium from hydrogen much more effectively at room temperature. The smaller deuterium molecules are more likely to pass through these tiny spaces, showing that quantum effects play a key role in this process. In contrast, a material like graphene oxide, with larger spaces (around 4.0 angstroms) only shows a lower D2/H2 selectivity of approx 1.17, indicating weaker quantum effects. This discovery suggests that materials with very small, atomic-scale spaces could be key to the efficient separation of hydrogen isotopes at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Long-Lived Coherence between Incoherent Excitons revealed by Time-Resolved ARPES: An Exact Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the exciton dynamics in an exactly solvable two-band model for semiconductors. The model incorporates light-matter, electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions, and captures exciton formation as well as the transition from the coherent to the incoherent regime. We analyze excitonic polarization, populations and coherences, with special focus on their impact in Time-Resolved and Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (TR-ARPES). For nonresonant pumping with below-gap photon energies, TR-ARPES spectra reveal distinct excitonic replica and quantum beats persisting in the incoherent regime. These are due to a coherence between different species of {\em incoherent} excitons. Such type of coherence is resistant to phonon dephasing, indicating that it follows different dynamics than those governing the coherences considered so far.</description>

      <title>Influence of 14N hyperfine interaction on electron nuclear double resonance of boron vacancy in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research focuses on the explanation of a phenomenon observed in the spectra of electron nuclear resonance (ENDOR) pertaining to nitrogen atoms adjacent to the boron vacancy (VB) defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The phenomenon is manifested as a shift of the ENDOR spectrum lines with respect to the nitrogen Larmor frequency. It is hypothesized that these shifts are indicative of a substantial hyperfine interaction between the VB defect and the 14N nuclei in hBN. A calculation utilizing second-order perturbation theory was executed to determine the positions of the ENDOR spectrum lines, resulting in the formulation of correction equations. The values obtained from the perturbation theory corrections align well with the experimental results. The extent of nuclear state admixture into electron states was found to be around 0.04-0.07%.</description>

      <title>Strong and Tunable Electrical-Anisotropy in Type-II Weyl Semimetal Candidate WP2 with Broken Inversion Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transition metal diphosphide WP2 is a candidate for type-II Weyl semimetals (WSMs) in which spatial inversion symmetry is broken and Lorentz invariance is violated. As one of the key prerequisites for the presence of the WSM state in WP2, spatial inversion symmetry breaking in this compound has rarely been investigated by experiments. Furthermore, how much anisotropy the electrical properties of WP2 have and whether its electrical anisotropy can be tuned remain elusive. Here, we report angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy, electrical transport, optical spectroscopy and first-principle studies of WP2. The energies of the observed Raman-active phonons and the angle dependences of the phonon intensities are well consistent with the results obtained by first-principle calculations and the analysis of the proposed crystal symmetry without spatial inversion, providing evidence that spatial inversion symmetry is broken in WP2. Moreover, the measured ratio (Rc/Ra) between the crystalline c-axis and a-axis electrical resistivities exhibits a weak dependence on temperature from 100 to 250 K, but increases abruptly below 100 K, and then reaches the value of 8.0 at 10 K, which is by far the strongest in-plane electrical resistivity anisotropy among the reported type-II WSM candidates with comparable carrier concentrations. Our optical-spectroscopy and calculation studies reveal that the abrupt enhancement of the Rc/Ra below 100 K mainly arises from a sharp increase in the scattering rate anisotropy at low temperatures. More interestingly, the Rc/Ra at 10 K can be tuned from 8.0 to 10.6 as the magnetic field increases from 0 to 9 T. The stronge and tunable electrical resistivity anisotropy found in WP2 can serve as a degree of freedom for tuning the electrical properties of type-II WSMs, which paves the way for developing novel electronic applications based on type-II WSMs.</description>

      <title>Chiral Topological Phononic Quasiparticles in Enantiomeric Crystals SrSi$_2$ and BaSi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral crystals have recently garnered significant interest in condensed matter physics due to their unique electronic and optical properties. In this paper, we explore the connection between the chirality of crystal structures and the chirality of topological quasiparticles. We specifically predict and analyze several chiral enantiomeric materials, such as SrSi$_2$ and BaSi$_2$, which crystallize in the chiral space groups $P4{_3}32$ and $P4{_1}32$. Based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that the phonon spectra of these materials host various topological phononic quasiparticles, including charge-2 triple points, charge-2 Dirac points, charge-2 Weyl points, and charge-1 Weyl points. Our paper shows that in these enantiomeric materials, the opposite chirality of the crystal structure results in topological quasiparticles with opposite chiral topological charges and distinct topological surface states. Our paper elucidates the intrinsic relationship between the chirality of crystal structures and the chirality of topological quasiparticles, providing promising theoretical guidance and material platform for investigating the physical properties of chiral crystals.</description>

      <title>Identification of orbital pumping from spin pumping and rectification effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently predicted mechanism of orbital pumping enables the generation of pure orbital current from a precessing ferromagnet (FM) without the need for electrical current injection. This orbital current can be efficiently injected into an adjacent nonmagnetic material (NM) without being hampered by electrical conductivity mismatch. However, experimentally identifying this novel effect presents significant challenges due to the substantial background contributions from spin pumping and spin rectification effects (SREs). In this work, we disentangle the effects of orbital pumping from spin pumping in bilayer structures composed of Nb/Ni and Nb/$\mathrm{Fe_{60}Co_{20}B_{20}}$ by observing a sign reversal of the measured voltage. This reversal arises from the competing signs of the spin and orbital Hall effects in the Nb. We establish methods to differentiate the pumping signal from SREs by analyzing the distinct angular dependence of the measured voltage and its spatial dependence relative to the radio frequency excitation source.</description>

      <title>Beyond the orbitally-resolved magnetic exchange in CrI$_{3}$ and NiI$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pertinent need for microscopic understanding of magnetic exchange motivated us to go beyond the existing theories and develop a systematic method to quantify all possible mechanisms that contribute to magnetic exchange for an arbitrary pair of atoms in a given material. We apply it to the archetypal 2D magnetic monolayers CrI3 and NiI2, to reveal the previously underrated dx2-y2,dx2-y2 contribution as either the leading or the second largest contribution to the total magnetic exchange. We proceed to explore the microscopic mechanisms behind all the non-zero orbital contributions in both CrI3 and NiI2, and generalize the findings to other magnetic monolayers dominated by d8 and d3 electronic configurations of the magnetic atoms.</description>

      <title>Angular dependent ferromagnetic resonance of exfoliated yttrium iron garnet film under stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yttrium iron garnet (Y3Fe5O12, YIG) plays a significant role in the field of spintronics due to its low magnetic damping and insulating characteristics. However, most studies have focused on YIG in bulk form or as film grown on rigid substrates. In this study, YIG film has been exfoliated from two-layer-graphene covered (111) Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG) substrate. Magnetic properties of YIG film under stress are investigated in detail via angular dependent ferromagnetic resonance. The relationship between magnetic parameters and compressive/tensile stress has been established. The findings of this work will be beneficial for the applications of flexible YIG film.</description>

      <title>Dendrite suppression in fast-charging high-energy metal-ion batteries: a Bayesian optimization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal anodes provide the highest possible energy density in batteries. However, challenges associated with electrode/electrolyte interface side reactions and dendrite growth remain unsolved, especially under fast-charging conditions. In this paper, we consider a phase-field model of electrodeposition and optimize its parameters for suppressing dendrite growth and accelerating charging speed under constant voltage. We identify interfacial mobility as a key parameter, which should be maximized to inhibit dendrites without compromising the charging speed. The proposed approach provides a versatile tool for designing battery cells by optimizing an arbitrary objective function using an arbitrary set of parameters. This approach is based on Bayesian optimization and explores the parameters space with a high sample efficiency and a low computation complexity. The results are verified using extended simulations of dendrite evolution in charging half cells with lithium-metal anodes.</description>

      <title>Optimization of magnetic contrast layer for neutron reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron reflectivity is a powerful technique for probing density profiles in films, with applications across Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. However, challenges arise when dealing with samples characterized by high roughness, unknown scattering length density (SLD) with low contrast, very thin layers, or complex multi-layered structures, that cannot be uniquely resolved due to the phase problem. Incorporating a magnetic reference layer (MRL) and using polarized neutron reflectivity improves sensitivity and modeling accuracy by providing complementary information. In this study, we introduce a quantitative way to compare MRL systems in a model-free way. We apply this approach to demonstrate that CoTi alloys offer a superior solution as an MRL compared to the commonly used Fe or Ni-based MRLs. The low nuclear and magnetic scattering length densities of CoTi significantly enhance sensitivity, making it particularly advantageous for soft matter research. Furthermore, the tunable Co vs Ti ratio allows for optimization of the SLDs to achieve maximum sensitivity, establishing CoTi as a highly effective choice for MRL applications. The applied simulation framework for optimizing MRL sensitivity to a specific materials system and research question is a generic approach that can be used prior to growing the MRL for a given experiment.</description>

      <title>Magnetic hysteresis control in thin film Fe/Si multilayers by incorporation of B4C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic hysteresis properties in Fe/Si multilayers have been studied as a function of the B4C content to control magnetization amplitude, coercivity, and hysteresis tilt, properties that are beneficial to tune for advancing applications in e.g. data storage, spintronics, and sensors. With an ion-assisted magnetron sputtering technique, 35 distinct thin film multilayer samples were prepared and their magnetic and structural properties were characterized by vibrating sample magnetometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and X-ray and neutron scattering methods. Key findings indicate that adding B4C lowers the coercivity and can decrease the saturation magnetization, demonstrating the tunability of magnetic responses based on composition. For samples with =30{\AA} periodicity, 10-15% of B4C addition produces antiferromagnetically (AF) coupled multilayers, and such AF coupling strength increases with the B4C content. Our findings reveal that B atoms do not chemically bind within the Fe atoms but instead occupy interstitial positions, disrupting medium- to long-range crystallinity thereby inducing the amorphization. Thereon, the observed effects on magnetic properties are directly attributed to this amorphization process caused by the presence of B4C. The demonstrated ability to finely adjust magnetic properties by varying the B4C content offers a promising approach to overcome challenges in magnetic device performance and efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining transport and magnetization measurements, we discover the emergence of a tricritical point connecting the antiferromagnetic, metamagnetic and paramagnetic regions in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, a magnetic topological insulator candidate which can potentially exhibit axion electrodynamics. We observe a unique magnetic field-driven phase diagram where the second-order antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase boundary bifurcates into two first-order lines at the tricritical point. The two first-order lines enclosing the metamagnetic phase eventually terminate at the quantum critical endpoints with the application of magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Tuning the chiral orbital currents in a colossal magnetoresistive nodal line ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ exhibits colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) owing to the chiral orbital currents (COC). The COC is developed due to spin-orbit interaction (SOI) attributed to the tellurium (Te) atoms. Here, we observe that on chemical substitution of the Te atoms with selenium (Se), the COC, which runs along the Te-Te edges of the MnTe$_6$ octahedra, becomes weaker and thus affects the angular magnetoresistance (MR) of Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. We find that the application of magnetic field along the easy axis leads to a considerable drop in resistance in substituted crystals, which otherwise exhibits weak MR. On the other hand, the CMR effect along the partially polarized magnetization direction is found to be only marginally affected due to the substitution and persists even for a significantly high concentration of Se.</description>

      <title>Full-cycle device-scale simulations of memory materials with a tailored atomic-cluster-expansion potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer simulations have long been key to understanding and designing phase-change materials (PCMs) for memory technologies. Machine learning is now increasingly being used to accelerate the modelling of PCMs, and yet it remains challenging to simultaneously reach the length and time scales required to simulate the operation of real-world PCM devices. Here, we show how ultra-fast machine-learned interatomic potentials, based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) framework, enable simulations of PCMs reflecting applications in devices with excellent scalability on high-performance computing platforms. We report full-cycle simulations -- including the time-consuming crystallisation process (from digital "zeroes" to "ones") -- thus representing the entire programming cycle for cross-point memory devices. We also showcase a simulation of full-cycle operations, relevant to neuromorphic computing, in a mushroom-type device geometry. Our work provides a springboard for the atomistic modelling of PCM-based memory and neuromorphic computing devices -- and, more widely, it illustrates the power of highly efficient ACE ML models for materials science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Resonance in a Magnetically Dilute Percolating Ferromagnet: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) serves as a powerful probe of magnetization dynamics and anisotropy in percolating ferromagnets, where short-range interactions govern long-range magnetic order. We apply this approach to Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N ($x \simeq 8$), a dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor, combining FMR and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. Our results confirm the percolative nature of ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)N, with a Curie temperature $T_{\mathrm{C}} = 12$ K, and reveal that despite magnetic dilution, key features of conventional ferromagnets are retained. FMR measurements establish a robust uniaxial anisotropy, dictated by Mn$^{3+}$ single-ion anisotropy, with an easy-plane character at low Mn content. While excessive line broadening suppresses FMR signals below 9 K, they persist up to 70 K, indicating the presence of non-percolating ferromagnetic clusters well above $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. The temperature dependence of the FMR intensity follows that of the magnetization, underscoring the stability of these clusters. Analysis of the FMR linewidth provides insights into relaxation processes, revealing large Gilbert damping due to the low magnetization of the system. Strikingly, atomistic spin model simulations reproduce the experimentally observed resonance fields, anisotropy trends, and linewidth evolution with remarkable accuracy. This agreement underscores the predictive power of our modeling approach in describing percolating ferromagnets. This study advances the understanding of percolating ferromagnetic systems, demonstrating that FMR is a key technique for probing their unique dynamic and anisotropic properties. Our findings contribute to the broader exploration of dilute ferromagnets and provide new insights into percolating ferromagnetic systems, which will be relevant for spintronic opportunities.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model for the structure relaxation of crystal materials and compare different types of neural network architectures and reinforcement learning algorithms for this purpose. Experiments are conducted on Al-Fe structures, with potential energy surfaces generated using EAM potentials. We examine the influence of parameter settings on model performance and benchmark the best-performing models against classical optimization algorithms. Additionally, the model's capacity to generalize learned interaction patterns from smaller atomic systems to more complex systems is assessed. The results demonstrate the potential of DRL models to enhance the efficiency of structure relaxation compared to classical optimizers.</description>

      <title>On the crystalline environment of luminescent Tb$^{3+}$ ions embedded in indium tin oxide thin films: a DFT and Crystal field analysis assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the local symmetry and crystal environment of trivalent terbium ions embedded in an indium tin oxide (ITO) matrix with bixbyite structure. The \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} ions tend to substitute \mbox{In$^{3+}$} ions in two different cationic sites ($b$ and $d$). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} ions are mainly located at $C_2$ symmetry sites relaxing selection rules and enabling electric dipole transitions, with the $^5\text{D}_4\rightarrow\leftindex^7{\text{F}}_2$ transition being the most intense, providing a red color to the light emission. Photoluminescence emission spectra under UV excitation at \qty{83}{\kelvin} revealed 30 intra-4$f$ transitions, which were assigned to the $\leftindex^7{\text{F}}_J$ ground multiplet of the \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} ion. Crystal-field analysis shows a strong alignment between calculated and observed energy levels, yielding a standard deviation of $\sigma=\qty{15.1}{\centi\per\metre}$. We believe these results can help to understand the activation mechanisms of \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} luminescent centers in transparent conductive oxides, as well as the potential to modulate \mbox{Tb$^{3+}$} emission color through its crystalline environment.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Exciton Polaron Characteristics via Lattice Engineering in 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered structure of 2D metal halide perovskites (MHPs) consisting of an ionic metal halide octahedral layer electronically separated by an organic cation, exhibits strong coupling between high-binding-energy excitons and low-energy lattice phonons. Photoexcitations in these systems are believed to be exciton polarons, Coulombically bound electron-hole pairs dressed by lattice vibrations. Understanding and controlling the structural and chemical factors that govern this interaction is crucial for optimizing exciton recombination, transport, and many-body interactions. Our study examines the role of the organic cation in a prototypical 2D-MHP system, phenylethylammonium lead iodide, (PEA)2PbI4, and its halogenated derivatives, (F/Cl-PEA)2PbI4. These substitutions allow us to probe polaronic effects while maintaining the average lattice and electronic structure. Using resonant impulsive stimulated Raman scattering (RISRS), we analyze the metal-halide sub-lattice motion coupled to excitons. We apply formalism based on a perturbative expansion of the nonlinear response function on the experimental data to estimate the Huang-Rhys parameter, $S=1/2 \Delta^2$, to quantify the lattice displacement ($\Delta$) due to exciton-phonon coupling. A direct correlation emerges between lattice displacement and octahedral distortion, with F-PEA exhibiting the largest shift and Cl-PEA exhibiting the least, significantly influencing the fine structure features in absorption. Additionally, 2D electronic spectroscopy reveals that F-PEA, with the strongest polaronic coupling, exhibits the least thermal dephasing, supporting the polaronic protection hypothesis. Our findings suggest that systematic organic cation substitution serves as a tunable control for the fine structure in 2D-MHPs, and offers a pathway to mitigate many-body scattering effects by tailoring the polaronic coupling.</description>

      <title>Improved Calculation of Acoustic Deformation Potentials from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), the band structure, phonon dispersion and electron phonon coupling matrix were calculated for silicon (Si), diamond and cubic boron nitride (cBN). From these, the acoustic deformation potential was calculated for multiple angles between the electron and phonon wave vectors and analytic expressions for the longitudinal and acoustic modes were fit to find an average deformation potential. The ability to calculate the deformation potential from first principles allows for the scattering rates to be determined without the use of lengthy empirical methods. For Si, the numerically calculated deformation potentials are in excellent agreement with what is seen in the literature. On the other hand, the deformation potentials calculated for diamond were found to be larger than what has been seen previously, however previous calculations of transport parameters in diamond report a large range of values for scattering parameters which may be due to assumptions made in each model. Excellent agreement was also seen between the value calculated for cBN and the literature, however there are no experimental results for cBN and so this value is compared against an estimate. This shows that scattering parameters can be calculated via first principles for materials with sparse experimental data, which in turn allows for increased confidence in the output of charge transport simulations of new and emerging materials.</description>

      <title>Phenothiazine-Based Self-Assembled Monolayer with Thiophene Head Groups Minimizes Buried Interface Losses in Tin Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have revolutionized the fabrication of lead-based perovskite solar cells, but they remain underexplored in tin perovskite systems. PEDOT is the material of choice for hole-selective layers in tin perovskite solar cells (TPSCs), but presents challenges for both performance and stability. MeO-2PACz, the only SAM reported for Sn perovskites, enables device fabrication but consistently underperforms when compared to PEDOT. In this work, we identify that MeO-2PACz's limitations arise from excessively strong interactions with perovskite surface and poor lattice matching, leading to poor interface quality. To overcome these issues, we design, synthesize, and characterize a novel SAM-forming molecule called Th-2EPT. Th-2EPT optimizes coordination strength and improves lattice compatibility, contributing to the creation of a high-quality buried interface and dramatically suppressing non-radiative recombination. We used Density Functional Theory (DFT) to evaluate coordination strength and lattice compatibility, complemented by nanosecond-resolution optical characterization techniques to confirm significantly reduced interfacial recombination and enhanced carrier lifetimes in Th-2EPT-Perovskite films. With Th-2EPT, we demonstrated the first SAM-based tin perovskite solar cells to outperform PEDOT-based devices, delivering a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.2% with a DMSO-free solvent system.</description>

      <title>Chasing Charge Carriers: Diffusion Dynamics in Mixed-n Quasi-Two-Dimensional Colloidal MAPbBr3 Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In optoelectronic applications, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) are compelling materials because of their highly tuneable and intensely competitive optical properties. Colloidal synthesis enables the controlled formation of various morphologies of MHP nanocrystals, all with different carrier properties and, hence, different optical and carrier transport behaviours. We characterized three different methylammonium lead tribromide perovskite (MAPbBr3) morphologies: nanoplatelets (NPLs), nanosheets (NSs), and nanostripes (NSTs) synthesized by hot-injection synthesis protocols with slightly different parameters. A fluorescence imaging microscope (FLIM) for time- and space-resolved measurements of the carrier migration was employed to quantify the charge carriers' migration process upon photoexcitation. The results are rationalized in the two-dimensional diffusion model framework, considering funnelling and trapping processes in mixed-n colloidal MHPs. Subdiffusion mode was found to prevail in the nanocrystals, whereby the highest carrier diffusivity was found for bulk-like NSTs, followed by layered NSs and a film of NPLs. These findings provide a better understanding of optoelectronic processes in perovskites relevant to photovoltaic and light-emitting devices.</description>

      <title>Triggered ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ from polar hybrid zone-boundary phonon instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric HfO$_2$ has garnered significant attention for its promising application in high density nonvolatile data storage and nanoscale transistors. However, the uncertain origin of polarization in HfO$_2$ limits our ability to fully understand and control its ferroelectricity. The ongoing debate centers on whether HfO$_2$ is a proper or improper ferroelectric, as it exhibits characteristics of both types. In this study, we utilize symmetry-guided first-principles quantum mechanical (DFT) calculations to accurately map the energy landscape and identify the coherent switching pathway of HfO$_2$ by voltage. Our findings reveal two key insights. First, ferroelectricity in HfO$_2$ is driven by a triggered mechanism through coupling between the stable polar mode and hybrid non-polar modes. Second, unusually high polarization arises from the hybrid modes, which consists solely of non-polar modes. The results fundamentally transforms the perspective on polarization in HfO$_2$ and resolve conflicting characteristics observed, offering valuable guidance for superior technological applications.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Magic Numbers in Spherical Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magic numbers in finite particle systems correspond to specific system sizes that allow configurations with low free energy, often exhibiting closed surface shells to maximize the number of nearest neighbors. Since their discovery in atomic nuclei, magic numbers have been essential for understanding the number-structure-property relationship in finite clusters across different scales. However, as system size increases, the significance of magic numbers diminishes, and the precise system size at which magic number phenomena disappear remains uncertain. In this study, we investigate colloidal clusters formed through confined self-assembly. Small magic number clusters display icosahedral symmetry with closed surface shells, corresponding to pronounced free energy minima. Our findings reveal that beyond a critical system size, closed surface shells disappear, and free energy minima become less pronounced. Instead, we observe a distinct type of colloidal cluster, termed football cluster, which retains icosahedral symmetry but features lower-coordinated facets disconnected by terraces. A sphere packing model demonstrates that forming closed surface shells becomes impossible beyond a critical system size, explaining the breakdown of magic numbers in large confined systems.</description>

      <title>Electron Fourier ptychography for phase reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase reconstruction is important in transmission electron microscopy for structural studies. We describe electron Fourier ptychography and its application to phase reconstruction of both radiation-resistant and beam-sensitive materials. We demonstrate that the phase of the exit wave can be reconstructed at high resolution using a modified iterative phase retrieval algorithm with data collected using an alternative optical geometry. This method achieves a spatial resolution of 0.63 nm at a fluence of $4.5 \times 10^2 \, e^-/\text{nm}^2$, as validated on Cry11Aa protein crystals under cryogenic conditions. Notably, this method requires no additional hardware modifications, is straightforward to implement, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing data collection software, providing a broadly accessible approach for structural studies.</description>

      <title>Microscopic mechanism of electric field-induced superconductivity suppression in metallic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supercurrent field-effect transistors made from thin metallic films are a promising option for next-generation high-performance computation platforms. Despite extensive research, there is still no complete quantitative microscopic explanation for how an external DC electric field suppresses superconductivity in thin films. This study aims to provide a quantitative description of superconductivity as a function of film thickness based on Eliashberg's theory. The calculation considers the electrostatics of the electric field, its realistic penetration depth in the film, and its effect on the Cooper pair, which is described as a standard s-wave bound state according to BCS theory. The estimation suggests that an external electric field of approximately $10^8$ V/m is required to suppress superconductivity in 10-30-nm-thick films, which aligns with experimental observations. Ultimately, the study offers "materials by design" guidelines for suppressing supercurrent when an external electric field is applied to the film surface. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily extended to investigate the same effects for ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient field-free switching by orbital Hall torque in a MoS2-based device operating at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-to-spin and spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms in high spin-orbit materials are the new frontier of memory devices. They operate via spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of a magnetic electrode, driven by an applied charge current. In this work, we propose a novel memory device based on the semiconducting two-dimensional centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) MoS2, that operates as a SOT device in the writing process and a spin valve in the reading process. We demonstrate that stable voltage states at room temperature can be deterministically controlled by a switching current density as low as 3.2x10^4 A/cm^2 even in zero field. An applied field 50-100 Oe can be used as a further or alternative control parameter for the state switching. Ab initio calculations of spin Hall effect (SHE) and orbital Hall effect (OHE) indicate that the latter is the only one responsible for the generation of the SOT in the magnetic electrode. The large value of OHC in bulk MoS2 makes our device competitive in terms of energetic efficiency and could be integrated in TMD heterostructures to design memory devices with multiple magnetization states for non-Boolean computation.</description>

      <title>Broken symmetries associated with a Kagome chiral charge order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality or handedness manifests in all fields of science, ranging from cell biology, molecular interaction, and catalysis to different branches of physics. In condensed matter physics, chirality is intrinsic to enigmatic quantum phases, such as chiral charge density waves and chiral superconductivity. Here, the underlying chiral response is subtle and leads to broken symmetries in the ground state. Detection of subtle broken symmetries is the key to understand these quantum states but they are extremely challenging to expose leading to debate and controversy. Here, using second-order optical response, we uncover the broken symmetries of a chiral charge density wave in the Kagome lattice KV3Sb5, revealing the relevant broken symmetries of its charge order. KV3Sb5 undergoes a phase transition to a charge-ordered state at low temperatures. Our polarization-dependent mid-infrared photocurrent microscopy reveals an intrinsic, longitudinal helicity-dependent photocurrent associated with the charge order. Our measurements, supported by our theoretical analysis, provide direct evidence for broken inversion and mirror symmetries at the charge order transition, indicating a chiral charge ordered state. On the other hand, we do not observe a circular photogalvanic effect along the direction perpendicular to that of the incident light, imposing stringent constraints on the rotational and point group symmetries of the charge order. Our study not only visualizes the chiral nature of the Kagome charge order revealing its broken symmetries, but also highlights the nonlinear photogalvanic effect as a sensitive probe for detecting subtle symmetry breakings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking has demonstrated the possibility of discovering the exotic textures of ferromagnetic systems in liquid crystalline fluid ferro-electrics. We show that the polar smectic mesophase exhibited by the first molecule discovered to exhibit a spontaneously chiral ferroelectric nematic phase is also helical has a strongly varied textural morphology depending in its thermal history and phase ordering. Electro-optic studies demonstrate that the two spontaneously chiral phases exhibit field induced phase transitions. For the nematic variant, this process is threshold-less and has no hysteresis while for the smectic it has a clear threshold and shows hysteresis meaning this phase exhibits pseudo-ferrielectric switching, the first of its kind for ferroelectric nematic like phases. We show that helix formation can be both 1st and 2nd order but when it is 1st it is accompanied by pre-transitional helix formation in the preceding ferroelectric nematic phase.</description>

      <title>Efficient passivation of III-As(P) photonic interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface effects can significantly impact the performance of nanophotonic and quantum photonic devices, especially as the device dimensions are reduced. In this work, we propose and investigate a novel approach to surface passivation to mitigate these challenges in photonic nanostructures with III-As(P) quantum wells defined by a dry etching process. The nanostructures are annealed under the phosphine (PH$_3$) ambient inside a metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy chamber to eliminate surface and subsurface defects induced during the dry etching and subsequent oxidation of the etched sidewalls. Moreover, encapsulation of the active material with a wider bandgap material allows for maintaining the band structure of the device, mitigating band bending effects. Our findings reveal an almost order of magnitude reduction in the surface recombination velocity from $2 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{cm/s}$ for the PH$_3$ annealing compared to $1.5 \times 10^4 \, \mathrm{cm/s}$ for the non-passivated structures and $5 \times 10^3 \, \mathrm{cm/s}$ for the standard method based on (NH$_4$)$_2$S wet treatment followed by Al$_2$O$_3$ encapsulation. A further reduction to $5 \times 10^2 \, \mathrm{cm/s}$ is achieved for the InP-regrown samples. Additionally, we develop a model accounting for the impact of surface charges in the analysis of time-resolved photoluminescence curves and demonstrate that the proposed passivation method effectively reduces the surface charge density on the sidewalls of the studied quantum well-based photonic nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Strong impact of low-level substitution of Mn by Fe on the magnetoelectric coupling in $TbMnO_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlation between static magnetoelectric coupling and magnetic structure was investigated in $TbMn_{0.98}Fe_{0.02}O_{3}$ with magnetic field up to 8 T and down to 2 K. Single-crystal neutron diffraction experiments reveal a substantial increase in the temperature dependence of the incommensurate modulation wave vector of the antiferromagnetic phase as the magnetic field strength increases. Magnetic field-dependent pyroelectric current measurements revealed significantly higher magnetoelectric coupling at magnetic fields below 4 T than in pure TbMnO3. This is due to the higher sensitivity of the incommensurably modulated cycloid structure to weak magnetic fields. Detailed analysis of our data confirmed that the ferroelectric polarization is induced by inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for magnetic field strength up to 4 T, but at higher fields a departure from theoretical predictions is ascertained, giving evidence for an additional, as yet misunderstood, contribution to magnetoelectric coupling. It shows that a small 2% substitution of Mn3+ by Fe3+ has a strong impact on the magnetic structure, promoting the destabilization of the incommensurably modulated magnetic cycloidal structure of $TbMnO_{3}$ in a magnetic field above 5 T. We demonstrate that the magnetoelectric coupling magnitude can be tuned through suitable substitutional elements, even at low level, inducing local lattice distortions with different electronic and magnetic properties.</description>

Abstract: Filamentary objects such as nano-wires, nanotubes and DNA are of current interest in physics, nanoscience, chemistry, biology and medicine. They can interact via exceptionally long-ranged many-object van der Waals (vdW, dispersion) forces, causing them to cluster into multi-object bundles. We analyse their vdW interactions quantitatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening. Relevant systems include polyelectrolyte double layers, Nafion exclusion zone, endothelial surface layer of cells, microemulsion interfaces and hexagonal phases, salt fingers in Gibbs Marangoni effects, myosin fibres in muscle, multiple nanotubes in the interior of neuronal axons, and carbon fibre materials.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets are defined as magnetic states with fully compensated spin angular momenta (spins) and broken PT (P: parity, T: time reversal, PT: parity times time reversal) symmetry. We classify three kinds of altermagnets: M-type: broken T symmetry and nonzero net magnetic moments, S-type: broken T symmetry and zero net magnetic moments, and A-type: unbroken T and broken P symmetries. Furthermore, strong altermagnets have spin split bands through exchange coupling in the non-relativistic limit, i.e., for zero spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and weak altermagnets has spin split bands only with non-zero SOC. These strong vs. weak altermagnets can be identified from the total number of symmetric orthogonal spin rotation operations. These classifications of altermagnets will be an essential guidance for the future research on altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Phonon-Phonon Interactions and Weakened Electron-Phonon Coupling in Charge-Density-Wave Topological Semimetal EuAl4 with a Possible Intermediate Electronic State</title>

Abstract: The origin of charge density wave (CDW) is a long-term open issue. Furthermore, the evolution of phonon-phonon interactions (PPI) across CDW transitions has rarely been investigated. Besides, whether electron-phonon coupling (EPC) would be weakened or enhanced after CDW transitions is still under debate. Additionally, CDW provides a fertile ground for uncovering intriguing intermediate electronic states. Here, we report a Raman spectroscopy study of the PPI and EPC in topological semimetal EuAl4 exhibiting a CDW phase below temperature Tc ~ 145 K. The free-charge-carrier-density (nc) and temperature dependences of the Fano asymmetric factors (1/|q|) of the two phonon modes A1g and B1g indicates that below Tc, the EPC becomes weakened probably due to the reduction of the nc. Interestingly, in the temperature range from 50 to 145 K, the steep growth of the 1/|q| leading to the significant deviation from the linear dependence on the nc, together with the shoulder-like features in the temperature evolutions of the 1/|q| and the nc around 50 K, implies the possible existence of an intermediate electronic state with the EPC distinctly larger than the CDW ground state in EuAl4. Furthermore, below Tc, the faster decrease in the full width at half maxima of the B1g phonon mode representing the collective vibrations of the CDW-modulated Al1 atoms suggests that a remarkable growth of the PPI for the B1g phonon mode after the CDW phase transition, which is in contrast to the weakening of the EPC and thus may mainly arise from the strengthening of lattice anharmonicity in EuAl4. Our results not only highlight the significance of the enhanced PPI and the weakened EPC in completely understanding the formation of the CDW phase but also initiate the exploration of novel intermediate electronic states in EuAl4.</description>

      <title>Annealing-Induced Magnetic Modulation in Co- and Y-doped CeO2: Insights from Experiments and DFT</title>

Abstract: The potential applications of dilute magnetic oxides (DMOs) in magneto-optic and spintronic devices have attracted significant attention, although understanding their magnetic behavior is complex due to intricate interactions of intrinsic defects. The present study aims to investigate the effect of different annealing environments on the magnetic properties of polycrystalline transition metal cation (Co and Y) doped CeO2 DMO with a 5% doping concentration of transition metal (TM). The objective is to investigate the defect interactions within the lattice through a comprehensive investigation involving structural characterizations, magnetic measurements, and first principle calculations. The results show that the Ar/H2 annealing environment induced more oxygen vacancies than air-annealed samples. Consequently, field-dependent magnetization measurements revealed above-room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) in both un-doped and TM-doped CeO2. The ferromagnetic (FM) properties of CeO2 resulted from carrier-trapped vacancy centers facilitating exchange interactions between the spins of magnetic ions. The Langevin field profile indicated that TM-doped CeO2 formed more bound magnetic polarons (BMPs) during annealing in an Ar/H2 environment, which contributed to the enhanced ferromagnetism. Similarly, enhancement in the magnetic properties with increasing oxygen vacancies is observed through first principle calculations. This suggests the potential for optimizing the magnetic properties of DMOs through controlled annealing processes.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing thermal fluctuations from polaron formation in halide perovskites</title>

Abstract: Recent angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements of the hole effective mass in CsPbBr$_3$ revealed an enhancement of $\sim$50 % compared to the bare mass computed from first principles for CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 0 K$. This large enhancement was interpreted as evidence of polaron formation. Employing accurate finite-temperature first-principles calculations, we show that the calculated hole effective mass of CsPbBr$_3$ at $T = 300 K$ can explain experimental results without invoking polarons. Thermal fluctuations are particularly strong in halide perovskites compared to conventional semiconductors such as Si and GaAs, and cannot be ignored when comparing with experiment. We not only resolve the debate on polaron formation in halide perovskites, but also demonstrate the general importance of including thermal fluctuations in first-principles calculations for strongly anharmonic materials.</description>

      <title>Strong magneto-optical responses of an ensemble of defect-bound excitons in ambient exposed WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers</title>

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers present a singular coupling in their spin and valley degrees of freedom. Moreover, by applying an external magnetic field it is possible to break the energy degeneracy between their K and $-$K valleys. This valley Zeeman effect opens the possibility of controlling and distinguishing the spin and valley characters of charge carriers in TMDs by their optical transition energies, making these materials promising for the next generation of spintronic and photonic devices. However, the free excitons of pristine TMD monolayers present a moderate valley Zeeman splitting of $\approx 0.23$ meV/T. Therefore, alternative excitonic states with higher magnetic responses are mandatory for application purposes. Here, we investigate the magneto-optical properties of ambient exposed WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers by circularly polarized magneto-photoluminescence experiments at cryogenic temperatures. A broad lower energy photoluminescence emission related to an ensemble of defects is observed, presenting remarkable valley-related splittings of $\approx 1.45$ meV/T and $\approx 1.11$ meV/T for WS$_2$ and WSe$_2$ monolayers, respectively. In addition, we report a significant valley polarization of charge carriers in the defect mid-gap states induced by the external magnetic field. We explain this valley-polarized population and enhanced valley-related splitting in terms of imbalanced intervalley relaxations, leading to a magnetic field-dependent distribution of charge carriers in multiple defect levels. This effect, together with the individual Zeeman shiftings of the mid-gap states, explains the strong magneto-optical responses observed. Our work uncovers the singular potential of manipulating the light emission of ambient exposed TMD monolayers by an external magnetic field.</description>
