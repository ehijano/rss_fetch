      <title>Double sums associated with binomial transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue our investigation of double sums where the inner sum is binomial but incomplete. We prove many new results for these types of double sums associated with binomial transform pairs. As applications we deduce new identities for double sums involving special numbers like Bernoulli numbers, Fibonacci numbers, harmonic numbers, Catalan numbers and Stirling numbers of the second kind. We also consider families of polynomials like Fibonacci polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials, Bernoulli polynomials, and others. Finally, we state new double sums involving hyperbolic functions.</description>

      <title>Optimal graph joining with applications to isomorphism detection and identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an optimal transport based approach for comparing undirected graphs with non-negative edge weights and general vertex labels, and we study connections between the resulting linear program and the graph isomorphism problem. Our approach is based on the notion of a joining of two graphs $G$ and $H$, which is a product graph that preserves their marginal structure. Given $G$ and $H$ and a vertex-based cost function $c$, the optimal graph joining (OGJ) problem finds a joining of $G$ and $H$ minimizing degree weighted cost. The OGJ problem can be written as a linear program with a convex polyhedral solution set. We establish several basic properties of the OGJ problem, and present theoretical results connecting the OGJ problem to the graph isomorphism problem. In particular, we examine a variety of conditions on graph families that are sufficient to ensure that for every pair of graphs $G$ and $H$ in the family (i) $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic if and only if their optimal joining cost is zero, and (ii) if $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic, the the extreme points of the solution set of the OGJ problem are deterministic joinings corresponding to the isomorphisms from $G$ to $H$.</description>

      <title>An exact Ramsey number of large bipartite graphs versus odd wheel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ramsey number for the pair of graphs $\mathbb{K}_{1,n}$ (star) versus $W_{m}$ (wheel) has been extensively studied. In contrast, the Ramsey number of $\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$ versus wheel is not yet explored due to the structural complexity of $\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$. In this article, we have established an exact value of $\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$ versus $W_{m}$ for large $n$ and $m$. In particular, we have proved \begin{equation*} R(\mathbb{K}_{2,n}, W_{m})=3n+4 \end{equation*} if $n$ and $m$ are sufficiently large integers where $n\geq4m$ and $m$ is an odd integer. This also proves the $W_{m}$-goodness of $\mathbb{K}_{2,n}$. We have used a probabilistic method composed of structural analysis in our proof.</description>

      <title>On Fair and Tolerant Colorings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A (not necessarily proper) vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with color classes $V_1$, $V_2$, $\dots$, $V_k$, is said to be a {\it Fair And Tolerant vertex coloring of $G$ with $k$ colors}, whenever $V_1$, $V_2$, $\dots$, $V_k$ are nonempty and there exist two real numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $\alpha \in [0,1]$ and $\beta \in [0,1]$ and the following condition holds for each arbitrary vertex $v$ and every arbitrary color class $V_i$: $$ \bigl| V_i \cap N (v) \bigr| = \begin{cases}
  \alpha \deg (v) &amp; \mbox{ if } \ \ v \notin V_i
  \beta \deg (v) &amp; \mbox{ if } \ \ v \in V_i . \end{cases} $$ The {\it FAT chromatic number} of $G$, denoted by $\chi ^{{\rm FAT}} (G)$, is defined as the maximum positive integer $k$ for which $G$ admits a Fair And Tolerant vertex coloring with $k$ colors. The concept of the FAT chromatic number of graphs was introduced and studied by Beers and Mulas, where they asked for the existence of a function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ in such a way that the inequality $\chi ^{{\rm FAT}} (G) \ \leq \ f \big( \chi (G) \big)$ holds for all graphs $G$. Another similar interesting question concerns the existence of some function $g \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that the inequality $\chi (G) \ \leq \ g \left( \chi ^{{\rm FAT}} (G) \right)$ holds for every graph $G$. In this paper, we establish that both questions admit negative resolutions.</description>

Abstract: For any finite poset we define a generating polynomial counting upsets, downsets, and their intersection. We investigate the behaviour of this polynomial with respect to poset operations, show that it distinguishes series-parallel posets, and comment on connections to the causal set approach to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Richardson tableaux and noncrossing partial matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Richardson tableaux are a remarkable subfamily of standard Young tableaux introduced by Karp and Precup in order to index the irreducible components of Springer fibers equal to Richardson varieties. We show that the set of insertion tableaux of noncrossing partial matchings on $\{1,2,,\ldots, n\}$ by applying the Robinson--Schensted algorithm coincides with the set of Richardson tableaux of size $n$. This leads to a natural one-to-one correspondence between the set of Richardson tableaux of size $n$ and the set of Motzkin paths with $n$ steps, in response to a problem proposed by Karp and Precup. As consequences, we recover some known and establish new properties for Richardson tableaux. Especially, we relate the $q$-counting of Richardson tableaux to $q$-Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>Sum-difference exponents for boundedly many slopes, and rational complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dimension of Kakeya sets can be bounded using sum-difference exponents $\SD(R;s)$ for various sets of rational slopes $R$ and output slope $s$; the arithmetic Kakeya conjecture, which implies the Kakeya conjecture in all dimensions, asserts that the infimum of such exponents is $1$. The best upper bound on this infimum currently is $1.67513\dots$. In this note, inspired by numerical explorations from the tool \texttt{AlphaEvolve}, we study the regime where the cardinality of the set of slopes $R$ is bounded. In this regime, we establish that these exponents converge to $2$ at a rate controlled by the \emph{rational complexity} of $s$ relative to $R$, which measures how efficiently $s$ can be expressed as a rational combination of slopes in $R$.</description>

      <title>String Graphs: Product Structure and Localised Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate string graphs through the lens of graph product structure theory, which describes complicated graphs as subgraphs of strong products of simpler building blocks. A graph $G$ is called a string graph if its vertices can be represented by a collection $\mathcal{C}$ of continuous curves (called a string representation of $G$) in a surface so that two vertices are adjacent in $G$ if and only if the corresponding curves in $\mathcal{C}$ cross. We prove that every string graph with bounded maximum degree in a fixed surface is isomorphic to a subgraph of the strong product of a graph with bounded treewidth and a path. This extends recent product structure theorems for string graphs. Applications of this result are presented. This product structure theorem ceases to be true if the `bounded maximum degree' assumption is relaxed to `bounded degeneracy'. For string graphs in the plane, we give an alternative proof of this result. Specifically, we show that every string graph in the plane has a `localised' string representation where the number of crossing points on the curve representing a vertex $u$ is bounded by a function of the degree of $u$.
  Our proof of the product structure theorem also leads to a result about the treewidth of outerstring graphs, which qualitatively extends a result of Fox and Pach [Eur. J. Comb. 2012] about outerstring graphs with bounded maximum degree. We extend our result to outerstring graphs defined in arbitrary surfaces.</description>

      <title>The first Steklov eigenvalue bound for graphs of positive genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph of genus $g$ with boundary $\delta\Omega$. For $g=0$, Lin and Zhao [J. Lond. Math. Soc. 112 (2025), Paper No. e70238] proved an upper bound for the first (non-trivial) Steklov eigenvalue of $(G, \delta\Omega )$, and they posed the problem of determining a corresponding bound for graphs of genus $g&gt;0$. In this paper, we prove an $O\left(\frac{g}{|\delta \Omega|}\right)$ bound for a bounded-degree graph of positive genus $g$. Our result can be regarded as a discrete analogue of Kokarev's bound [Adv. Math. 258 (2014), 191-239], up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Frustration indices of signed subcubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frustration index of a signed graph is defined as the minimum number of negative edges among all switching-equivalent signatures. This can be regarded as a generalization of the classical \textsc{Max-Cut} problem in graphs, as the \textsc{Max-Cut} problem is equivalent to determining the frustration index of signed graphs with all edges being negative signs. In this paper, we prove that the frustration index of an $n$-vertex signed connected simple subcubic graph, other than $(K_4, -)$, is at most $\frac{3n + 2}{8}$, and we characterize the family of signed graphs for which this bound is attained. This bound can be further improved to $\frac{n}{3}$ for signed $2$-edge-connected simple subcubic graphs, with the exceptional signed graphs being characterized. As a corollary, every signed $2$-edge-connected simple cubic graph on at least $10$ vertices and with $m$ edges has its frustration index at most $\frac{2}{9}m$, where the upper bound is tight as it is achieved by an infinite family of signed cubic graphs.</description>

      <title>A note on the classification of classical distance-regular graphs of negative type and the non-existence of hemisystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to connect some interesting results in the literature on algebraic graph theory and finite geometry. In 1999, Weng gave an almost complete classification of classical distance-regular graphs of negative type with diameter at least 4. He proved that these graphs are either dual polar graphs of Hermitian polar spaces, Hermitian forms graphs, or fall into a last category. It was recently proved by Yian et al. that the latter category does not exist when the diameter equals 3, which by Weng's results proves that they do not exist for bigger diameter. Using a result of Vanhove, this proves that certain hemisystems in Hermitian polar spaces cannot exist.</description>

Abstract: In a 2022, Bartoli, Cossidente, Marino, and Pavese proved that in the projective space ${\rm PG}(3,q^3)$, one can find three $\mathbb F_q$-subgeometries such that the union of their point sets is a strong blocking set. This proves the existence of linear minimal codes with parameters $[3(q^2+1)(q+1),4]_{q^3}$ for every prime power $q$. We give a short proof of this result for odd values of $q &gt; 9$, using the theory of small blocking sets in projective planes.</description>

      <title>Edge-spectral Tur\'{a}n theorems for color-critical graphs with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result of Nosal asserts that every $m$-edge graph with spectral radius $\lambda (G)&gt; \sqrt{m}$ contains a triangle. A celebrated extension of Nikiforov [35] states that if $G$ is an $m$-edge graph with $\lambda (G)&gt; \sqrt{(1- {1}/{r})2m}$, then $G$ contains a clique $K_{r+1}$. This result implies the Tur\'{a}n theorem and Wilf theorem, and offers a new perspective on the existence of substructures. The edge-spectral conditions are versatile for enforcing substructures, as they can be applied to any sparse graph regardless of its edge density. In this paper, we prove that for any color-critical graph $F$ with chromatic number $\chi (F)=r+1\ge 4$, if $m$ is sufficiently large and $G$ is an $F$-free graph with $m$ edges, then $\lambda (G)\le \sqrt{(1- {1}/{r})2m}$, with equality if and only if $G$ is a regular complete $r$-partite graph. This settles an open problem proposed by Yu and Li [52] and also gives spectral bounds for graphs forbidding books and wheels.
  Secondly, we establish an asymptotic formula and structural characterization when we forbid an almost-bipartite graph $F$, where $F$ is called almost-bipartite if it can be made bipartite by removing at most one edge. As applications, we determine the unique $m$-edge spectral extremal graph for every integer $m$ when avoiding certain substructures, including complete bipartite graphs plus an edge, cycles plus an edge, and theta graphs, etc. Our results resolve an open problem proposed by Li, Zhao and Zou [24], as well as two conjectures posed by Liu and Li [31]. The arguments in our proofs are based on the edge-spectral stability method recently established by the authors. In addition, we develop some new spectral techniques, including the stability result for the Perron--Frobenius eigenvector.</description>

      <title>Odd Induced Subgraphs in Graphs of Maximum Degree Four</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is called odd if all of its vertex degrees are odd. A long-standing conjecture asked whether there exists a positive constant $c$ such that every $n$-vertex graph without isolated vertices contains an odd induced subgraph on at least $cn$ vertices. In 2022, Ferber and Krivelevich resolved this conjecture affirmatively with $c=10^{-4}$. A natural question is to determine the largest possible constant $c$. In 1994, Caro remarked that if $2/7$ is a valid value for $c$, then it is the largest possible one. To the best of our knowledge, the bound $c\ge 2/7$ has not been improved. Previous research has established tight bounds for specific graph classes -- for instance, $c = 2/5$ for graphs with maximum degree at most $3$ and without isolated vertices. In this paper, we prove that $c=2/7$ is the tight bound for graphs with maximum degree at most $4$ and without isolated vertices. Our result provides some support for $2/7$ being the largest value of $c$.</description>

      <title>On the largest degrees in intersecting hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\binom{[n]}{k}$ denote the collection of all $k$-subsets of the standard $n$-set $[n]=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. Let $n&gt;2k$ and let $\mathcal{F}\subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ be an {\it intersecting} $k$-graph, i.e., $F\cap F'\neq \emptyset$ for all $F,F'\in \mathcal{F}$. The number of edges $F\in \mathcal{F}$ containing $x\in [n]$ is called the {\it degree} of $x$. Assume that $d_1\geq d_2\geq \ldots\geq d_n$ are the degrees of $\mathcal{F}$ in decreasing order. An important result of Huang and Zhao states that for $n&gt;2k$ the minimum degree $d_n$ is at most $\binom{n-2}{k-2}$. For $n\geq 6k-9$ we strengthen this result by showing $d_{2k+1}\leq \binom{n-2}{k-2}$. As to the second and third largest degrees we prove the best possible bound $d_3\leq d_2\leq \binom{n-2}{k-2}+\binom{n-3}{k-2}$ for $n&gt;2k$. Several more best possible results of a similar nature are established.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Ramsey numbers of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\geq\nu$, let $T$ be an $n$-vertex tree with bipartition class sizes $t_1\geq t_2$, and let $S$ be a $\nu$-vertex tree with bipartition class sizes $\tau_1\geq\tau_2$. Using four natural constructions, we show that the Ramsey number $R(T,S)$ is lower bounded by $\underline{R}(T,S)=\max\{n+\tau_2,\nu+\min\{t_2,\nu\},\min\{2t_1,2\nu\},2\tau_1\}-1$.
  Our main result shows that there exists a constant $c&gt;0$, such that for all sufficiently large integers $n\geq\nu$, if (i) $\Delta(T)\leq cn/\log n$ and $\Delta(S)\leq c\nu/\log\nu$, (ii) $\tau_2\geq t_2$, and (iii) $\nu\geq t_1$, then $R(T,S)=\underline{R}(T,S)$. In particular, this determines the exact Ramsey numbers for a large family of pairs of trees. We also provide examples showing that $R(T,S)$ can exceed $\underline{R}(T,S)$ if any one of the three assumptions (i), (ii), and (iii) is removed.</description>

Abstract: A characterization is completed for finite groups which act regularly on maps with square-free Euler characteristic, associated with infinite families of square-free Euler characteristic regular maps presented. This is based on a classification of finite groups of which each Sylow subgroup has a cyclic or dihedral subgroup of prime index.</description>

      <title>A Dichotomy for 1-Planarity with Restricted Crossing Types Parameterized by Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A drawing of a graph is 1-planar if each edge participates in at most one crossing and adjacent edges do not cross. Up to symmetry, each crossing in a 1-planar drawing belongs to one out of six possible crossing types, where a type characterizes the subgraph induced by the four vertices of the crossing edges. Each of the 63 possible nonempty subsets $\mathcal{S}$ of crossing types gives a recognition problem: does a given graph admit an $\mathcal{S}$-restricted drawing, that is, a 1-planar drawing where the crossing type of each crossing is in $\mathcal{S}$?
  We show that there is a set $\mathcal{S}_{\rm bad}$ with three crossing types and the following properties: If $\mathcal{S}$ contains no crossing type from $\mathcal{S}_{\rm bad}$, then the recognition of graphs that admit an $\mathcal{S}$-restricted drawing is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the treewidth of the input graph. If $\mathcal{S}$ contains any crossing type from $\mathcal{S}_{\rm bad}$, then it is NP-hard to decide whether a graph has an $\mathcal{S}$-restricted drawing, even when considering graphs of constant pathwidth.
  We also extend this characterization of crossing types to 1-planar straight-line drawings and show the same complexity behaviour parameterized by treewidth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $W_{\mathrm{aff}}$ be an extended affine Weyl group and $\mathbf{H}$ and $J$ be the corresponding affine and asymptotic Hecke algebras with standard bases $\{T_x\}$ and $\{t_w\}$, respectively. Viewing $J$ as a subalgebra of the $\mathbf{q}^{-\frac{1}{2}}$-adic completion of $\mathbf{H}$, we give formulas for the coefficient of $T_x$ in $t_w$ for various $x$ and $w$ in the lowest two-sided cell, in terms of generalized exponents of the Langlands dual group, under a hypothesis on the left cell containing $w$. In particular our results hold for the canonical left cell. For such $w$ we also define a seemingly new positive basis for the corresponding subring of $J$. For $\mathrm{GL}_n$, we give partial results for some other cells.</description>

      <title>On Schultz's generalization of Borweins' cubic identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Around 1991, J.M. and P.B. Borwein established a cubic analogue of Jacobi's fundamental identity for theta functions. Their identity serves as the foundation for the subsequent development by B.C. Berndt, S. Bhargava, and F.G. Garvan of Ramanujan's theory of elliptic functions to the cubic base. In 2013, D. Schultz discovered an identity for theta series in three variables which generalizes the Borweins' identity. In this article, we revisit Schultz's identity and present two distinct approaches to its derivation. Our investigation not only provides new proofs but also yields several identities of a similar type. Furthermore, this study enables us to construct new two-variable generalizations of Jacobi's original classical identity.</description>

      <title>Endomorphism and automorphism graphs of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. The directed endomorphism graph, $\dend(G)$ of $G$ is a directed graph with vertex set $G$ and there is a directed edge from the vertex $a$ to the vertex $b$ if $a \neq b$ and there exists an endomorphism on $G$ mapping $a$ to $b$. The endomorphism graph, $\uend(G)$ is the corresponding undirected simple graph. The automorphism graph of $G$ is similarly defined for automorphisms: it is a disjoint union of complete graphs on the orbits of $\Aut(G)$. The endomorphism digraph is a special case of a digraph associated with a transformation monoid, and we begin by introducing this. We have explored graph theoretic properties like size, planarity, girth etc. and tried finding out for which types of groups these graphs are complete, diconnected, trees, bipartite and so on, as well as computing these graphs for some special groups. We conclude with examples showing that things are not always simple.</description>

Abstract: We conduct a quantitative analysis of how many random edges need to be added to a base graph $H$ in order to significantly increase natural minor-monotone graph parameters of the resulting graph $R$. Specifically, we show that if $R$ is obtained from a connected graph $H$ by adding only a few random edges, the tree-width, genus, and Hadwiger number of $R$ become very large, irrespective of the structure of $H$.</description>

      <title>Rank-based linkage I: triplet comparisons and oriented simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02200v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rank-based linkage is a new tool for summarizing a collection $S$ of objects according to their relationships. These objects are not mapped to vectors, and ``similarity'' between objects need be neither numerical nor symmetrical. All an object needs to do is rank nearby objects by similarity to itself, using a \texttt{Comparator} which is transitive, but need not be consistent with any metric on the whole set. Call this a ranking system on $S$. Rank-based linkage is applied to the $K$-nearest neighbor digraph derived from a ranking system. Computations occur on a 2-dimensional abstract oriented simplicial complex whose faces are among the points, edges, and triangles of the line graph of the undirected $K$-nearest neighbor graph on $S$. In $|S| K^2$ steps it builds an edge-weighted linkage graph $(S, \mathcal{L}, \sigma)$ where $\sigma(\{x, y\})$ is called the in-sway between objects $x$ and $y$. Take $\mathcal{L}_t$ to be the links whose in-sway is at least $t$, and partition $S$ into components of the graph $(S, \mathcal{L}_t)$, for varying $t$. Rank-based linkage is a functor from a category of ``out-ordered'' digraphs to a category of partitioned sets, with the practical consequence that augmenting the set of objects in a rank-respectful way gives a fresh clustering which does not ``rip apart'' the previous one. The same holds for single linkage clustering in the metric space context, but not for typical optimization-based methods. Orientation sheaves play in a fundamental role and ensure that partially overlapping data sets can be ``glued'' together. Open combinatorial problems are presented in the last section</description>

      <title>Creating Subgraphs in Semi-Random Hypergraph Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semi-random hypergraph process is a natural generalisation of the semi-random graph process, which can be thought of as a one player game. For fixed $r &lt; s$, starting with an empty hypergraph on $n$ vertices, in each round a set of $r$ vertices $U$ is presented to the player independently and uniformly at random. The player then selects a set of $s-r$ vertices $V$ and adds the hyperedge $U \cup V$ to the $s$-uniform hypergraph. For a fixed (monotone) increasing graph property, the player's objective is to force the graph to satisfy this property with high probability in as few rounds as possible.
  We focus on the case where the player's objective is to construct a subgraph isomorphic to an arbitrary, fixed hypergraph $H$. In the case $r=1$ the threshold for the number of rounds required was already known in terms of the degeneracy of $H$. In the case $2 \le r &lt; s$, we give upper and lower bounds on this threshold for general $H$, and find further improved upper bounds for cliques in particular. We identify cases where the upper and lower bounds match. We also demonstrate that the lower bounds are not always tight by finding exact thresholds for various paths and cycles.</description>

      <title>On coarse tree decompositions and coarse balanced separators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that there is a linear dependence between the treewidth of a graph and its balanced separator number: the smallest integer $k$ such that for every weighing of the vertices, the graph admits a balanced separator of size at most $k$. We investigate whether this connection can be lifted to the setting of coarse graph theory, where both the bags of the considered tree decompositions and the considered separators should be coverable by a bounded number of bounded-radius balls.
  As the first result, we prove that if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ admits balanced separators coverable by $k$ balls of radius $r$, then $G$ also admits tree decompositions ${\cal T}_1$ and ${\cal T}_2$ such that:
  - in ${\cal T}_1$, every bag can be covered by $O(k\log n)$ balls of radius $r$; and
  - in ${\cal T}_2$, every bag can be covered by $O(k^2\log k)$ balls of radius $r(\log k+\log\log n+O(1))$.
  As the second result, we show that if we additionally assume that $G$ has doubling dimension at most $m$, then the functional equivalence between the existence of small balanced separators and of tree decompositions of small width can be fully lifted to the coarse setting. Precisely, we prove that for a positive integer $r$ and a graph $G$ of doubling dimension at most $m$, the following conditions are equivalent, with constants $k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4,\Delta_3,\Delta_4$ depending on each other and on $m$:
  - $G$ admits balanced separators consisting of $k_1$ balls of radius $r$;
  - $G$ has a tree decomposition with bags coverable by $k_2$ balls of radius $r$;
  - $G$ has a tree-partition of maximum degree $\leq \Delta_3$ with bags coverable by $k_3$ balls of radius $r$;
  - $G$ is quasi-isometric to a graph of maximum degree $\leq \Delta_4$ and tree-partition width $\leq k_4$.</description>

This conjecture was known to hold for $t=3$ due to work of Barman Mahanta and Singh. In this paper, we prove this conjecture.</description>

Motivated by recent progress on upper bounds toward the Fourier-Entropy-Influence (FEI) conjecture, we prove a complementary lower bound in terms of squared influences: for every $f:(\{0,1\}^n,\mu_p^n)\to \{-1,1\}$ we have $$ {\rm Ent}_p(f)\ge 4p(1-p)(2p-1)^2\cdot\sum_{k=1}^n{\rm Inf}^{(p)}_k(f)^2.$$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simsun permutations, Andr\'e I permutations and Andr\'e II permutations are three combinatorial models for Euler numbers. It's known that the descent statistic is equidistributed over the set of Andr\'e I permutations and the set of simsun permutations. In this paper, we prove that the trivariate statistic (ides, des, maj), comprising the inverse descent, descent, and major index, are equidistributed over these three sets. This result is equivalent to showing that the inverse descent is equidistributed over these three sets that share the same tree shape. The proof of the equidistribution of the inverse descent over the set of Andr\'e I permutations and the set of Andr\'e II permutations with the same tree shape reduces to establishing new refinements of Stanley's shuffle theorem.</description>

      <title>Entropic additive energy and entropy inequalities for sums and products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following a growing number of studies that, over the past 15 years, have established entropy inequalities via ideas and tools from additive combinatorics, in this work we obtain a number of new bounds for the differential entropy of sums, products, and sum-product combinations of continuous random variables. Partly motivated by recent work by Goh on the discrete entropic version of the notion of "additive energy", we introduce the additive energy of pairs of continuous random variables and prove various versions of the statement that "the additive energy is large if and only if the entropy of the sum is small", along with a version of the Balog-Szemer\'edi-Gowers theorem for differential entropy. Then, motivated in part by recent work by M\'ath\'e and O'Regan, we establish a series of new differential entropy inequalities for products and sum-product combinations of continuous random variables. In particular, we prove a new, general, ring Pl\"unnecke-Ruzsa entropy inequality. We briefly return to the case of discrete entropy and provide a characterization of discrete random variables with "large doubling", analogous to Tao's Freiman-type inverse sumset theory for the case of small doubling. Finally, we consider the natural entropic analog of the Erd\"os-Szemer\'edi sum-product phenomenon for integer-valued random variables. We show that, if it does hold, then the range of parameters for which it does would necessarily be significantly more restricted than its anticipated combinatorial counterpart.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gauge theories with finite gauge groups have applications to quantum simulation and quantum gravity. Recently, the exact number of gauge-invariant states was computed for pure gauge theories on arbitrary lattices. In this work, we generalize this counting to include the case of scalar and fermionic matter, as well as various kinds of boundary conditions. As a byproduct, we consider several related questions, such as the implementation of charge conjugation for a generic finite group. These results are relevant for resource estimation and also as a crosscheck when working in a gauge-invariant basis.</description>

      <title>Simple harmonic oscillators from non-semisimple walled Brauer algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Ergodic averages for sparse corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for the study of the limiting behavior of multiple ergodic averages with commuting transformations when all iterates are given by the same sparse sequence; this enables us to partially resolve several longstanding problems. First, we address a special case of the joint intersectivity question of Bergelson, Leibman, and Lesigne by giving necessary and sufficient conditions under which the multidimensional polynomial Szemer\'edi theorem holds for length-three patterns. Second, we show that for two commuting transformations, the Furstenberg averages remain unchanged when the iterates are taken along sparse sequences such as $[n^c]$ for a positive noninteger $c$, advancing a conjecture of the first author. Third, we extend a result of Chu on popular common differences in linear corners to polynomial and Hardy corners. Lastly, we answer open problems of Le, Moreira, and Richter concerning decomposition results for double correlation sequences. Our toolbox includes recent degree lowering and seminorm smoothing techniques, the machinery of magic extensions of Host, and novel structured extensions motivated by works of Tao and Leng. Combined, these techniques reduce the analysis to settings where the Host-Kra theory of characteristic factors and equidistribution on nilmanifolds yield a family of striking identities from which our main results follow.</description>

      <title>Manivel's semi-group property for Kronecker coefficients, generalized blocks of symmetric groups and Saxl conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an positive integer $k$, let $n:=\binom{k+1}{2}$. In 2012, during a talk at UCLA, Jan Saxl conjectured that all irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ occur in the decomposition of the tensor square of the irreducible representation corresponding to the staircase partition. In this paper, we investigate two useful methods to obtain some irreducible representations that occur in this decomposition. Our main tolls are the semi-group property for Kronecker coefficients and generalized blocks of symmetric groups.</description>

      <title>Bounds for monochromatic solutions to $\{x+y,xy\}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $r$ be a sufficiently large positive integer, and let $N \ge \exp\exp(r^{50})$. Then any $r$-colouring of $[N]$ contains a monochromatic copy of $\{x+y,xy\}$ with $x &gt; y &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Observable sets for the free Schr\"odinger equation on combinatorial graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study observability for the free Schr\"odinger equation $\partial_t u = i\Delta u$ on combinatorial graphs $G=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$. A subset $E\subset\mathcal{V}$ is observable at time $T&gt;0$ if there exists $C(T,E)&gt;0$ such that for all $u_0\in l^2(\mathcal{V})$, $$ \|u_0\|_{l^2(\mathcal{V})}^2 \le C(T,E)\int_0^T \|e^{it\Delta}u_0\|_{l^2(E)}^2\,\d t. $$
  On the one-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}$, we obtain a sharp threshold for thick sets: if $E\subset\mathbb{Z}$ is $\gamma$-thick with $\gamma\geq1/2$, then $E$ is observable at some time; conversely, for every $\gamma&lt;1/2$ there exists a $\gamma$-thick set that is not observable at any time. This critical threshold marks the exact point where the discrete lattice departs from the real line: on the lattice it must be attained, whereas on $\R$ any $\gamma$-thick set with $\gamma&gt;0$ already suffices.
  On $\mathbb{Z}^d$ we show that the complements of finite sets are observable at any time $T&gt;0$. This parallels the Euclidean setting $\R^d$: any set that contains the exterior of a finite ball is observable at any time.
  For finite graphs we give an equivalent characterization of observability in terms of the zero sets of Laplacian eigenfunctions. As an application, we construct unobservable sets of large density on discrete tori, in contrast with the continuous torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, where every nonempty open set is observable.</description>
