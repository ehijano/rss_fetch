      <title>Problems with fixpoints of polynomials of polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in computable analysis, we study fixpoints of certain endofunctors over categories of containers. More specifically, we focus on fibred endofunctors over the fibrewise opposite of the codomain fibration that can be themselves be represented by families of polynomial endofunctors. In this setting, we show how to compute initial algebras, terminal coalgebras and another kind of fixpoint $\zeta$. We then explore a number of examples of derived operators inspired by Weihrauch complexity and the usual construction of the free polynomial monad.
  We introduce $\zeta$-expressions as the syntax of $\mu$-bicomplete categories, extended with $\zeta$-binders and parallel products, which thus have a natural denotation in containers. By interpreting certain $\zeta$-expressions in a category of type 2 computable maps, we are able to capture a number of meaningful Weihrauch degrees, ranging from closed choice on $\{0, 1\}$ to determinacy of infinite parity games, via an "answerable part" operator.</description>

      <title>CTL* Model Checking on Infinite Families of Finite-State Labeled Transition Systems (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study model checking algorithms for infinite families of finite-state labeled transition systems against temporal properties written in CTL*. Such families arise, for example, as models of highly configurable systems or software product lines.
  We model families using context-free graph grammars. We then develop a state labeling algorithm that works compositionally on the grammar's production rules with limited information about the context in which the rule is applied. The result is a graph grammar modeling the same family but with extended labels. We leverage this grammar to decide whether all, some, or (in)finitely many members of a family satisfy a given temporal property. We have implemented our algorithms and present early experiments.</description>

      <title>Contractions of quasi relation algebras and applications to representability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi relation algebras (qRAs) were first described by Galatos and Jipsen in 2013. They are generalisations of relation algebras and can also be viewed as certain residuated lattice expansions. We identify positive symmetric idempotent elements in qRAs and show that they can be used to construct new qRAs, so-called contractions of the original algebra. We then show that the contraction of a distributive qRA will be representable when the original algebra is representable. Further, we identify a class of distributive qRAs that are not finitely representable.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group representable relation algebras play an important role in the study of representable relation algebras. The class of distributive involutive FL-algebras (DInFL-algebras) generalises relation algebras, as well as Sugihara monoids and MV-algebras. We construct DInFL-algebras from pregroups and show that they can be represented as algebras of binary relations. Even for finite pregroups we obtain relational representations of DInFL-algebras with non-Boolean lattice reducts. If the pregroup is enriched with a particular unary order-reversing operation, then our construction yields representation results for distributive quasi relation algebras.</description>

      <title>Computing Fixpoints of Learned Functions: Chaotic Iteration and Simple Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of determining the (least) fixpoint of (higher-dimensional) functions over the non-negative reals frequently occurs when dealing with systems endowed with a quantitative semantics. We focus on the situation in which the functions of interest are not known precisely but can only be approximated. As a first contribution we generalize an iteration scheme called dampened Mann iteration, recently introduced in the literature. The improved scheme relaxes previous constraints on parameter sequences, allowing learning rates to converge to zero or not converge at all. While seemingly minor, this flexibility is essential to enable the implementation of chaotic iterations, where only a subset of components is updated in each step, allowing to tackle higher-dimensional problems. Additionally, by allowing learning rates to converge to zero, we can relax conditions on the convergence speed of function approximations, making the method more adaptable to various scenarios. We also show that dampened Mann iteration applies immediately to compute the expected payoff in various probabilistic models, including simple stochastic games, not covered by previous work.</description>

      <title>Substrate Stability Under Persistent Disagreement: Structural Constraints for Neutral Ontological Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern data systems increasingly operate under conditions of persistent legal, political, and analytic disagreement. In such settings, interoperability cannot rely on shared interpretation, negotiated semantics, or centralized authority. Instead, representations must function as neutral substrates that preserve stable reference across incompatible extensions. This paper investigates the structural constraints imposed on ontological design by this requirement. Building on a neutrality framework that treats interpretive non-commitment and stability under extension as explicit design constraints, we ask what minimal ontological structure is forced if accountability relationships are to remain referable and comparable under disagreement. Minimality here is not mere parsimony: a reduction is admissible only if it does not reintroduce stability-critical distinctions as hidden roles, flags, or contextual predicates. We establish a conditional lower-bound result: any ontology capable of supporting accountability under persistent disagreement must realize at least six distinct identity-and-persistence regimes. We further show that a construction with exactly six such regimes is sufficient to satisfy the stated requirements without embedding causal or normative commitments in the substrate. The result is not a proposal for a universal ontology, but a constraint on what is possible when neutrality and stable reference are treated as non-negotiable design goals.</description>

      <title>A tensor network formalism for neuro-symbolic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unification of neural and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence remains a central open challenge. In this work, we introduce a tensor network formalism, which captures sparsity principles originating in the different approaches in tensor decompositions. In particular, we describe a basis encoding scheme for functions and model neural decompositions as tensor decompositions. The proposed formalism can be applied to represent logical formulas and probability distributions as structured tensor decompositions. This unified treatment identifies tensor network contractions as a fundamental inference class and formulates efficiently scaling reasoning algorithms, originating from probability theory and propositional logic, as contraction message passing schemes. The framework enables the definition and training of hybrid logical and probabilistic models, which we call Hybrid Logic Network. The theoretical concepts are accompanied by the python library tnreason, which enables the implementation and practical use of the proposed architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence Spaces Revisited: A von Neumann (Co)Algebraic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a categorical model of MALL (Multiplicative Additive Linear Logic) inspired by the Heisenberg-Schr\"odinger duality of finite-dimensional quantum theory. Proofs of formulas with positive logical polarity correspond to CPTP (completely positive trace-preserving) maps in our model, i.e. the quantum operations in the Schr\"odinger picture, whereas proofs of formulas with negative logical polarity correspond to CPU (completely positive unital) maps, i.e. the quantum operations in the Heisenberg picture. The mathematical development is based on noncommutative geometry and finite-dimensional von Neumann (co)algebras, which can be defined as special kinds of (co)monoid objects internal to the category of finite-dimensional operator spaces.</description>

      <title>Existential Positive Transductions of Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monadic stability generalizes many tameness notions from structural graph theory such as planarity, bounded degree, bounded tree-width, and nowhere density. The sparsification conjecture predicts that the (possibly dense) monadically stable graph classes are exactly those that can be logically encoded by first-order (FO) transductions in the (always sparse) nowhere dense classes. So far this conjecture has been verified for several special cases, such as for classes of bounded shrub-depth, and for the monadically stable fragments of bounded (linear) clique-width, twin-width, and merge-width.
  In this work we propose the existential positive sparsification conjecture, predicting that the more restricted co-matching-free, monadically stable classes are exactly those that can be transduced from nowhere dense classes using only existential positive FO formulas. While the general conjecture remains open, we verify its truth for all known special cases of the original conjecture. Even stronger, we find the sparse preimages as subgraphs of the dense input graphs.
  As a key ingredient, we introduce a new combinatorial operation, called subflip, that arises as the natural co-matching-free analog of the flip operation, which is a central tool in the characterization of monadic stability. Using subflips, we characterize the co-matching-free fragment of monadic stability by appropriate strengthenings of the known flip-flatness and flipper game characterizations for monadic stability. In an attempt to generalize our results to the more expressive MSO logic, we discover (rediscover?) that on relational structures (existential) positive MSO has the same expressive power as (existential) positive FO.</description>

      <title>Layered automata: A canonical model for automata over infinite words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce layered automata, a subclass of alternating parity automata that generalises deterministic automata. Assuming a consistency property, these automata are history deterministic and 0-1 probabilistic. We show that every omega-regular language is recognised by a unique minimal consistent layered automaton, and that this canonical form can be computed in polynomial time from every layered or deterministic automaton. We further establish that for layered automata both consistency checking and inclusion testing can be performed in polynomial time. Much like deterministic finite automata, minimal consistent layered automata admit a characterisation based on congruences.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of monadically dependent tree-ordered weakly sparse structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class of structures is monadically dependent if one cannot interpret all graphs in colored expansions from the class using a fixed first-order formula. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is the expansion of a $\sigma$-structure with a tree-order. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is weakly sparse if the Gaifman graph of its $\sigma$-reduct excludes some biclique (of a given fixed size) as a subgraph. Tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs are commonly used as tree-models (for example for classes with bounded shrubdepth, structurally bounded expansion, bounded cliquewidth, or bounded twin-width), motivating their study on their own. In this paper, we consider several constructions on tree-ordered structures, such as tree-ordered variants of the Gaifman graph and of the incidence graph, induced and non-induced tree-ordered minors, and generalized fundamental graphs.
  We provide characterizations of monadically dependent classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse $\sigma$-structures based on each of these constructions, some of them establishing unexpected bridges with sparsity theory. As an application, we prove that a class of tree-ordered weakly sparse structures is monadically dependent if and only if its sparsification is nowhere-dense. Moreover, the sparsification transduction translates boundedness of clique-width and linear clique-width into boundedness of tree-width and path-width. We also prove that first-order model checking is not fixed parameter tractable on independent hereditary classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs (assuming $AW[*]\neq FPT$) and give what we believe is the first model-theoretical characterization of classes of graphs excluding a minor, thus opening a new perspective of structural graph theory.</description>

      <title>Games with $\omega$-Automatic Preference Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates Nash equilibria (NEs) in multi-player turn-based games on graphs, where player preferences are modeled as $\omega$-automatic relations via deterministic parity automata. Unlike much of the existing literature, which focuses on specific reward functions, our results apply to any preference relation definable by an $\omega$-automatic relation. We analyze the computational complexity of determining the existence of an NE (possibly under some constraints), verifying whether a given strategy profile forms an NE, and checking whether a specific outcome can be realized by an NE. When a (constrained) NE exists, we show that there always exists one with finite-memory strategies. Finally, we explore fundamental properties of $\omega$-automatic relations and their implications for the existence of equilibria.</description>

      <title>Trees in Coalgebra from Generalized Reachability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15585v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An automaton is called reachable if every state is reachable from the initial state. This notion has been generalized coalgebraically in two ways: first, via a universal property on pointed coalgebras, namely, that a reachable coalgebra has no proper subcoalgebras; and second, a coalgebra is reachable if it arises as the union of an iterative computation of successor states, starting from the initial state.
  In the current paper, we present corresponding universal properties and iterative constructions for trees. The universal property captures when a coalgebra is a tree, namely, when it has no proper tree unravellings. The iterative construction unravels an arbitrary coalgebra to a tree. We show that this yields the expected notion of tree for a variety of standard examples.
  We obtain our characterization of trees by first generalizing the previous theory of reachable coalgebras and of a minimal object in a category, related to projectivity. Surprisingly, both the universal property and the iterative construction for trees arise as instances of this generalized notion of reachability. Our iterative construction works for all analytic set functors.</description>

      <title>Cut-free Deductive System for Continuous Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and develop propositional continuous intuitionistic logic and propositional continuous affine logic via complete algebraic semantics. Our approach centres on AC-algebras, which are algebras $USC(\mathcal{L})$ of sup-preserving functions from $[0,1]$ to an integral commutative residuated complete lattice $\mathcal{L}$ (in the intuitionistic case, $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale). We give an algebraic axiomatisation of AC-algebras in the language of continuous logic and prove, using the Macneille completion, that every Archimedean model embeds into some AC-algebra. We also show that (i) $USC(\mathcal{L})$ satisfies $v \dot + v = 2v$ exactly when $\mathcal{L}$ is a locale, (ii) involutiveness of negation in $USC(\mathcal{L})$ corresponds to that in $\mathcal{L} $, and that (iii) adding those conditions recovers classical continuous logic. For each variant -affine, intuitionistic, involutive, classical -we provide a sequent style deductive system and prove completeness and cut admissibility. This yields the first sequent style formulation of classical continuous logic enjoying cut admissibility.</description>

      <title>Fast Ramsey Quantifier Elimination in LIRA (with applications to liveness checking)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ramsey quantifiers have recently been proposed as a unified framework for handling properties of interests in program verification involving proofs in the form of infinite cliques, which are not expressible in first-order logic. Among others, these include liveness verification and monadic decomposability. We present the tool REAL, which implements an efficient elimination of Ramsey quantifiers in existential linear arithmetic theories over integers (LIA), reals (LRA), and the mixed case (LIRA). The tool supports a convenient input format, which is an extension of SMT-LIB over the aforementioned theories with Ramsey quantifiers. We also demonstrate a substantial speedup from the original prototype. As an application, we provide an automatic translation from FASTer (a tool for verifying reachability over infinite-state systems) output format to our extension of SMT-LIB and show how our tool extends FASTer to liveness checking.</description>

      <title>How hard can it be? Quantifying MITRE attack campaigns with attack trees and cATM logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The landscape of cyber threats grows more complex by the day. Advanced Persistent Threats carry out attack campaigns - e.g. operations Dream Job, Wocao, and WannaCry - against which cybersecurity practitioners must defend. To prioritise which of these to defend against, cybersecurity experts must be equipped with the right toolbox to evaluate the most threatening ones. In particular, they would strongly benefit from (a) an estimation of the likelihood values for each attack recorded in the wild, and (b) transparently operationalising these values to compare campaigns quantitatively. Security experts could then perform transparent and accountable quantitatively-informed decisions. Here we construct such a framework: (1) quantifying the likelihood of attack campaigns via data-driven procedures on the MITRE knowledge-base, (2) introducing a methodology for automatic modelling of MITRE intelligence data, that captures any attack campaign via template attack tree models, and (3) proposing an open-source tool to perform these comparisons based on the cATM logic. Finally, we quantify the likelihood of all MITRE Enterprise campaigns, and compare the likelihood of the Wocao and Dream Job MITRE campaigns - generated with our proposed approach - against manually-built attack tree models. We demonstrate how our methodology is substantially lighter in modelling effort, and capable of capturing all the quantitative relevant data.</description>

      <title>Formalising the Bruhat-Tits Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we describe the formalisation of the Bruhat-Tits tree - an important tool in modern number theory - in the Lean Theorem Prover. Motivated by the goal of connecting to ongoing research, we apply our formalisation to verify a result about harmonic cochains on the tree.</description>
