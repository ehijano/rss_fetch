      <title>Using Fermat-Torricelli points in assessing investment risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Fermat-Torricelli points can be an effective mathematical tool for analyzing numerical series that have a large variance, a pronounced nonlinear trend, or do not have a normal distribution of a random variable. Linear dependencies are very rare in nature. Smoothing numerical series by constructing Fermat-Torricelli points reduces the influence of the random component on the final result.
  The presence of a normal distribution of a random variable for numerical series that relate to long time intervals is an exception to the rule rather than an axiom. The external environment (international economic relations, scientific and technological progress, political events) is constantly changing, which in turn, in general, does not give grounds to assert that under these conditions a random variable satisfies the requirements of the Gauss-Markov theorem.</description>

      <title>Contemporaneous and lagged spillovers across crude oil, carbon emission allowance, climate change, and agriculture futures markets: Evidence from the $R^2$ decomposed connectedness approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the dynamic spillovers among the crude oil, carbon emission allowance, climate change, and agricultural markets. Adopting a novel $R^2$ decomposed connectedness approach, our empirical analysis reveals several key findings. The overall TCI dynamics have been mainly dominated by contemporaneous dynamics rather than the lagged dynamics. We also find climate change has significant spillovers to other markets. Moreover, there are heterogeneous spillover effects among agricultural markets. Specially, corn is the biggest risk contributor to this system, while barley is the major risk receiver of shocks.</description>

      <title>Optimal insurance design with Lambda-Value-at-Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores optimal insurance solutions based on the Lambda-Value-at-Risk ($\Lambda\VaR$). If the expected value premium principle is used, our findings confirm that, similar to the VaR model, a truncated stop-loss indemnity is optimal in the $\Lambda\VaR$ model. We further provide a closed-form expression of the deductible parameter under certain conditions. Moreover, we study the use of a $\Lambda'\VaR$ as premium principle as well, and show that full or no insurance is optimal. Dual stop-loss is shown to be optimal if we use a $\Lambda'\VaR$ only to determine the risk-loading in the premium principle. Moreover, we study the impact of model uncertainty, considering situations where the loss distribution is unknown but falls within a defined uncertainty set. Our findings indicate that a truncated stop-loss indemnity is optimal when the uncertainty set is based on a likelihood ratio. However, when uncertainty arises from the first two moments of the loss variable, we provide the closed-form optimal deductible in a stop-loss indemnity.</description>
