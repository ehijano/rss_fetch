      <title>Generative AI in Live Operations: Evidence of Productivity Gains in Cybersecurity and Endpoint Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the association between generative AI (GAI) tool adoption and four metrics spanning security operations, information protection, and endpoint management: 1) number of security alerts per incident, 2) probability of security incident reopenings, 3) time to classify a data loss prevention alert, and 4) time to resolve device policy conflicts. We find that GAI is associated with robust and statistically and practically significant improvements in the four metrics. Although unobserved confounders inhibit causal identification, these results are among the first to use observational data from live operations to investigate the relationship between GAI adoption and security operations, data loss prevention, and device policy management.</description>

      <title>X-Guard: Multilingual Guard Agent for Content Moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become integral to numerous applications in critical domains where reliability is paramount. Despite significant advances in safety frameworks and guardrails, current protective measures exhibit crucial vulnerabilities, particularly in multilingual contexts. Existing safety systems remain susceptible to adversarial attacks in low-resource languages and through code-switching techniques, primarily due to their English-centric design. Furthermore, the development of effective multilingual guardrails is constrained by the scarcity of diverse cross-lingual training data. Even recent solutions like Llama Guard-3, while offering multilingual support, lack transparency in their decision-making processes. We address these challenges by introducing X-Guard agent, a transparent multilingual safety agent designed to provide content moderation across diverse linguistic contexts. X-Guard effectively defends against both conventional low-resource language attacks and sophisticated code-switching attacks. Our approach includes: curating and enhancing multiple open-source safety datasets with explicit evaluation rationales; employing a jury of judges methodology to mitigate individual judge LLM provider biases; creating a comprehensive multilingual safety dataset spanning 132 languages with 5 million data points; and developing a two-stage architecture combining a custom-finetuned mBART-50 translation module with an evaluation X-Guard 3B model trained through supervised finetuning and GRPO training. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate X-Guard's effectiveness in detecting unsafe content across multiple languages while maintaining transparency throughout the safety evaluation process. Our work represents a significant advancement in creating robust, transparent, and linguistically inclusive safety systems for LLMs and its integrated systems.</description>

      <title>Hardware Design and Security Needs Attention: From Survey to Path Forward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in attention-based artificial intelligence (AI) models have unlocked vast potential to automate digital hardware design while enhancing and strengthening security measures against various threats. This rapidly emerging field leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate HDL code, identify vulnerabilities, and sometimes mitigate them. The state of the art in this design automation space utilizes optimized LLMs with HDL datasets, creating automated systems for register-transfer level (RTL) generation, verification, and debugging, and establishing LLM-driven design environments for streamlined logic designs. Additionally, attention-based models like graph attention have shown promise in chip design applications, including floorplanning. This survey investigates the integration of these models into hardware-related domains, emphasizing logic design and hardware security, with or without the use of IP libraries. This study explores the commercial and academic landscape, highlighting technical hurdles and future prospects for automating hardware design and security. Moreover, it provides new insights into the study of LLM-driven design systems, advances in hardware security mechanisms, and the impact of influential works on industry practices. Through the examination of 30 representative approaches and illustrative case studies, this paper underscores the transformative potential of attention-based models in revolutionizing hardware design while addressing the challenges that lie ahead in this interdisciplinary domain.</description>

      <title>An LLM Framework For Cryptography Over Chat Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed communication, yet their role in secure messaging remains underexplored, especially in surveillance-heavy environments. At the same time, many governments all over the world are proposing legislation to detect, backdoor, or even ban encrypted communication. That emphasizes the need for alternative ways to communicate securely and covertly over open channels. We propose a novel cryptographic embedding framework that enables covert Public Key or Symmetric Key encrypted communication over public chat channels with humanlike produced texts. Some unique properties of our framework are: 1. It is LLM agnostic, i.e., it allows participants to use different local LLM models independently; 2. It is pre- or post-quantum agnostic; 3. It ensures indistinguishability from human-like chat-produced texts. Thus, it offers a viable alternative where traditional encryption is detectable and restricted.</description>

      <title>RAG-Based Fuzzing of Cross-Architecture Compilers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OneAPI is an open standard that supports cross-architecture software development with minimal effort from developers. It brings DPC++ and C++ compilers which need to be thoroughly tested to verify their correctness, reliability, and security. Compilers have numerous code flows and optimization features. This process requires developers with deep understanding of the different compiler flows to craft testcases specific to target paths in the compiler. This testcase creation is a time-consuming and costly process. In this paper, we propose a large-language model (LLM)-based compiler fuzzing tool that integrates the concept of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This tool automates the testcase generation task and relieves experienced compiler developers from investing time to craft testcase generation patterns. We test our proposed approach on the Intel DPC++/C++ compiler. This compiler compiles SYCL code and allows developers to offload it to different architectures, e.g. GPUs and CPUs from different vendors. Using this tool, we managed to identify 87 SYCL code test cases that lead to output value mismatch or compiler runtime errors when compiled using Intel DPC++ and clang++ compilers and run on different architectures. The testcases and the identified unexpected behaviors of the compilers under test were obtained within only few hours with no prior background on the compiler passes under tests. This tool facilitates efficient compiler fuzzing with reduced developer time requirements via the dynamic testcase creation capability provided by an LLM with RAG.</description>

      <title>Robust Steganography from Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent steganographic schemes, starting with Meteor (CCS'21), rely on leveraging large language models (LLMs) to resolve a historically-challenging task of disguising covert communication as ``innocent-looking'' natural-language communication. However, existing methods are vulnerable to ``re-randomization attacks,'' where slight changes to the communicated text, that might go unnoticed, completely destroy any hidden message. This is also a vulnerability in more traditional encryption-based stegosystems, where adversaries can modify the randomness of an encryption scheme to destroy the hidden message while preserving an acceptable covertext to ordinary users. In this work, we study the problem of robust steganography. We introduce formal definitions of weak and strong robust LLM-based steganography, corresponding to two threat models in which natural language serves as a covertext channel resistant to realistic re-randomization attacks. We then propose two constructions satisfying these notions. We design and implement our steganographic schemes that embed arbitrary secret messages into natural language text generated by LLMs, ensuring recoverability even under adversarial paraphrasing and rewording attacks. To support further research and real-world deployment, we release our implementation and datasets for public use.</description>

      <title>MCP Bridge: A Lightweight, LLM-Agnostic RESTful Proxy for Model Context Protocol Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with external tools through standardized interfaces like the Model Context Protocol (MCP). However, current MCP implementations face critical limitations: they typically require local process execution through STDIO transports, making them impractical for resource-constrained environments like mobile devices, web browsers, and edge computing. We present MCP Bridge, a lightweight RESTful proxy that connects to multiple MCP servers and exposes their capabilities through a unified API. Unlike existing solutions, MCP Bridge is fully LLM-agnostic, supporting any backend regardless of vendor. The system implements a risk-based execution model with three security levels standard execution, confirmation workflow, and Docker isolation while maintaining backward compatibility with standard MCP clients. Complementing this server-side infrastructure is a Python based MCP Gemini Agent that facilitates natural language interaction with MCP tools. The evaluation demonstrates that MCP Bridge successfully addresses the constraints of direct MCP connections while providing enhanced security controls and cross-platform compatibility, enabling sophisticated LLM-powered applications in previously inaccessible environments</description>

      <title>Privacy Preservation in Gen AI Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of machines to comprehend and produce language that is similar to that of humans has revolutionized sectors like customer service, healthcare, and finance thanks to the quick advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which are fueled by Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). However, because LLMs trained on large datasets may unintentionally absorb and reveal Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from user interactions, these capabilities also raise serious privacy concerns. Deep neural networks' intricacy makes it difficult to track down or stop the inadvertent storing and release of private information, which raises serious concerns about the privacy and security of AI-driven data. This study tackles these issues by detecting Generative AI weaknesses through attacks such as data extraction, model inversion, and membership inference. A privacy-preserving Generative AI application that is resistant to these assaults is then developed. It ensures privacy without sacrificing functionality by using methods to identify, alter, or remove PII before to dealing with LLMs. In order to determine how well cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS provide privacy tools for protecting AI applications, the study also examines these technologies. In the end, this study offers a fundamental privacy paradigm for generative AI systems, focusing on data security and moral AI implementation, and opening the door to a more secure and conscientious use of these tools.</description>

      <title>CAShift: Benchmarking Log-Based Cloud Attack Detection under Normality Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of cloud-native computing, securing cloud environments has become an important task. Log-based Anomaly Detection (LAD) is the most representative technique used in different systems for attack detection and safety guarantee, where multiple LAD methods and relevant datasets have been proposed. However, even though some of these datasets are specifically prepared for cloud systems, they only cover limited cloud behaviors and lack information from a whole-system perspective. Besides, another critical issue to consider is normality shift, which implies the test distribution could differ from the training distribution and highly affects the performance of LAD. Unfortunately, existing works only focus on simple shift types such as chronological changes, while other important and cloud-specific shift types are ignored, e.g., the distribution shift introduced by different deployed cloud architectures. Therefore, creating a new dataset that covers diverse behaviors of cloud systems and normality shift types is necessary.
  To fill the gap in evaluating LAD under real-world conditions, we present CAShift, the first normality shift-aware dataset for cloud systems. CAShift captures three shift types, including application, version, and cloud architecture shifts, and includes 20 diverse attack scenarios across various cloud components. Using CAShift, we conduct an empirical study showing that (1) all LAD methods are significantly affected by normality shifts, with performance drops of up to 34%, and (2) continuous learning techniques can improve F1-scores by up to 27%, depending on data usage and algorithm choice. Based on our findings, we offer valuable implications for future research in designing more robust LAD models and methods for LAD shift adaptation.</description>

      <title>Secure Physical Layer Communications for Low-Altitude Economy Networking: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Low-Altitude Economy Networking (LAENet) is emerging as a transformative paradigm that enables an integrated and sophisticated communication infrastructure to support aerial vehicles in carrying out a wide range of economic activities within low-altitude airspace. However, the physical layer communications in the LAENet face growing security threats due to inherent characteristics of aerial communication environments, such as signal broadcast nature and channel openness. These challenges highlight the urgent need for safeguarding communication confidentiality, availability, and integrity. In view of the above, this survey comprehensively reviews existing secure countermeasures for physical layer communication in the LAENet. We explore core methods focusing on anti-eavesdropping and authentication for ensuring communication confidentiality. Subsequently, availability-enhancing techniques are thoroughly discussed for anti-jamming and spoofing defense. Then, we review approaches for safeguarding integrity through anomaly detection and injection protection. Furthermore, we discuss future research directions, emphasizing energy-efficient physical layer security, multi-drone collaboration for secure communication, AI-driven security defense strategy, space-air-ground integrated security architecture, and 6G-enabled secure UAV communication. This survey may provide valuable references and new insights for researchers in the field of secure physical layer communication for the LAENet.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Layered Security Analysis of Blockchain Systems: From Attack Vectors to Defense and System Hardening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of Bitcoin enables people to understand blockchain technology gradually. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that does not rely on third-party credit institutions, and the core of Bitcoin's underlying technology is blockchain. With the increasing value of Bitcoin and the vigorous development of decentralization, people's research on blockchain is also increasing day by day. Today's blockchain technology has not only made great achievements in the application of Bitcoin, but has also been preliminarily applied in other fields, such as finance, medical treatment, the Internet of Things, and so on. However, with the initial application of blockchain technology on the Internet, the security of blockchain technology has also been widely concerned by people in the industry. For example, whether currency trading platforms, smart contracts, blockchain consensus mechanisms, and other technologies are vulnerable to attacks, and how we can defend against these attacks digitally and optimize the blockchain system is exactly the subject we want to study. For the security of appeal blockchain, this paper first analyzes the security threats faced by the application digital currency trading platform of the blockchain system, then analyzes the security problems of smart contract closely related to blockchain 2.0, and then analyzes and studies the security threats of blockchain public chain, consensus mechanism, and P2P. Finally, combined with the security problems at all levels of the blockchain system we analyze and study how to optimize the security of the blockchain system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social Virtual Reality (VR) platforms have surged in popularity, yet their security risks remain underexplored. This paper presents four novel UI attacks that covertly manipulate users into performing harmful actions through deceptive virtual content. Implemented on VRChat and validated in an IRB-approved study with 30 participants, these attacks demonstrate how deceptive elements can mislead users into malicious actions without their awareness. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose MetaScanner, a proactive countermeasure that rapidly analyzes objects and scripts in virtual worlds, detecting suspicious elements within seconds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain and smart contracts have emerged as revolutionary technologies transforming distributed computing. While platform evolution and smart contracts' inherent immutability necessitate migrations both across and within chains, migrating the vast amounts of critical data in these contracts while maintaining data integrity and minimizing operational disruption presents a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we present SmartShift, a framework that enables secure and efficient smart contract migrations through intelligent state partitioning and progressive function activation, preserving operational continuity during transitions. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartShift significantly reduces migration downtime while ensuring robust security, establishing a foundation for efficient and secure smart contract migration systems.</description>

      <title>CrossLink: A Decentralized Framework for Secure Cross-Chain Smart Contract Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces CrossLink, a decentralized framework for secure cross-chain smart contract execution that effectively addresses the inherent limitations of contemporary solutions, which primarily focus on asset transfers and rely on potentially vulnerable centralized intermediaries. Recognizing the escalating demand for seamless interoperability among decentralized applications, CrossLink provides a trustless mechanism for smart contracts across disparate blockchain networks to communicate and interact. At its core, CrossLink utilizes a compact chain for selectively storing authorized contract states and employs a secure inter-chain messaging mechanism to ensure atomic execution and data consistency. By implementing a deposit/collateral fee system and efficient state synchronization, CrossLink enhances security and mitigates vulnerabilities, offering a novel approach to seamless, secure, and decentralized cross-chain interoperability. A formal security analysis further validates CrossLink's robustness against unauthorized modifications and denial-of-service attacks.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Cyberattack Detection and Identification for Automatic Generation Control Systems Considering Nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic generation control (AGC) systems play a crucial role in maintaining system frequency across power grids. However, AGC systems' reliance on communicated measurements exposes them to false data injection attacks (FDIAs), which can compromise the overall system stability. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML)-based detection framework that identifies FDIAs and determines the compromised measurements. The approach utilizes an ML model trained offline to accurately detect attacks and classify the manipulated signals based on a comprehensive set of statistical and time-series features extracted from AGC measurements before and after disturbances. For the proposed approach, we compare the performance of several powerful ML algorithms. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in detecting FDIAs while maintaining a low false alarm rate, with an F1-score of up to 99.98%, outperforming existing approaches.</description>

      <title>PLS-Assisted Offloading for Edge Computing-Enabled Post-Quantum Security in Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards, it has become imperative for resource-constrained devices (RCDs) in the Internet of Things (IoT) to adopt these quantum-resistant protocols. However, the high computational overhead and the large key sizes associated with PQC make direct deployment on such devices impractical. To address this challenge, we propose an edge computing-enabled PQC framework that leverages a physical-layer security (PLS)-assisted offloading strategy, allowing devices to either offload intensive cryptographic tasks to a post-quantum edge server (PQES) or perform them locally. Furthermore, to ensure data confidentiality within the edge domain, our framework integrates two PLS techniques: offloading RCDs employ wiretap coding to secure data transmission, while non-offloading RCDs serve as friendly jammers by broadcasting artificial noise to disrupt potential eavesdroppers. Accordingly, we co-design the computation offloading and PLS strategy by jointly optimizing the device transmit power, PQES computation resource allocation, and offloading decisions to minimize overall latency under resource constraints. Numerical results demonstrate significant latency reductions compared to baseline schemes, confirming the scalability and efficiency of our approach for secure PQC operations in IoT networks.</description>

      <title>AdaSteer: Your Aligned LLM is Inherently an Adaptive Jailbreak Defender</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive efforts in safety alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Activation steering offers a training-free defense method but relies on fixed steering coefficients, resulting in suboptimal protection and increased false rejections of benign inputs. To address this, we propose AdaSteer, an adaptive activation steering method that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on input characteristics. We identify two key properties: Rejection Law (R-Law), which shows that stronger steering is needed for jailbreak inputs opposing the rejection direction, and Harmfulness Law (H-Law), which differentiates adversarial and benign inputs. AdaSteer steers input representations along both the Rejection Direction (RD) and Harmfulness Direction (HD), with adaptive coefficients learned via logistic regression, ensuring robust jailbreak defense while preserving benign input handling. Experiments on LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5 show that AdaSteer outperforms baseline methods across multiple jailbreak attacks with minimal impact on utility. Our results highlight the potential of interpretable model internals for real-time, flexible safety enforcement in LLMs.</description>

      <title>A Secure Communication Protocol for Remote Keyless Entry System with Adaptive Adjustment of Transmission Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) systems have become a standard feature in modern vehicles, yet their unidirectional fixed-frequency radio communication renders them vulnerable to replay attacks, impersonation attacks, cryptanalysis, and intentional interference. Existing cryptographic authentication methods enhance security but often fail to address real-world constraints such as computational efficiency and radio interference. To mitigate these threats, we designed the Adaptive Frequency-Hopping Algorithm and the Adaptive TXP and PHY Mode Control Algorithm that can dynamically optimize channel selection, transmission power, and PHY modes based on real-time channel quality assessment. To enhance the security and reliability of RKE systems, we propose the Lightweight Vehicle-Key Authentication Protocol. In addition, a prototype of the proposed scheme was implemented to verify its effectiveness in mitigating interference and preventing unauthorized access.Experimental results show that our scheme significantly enhances communication security and reliability while maintaining low computational overhead. Under mild interference conditions, the packet delivery rate (PDR) of the adaptive scheme increases from 93% to 99.23%, and under strong interference, it improves from 85% to 99.01%. Additionally, the scheme effectively prevents replay and impersonation attacks, ensuring secure vehicle access control by dynamically optimizing communication parameters to maintain stable and reliable transmission.</description>

      <title>Eccfrog512ck2: An Enhanced 512-bit Weierstrass Elliptic Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whilst many key exchange and digital signature methods use the NIST P256 (secp256r1) and secp256k1 curves, there is often a demand for increased security. With these curves, we have a 128-bit security. These security levels can be increased to 256-bit security with NIST P-521 Curve 448 and Brainpool-P512. This paper outlines a new curve - Eccfrog512ck2 - and which provides 256-bit security and enhanced performance over NIST P-521. Along with this, it has side-channel resistance and is designed to avoid weaknesses such as related to the MOV attack. It shows that Eccfrog512ck2 can have a 61.5% speed-up on scalar multiplication and a 33.3% speed-up on point generation over the NIST P-521 curve.</description>

      <title>ControlNET: A Firewall for RAG-based LLM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced the factual accuracy and domain adaptability of Large Language Models (LLMs). This advancement has enabled their widespread deployment across sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and enterprise applications. RAG mitigates hallucinations by integrating external knowledge, yet introduces privacy risk and security risk, notably data breaching risk and data poisoning risk. While recent studies have explored prompt injection and poisoning attacks, there remains a significant gap in comprehensive research on controlling inbound and outbound query flows to mitigate these threats. In this paper, we propose an AI firewall, ControlNET, designed to safeguard RAG-based LLM systems from these vulnerabilities. ControlNET controls query flows by leveraging activation shift phenomena to detect adversarial queries and mitigate their impact through semantic divergence. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four different benchmark datasets including Msmarco, HotpotQA, FinQA, and MedicalSys using state-of-the-art open source LLMs (Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral). Our results demonstrate that ControlNET achieves over 0.909 AUROC in detecting and mitigating security threats while preserving system harmlessness. Overall, ControlNET offers an effective, robust, harmless defense mechanism, marking a significant advancement toward the secure deployment of RAG-based LLM systems.</description>

      <title>Bridging Immutability with Flexibility: A Scheme for Secure and Efficient Smart Contract Upgrades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of blockchain technology has revolutionized contract execution through the introduction of smart contracts. Ethereum, the leading blockchain platform, leverages smart contracts to power decentralized applications (DApps), enabling transparent and self-executing systems across various domains. While the immutability of smart contracts enhances security and trust, it also poses significant challenges for updates, defect resolution, and adaptation to changing requirements. Existing upgrade mechanisms are complex, resource-intensive, and costly in terms of gas consumption, often compromising security and limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose FlexiContracts+, a novel scheme that reimagines smart contracts by enabling secure, in-place upgrades on Ethereum while preserving historical data without relying on multiple contracts or extensive pre-deployment planning. FlexiContracts+ enhances security, simplifies development, reduces engineering overhead, and supports adaptable, expandable smart contracts. Comprehensive testing demonstrates that FlexiContracts+ achieves a practical balance between immutability and flexibility, advancing the capabilities of smart contract systems.</description>

      <title>The Structural Safety Generalization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLM jailbreaks are a widespread safety challenge. Given this problem has not yet been tractable, we suggest targeting a key failure mechanism: the failure of safety to generalize across semantically equivalent inputs. We further focus the target by requiring desirable tractability properties of attacks to study: explainability, transferability between models, and transferability between goals. We perform red-teaming within this framework by uncovering new vulnerabilities to multi-turn, multi-image, and translation-based attacks. These attacks are semantically equivalent by our design to their single-turn, single-image, or untranslated counterparts, enabling systematic comparisons; we show that the different structures yield different safety outcomes. We then demonstrate the potential for this framework to enable new defenses by proposing a Structure Rewriting Guardrail, which converts an input to a structure more conducive to safety assessment. This guardrail significantly improves refusal of harmful inputs, without over-refusing benign ones. Thus, by framing this intermediate challenge - more tractable than universal defenses but essential for long-term safety - we highlight a critical milestone for AI safety research.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Fear of Losing Alignment in LLM Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary capabilities in understanding complex contexts and performing a wide range of tasks. However, LLMs can also answer questions that are unethical or harmful, raising concerns about their applications. To regulate LLMs' responses to such questions, a training strategy called \textit{alignment} can help. Yet, alignment can be unexpectedly compromised when fine-tuning an LLM for downstream tasks. This paper focuses on recovering the alignment lost during fine-tuning.
  We observe that there are two distinct directions inherent in an aligned LLM: the \textit{aligned direction} and the \textit{harmful direction}. An LLM is inclined to answer questions in the aligned direction while refusing queries in the harmful direction. Therefore, we propose to recover the harmful direction of the fine-tuned model that has been compromised. Specifically, we restore a small subset of the fine-tuned model's weight parameters from the original aligned model using gradient descent. We also introduce a rollback mechanism to avoid aggressive recovery and maintain downstream task performance. Our evaluation on 125 fine-tuned LLMs demonstrates that our method can reduce their harmful rate (percentage of answering harmful questions) from 33.25\% to 1.74\%, without sacrificing task performance much. In contrast, the existing methods either only reduce the harmful rate to a limited extent or significantly impact the normal functionality.

      <title>An Investigation of Large Language Models and Their Vulnerabilities in Spam Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spam messages continue to present significant challenges to digital users, cluttering inboxes and posing security risks. Traditional spam detection methods, including rules-based, collaborative, and machine learning approaches, struggle to keep up with the rapidly evolving tactics employed by spammers. This project studies new spam detection systems that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned with spam datasets. More importantly, we want to understand how LLM-based spam detection systems perform under adversarial attacks that purposefully modify spam emails and data poisoning attacks that exploit the differences between the training data and the massages in detection, to which traditional machine learning models are shown to be vulnerable. This experimentation employs two LLM models of GPT2 and BERT and three spam datasets of Enron, LingSpam, and SMSspamCollection for extensive training and testing tasks. The results show that, while they can function as effective spam filters, the LLM models are susceptible to the adversarial and data poisoning attacks. This research provides very useful insights for future applications of LLM models for information security.</description>

      <title>StruPhantom: Evolutionary Injection Attacks on Black-Box Tabular Agents Powered by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized popular business applications dealing with tabular data, i.e., tabular agents. Although LLMs are observed to be vulnerable against prompt injection attacks from external data sources, tabular agents impose strict data formats and predefined rules on the attacker's payload, which are ineffective unless the agent navigates multiple layers of structural data to incorporate the payload. To address the challenge, we present a novel attack termed StruPhantom which specifically targets black-box LLM-powered tabular agents. Our attack designs an evolutionary optimization procedure which continually refines attack payloads via the proposed constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search augmented by an off-topic evaluator. StruPhantom helps systematically explore and exploit the weaknesses of target applications to achieve goal hijacking. Our evaluation validates the effectiveness of StruPhantom across various LLM-based agents, including those on real-world platforms, and attack scenarios. Our attack achieves over 50% higher success rates than baselines in enforcing the application's response to contain phishing links or malicious codes.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the attacker's knowledge in inference attacks against Searchable Symmetric Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encrypted search schemes have been proposed to address growing privacy concerns. However, several leakage-abuse attacks have highlighted some security vulnerabilities. Recent attacks assumed an attacker's knowledge containing data ``similar'' to the indexed data. However, this vague assumption is barely discussed in literature: how likely is it for an attacker to obtain a "similar enough" data?
  Our paper provides novel statistical tools usable on any attack in this setting to analyze its sensitivity to data similarity. First, we introduce a mathematical model based on statistical estimators to analytically understand the attackers' knowledge and the notion of similarity. Second, we conceive statistical tools to model the influence of the similarity on the attack accuracy. We apply our tools on three existing attacks to answer questions such as: is similarity the only factor influencing accuracy of a given attack? Third, we show that the enforcement of a maximum index size can make the ``similar-data'' assumption harder to satisfy. In particular, we propose a statistical method to estimate an appropriate maximum size for a given attack and dataset. For the best known attack on the Enron dataset, a maximum index size of 200 guarantees (with high probability) the attack accuracy to be below 5%.</description>

      <title>Proofs of Useful Work from Arbitrary Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the longstanding open problem of implementing Nakamoto's proof-of-work (PoW) consensus based on a real-world computational task $T(x)$ (as opposed to artificial random hashing), in a truly permissionless setting where the miner itself chooses the input $x$. The challenge in designing such a Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) protocol, is using the native computation of $T(x)$ to produce a PoW certificate with prescribed hardness and with negligible computational overhead over the worst-case complexity of $T(\cdot)$ -- This ensures malicious miners cannot ``game the system" by fooling the verifier to accept with higher probability compared to honest miners (while using similar computational resources). Indeed, obtaining a PoUW with $O(1)$-factor overhead is trivial for any task $T$, but also useless.
  Our main result is a PoUW for the task of Matrix Multiplication $MatMul(A,B)$ of arbitrary matrices with $1+o(1)$ multiplicative overhead compared to naive $MatMul$ (even in the presence of Fast Matrix Multiplication-style algorithms, which are currently impractical). We conjecture that our protocol has optimal security in the sense that a malicious prover cannot obtain any significant advantage over an honest prover. This conjecture is based on reducing hardness of our protocol to the task of solving a batch of low-rank random linear equations which is of independent interest.
  Since $MatMul$s are the bottleneck of AI compute as well as countless industry-scale applications, this primitive suggests a concrete design of a new L1 base-layer protocol, which nearly eliminates the energy-waste of Bitcoin mining -- allowing GPU consumers to reduce their AI training and inference costs by ``re-using" it for blockchain consensus, in exchange for block rewards (2-for-1). This blockchain is currently under construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poorly designed smart contracts are particularly vulnerable, as they may allow attackers to exploit weaknesses and steal the virtual currency they manage. In this study, we train a model using unsupervised learning to identify vulnerabilities in the Solidity source code of Ethereum smart contracts. To address the challenges associated with real-world smart contracts, our training data is derived from actual vulnerability samples obtained from datasets such as SmartBugs Curated and the SolidiFI Benchmark. These datasets enable us to develop a robust unsupervised static analysis method for detecting five specific vulnerabilities: Reentrancy, Access Control, Timestamp Dependency, tx.origin, and Unchecked Low-Level Calls. We employ clustering algorithms to identify outliers, which are subsequently classified as vulnerable smart contracts.</description>

      <title>Do We Really Need Curated Malicious Data for Safety Alignment in Multi-modal Large Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress, yet their safety alignment remains limited. Typically, current open-source MLLMs rely on the alignment inherited from their language module to avoid harmful generations. However, the lack of safety measures specifically designed for multi-modal inputs creates an alignment gap, leaving MLLMs vulnerable to vision-domain attacks such as typographic manipulation. Current methods utilize a carefully designed safety dataset to enhance model defense capability, while the specific knowledge or patterns acquired from the high-quality dataset remain unclear. Through comparison experiments, we find that the alignment gap primarily arises from data distribution biases, while image content, response quality, or the contrastive behavior of the dataset makes little contribution to boosting multi-modal safety. To further investigate this and identify the key factors in improving MLLM safety, we propose finetuning MLLMs on a small set of benign instruct-following data with responses replaced by simple, clear rejection sentences. Experiments show that, without the need for labor-intensive collection of high-quality malicious data, model safety can still be significantly improved, as long as a specific fraction of rejection data exists in the finetuning set, indicating the security alignment is not lost but rather obscured during multi-modal pretraining or instruction finetuning. Simply correcting the underlying data bias could narrow the safety gap in the vision domain.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Privacy Leakage in Split Inference via Fisher-Approximated Shannon Information Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split inference (SI) partitions deep neural networks into distributed sub-models, enabling privacy-preserving collaborative learning. Nevertheless, it remains vulnerable to Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs), wherein adversaries exploit exposed smashed data to reconstruct raw inputs. Despite extensive research on adversarial attack-defense games, a shortfall remains in the fundamental analysis of privacy risks. This paper establishes a theoretical framework for privacy leakage quantification using information theory, defining it as the adversary's certainty and deriving both average-case and worst-case error bounds. We introduce Fisher-approximated Shannon information (FSInfo), a novel privacy metric utilizing Fisher Information (FI) for operational privacy leakage computation. We empirically show that our privacy metric correlates well with empirical attacks and investigate some of the factors that affect privacy leakage, namely the data distribution, model size, and overfitting.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Practices in LLM-driven Offensive Security: Testbeds, Metrics, and Experiment Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful approach for driving offensive penetration-testing tooling. This paper analyzes the methodology and benchmarking practices used for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM)-driven attacks, focusing on offensive uses of LLMs in cybersecurity. We review 16 research papers detailing 15 prototypes and their respective testbeds.
  We detail our findings and provide actionable recommendations for future research, emphasizing the importance of extending existing testbeds, creating baselines, and including comprehensive metrics and qualitative analysis. We also note the distinction between security research and practice, suggesting that CTF-based challenges may not fully represent real-world penetration testing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Universally Composable Commitments with Communicating Malicious Physically Uncloneable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the possibility of universally composable (UC)-secure commitments using Physically Uncloneable Functions (PUFs) within a new adversarial model. We introduce the communicating malicious PUFs, i.e. malicious PUFs that can interact with their creator even when not in their possession, obtaining a stronger adversarial model. Prior work [ASIACRYPT 2013, LNCS, vol. 8270, pp. 100-119] proposed a compiler for constructing UC-secure commitments from ideal extractable commitments, and our task would be to adapt the ideal extractable commitment scheme proposed therein to our new model. However, we found an attack and identified a few other issues in that construction, and to address them, we modified the aforementioned ideal extractable commitment scheme and introduced new properties and tools that allow us to rigorously develop and present security proofs in this context. We propose a new UC-secure commitment scheme against adversaries that can only create stateless malicious PUFs which can receive, but not send, information from their creators. Our protocol is more efficient compared to previous proposals, as we have parallelized the ideal extractable commitments within it. The restriction to stateless malicious PUFs is significant, mainly since the protocol from [ASIACRYPT 2013, LNCS, vol. 8270, pp. 100-119] assumes malicious PUFs with unbounded state, thus limiting its applicability. However it is the only way we found to address the issues of the original construction. We hope that in future work this restriction can be lifted, and along the lines of our work, UC-secure commitments with fewer restrictions on both the state and communication can be constructed.</description>

      <title>Shield Bash: Abusing Defensive Coherence State Retrieval to Break Timing Obfuscation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microarchitectural attacks are a significant concern, leading to many hardware-based defense proposals. However, different defenses target different classes of attacks, and their impact on each other has not been fully considered. To raise awareness of this problem, we study an interaction between two state-of-the art defenses in this paper, timing obfuscations of remote cache lines (TORC) and delaying speculative changes to remote cache lines (DSRC). TORC mitigates cache-hit based attacks and DSRC mitigates speculative coherence state change attacks.
  We observe that DSRC enables coherence information to be retrieved into the processor core, where it is out of the reach of timing obfuscations to protect. This creates an unforeseen consequence that redo operations can be triggered within the core to detect the presence or absence of remote cache lines, which constitutes a security vulnerability. We demonstrate that a new covert channel attack is possible using this vulnerability. We propose two ways to mitigate the attack, whose performance varies depending on an application's cache usage. One way is to never send remote exclusive coherence state (E) information to the core even if it is created. The other way is to never create a remote E state, which is responsible for triggering redos.
  We demonstrate the timing difference caused by this microarchitectural defense assumption violation using GEM5 simulations. Performance evaluation on SPECrate 2017 and PARSEC benchmarks of the two fixes show less than 32\% average overhead across both sets of benchmarks. The repair which prevented the creation of remote E state had less than 2.8% average overhead.</description>

      <title>Uncertain Location Transmitter and UAV-Aided Warden Based LEO Satellite Covert Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel covert communication system in which a ground user, Alice, transmits unauthorized message fragments to Bob, a low-Earth orbit satellite (LEO), and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) warden (Willie) attempts to detect these transmissions. The key contribution is modeling a scenario where Alice and Willie are unaware of each other's exact locations and move randomly within a specific area. Alice utilizes environmental obstructions to avoid detection and only transmits when the satellite is directly overhead. LEO satellite technology allows users to avoid transmitting messages near a base station. We introduce two key performance metrics: catch probability (Willie detects and locates Alice during a message chunk transmission) and overall catch probability over multiple message chunks. We analyze how two parameters impact these metrics: 1) the size of the detection window and 2) the number of message chunks. The paper proposes two algorithms to optimize these parameters. The simulation results show that the algorithms effectively reduce the detection risks. This work advances the understanding of covert communication under mobility and uncertainty in satellite-aided systems.</description>

      <title>Research on the Design of a Short Video Recommendation System Based on Multimodal Information and Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of short video platforms, recommendation systems have become key technologies for improving user experience and enhancing platform engagement. However, while short video recommendation systems leverage multimodal information (such as images, text, and audio) to improve recommendation effectiveness, they also face the severe challenge of user privacy leakage. This paper proposes a short video recommendation system based on multimodal information and differential privacy protection. First, deep learning models are used for feature extraction and fusion of multimodal data, effectively improving recommendation accuracy. Then, a differential privacy protection mechanism suitable for recommendation scenarios is designed to ensure user data privacy while maintaining system performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing mainstream approaches in terms of recommendation accuracy, multimodal fusion effectiveness, and privacy protection performance, providing important insights for the design of recommendation systems for short video platforms.</description>

      <title>Embedding Hidden Adversarial Capabilities in Pre-Trained Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new attack paradigm that embeds hidden adversarial capabilities directly into diffusion models via fine-tuning, without altering their observable behavior or requiring modifications during inference. Unlike prior approaches that target specific images or adjust the generation process to produce adversarial outputs, our method integrates adversarial functionality into the model itself. The resulting tampered model generates high-quality images indistinguishable from those of the original, yet these images cause misclassification in downstream classifiers at a high rate. The misclassification can be targeted to specific output classes. Users can employ this compromised model unaware of its embedded adversarial nature, as it functions identically to a standard diffusion model. We demonstrate the effectiveness and stealthiness of our approach, uncovering a covert attack vector that raises new security concerns. These findings expose a risk arising from the use of externally-supplied models and highlight the urgent need for robust model verification and defense mechanisms against hidden threats in generative models.

      <title>SafeMLRM: Demystifying Safety in Multi-modal Large Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of multi-modal large reasoning models (MLRMs) -- enhanced versions of multimodal language models (MLLMs) equipped with reasoning capabilities -- has revolutionized diverse applications. However, their safety implications remain underexplored. While prior work has exposed critical vulnerabilities in unimodal reasoning models, MLRMs introduce distinct risks from cross-modal reasoning pathways. This work presents the first systematic safety analysis of MLRMs through large-scale empirical studies comparing MLRMs with their base MLLMs. Our experiments reveal three critical findings: (1) The Reasoning Tax: Acquiring reasoning capabilities catastrophically degrades inherited safety alignment. MLRMs exhibit 37.44% higher jailbreaking success rates than base MLLMs under adversarial attacks. (2) Safety Blind Spots: While safety degradation is pervasive, certain scenarios (e.g., Illegal Activity) suffer 25 times higher attack rates -- far exceeding the average 3.4 times increase, revealing scenario-specific vulnerabilities with alarming cross-model and datasets consistency. (3) Emergent Self-Correction: Despite tight reasoning-answer safety coupling, MLRMs demonstrate nascent self-correction -- 16.9% of jailbroken reasoning steps are overridden by safe answers, hinting at intrinsic safeguards. These findings underscore the urgency of scenario-aware safety auditing and mechanisms to amplify MLRMs' self-correction potential. To catalyze research, we open-source OpenSafeMLRM, the first toolkit for MLRM safety evaluation, providing unified interface for mainstream models, datasets, and jailbreaking methods. Our work calls for immediate efforts to harden reasoning-augmented AI, ensuring its transformative potential aligns with ethical safeguards.</description>

      <title>Toward Spiking Neural Network Local Learning Modules Resistant to Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown the vulnerability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) under adversarial examples that are nearly indistinguishable from clean data in the context of frame-based and event-based information. The majority of these studies are constrained in generating adversarial examples using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), a gradient-based method which lacks biological plausibility. In contrast, local learning methods, which relax many of BPTT's constraints, remain under-explored in the context of adversarial attacks. To address this problem, we examine adversarial robustness in SNNs through the framework of four types of training algorithms. We provide an in-depth analysis of the ineffectiveness of gradient-based adversarial attacks to generate adversarial instances in this scenario. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid adversarial attack paradigm that leverages the transferability of adversarial instances. The proposed hybrid approach demonstrates superior performance, outperforming existing adversarial attack methods. Furthermore, the generalizability of the method is assessed under multi-step adversarial attacks, adversarial attacks in black-box FGSM scenarios, and within the non-spiking domain.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Effects of Load Altering Attacks on Load Frequency Control through Python and RTDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modern power grid increasingly depends on advanced information and communication technology (ICT) systems to enhance performance and reliability through real-time monitoring, intelligent control, and bidirectional communication. However, ICT integration also exposes the grid to cyber-threats. Load altering attacks (LAAs), which use botnets of high-wattage devices to manipulate load profiles, are a notable threat to grid stability. While previous research has examined LAAs, their specific impact on load frequency control (LFC), critical for maintaining nominal frequency during load fluctuations, still needs to be explored. Even minor frequency deviations can jeopardize grid operations. This study bridges the gap by analyzing LAA effects on LFC through simulations of static and dynamic scenarios using Python and RTDS. The results highlight LAA impacts on frequency stability and present an eigenvalue-based stability assessment for dynamic LAAs (DLAAs), identifying key parameters influencing grid resilience.</description>

      <title>Detecting Instruction Fine-tuning Attack on Language Models with Influence Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instruction fine-tuning attacks pose a significant threat to large language models (LLMs) by subtly embedding poisoned data in fine-tuning datasets, which can trigger harmful or unintended responses across a range of tasks. This undermines model alignment and poses security risks in real-world deployment. In this work, we present a simple and effective approach to detect and mitigate such attacks using influence functions, a classical statistical tool adapted for machine learning interpretation. Traditionally, the high computational costs of influence functions have limited their application to large models and datasets. The recent Eigenvalue-Corrected Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (EK-FAC) approximation method enables efficient influence score computation, making it feasible for large-scale analysis.
  We are the first to apply influence functions for detecting language model instruction fine-tuning attacks on large-scale datasets, as both the instruction fine-tuning attack on language models and the influence calculation approximation technique are relatively new. Our large-scale empirical evaluation of influence functions on 50,000 fine-tuning examples and 32 tasks reveals a strong association between influence scores and sentiment. Building on this, we introduce a novel sentiment transformation combined with influence functions to detect and remove critical poisons -- poisoned data points that skew model predictions. Removing these poisons (only 1% of total data) recovers model performance to near-clean levels, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

      <title>Asymptotic stabilization under homomorphic encryption: A re-encryption free method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose methods to encrypted a pre-given dynamic controller with homomorphic encryption, without re-encrypting the control inputs. We first present a preliminary result showing that the coefficients in a pre-given dynamic controller can be scaled up into integers by the zooming-in factor in dynamic quantization, without utilizing re-encryption. However, a sufficiently small zooming-in factor may not always exist because it requires that the convergence speed of the pre-given closed-loop system should be sufficiently fast. Then, as the main result, we design a new controller approximating the pre-given dynamic controller, in which the zooming-in factor is decoupled from the convergence rate of the pre-given closed-loop system. Therefore, there always exist a (sufficiently small) zooming-in factor of dynamic quantization scaling up all the controller's coefficients to integers, and a finite modulus preventing overflow in cryptosystems. The process is asymptotically stable and the quantizer is not saturated.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of Reinforcement Learning over Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate encrypted control policy synthesis over the cloud. While encrypted control implementations have been studied previously, we focus on the less explored paradigm of privacy-preserving control synthesis, which can involve heavier computations ideal for cloud outsourcing. We classify control policy synthesis into model-based, simulator-driven, and data-driven approaches and examine their implementation over fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) for privacy enhancements. A key challenge arises from comparison operations (min or max) in standard reinforcement learning algorithms, which are difficult to execute over encrypted data. This observation motivates our focus on Relative-Entropy-regularized reinforcement learning (RL) problems, which simplifies encrypted evaluation of synthesis algorithms due to their comparison-free structures. We demonstrate how linearly solvable value iteration, path integral control, and Z-learning can be readily implemented over FHE. We conduct a case study of our approach through numerical simulations of encrypted Z-learning in a grid world environment using the CKKS encryption scheme, showing convergence with acceptable approximation error. Our work suggests the potential for secure and efficient cloud-based reinforcement learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-shot jailbreaking (MSJ) is an adversarial technique that exploits the long context windows of modern LLMs to circumvent model safety training by including in the prompt many examples of a ``fake'' assistant responding inappropriately before the final request. With enough examples, the model's in-context learning abilities override its safety training, and it responds as if it were the ``fake'' assistant. In this work, we probe the effectiveness of different fine tuning and input sanitization approaches on mitigating MSJ attacks, alone and in combination. We find incremental mitigation effectiveness for each, and we show that the combined techniques significantly reduce the effectiveness of MSJ attacks, while retaining model performance in benign in-context learning and conversational tasks. We suggest that our approach could meaningfully ameliorate this vulnerability if incorporated into model safety post-training.</description>

      <title>SafeSpeech: Robust and Universal Voice Protection Against Malicious Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech synthesis technology has brought great convenience, while the widespread usage of realistic deepfake audio has triggered hazards. Malicious adversaries may unauthorizedly collect victims' speeches and clone a similar voice for illegal exploitation (\textit{e.g.}, telecom fraud). However, the existing defense methods cannot effectively prevent deepfake exploitation and are vulnerable to robust training techniques. Therefore, a more effective and robust data protection method is urgently needed. In response, we propose a defensive framework, \textit{\textbf{SafeSpeech}}, which protects the users' audio before uploading by embedding imperceptible perturbations on original speeches to prevent high-quality synthetic speech. In SafeSpeech, we devise a robust and universal proactive protection technique, \textbf{S}peech \textbf{PE}rturbative \textbf{C}oncealment (\textbf{SPEC}), that leverages a surrogate model to generate universally applicable perturbation for generative synthetic models. Moreover, we optimize the human perception of embedded perturbation in terms of time and frequency domains. To evaluate our method comprehensively, we conduct extensive experiments across advanced models and datasets, both subjectively and objectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that SafeSpeech achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) voice protection effectiveness and transferability and is highly robust against advanced adaptive adversaries. Moreover, SafeSpeech has real-time capability in real-world tests. The source code is available at \href{https://github.com/wxzyd123/SafeSpeech}{https://github.com/wxzyd123/SafeSpeech}.</description>

      <title>RealHarm: A Collection of Real-World Language Model Application Failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language model deployments in consumer-facing applications introduce numerous risks. While existing research on harms and hazards of such applications follows top-down approaches derived from regulatory frameworks and theoretical analyses, empirical evidence of real-world failure modes remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce RealHarm, a dataset of annotated problematic interactions with AI agents built from a systematic review of publicly reported incidents. Analyzing harms, causes, and hazards specifically from the deployer's perspective, we find that reputational damage constitutes the predominant organizational harm, while misinformation emerges as the most common hazard category. We empirically evaluate state-of-the-art guardrails and content moderation systems to probe whether such systems would have prevented the incidents, revealing a significant gap in the protection of AI applications.</description>

Abstract: With wearable devices such as smartwatches on the rise in the consumer electronics market, securing these wearables is vital. However, the current security mechanisms only focus on validating the user not the device itself. Indeed, wearables can be (1) unauthorized wearable devices with correct credentials accessing valuable systems and networks, (2) passive insiders or outsider wearable devices, or (3) information-leaking wearables devices. Fingerprinting via machine learning can provide necessary cyber threat intelligence to address all these cyber attacks. In this work, we introduce a wearable fingerprinting technique focusing on Bluetooth classic protocol, which is a common protocol used by the wearables and other IoT devices. Specifically, we propose a non-intrusive wearable device identification framework which utilizes 20 different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in the training phase of the classification process and selects the best performing algorithm for the testing phase. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of proposed wearable fingerprinting technique on real wearable devices, including various off-the-shelf smartwatches. Our evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed technique to provide reliable cyber threat intelligence. Specifically, our detailed accuracy results show on average 98.5%, 98.3% precision and recall for identifying wearables using the Bluetooth classic protocol.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Smart Contract Security Analysis with Execution Property Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smart contract vulnerabilities have led to significant financial losses, with their increasing complexity rendering outright prevention of hacks increasingly challenging. This trend highlights the crucial need for advanced forensic analysis and real-time intrusion detection, where dynamic analysis plays a key role in dissecting smart contract executions. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a unified and generic representation of smart contract executions, complemented by an efficient methodology that enables the modeling and identification of a broad spectrum of emerging attacks.
  We introduce Clue, a dynamic analysis framework specifically designed for the Ethereum virtual machine. Central to Clue is its ability to capture critical runtime information during contract executions, employing a novel graph-based representation, the Execution Property Graph. A key feature of Clue is its innovative graph traversal technique, which is adept at detecting complex attacks, including (read-only) reentrancy and price manipulation. Evaluation results reveal Clue's superior performance with high true positive rates and low false positive rates, outperforming state-of-the-art tools. Furthermore, Clue's efficiency positions it as a valuable tool for both forensic analysis and real-time intrusion detection.</description>

      <title>PCDP-SGD: Improving the Convergence of Differentially Private SGD via Projection in Advance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paradigm of Differentially Private SGD~(DP-SGD) can provide a theoretical guarantee for training data in both centralized and federated settings. However, the utility degradation caused by DP-SGD limits its wide application in high-stakes tasks, such as medical image diagnosis. In addition to the necessary perturbation, the convergence issue is attributed to the information loss on the gradient clipping. In this work, we propose a general framework PCDP-SGD, which aims to compress redundant gradient norms and preserve more crucial top gradient components via projection operation before gradient clipping. Additionally, we extend PCDP-SGD as a fundamental component in differential privacy federated learning~(DPFL) for mitigating the data heterogeneous challenge and achieving efficient communication. We prove that pre-projection enhances the convergence of DP-SGD by reducing the dependence of clipping error and bias to a fraction of the top gradient eigenspace, and in theory, limits cross-client variance to improve the convergence under heterogeneous federation. Experimental results demonstrate that PCDP-SGD achieves higher accuracy compared with state-of-the-art DP-SGD variants in computer vision tasks. Moreover, PCDP-SGD outperforms current federated learning frameworks when DP is guaranteed on local training sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09026v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptor signatures can be viewed as a generalized form of standard digital signature schemes by linking message authentication to the disclosure of a secret value. As a recent cryptographic primitive, they have become essential for blockchain applications, including cryptocurrencies, by reducing on-chain costs, improving fungibility, and enabling off-chain payments in payment-channel networks, payment-channel hubs, and atomic swaps. However, existing adaptor signature constructions are vulnerable to quantum attacks due to Shor's algorithm. In this work, we introduce $\mathsf{SQIAsignHD}$, a new quantum-resistant adaptor signature scheme based on isogenies of supersingular elliptic curves, using SQIsignHD - as the underlying signature scheme - and exploiting the idea of the artificial orientation on the supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, SIDH, to define the underlying hard relation. We, furthermore, provide a formal security proof for our proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>SnatchML: Hijacking ML models without Training Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model hijacking can cause significant accountability and security risks since the owner of a hijacked model can be framed for having their model offer illegal or unethical services. Prior works consider model hijacking as a training time attack, whereby an adversary requires full access to the ML model training. In this paper, we consider a stronger threat model for an inference-time hijacking attack, where the adversary has no access to the training phase of the victim model. Our intuition is that ML models, which are typically over-parameterized, might have the capacity to (unintentionally) learn more than the intended task they are trained for. We propose SnatchML, a new training-free model hijacking attack, that leverages the extra capacity learnt by the victim model to infer different tasks that can be semantically related or unrelated to the original one. Our results on models deployed on AWS Sagemaker showed that SnatchML can deliver high accuracy on hijacking tasks. Interestingly, while all previous approaches are limited by the number of classes in the benign task, SnatchML can hijack models for tasks that contain more classes than the original. We explore different methods to mitigate this risk; We propose meta-unlearning, which is designed to help the model unlearn a potentially malicious task while training for the original task. We also provide insights on over-parametrization as a possible inherent factor that facilitates model hijacking, and accordingly, we propose a compression-based countermeasure to counteract this attack. We believe this work offers a previously overlooked perspective on model hijacking attacks, presenting a stronger threat model and higher applicability in real-world contexts.</description>

      <title>Beyond Statistical Estimation: Differentially Private Individual Computation via Shuffling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18145v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In data-driven applications, preserving user privacy while enabling valuable computations remains a critical challenge. Technologies like differential privacy have been pivotal in addressing these concerns. The shuffle model of DP requires no trusted curators and can achieve high utility by leveraging the privacy amplification effect yielded from shuffling. These benefits have led to significant interest in the shuffle model. However, the computation tasks in the shuffle model are limited to statistical estimation, making it inapplicable to real-world scenarios in which each user requires a personalized output. This paper introduces a novel paradigm termed Private Individual Computation (PIC), expanding the shuffle model to support a broader range of permutation-equivariant computations. PIC enables personalized outputs while preserving privacy, and enjoys privacy amplification through shuffling. We propose a concrete protocol that realizes PIC. By using one-time public keys, our protocol enables users to receive their outputs without compromising anonymity, which is essential for privacy amplification. Additionally, we present an optimal randomizer, the Minkowski Response, designed for the PIC model to enhance utility. We formally prove the security and privacy properties of the PIC protocol. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate PIC's capability in handling non-statistical computation tasks, and the efficacy of PIC and the Minkowski randomizer in achieving superior utility compared to existing solutions.</description>

      <title>Footprints of Data in a Classifier: Understanding the Privacy Risks and Solution Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across government and private industries brings both advancements and heightened privacy and security concerns. Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates the Right to Erasure, requiring data to be permanently removed from a system to prevent potential compromise. While existing research primarily focuses on erasing sensitive data attributes, several passive data compromise mechanisms remain underexplored and unaddressed. One such issue arises from the residual footprints of training data embedded within predictive models. Performance disparities between test and training data can inadvertently reveal which data points were part of the training set, posing a privacy risk. This study examines how two fundamental aspects of classifier systems - training data quality and classifier training methodology - contribute to privacy vulnerabilities. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that classifiers exhibit universal vulnerability under conditions of data imbalance and distributional shifts. Empirical findings reinforce our theoretical results, highlighting the significant role of training data quality in classifier susceptibility. Additionally, our study reveals that a classifier's operational mechanism and architectural design impact its vulnerability. We further investigate mitigation strategies through data obfuscation techniques and analyze their impact on both privacy and classification performance. To aid practitioners, we introduce a privacy-performance trade-off index, providing a structured approach to balancing privacy protection with model effectiveness. The findings offer valuable insights for selecting classifiers and curating training data in diverse real-world applications.</description>

      <title>MARTSIA: Safeguarding Data Confidentiality in Blockchain-Driven Process Execution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchain technology streamlines multi-party collaborations in decentralized settings, especially when trust is limited or difficult to establish. While public blockchains enhance transparency and reliability by replicating data across all network nodes, they also conflict with confidentiality. Here, we introduce Multi-Authority Approach to Transaction Systems for Interoperating Applications (MARTSIA) to address this challenge. MARTSIA provides fine-grained read-access control at the message-part level by combining user-defined policies with certifier-declared attributes. The approach guarantees that even though data is replicated across the network to maintain consistency, fault tolerance, and availability, its confidentiality is securely preserved through encryption. To this end, MARTSIA integrates blockchain technologies, Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption, and distributed hash-table file storages. This architecture effectively balances the transparency inherent in public blockchains with the privacy required for sensitive applications. We present the tool and its applicability in a business scenario.</description>

      <title>Cybench: A Framework for Evaluating Cybersecurity Capabilities and Risks of Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08926v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Language Model (LM) agents for cybersecurity that are capable of autonomously identifying vulnerabilities and executing exploits have potential to cause real-world impact. Policymakers, model providers, and researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks and evaluating agents on those tasks. We include 40 professional-level Capture the Flag (CTF) tasks from 4 distinct CTF competitions, chosen to be recent, meaningful, and spanning a wide range of difficulties. Each task includes its own description, starter files, and is initialized in an environment where an agent can execute commands and observe outputs. Since many tasks are beyond the capabilities of existing LM agents, we introduce subtasks for each task, which break down a task into intermediary steps for a more detailed evaluation. To evaluate agent capabilities, we construct a cybersecurity agent and evaluate 8 models: GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mixtral 8x22b Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B Chat, and Llama 3.1 405B Instruct. For the top performing models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet), we further investigate performance across 4 agent scaffolds (structed bash, action-only, pseudoterminal, and web search). Without subtask guidance, agents leveraging Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, and Claude 3 Opus successfully solved complete tasks that took human teams up to 11 minutes to solve. In comparison, the most difficult task took human teams 24 hours and 54 minutes to solve. All code and data are publicly available at https://cybench.github.io.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models for Template Detection from Security Event Logs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern IT systems and computer networks, real-time and offline event log analysis is a crucial part of cyber security monitoring. In particular, event log analysis techniques are essential for the timely detection of cyber attacks and for assisting security experts with the analysis of past security incidents. The detection of line patterns or templates from unstructured textual event logs has been identified as an important task of event log analysis since detected templates represent event types in the event log and prepare the logs for downstream online or offline security monitoring tasks. During the last two decades, a number of template mining algorithms have been proposed. However, many proposed algorithms rely on traditional data mining techniques, and the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) has received less attention so far. Also, most approaches that harness LLMs are supervised, and unsupervised LLM-based template mining remains an understudied area. The current paper addresses this research gap and investigates the application of LLMs for unsupervised detection of templates from unstructured security event logs.</description>

      <title>To Shuffle or not to Shuffle: Auditing DP-SGD with Shuffling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) algorithm allows the training of machine learning (ML) models with formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Since DP-SGD processes training data in batches, it employs Poisson sub-sampling to select each batch at every step. However, it has become common practice to replace sub-sampling with shuffling owing to better compatibility and computational overhead. At the same time, we do not know how to compute tight theoretical guarantees for shuffling; thus, DP guarantees of models privately trained with shuffling are often reported as though Poisson sub-sampling was used.
  This prompts the need to verify whether gaps exist between the theoretical DP guarantees reported by state-of-the-art models and their actual leakage. To do so, we introduce a novel DP auditing procedure to analyze DP-SGD with shuffling and show that DP models trained with this approach have considerably overestimated privacy guarantees (up to 4 times). In the process, we assess the impact on privacy leakage of several parameters, including batch size, privacy budget, and threat model. Finally, we study two common variations of the shuffling procedure that result in even further privacy leakage (up to 10 times). Overall, our work attests to the risk of using shuffling instead of Poisson sub-sampling vis-\`a-vis privacy leakage from DP-SGD.</description>

      <title>Conceptwm: A Diffusion Model Watermark for Concept Protection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The personalization techniques of diffusion models succeed in generating specific concepts but also pose threats to copyright protection and illegal use. Model Watermarking is an effective method to prevent the unauthorized use of subject-driven or style-driven image generation, safeguarding concept copyrights. However, under the goal of concept-oriented protection, current watermarking schemes typically add watermarks to all images rather than applying them in a refined manner targeted at specific concepts. Additionally, the personalization techniques of diffusion models can easily remove watermarks. Existing watermarking methods struggle to achieve fine-grained watermark embedding with a few images of specific concept and prevent removal of watermarks through personalized fine-tuning. Therefore, we introduce a novel concept-oriented watermarking framework that seamlessly embeds imperceptible watermarks into the concept of diffusion models. We introduce Fidelity-preserving Latent Watermarking (FLW) to generate latent watermarks based on image characteristics and the Adversarial Watermarking Modulation module to prevent "jailbreaking" via personalized finetuning. To enhance U-Net's efficiency in learning watermark patterns with limited samples, we propose Efficient Concept Watermark Finetuning, which alternates optimization of model parameters for both watermark embedding and concept learning. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify our framework. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Conceptwm-4EB3/.</description>

      <title>From Vulnerabilities to Remediation: A Systematic Literature Review of LLMs in Code Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating various programming tasks, including security-related ones, such as detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Despite their promising capabilities, when required to produce or modify pre-existing code, LLMs could introduce vulnerabilities unbeknown to the programmer. When analyzing code, they could miss clear vulnerabilities or signal nonexistent ones. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we aim to investigate both the security benefits and potential drawbacks of using LLMs for a variety of code-related tasks. In particular, first we focus on the types of vulnerabilities that could be introduced by LLMs, when used for producing code. Second, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to detect and fix vulnerabilities, in any given code, and how the prompting strategy of choice impacts their performance in these two tasks. Last, we provide an in-depth analysis on how data poisoning attacks on LLMs can impact performance in the aforementioned tasks.</description>

      <title>PromptShield: Deployable Detection for Prompt Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Application designers have moved to integrate large language models (LLMs) into their products. However, many LLM-integrated applications are vulnerable to prompt injections. While attempts have been made to address this problem by building prompt injection detectors, many are not yet suitable for practical deployment. To support research in this area, we introduce PromptShield, a benchmark for training and evaluating deployable prompt injection detectors. Our benchmark is carefully curated and includes both conversational and application-structured data. In addition, we use insights from our curation process to fine-tune a new prompt injection detector that achieves significantly higher performance in the low false positive rate (FPR) evaluation regime compared to prior schemes. Our work suggests that careful curation of training data and larger models can contribute to strong detector performance.</description>

      <title>AgentBreeder: Mitigating the AI Safety Impact of Multi-Agent Scaffolds via Self-Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaffolding Large Language Models (LLMs) into multi-agent systems often improves performance on complex tasks, but the safety impact of such scaffolds has not been thoroughly explored. We introduce AgentBreeder, a framework for multi-objective self-improving evolutionary search over scaffolds. We evaluate discovered scaffolds on widely recognized reasoning, mathematics, and safety benchmarks and compare them with popular baselines. In 'blue' mode, we see a 79.4% average uplift in safety benchmark performance while maintaining or improving capability scores. In 'red' mode, we find adversarially weak scaffolds emerging concurrently with capability optimization. Our work demonstrates the risks of multi-agent scaffolding and provides a framework for mitigating them. Code is available at https://github.com/J-Rosser-UK/AgentBreeder.</description>

      <title>Model Tampering Attacks Enable More Rigorous Evaluations of LLM Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are increasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance frameworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs that elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers from two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot evaluate realistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's worst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for eliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering attacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit state-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a suite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to benchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model resilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional robustness subspace; (2) the attack success rate of model tampering attacks can empirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of held-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can easily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together these results highlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that model tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than input-space attacks alone.</description>

      <title>CriteoPrivateAds: A Real-World Bidding Dataset to Design Private Advertising Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past years, many proposals have emerged in order to address online advertising use-cases without access to third-party cookies. All these proposals leverage some privacy-enhancing technologies such as aggregation or differential privacy. Yet, no public and rich-enough ground truth is currently available to assess the relevancy of aforementioned private advertising frameworks. We are releasing the largest, in terms of number of features, bidding dataset specifically built in alignment with the design of major browser vendors proposals such as Chrome Privacy Sandbox. This dataset, coined CriteoPrivateAds, stands for an anonymised version of Criteo production logs and provides sufficient data to learn bidding models commonly used in online advertising under many privacy constraints (delayed reports, display and user-level differential privacy, user signal quantisation or aggregated reports). We ensured that this dataset, while being anonymised, is able to provide offline results close to production performance of adtech companies including Criteo - making it a relevant ground truth to design private advertising systems. The dataset is available in Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/datasets/criteo/CriteoPrivateAd.</description>

      <title>The Beginner's Textbook for Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05136v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a cryptographic scheme that enables computations to be performed directly on encrypted data, as if the data were in plaintext. After all computations are performed on the encrypted data, it can be decrypted to reveal the result. The decrypted value matches the result that would have been obtained if the same computations were applied to the plaintext data.
  FHE supports basic operations such as addition and multiplication on encrypted numbers. Using these fundamental operations, more complex computations can be constructed, including subtraction, division, logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, XOR, NAND, MUX), and even advanced mathematical functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, and trigonometric functions (e.g., sin, cos). These functions can be implemented either as exact formulas or as approximations, depending on the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy.
  Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables privacy-preserving machine learning by allowing a server to process the client's data in its encrypted form through an ML model. With FHE, the server learns neither the plaintext version of the input features nor the inference results. Only the client, using their secret key, can decrypt and access the results at the end of the service protocol.FHE can also be applied to confidential blockchain services, ensuring that sensitive data in smart contracts remains encrypted and confidential while maintaining the transparency and integrity of the execution process. Other applications of FHE include secure outsourcing of data analytics, encrypted database queries, privacy-preserving searches, efficient multi-party computation for digital signatures, and more.
  This article is designed to help the reader understand how FHE works from the mathematical level.</description>

      <title>VeriLeaky: Navigating IP Protection vs Utility in Fine-Tuning for LLM-Driven Verilog Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for coding, yet fine-tuning (FT) with curated data is essential for niche languages like Verilog. Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference. This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection?
  For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</description>

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) depend on untrusted software components to automate dangerous or critical missions, making them a desirable target for attacks. Some work has been done to prevent an attacker who has either compromised a ground control station or parts of a UAV's software from sabotaging the vehicle, but not both. We present an architecture running a UAV software stack with runtime monitoring and seL4-based software isolation that prevents attackers from both exploiting software bugs and stealthy attacks. Our architecture retrofits legacy UAVs and secures the popular MAVLink protocol, making wide adoption possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ever-increasing security vulnerabilities in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems require improved threat detection approaches. This paper presents a compact and efficient approach to detect botnet attacks by employing an integrated approach that consists of traffic pattern analysis, temporal support learning, and focused feature extraction. The proposed attention-based model benefits from a hybrid CNN-BiLSTM architecture and achieves 99% classification accuracy in detecting botnet attacks utilizing the N-BaIoT dataset, while maintaining high precision and recall across various scenarios. The proposed model's performance is further validated by key parameters, such as Mathews Correlation Coefficient and Cohen's kappa Correlation Coefficient. The close-to-ideal results for these parameters demonstrate the proposed model's ability to detect botnet attacks accurately and efficiently in practical settings and on unseen data. The proposed model proved to be a powerful defense mechanism for IoT networks to face emerging security challenges.</description>

Abstract: The adoption of modern encryption protocols such as TLS 1.3 has significantly challenged traditional network traffic classification (NTC) methods. As a consequence, researchers are increasingly turning to machine learning (ML) approaches to overcome these obstacles. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze ML-based NTC studies, developing a taxonomy of their design choices, benchmarking suites, and prevalent assumptions impacting classifier performance. Through this systematization, we demonstrate widespread reliance on outdated datasets, oversights in design choices, and the consequences of unsubstantiated assumptions. Our evaluation reveals that the majority of proposed encrypted traffic classifiers have mistakenly utilized unencrypted traffic due to the use of legacy datasets. Furthermore, by conducting 348 feature occlusion experiments on state-of-the-art classifiers, we show how oversights in NTC design choices lead to overfitting, and validate or refute prevailing assumptions with empirical evidence. By highlighting lessons learned, we offer strategic insights, identify emerging research directions, and recommend best practices to support the development of real-world applicable NTC methodologies.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Being Discrete: Measuring the Impact of Discretization in End-to-End Differentially Private Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentially Private (DP) generative marginal models are often used in the wild to release synthetic tabular datasets in lieu of sensitive data while providing formal privacy guarantees. These models approximate low-dimensional marginals or query workloads; crucially, they require the training data to be pre-discretized, i.e., continuous values need to first be partitioned into bins. However, as the range of values (or their domain) is often inferred directly from the training data, with the number of bins and bin edges typically defined arbitrarily, this approach can ultimately break end-to-end DP guarantees and may not always yield optimal utility.
  In this paper, we present an extensive measurement study of four discretization strategies in the context of DP marginal generative models. More precisely, we design DP versions of three discretizers (uniform, quantile, and k-means) and reimplement the PrivTree algorithm. We find that optimizing both the choice of discretizer and bin count can improve utility, on average, by almost 30% across six DP marginal models, compared to the default strategy and number of bins, with PrivTree being the best-performing discretizer in the majority of cases. We demonstrate that, while DP generative models with non-private discretization remain vulnerable to membership inference attacks, applying DP during discretization effectively mitigates this risk. Finally, we propose an optimized approach for automatically selecting the optimal number of bins, achieving high utility while reducing both privacy budget consumption and computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Context Switching for Secure Multi-programming of Near-Term Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-programming quantum computers improve device utilization and throughput. However, crosstalk from concurrent two-qubit CNOT gates poses security risks, compromising the fidelity and output of co-running victim programs. We design Zero Knowledge Tampering Attacks (ZKTAs), using which attackers can exploit crosstalk without knowledge of the hardware error profile. ZKTAs can alter victim program outputs in 40% of cases on commercial systems.
  We identify that ZKTAs succeed because the attacker's program consistently runs with the same victim program in a fixed context. To mitigate this, we propose QONTEXTS: a context-switching technique that defends against ZKTAs by running programs across multiple contexts, each handling only a subset of trials. QONTEXTS uses multi-programming with frequent context switching while identifying a unique set of programs for each context. This helps limit only a fraction of execution to ZKTAs. We enhance QONTEXTS with attack detection capabilities that compare the distributions from different contexts against each other to identify noisy contexts executed with ZKTAs. Our evaluations on real IBMQ systems show that QONTEXTS increases program resilience by three orders of magnitude and fidelity by 1.33$\times$ on average. Moreover, QONTEXTS improves throughput by 2$\times$, advancing security in multi-programmed environments.</description>

      <title>Secure Text Mail Encryption with Generative Adversarial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an encryption model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Encryption of RTF-8 data is realized by dynamically generating decimal numbers that lead to the encryption and decryption of alphabetic strings in integer representation by simple addition rules, the modulus of the dimension of the considered alphabet. The binary numbers for the private dynamic keys correspond to the binary numbers of public reference keys, as defined by a specific GAN configuration. For reversible encryption with a bijective mapping between dynamic and reference keys, as defined by the GAN encryptor, secure text encryption can be achieved by transferring a GAN-encrypted public key along with the encrypted text from a sender to a receiver. Using the technique described above, secure text mail transfer can be realized through component-wise encryption and decryption of text mail strings, with total key sizes of up to $10^{8}$ bits that define random decimal numbers generated by the GAN. From the present model, we assert that encrypted texts can be transmitted more efficiently and securely than from RSA encryption, as long as users of the specific configuration of the GAN encryption model are unaware of the GAN encryptor circuit and configuration, respectively.</description>

      <title>MUFFLER: Secure Tor Traffic Obfuscation with Dynamic Connection Shuffling and Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tor, a widely utilized privacy network, enables anonymous communication but is vulnerable to flow correlation attacks that deanonymize users by correlating traffic patterns from Tor's ingress and egress segments. Various defenses have been developed to mitigate these attacks; however, they have two critical limitations: (i) significant network overhead during obfuscation and (ii) a lack of dynamic obfuscation for egress segments, exposing traffic patterns to adversaries. In response, we introduce MUFFLER, a novel connection-level traffic obfuscation system designed to secure Tor egress traffic. It dynamically maps real connections to a distinct set of virtual connections between the final Tor nodes and targeted services, either public or hidden. This approach creates egress traffic patterns fundamentally different from those at ingress segments without adding intentional padding bytes or timing delays. The mapping of real and virtual connections is adjusted in real-time based on ongoing network conditions, thwarting adversaries' efforts to detect egress traffic patterns. Extensive evaluations show that MUFFLER mitigates powerful correlation attacks with a TPR of 1% at an FPR of 10^-2 while imposing only a 2.17% bandwidth overhead. Moreover, it achieves up to 27x lower latency overhead than existing solutions and seamlessly integrates with the current Tor architecture.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of Data Domain Extraction on Synthetic Data Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy attacks, particularly membership inference attacks (MIAs), are widely used to assess the privacy of generative models for tabular synthetic data, including those with Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. These attacks often exploit outliers, which are especially vulnerable due to their position at the boundaries of the data domain (e.g., at the minimum and maximum values). However, the role of data domain extraction in generative models and its impact on privacy attacks have been overlooked. In this paper, we examine three strategies for defining the data domain: assuming it is externally provided (ideally from public data), extracting it directly from the input data, and extracting it with DP mechanisms. While common in popular implementations and libraries, we show that the second approach breaks end-to-end DP guarantees and leaves models vulnerable. While using a provided domain (if representative) is preferable, extracting it with DP can also defend against popular MIAs, even at high privacy budgets.</description>

      <title>Secret Collusion among Generative AI Agents: Multi-Agent Deception via Steganography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07510v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent capability increases in large language models (LLMs) open up applications in which groups of communicating generative AI agents solve joint tasks. This poses privacy and security challenges concerning the unauthorised sharing of information, or other unwanted forms of agent coordination. Modern steganographic techniques could render such dynamics hard to detect. In this paper, we comprehensively formalise the problem of secret collusion in systems of generative AI agents by drawing on relevant concepts from both AI and security literature. We study incentives for the use of steganography, and propose a variety of mitigation measures. Our investigations result in a model evaluation framework that systematically tests capabilities required for various forms of secret collusion. We provide extensive empirical results across a range of contemporary LLMs. While the steganographic capabilities of current models remain limited, GPT-4 displays a capability jump suggesting the need for continuous monitoring of steganographic frontier model capabilities. We conclude by laying out a comprehensive research program to mitigate future risks of collusion between generative AI models.</description>

      <title>Let the Noise Speak: Harnessing Noise for a Unified Defense Against Adversarial and Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential adoption of machine learning (ML) is propelling the world into a future of distributed and intelligent automation and data-driven solutions. However, the proliferation of malicious data manipulation attacks against ML, namely adversarial and backdoor attacks, jeopardizes its reliability in safety-critical applications. The existing detection methods are attack-specific and built upon some strong assumptions, limiting them in diverse practical scenarios. Thus, motivated by the need for a more robust, unified, and attack-agnostic defense mechanism, we first investigate the shared traits of adversarial and backdoor attacks. Based on our observation, we propose NoiSec, a reconstruction-based intrusion detection system that brings a novel perspective by shifting focus from the reconstructed input to the reconstruction noise itself, which is the foundational root cause of such malicious data alterations. NoiSec disentangles the noise from the test input, extracts the underlying features from the noise, and leverages them to recognize systematic malicious manipulation. Our comprehensive evaluation of NoiSec demonstrates its high effectiveness across various datasets, including basic objects, natural scenes, traffic signs, medical images, spectrogram-based audio data, and wireless sensing against five state-of-the-art adversarial attacks and three backdoor attacks under challenging evaluation conditions. NoiSec demonstrates strong detection performance in both white-box and black-box adversarial attack scenarios, significantly outperforming the closest baseline models, particularly in an adaptive attack setting. We will provide the code for future baseline comparison. Our code and artifacts are publicly available at https://github.com/shahriar0651/NoiSec.</description>

      <title>Conceptualizing Trustworthiness and Trust in Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trustworthiness and trust are basic factors in common societies that allow us to interact and enjoy being in crowds without fear. As robotic devices start percolating into our daily lives they must behave as fully trustworthy objects, such that humans accept them just as we trust interacting with other people in our daily lives.
  How can we learn from system models and findings from social sciences and how can such learnings be translated into requirements for future technical solutions? We present a novel holistic approach on how to tackle trustworthiness systematically in the context of communications. We propose a first attempt to incorporate objective system properties and subjective beliefs to establish trustworthiness-based trust, in particular in the context of the future Tactile Internet connecting robotic devices. A particular focus is on the underlying communications technology.</description>

      <title>CleanVul: Automatic Function-Level Vulnerability Detection in Code Commits Using LLM Heuristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17274v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate identification of software vulnerabilities is crucial for system integrity. Vulnerability datasets, often derived from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or directly from GitHub, are essential for training machine learning models to detect these security flaws. However, these datasets frequently suffer from significant noise, typically 40% to 75%, due primarily to the automatic and indiscriminate labeling of all changes in vulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) as vulnerability-related. This misclassification occurs because not all changes in a commit aimed at fixing vulnerabilities pertain to security threats; many are routine updates like bug fixes or test improvements.
  This paper introduces the first methodology that uses the Large Language Model (LLM) with a heuristic enhancement to automatically identify vulnerability-fixing changes from VFCs, achieving an F1-score of 0.82. VulSifter was applied to a large-scale study, where we conducted a crawl of 127,063 repositories on GitHub, resulting in the acquisition of 5,352,105 commits. VulSifter involves utilizing an LLM to comprehend code semantics and contextual information, while applying heuristics to filter out unrelated changes. We then developed CleanVul, a high-quality dataset comprising 8,203 functions using our LLM heuristic enhancement approach, demonstrating Correctness (90.6%) comparable to established datasets such as SVEN and PrimeVul.
  To evaluate the CleanVul dataset, we conducted experiments focusing on fine-tuning various LLMs on CleanVul and other high-quality datasets. Evaluation results reveal that LLMs fine-tuned on CleanVul not only exhibit enhanced accuracy but also superior generalization capabilities compared to those trained on uncleaned datasets. Specifically, models trained on CleanVul and tested on PrimeVul achieve accuracy higher than those trained and tested exclusively on PrimeVul.</description>

      <title>Not All Edges are Equally Robust: Evaluating the Robustness of Ranking-Based Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Ranking Learning (FRL) is a state-of-the-art FL framework that stands out for its communication efficiency and resilience to poisoning attacks. It diverges from the traditional FL framework in two ways: 1) it leverages discrete rankings instead of gradient updates, significantly reducing communication costs and limiting the potential space for malicious updates, and 2) it uses majority voting on the server side to establish the global ranking, ensuring that individual updates have minimal influence since each client contributes only a single vote. These features enhance the system's scalability and position FRL as a promising paradigm for FL training.
  However, our analysis reveals that FRL is not inherently robust, as certain edges are particularly vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Through a theoretical investigation, we prove the existence of these vulnerable edges and establish a lower bound and an upper bound for identifying them in each layer. Based on this finding, we introduce a novel local model poisoning attack against FRL, namely the Vulnerable Edge Manipulation (VEM) attack. The VEM attack focuses on identifying and perturbing the most vulnerable edges in each layer and leveraging an optimization-based approach to maximize the attack's impact. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our attack achieves an overall 53.23% attack impact and is 3.7x more impactful than existing methods. Our findings highlight significant vulnerabilities in ranking-based FL systems and underline the urgency for the development of new robust FL frameworks.</description>

      <title>VeriContaminated: Assessing LLM-Driven Verilog Coding for Data Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, achieving exceptional results on various established benchmarking frameworks. However, concerns about data contamination - where benchmark data inadvertently leaks into pre-training or fine-tuning datasets - raise questions about the validity of these evaluations. While this issue is known, limiting the industrial adoption of LLM-driven software engineering, hardware coding has received little to no attention regarding these risks. For the first time, we analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluation frameworks for Verilog code generation (VerilogEval and RTLLM), using established methods for contamination detection (CCD and Min-K% Prob). We cover SOTA commercial and open-source LLMs (CodeGen2.5, Minitron 4b, Mistral 7b, phi-4 mini, LLaMA-{1,2,3.1}, GPT-{2,3.5,4o}, Deepseek-Coder, and CodeQwen 1.5), in baseline and fine-tuned models (RTLCoder and Verigen). Our study confirms that data contamination is a critical concern. We explore mitigations and the resulting trade-offs for code quality vs fairness (i.e., reducing contamination toward unbiased benchmarking).</description>
