      <title>The free and parking quasi-symmetrizing actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define two actions of the infinite symmetric group on the set of words on positive integers, called the free and parking quasi-symmetrizing actions, whose invariants are respectively the elements of the Hopf algebras $\textbf{FQSym}^*$ and $\textbf{PQSym}^*$. We study in depth the parking quasi-symmetrizing action by generalizing it to actions with a parameter $r\in(\mathbb{N}\setminus \{0\} )\bigcup\{\infty\}$. We prove that the spaces of the invariants under these $r$-actions form an infinite chain of nested graded Hopf subalgebras of $\textbf{PQSym}^*$. We give some properties of these Hopf algebras including their Hilbert series, a basis, and formulas for their product and coproduct. Finally we look more closely at the case $r=\infty$, obtaining enumerative results related to trees with maximal decreasing subtrees of given sizes.</description>

      <title>Weak and strong local irregularity of digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local Irregularity Conjecture states that every simple connected graph, except special cacti, can be decomposed into at most three locally irregular graphs, i.e., graphs in which adjacent vertices have different degrees. The connected minimization problem, finding the minimum number $k$ such that a graph can be decomposed into $k$ locally irregular graphs, is known to be NP-hard in general (Baudon, Bensmail, and Sopena, 2015). This naturally raises interest in the study of related problems. Among others, the concept of local irregularity was defined for digraphs in several different ways. In this paper we present the following new methods of defining a locally irregular digraph. The first one, weak local irregularity, is based on distinguishing adjacent vertices by indegree-outdegree pairs, and the second one, strong local irregularity, asks for different balanced degrees (i.e., difference between the outdegree and the indegree of a vertex) of adjacent vertices. For both of these irregularities, we define locally irregular decompositions and colorings of digraphs. We discuss relation of these concept to others, which were studied previously, and provide related conjectures on the minimum number of colors in weak and strong locally irregular colorings. We support these conjectures with new results, using the chromatic and structural properties of digraphs and their skeletons (Eulerian and symmetric digraphs, orientations of regular graphs, cacti, etc.).</description>

      <title>Intersecting Families of Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family $\mathcal{F}$ of spanning trees of the complete graph on $n$ vertices $K_n$ is \emph{$t$-intersecting} if any two members have a forest on $t$ edges in common. We prove an Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado result for $t$-intersecting families of spanning trees of $K_n$. In particular, we show there exists a constant $C &gt; 0$ such that for all $n \geq C (\log n) t$ the largest $t$-intersecting families are the families consisting of all trees that contain a fixed set of $t$ disjoint edges (as well as the stars on $n$ vertices for $t = 1$). The proof uses the spread approximation technique in conjunction with the Lopsided Lov\'asz Local Lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arboreal networks are a generalization of rooted trees, defined by keeping the tree-like structure, but dropping the requirement for a single root. Just as the class of cographs is precisely the class of undirected graphs that can be explained by a labelled rooted tree (T,t), we show that the class of distance-hereditary graphs is precisely the class of undirected graphs that can be explained by a labelled arboreal network (N,t).</description>

      <title>On Euler-Sombor Energy of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2024, Gutman et al. \cite{I.Gutman 3} defined a new molecular descriptor called as The Euler-Sombor $(ES)$ index of graph. By using this index we define the Euler-Sombor $(ES)$ matrix of a graph $G$ whoes $(i,j)^{th}$ entry is $\sqrt{{d_i}^2+{d_j}^2+d_i.d_j}$ if vertex $v_i$ is adjacent to vertex $v_j$, otherwise $0$. The $ES$ eigenvalues of the graph $G$ are the eigenvalues of its $ES$ matrix ,$ES(G)$. In this paper we discus $ES$ eigenvalues $\nu_i$ and energy of some classes of graphs.</description>

      <title>Constructions of Covering Sequences and Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $(n,R)$-covering sequence is a cyclic sequence whose consecutive $n$-tuples form a code of length $n$ and covering radius $R$. Using several construction methods improvements of the upper bounds on the length of such sequences for $n \leq 20$ and $1 \leq R \leq 3$, are obtained. The definition is generalized in two directions. An $(n,m,R)$-covering sequence code is a set of cyclic sequences of length $m$ whose consecutive $n$-tuples form a code of length~$n$ and covering radius $R$. The definition is also generalized to arrays in which the $m \times n$ sub-matrices form a covering code with covering radius $R$. We prove that asymptotically there are covering sequences that attain the sphere-covering bound up to a constant factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that finding extremal values and structures can be hard in weighted graphs. However, if the weights are random, this problem can become way easier. In this paper, we examine the minimal weight of a union of $k$ edge-disjoint trees in a complete graph with independent and identically distributed edge weights. The limit of this value (for a given distribution) is known for $k=1,2$. We extend these results and find the limit value for any $k&gt;2$. We also prove a related result regarding the structure of sparse random graphs.</description>

      <title>Abstract questionnaires and FS-decision digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A questionnaire is a sequence of multiple choice questions aiming to collect data on a population. We define an abstract questionnaire as an ordered pair $(N,{\cal M})$, where $N$ is a positive integer and ${\cal M}=(m_0,m_1,\ldots,m_{N-1})$ is an $N$-tuple of positive integers, with $m_i$, for $i \in \{0, 1, \ldots, N-1 \}$, as the number of possible answers to question $i$. An abstract questionnaire may be endowed with a skip-list (which tells us which questions to skip based on the sequence of answers to the earlier questions) and a flag-set (which tells us which sequences of answers are of special interest). An FS-decision tree is a decision tree of an abstract questionnaire that also incorporates the information contained in the skip-list and flag-set. The main objective of this paper is to represent the abstract questionnaire using a directed graph, which we call an FS-decision digraph, that contains the full information of an FS-decision tree, but is in general much more concise. We present an algorithm for constructing a fully reduced FS-decision digraph, and develop the theory that supports it. In addition, we show how to generate all possible orderings of the questions in an abstract questionnaire that respect a given precedence relation.</description>

      <title>Sharp results for the Erd\H{o}s, Pach, Pollack and Tuza problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Erd\H{o}s, Pach, Pollack and Tuza problem, asking for the maximum diameter of a graph with given order $n$, minimum degree $\delta$ and clique number at most $\omega$. We solve their problem asymptotically for the first hard case, $\omega \leq 3$, for the smallest values of $\delta$ by determining the smallest rational number $f(\delta)$ such that $diam(G) \leq f(\delta)n+O(1)$ for all graphs $G$ with order $n$, minimum degree $\delta$ and clique number $\omega \leq 3$. We also consider the weaker version where the clique number $\omega \leq 3$ is replaced by having chromatic number $\chi \leq 3$ and solve this version for small $\delta$, thereby yielding a counterexample to a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s et al. in a regime where this conjecture was still open. When restricting the conjecture to graphs with chromatic number $\chi \leq 3$, we show that this counterexample appears for the smallest possible $\delta$, namely $\delta=16.$</description>

      <title>Fixed-strength spherical designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spherical $t$-design is a finite subset $X$ of the unit sphere such that every polynomial of degree at most $t$ has the same average over $X$ as it does over the entire sphere. Determining the minimum possible size of spherical designs, especially in a fixed dimension as $t \to \infty$, has been an important research topic for several decades. This paper presents results on the complementary asymptotic regime, where $t$ is fixed and the dimension tends to infinity. We combine techniques from algebra, geometry, and probability to prove upper bounds on the size of designs, including an optimal bound for signed spherical designs. We also prove lower and upper bounds for approximate designs and establish an explicit connection between spherical and Gaussian designs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $n,m$ be positive integers and $c \in \mathbb{Z}_n$, where $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is the ring of integers modulo $n$. We almost complete providing the answer to the following problem, partially solved by N. Alon. Does any infinite sequence over $\mathbb{Z}_n$ contain $m$ same-length consecutive blocks $B_1, \ldots, B_m$ s.t. $\sum B_j + c \prod B_j = 0$ for every $j=1,\ldots,m$ (where $\sum B$ and $\prod B$ denote, respectively, the sum and the product of the elements in block $B$)? In the case of $c=0$, this problem is equivalent to the Van der Waerden theorem. After investigating $B \mapsto \sum B + c\prod B$, we provide other examples of generalizing the Van der Waerden theorem.</description>

      <title>The CEGM NLSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying quantum field theories through geometric principles has revealed deep connections between physics and mathematics, including the discovery by Cachazo, Early, Guevara and Mizera (CEGM) of a generalization of biadjoint scalar amplitudes. However, extending this to generalizations of other quantum field theories remains a central challenge. Recently it has been discovered that the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) emerges after a certain zero-preserving deformation from $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$. In this work, we find a much richer story of zero-preserving deformations in the CEGM context, yielding generalized NLSM amplitudes. We prove an explicit formula for the residual embedding of an $n$-point NLSM amplitude in a mixed $n+2$ point generalized NLSM amplitude, which provides a strong consistency check on our generalization. We show that the dimension of the space of pure kinematic deformations is $\gcd(k,n)-1$, we introduce a deformation-compatible modification of the Global Schwinger Parameterization, and we include a new proof, using methods from matroidal blade arrangements, of the linear independence for the set of planar kinematic invariants for CEGM amplitudes. Our framework is compatible with string theory through recent generalizations of the Koba-Nielsen string integral to any positive configuration space $X^+(k,n)$, where the usual Koba-Nielsen string integral corresponds to $X(2,n) = \mathcal{M}_{0,n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a Gr\"obner basis technique first introduced by Knutson, Miller and Yong to study the interplay between properties of a graph $G$ and algebraic properties of the toric ideal that it defines. We first recover a well-known height formula for the toric ideal of a graph $I_G$ and demonstrate an algebraic property that can detect when a graph deletion is bipartite. We also bound the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ using information about an initial ideal of $I_G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S=(d_1,d_2,d_3, \ldots )$ be an infinite sequence of rolls of independent fair dice. For an integer $k \geq 1$, let $L_k=L_k(S)$ be the smallest $i$ so that there are $k$ integers $j \leq i$ for which $\sum_{t=1}^j d_t$ is a prime. Therefore, $L_k$ is the random variable whose value is the number of dice rolls required until the accumulated sum equals a prime $k$ times. It is known that the expected value of $L_1$ is close to $2.43$. Here we show that for large $k$, the expected value of $L_k$ is $(1+o(1)) k\log_e k$, where the $o(1)$-term tends to zero as $k$ tends to infinity. We also include some computational results about the distribution of $L_k$ for $k \leq 100$.</description>

      <title>Perfect state transfer between real pure states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pure states correspond to one-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^n$ represented by unit vectors. In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect state transfer (PST) between real pure states with emphasis on the adjacency and Laplacian matrices as Hamiltonians of a graph representing a quantum spin network. We characterize PST between real pure states based on the spectral information of a graph and prove three fundamental results: (i) every periodic real pure state $\mathbf{x}$ admits perfect state transfer with another real pure state $\mathbf{y}$, (ii) every connected graph admits perfect state transfer between real pure states, and (iii) for any pair of real pure states $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ and for any time $\tau$, there exists a real symmetric matrix $M$ such that $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ admits perfect state transfer relative to $M$ at time $\tau$. We also determine all real pure states that admit PST in complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. This leads to a complete characterization of pair and plus state transfer in paths and complete bipartite graphs. We give constructions of graphs that admit PST between real pure states. Finally, using results on the spread of graphs, we prove that among all $n$-vertex simple unweighted graphs, the least minimum PST time between real pure states relative to the Laplacian is attained by any join graph, while the it is attained by the join of an empty graph and a complete graph of appropriate sizes relative to the adjacency matrix.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic intersection theory in Riemannian homogeneous spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M=G/H$ be a Riemannian homogeneous space, where $G$ is a compact Lie group with closed subgroup $H$. Classical intersection theory states that the de Rham cohomology ring of $M$ describes the signed count of intersection points of submanifolds $Y_1, \ldots, Y_s$ of $M$ in general position, when the codimensions add up to $\dim M$.
  We introduce the probabilistic intersection ring $\mathrm{H}_{\mathbb E}(M)$, whose multiplication describes the unsigned count of intersection points, when the $Y_i$ are randomly moved by independent uniformly random elements of $G$. The probabilistic intersection ring $\mathrm{H}_{\mathbb E}(M)$ has the structure of a graded commutative and associative real Banach algebra. It is defined as a quotient of the ring of Grassmann zonoids of a fixed cotangent space $V$ of $M$. The latter was introduced by the authors in [Adv. Math. 402, 2022]. There is a close connection to valuations of convex bodies: $\mathrm{H}_{\mathbb E}(M)$ can be interpreted as a subspace of the space of translation invariant, even, continuous valuations on $V$, whose multiplication coincides with Alesker's multiplication for smooth valuations.
  We describe the ring structure of the probabilistic intersection ring for spheres, real projective space and complex projective space, relying on Fu [J. Diff. Geo. 72(3), 2006] for the latter case. From this, we derive an interesting probabilistic intersection formula in complex projective space. Finally, we initiate the investigation of the probabilistic intersection ring for real Grassmannians, outlining the construction of a probabilistic version of Schubert Calculus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set $B$ is said to be \emph{sum-free} if there are no $x,y,z\in B$ with $x+y=z$. We show that there exists a constant $c&gt;0$ such that any set $A$ of $n$ integers contains a sum-free subset $A'$ of size $|A'|\geqslant n/3+c\log \log n$. This answers a longstanding problem in additive combinatorics, originally due to Erd\H{o}s.</description>

      <title>The $\mathcal{G}$-invariant and catenary data of a matroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:1510.00682v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The catenary data of a matroid $M$ of rank $r$ on $n$ elements is the vector $(\nu(M;a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_r))$, indexed by compositions $(a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_r)$, where $a_0 \geq 0$,\, $a_i &gt; 0$ for $i \geq 1$, and $a_0+ a_1 + \cdots + a_r = n$, with the coordinate $\nu (M;a_0,a_1, \ldots,a_r)$ equal to the number of maximal chains or flags $(X_0,X_1, \ldots,X_r)$ of flats or closed sets such that $X_i$ has rank $i$,\, $|X_0| = a_0$, and $|X_i - X_{i-1}| = a_i$. We show that the catenary data of $M$ contains the same information about $M$ as its $\mathcal{G}$-invariant, which was defined by H. Derksen [\emph{J.\ Algebr.\ Combin.}\ 30 (2009) 43--86]. The Tutte polynomial is a specialization of the $\mathcal{G}$-invariant. We show that many known results for the Tutte polynomial have analogs for the $\mathcal{G}$-invariant. In particular, we show that for many matroid constructions, the $\mathcal{G}$-invariant of the construction can be calculated from the $\mathcal{G}$-invariants of the constituents and that the $\mathcal{G}$-invariant of a matroid can be calculated from its size, the isomorphism class of the lattice of cyclic flats with lattice elements labeled by the rank and size of the underlying set. We also show that the number of flats and cyclic flats of a given rank and size can be derived from the $\mathcal{G}$-invariant, that the $\mathcal{G}$-invariant of $M$ is reconstructible from the deck of $\mathcal{G}$-invariants of restrictions of $M$ to its copoints, and that, apart from free extensions and coextensions, one can detect whether a matroid is a free product from its $\mathcal{G}$-invariant.</description>

Abstract: For each positive integer $t$ and each sufficiently large integer $r$, we show that the maximum number of elements of a simple, rank-$r$, $\mathbb C$-representable matroid with no $U_{2,t+3}$-minor is $t{r\choose 2}+r$. We derive this as a consequence of a much more general result concerning matroids on group-labeled graphs.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Representation via Axis-Aligned Point-Subspace Cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13555v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new representation of $k$-partite, $k$-uniform hypergraphs, that is, a hypergraph with a partition of vertices into $k$ parts such that each hyperedge contains exactly one vertex of each type; we call them $k$-hypergraphs for short. Given positive integers $\ell, d$, and $k$ with $\ell\leq d-1$ and $k={d\choose\ell}$, any finite set $P$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ represents a $k$-hypergraph $G_P$ as follows. Each point in $P$ is covered by $k$ many axis-aligned affine $\ell$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^d$, which we call $\ell$-subspaces for brevity and which form the vertex set of $G_P$. We interpret each point in $P$ as a hyperedge of $G_P$ that contains each of the covering $\ell$-subspaces as a vertex. The class of \emph{$(d,\ell)$-hypergraphs} is the class of $k$-hypergraphs that can be represented in this way. The resulting classes of hypergraphs are fairly rich: Every $k$-hypergraph is a $(k,k-1)$-hypergraph. On the other hand, $(d,\ell)$-hypergraphs form a proper subclass of the class of all $k$-hypergraphs for $\ell&lt;d-1$.
  In this paper we give a natural structural characterization of $(d,\ell)$-hypergraphs based on vertex cuts. This characterization leads to a poly\-nomial-time recognition algorithm that decides for a given $k$-hypergraph whether or not it is a $(d,\ell)$-hypergraph and that computes a representation if existing. We assume that the dimension $d$ is constant and that the partitioning of the vertex set is prescribed.</description>

      <title>The degree-restricted random process is far from uniform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degree-restricted random process is a natural algorithmic model for generating graphs with degree sequence D_n=(d_1, \ldots, d_n): starting with an empty n-vertex graph, it sequentially adds new random edges so that the degree of each vertex v_i remains at most d_i. Wormald conjectured in 1999 that, for d-regular degree sequences D_n, the final graph of this process is similar to a uniform random d-regular graph.
  In this paper we show that, for degree sequences D_n that are not nearly regular, the final graph of the degree-restricted random process differs substantially from a uniform random graph with degree sequence D_n. The combinatorial proof technique is our main conceptual contribution: we adapt the switching method to the degree-restricted process, demonstrating that this enumeration technique can also be used to analyze stochastic processes (rather than just uniform random models, as before).</description>

      <title>The probability that a random triple of dice is transitive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.16156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $n$-sided die is an $n$-tuple of positive integers. We say that a die $(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ beats a die $(b_1,\dots,b_n)$ if the number of pairs $(i,j)$ such that $a_i&gt;b_j$ is greater than the number of pairs $(i,j)$ such that $a_i&lt;b_j$. We show that for a natural model of random $n$-sided dice, if $A, B$ and $C$ are three random dice then the probability that $A$ beats $C$ given that $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$ is approximately 1/2. In other words, the information that $A$ beats $B$ and $B$ beats $C$ has almost no effect on the probability that $A$ beats $C$. This proves a statement that was conjectured by Conrey, Gabbard, Grant, Liu and Morrison for a different model.</description>

      <title>Sparse graph counting and Kelley-Meka bounds for binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12248v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Kelley and Meka (FOCS 2023) obtained a strong upper bound on the density of sets of integers without nontrivial three-term arithmetic progressions. In this work, we extend their result, establishing similar bounds for all linear patterns defined by binary systems of linear forms, where "binary" indicates that every linear form depends on exactly two variables. Prior to our work, no strong bounds were known for such systems even in the finite field model setting. A key ingredient in our proof is a graph counting lemma. The classical graph counting lemma, developed by Thomason (Random Graphs 1985) and Chung, Graham, and Wilson (Combinatorica 1989), is a fundamental tool in combinatorics. For a fixed graph $H$, it states that the number of copies of $H$ in a pseudorandom graph $G$ is similar to the number of copies of $H$ in a purely random graph with the same edge density as $G$. However, this lemma is only non-trivial when $G$ is a dense graph. In this work, we prove a graph counting lemma that is also effective when $G$ is sparse. Moreover, our lemma is well-suited for density increment arguments in additive number theory. As an immediate application, we obtain a strong bound for the Tur\'an problem in abelian Cayley sum graphs: let $\Gamma$ be a finite abelian group with odd order. If a Cayley sum graph on $\Gamma$ does not contain any $r$-clique as a subgraph, it must have at most $2^{-\Omega_r(\log^{1/16}|\Gamma|)}\cdot |\Gamma|^2$ edges. These results hinge on the technology developed by Kelley and Meka and the follow-up work by Kelley, Lovett, and Meka (STOC 2024).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we provide results that relate the Jacobi polynomials in genus $g$. We show that if a code is $t$-homogeneous that is, the codewords of the code for every given weight hold a $t$-design, then its Jacobi polynomial in genus $g$ with composition $T$ with $|T|\leq t$ can be obtained from its weight enumerator in genus~$g$ using the polarization operator. Using this fact, we investigate the invariant ring, which relates the homogeneous Jacobi polynomials of the binary codes in genus $g$. Specifically, the generators of the invariant ring appearing for $g=1$ are obtained. Moreover, we define the split Jacobi polynomials in genus~$g$ and obtain the MacWilliams type identity for it. A split generalization for higher genus cases of the relation between the Jacobi polynomials and weight enumerator of a $t$-homogeneous code also given.</description>

Abstract: We show that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists a sufficiently large $d_0\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for every $d\ge d_0$, whp the random $d$-regular graph $G(n,d)$ contains a $T$-factor for every tree $T$ on at most $(1-\epsilon)d/\ln d$ vertices. This is best possible since, for large enough integer $d$, whp $G(n,d)$ does not contain a $\frac{(1+\epsilon)d}{\ln d}$-star-factor. Our method gives a randomised algorithm which whp finds said $T$-factor and whose expected running time is $O(n^{1+o(1)})$, as well as an efficient deterministic counterpart.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Number of Bases in a Family of Vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proportion of $d$-element subsets of $\mathbb{F}_2^d$ that are bases is asymptotic to $\prod_{j=1}^{\infty}(1-2^{-j}) \approx 0.29$ as $d \to \infty$. It is natural to ask whether there exists a (large) subset $\mathcal{F}$ of $\mathbb{F}_2^d$ such that the proportion of $d$-element subsets of $\mathcal{F}$ that are bases is (asymptotically) greater than this number. As well as being a natural question in its own right, this would imply better lower bounds on the Tur\'an densities of certain hypercubes and `daisy' hypergraphs.
  We give a negative answer to the above question. More generally, we obtain an asymptotically sharp upper bound on the proportion of linearly independent $r$-element subsets of a (large) family of vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^d$, for $r \leq d$. This bound follows from an exact result concerning the probability of obtaining a linearly independent sequence when we randomly sample $r$ elements with replacement from our family of vectors: we show that this probability, for any family of vectors, is at most what it is when the family is the whole space $\mathbb{F}_2^d \setminus \{0\}$. Our results also go through when $\mathbb{F}_2$ is replaced by $\mathbb{F}_q$ for any prime power $q$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.07246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the stationary distribution of the simple random walk on the directed configuration model with bounded degrees. Provided that the minimum out-degree is at least $2$, with high probability (whp) there is a unique stationary distribution. We show that the minimum positive stationary value is whp $n^{-(1+C+o(1))}$ for some constant $C \ge 0$ determined by the degree distribution. In particular, $C$ is the competing combination of two factors: (1) the contribution of atypically "thin" in-neighbourhoods, controlled by subcritical branching processes; and (2) the contribution of atypically "light" trajectories, controlled by large deviation rate functions. Additionally, our proof implies that whp the hitting and the cover time are both $n^{1+C+o(1)}$. Our results complement those of Caputo and Quattropani who showed that if the minimum in-degree is at least 2, stationary values have logarithmic fluctuations around $n^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Linear quotients of connected ideals of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a higher analogue of the edge ideal of a graph, we study the $t$-connected ideal $\operatorname{J}_{t}$. This is the monomial ideal generated by the connected subsets of size $t$. For chordal graphs, we show that $\operatorname{J}_{t}$ has a linear resolution iff the tree is $t$-gap-free, and that this is equivalent to having linear quotients. We then show that if $G$ is any gap-free and $t$-claw-free graph, then $\operatorname{J}_{t}(G)$ has linear quotients and hence, linear resolution.</description>

      <title>The intersection cohomology Hodge module of toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Hodge filtration of the intersection cohomology Hodge module for toric varieties. More precisely, we study the cohomology sheaves of the graded de Rham complex of the intersection cohomology Hodge module and give a precise formula relating it with the stalks of the intersection cohomology as a constructible complex. The main idea is to use the Ishida complex in order to compute the higher direct images of the sheaf of reflexive differentials.</description>

      <title>Crystallizations of small covers over the $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ and the prism $\Delta^{n-1} \times I$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A crystallization of a PL manifold is an edge-colored graph that corresponds to a contracted triangulation of the manifold, facilitating the study of its topological and combinatorial properties. A small cover over a simple convex $n$-polytope $P^n$ is a closed $n$-manifold with a locally standard $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-action such that its orbit space is homeomorphic to $P^n$. In this article, we study the crystallizations of small covers over the $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ and the prism $\Delta^{n-1} \times I$. It is known that the small cover over the $n$-simplex $\Delta^n$ is $\mathbb{RP}^n$. For every $n\geq 2$, we prove that $\mathbb{RP}^n$ has a unique $2^n$-vertex crystallization. We also demonstrate that there are exactly $1 + 2^{n-1}$ D-J equivalence classes of small covers over the prism $\Delta^{n-1} \times I$, where $n\geq 3$. For each $\mathbb{Z}_2$-characteristic function of $\Delta^{n-1} \times I$, we construct a $2^{n-1}(n+1)$-vertex crystallization of the small cover $M^n(\lambda)$ with regular genus $1 + 2^{n-4}(n^2 - 2n - 3)$, where $n\geq 4$. In particular, we construct four orientable and four non-orientable $\mathbb{RP}^3$-bundles over $\mathbb{S}^1$ up to D-J equivalence with regular genus 6.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Regret for Unconstrained Submodular Maximization Stochastic Bandit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the online unconstrained submodular maximization problem (Online USM), in a setting with stochastic bandit feedback. In this framework, a decision-maker receives noisy rewards from a non monotone submodular function taking values in a known bounded interval. This paper proposes Double-Greedy - Explore-then-Commit (DG-ETC), adapting the Double-Greedy approach from the offline and online full-information settings. DG-ETC satisfies a $O(d\log(dT))$ problem-dependent upper bound for the $1/2$-approximate pseudo-regret, as well as a $O(dT^{2/3}\log(dT)^{1/3})$ problem-free one at the same time, outperforming existing approaches. In particular, we introduce a problem-dependent notion of hardness characterizing the transition between logarithmic and polynomial regime for the upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Parsings of Stationary Processes, Stopping Times and the Fundamental Pointwise Convergence Theorems of Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02615v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>
