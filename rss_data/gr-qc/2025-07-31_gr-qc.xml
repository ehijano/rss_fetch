      <title>Quantum Black Holes: Perihelion Advance, Quasi Normal Modes and Classical/ Topological Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on some properties of a quantum black hole obtained recently. The correction to the Newtonian gravitational potential is proportional to a coupling $\alpha$, which is the only free parameter of the theory. We constrain the coupling using the perihelion advance, we compute the quasi-normal modes for scalar (both massless and massive) and electromagnetic perturbations. We find that all modes computed here are complex numbers characterized by a positive real part and a negative imaginary part, while both parts increase with the mass of the test scalar field. Also thermodynamics properties are investigated from the classical and topological point of view. In this regard, the quantum black hole exhibits the same behavior as the classical Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time, that is, it presents stable/unstable branches in the Gibbs potential, one generating point and a topological charge $W=0$.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Undecidability in Physics on the Theory of Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity treats spacetime as dynamical and exhibits its breakdown at singularities. This failure is interpreted as evidence that quantum gravity is not a theory formulated within spacetime; instead, it must explain the very emergence of spacetime from deeper quantum degrees of freedom, thereby resolving singularities. Quantum gravity is therefore envisaged as an axiomatic structure, and algorithmic calculations acting on these axioms are expected to generate spacetime. However, G\"odel's incompleteness theorems, Tarski's undefinability theorem, and Chaitin's information-theoretic incompleteness establish intrinsic limits on any such algorithmic programme. Together, these results imply that a wholly algorithmic "Theory of Everything" is impossible: certain facets of reality will remain computationally undecidable and can be accessed only through non-algorithmic understanding. We formalize this by constructing a "Meta-Theory of Everything" grounded in non-algorithmic understanding, showing how it can account for undecidable phenomena and demonstrating that the breakdown of computational descriptions of nature does not entail a breakdown of science. Because any putative simulation of the universe would itself be algorithmic, this framework also implies that the universe cannot be a simulation.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Quantum tunneling from Schwarzschild black hole in non-commutative gauge theory of gravity"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle creation via quantum tunneling was recently calculated for the Schwarzschild non-commutative black hole solution in Ref. [Phys. Lett. B 848 (2024) 138335, e-Print: 2310.02445 [gr-qc]]. Nevertheless, it contains inconsistencies in the calculations that need to be properly corrected. In particular, the event horizon was incorrectly determined in that work, which affected all the subsequent calculations. Moreover, the same issue have been repeated elsewhere by the same authors in Refs. [1-4].</description>

      <title>Dynamical Love numbers of black holes: theory and gravitational waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In General Relativity, the static tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish identically. Whether this remains true for time-dependent tidal fields -- i.e., in the case of dynamical tidal Love numbers -- is an open question, complicated by subtle issues in the definition and computation of the tidal response at finite frequency. In this work, we compute the dynamical tidal perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole to quadratic order in the tidal frequency. By employing the Teukolsky formalism in advanced null coordinates, which are regular at the horizon, we obtain a particularly clean perturbative scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a response function based on the full solution of the perturbation equation which does not depend on any arbitrary constant. Our analysis recovers known results for the dissipative response at linear order and the logarithmic running at quadratic order, associated with scale dependence in the effective theory. In addition, we find a finite, nonvanishing conservative correction at second-order in frequency, thereby possibly demonstrating a genuine dynamical deformation of the black hole geometry. We then assess the impact of these dynamical tidal effects on the gravitational-wave phase, which enter at 8th post-Newtonian order, and express the correction in terms of generic $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, which have to be matched to the perturbative result. Despite their conceptual interest, we argue that such corrections are too small to be observable even with future-generation gravitational wave detectors. Moreover, the corresponding phase shifts are degenerate with unknown point-particle contributions entering at the same post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in Palatini gravity for a non-minimal geometry-matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the propagation of gravitational waves over a non-Riemannian spacetime, when a non-minimal coupling between the geometry and matter is considered in the form of contractions of the energy momentum tensor with the Ricci and co-Ricci curvature tensors. We focus our analysis on perturbations on a Minkowski background, elucidating how derivatives of the energy momentum tensor can sustain non-trivial torsion and non-metricity excitations, eventually resulting in additional source terms for the metric field. These can be reorganized in the form of D'Alembert operator acting on the energy momentum tensor and the equivalence principle can be reinforced at the linear level by a suitable choice of the parameters of the model. We show how tensor polarizations can exhibit a subluminal phase velocity in matter, evading the constraints found in General Relativity, and how this allows for the kinematic damping in specific configurations of the medium and of the geometry-matter coupling. These in turn define regions in the wavenumber space where propagation is forbidden, leading to the appearance of typical cut-off scale in the frequency spectrum.</description>

      <title>Spacetime inextensibility criteria by volume-distance-ratio asymptote and applications to naked singularities and FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inextensibility problem of the spacetime at a future boundary point. We detect the inextensibility of the spacetime by the volume-distance-ratio asymptote of the timelike diamond approaching the future boundary point. The fundamental idea is to compare the asymptote with the one in Minkowski spacetime. By this idea, we establish the inextensibility criteria for both $C^{0,1}$ and $C^0$ regularities. As applications, we prove that i) $C^{0,1}$-inextensibility of the interior solution of the spherically self-similar naked singularity in the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field constructed by Christodoulou. The key estimate is on the volume form of the interior solution of the naked singularity in a self-similar coordinate system. ii) $C^0$-inextensibility of the spatially flat FLRW spacetime with asymptotically linear scale factor $a(t) \sim t$. The key estimate is the volume comparison with the spatially hyperbolic FLRW spacetime with the scale factor $t$ which is the causal past of a point in the Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Multiple-scale analysis of modified gravitational-wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ multiple-scale analysis to systematically derive analytical approximations describing the cosmological propagation of gravitational waves beyond general relativity, in a framework with two interacting spin-2 fields with time-dependent couplings. Such techniques allow us to accurately track the evolution of a system with slowly evolving time-dependent couplings over a large number of oscillation periods. We focus on tensor modes propagating on sub-horizon scales in a universe dominated by dark energy and explicitly derive solutions for a general class of models. To illustrate the possible applications of our general scheme and further corroborate our analytical results, we calculate the evolution of tensor perturbations in some phenomenological toy models and compare them with numerical simulations. We show that, generically, the interactions of independent spin-2 fields lead to non-trivial modifications to the amplitude and phase of the detected waveform, which are different from those obtained in other modified gravity theories with a single graviton. This provides an avenue to test and constrain gravitational models with new fundamental physical fields.</description>

      <title>Doubly regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to curvature singularities, electrovacuum black holes in general relativity exhibit thermodynamic singularities. These so-called Davies' points occur at non-extremal values of charge and spin where the heat capacity diverges and may indicate a type of theoretical incompleteness. The thermodynamic regularity of several families of static, asymptotically-flat spacetimes with bounded curvature invariants is examined using a theory-agnostic framework, showing that while they may be regular in physical space they are generally not in phase space. The inclusion of angular momentum, via the Newman-Janis algorithm, makes the set of such "doubly regular" objects especially restrictive. It is argued that, if thermodynamic regularity is to be considered a desirable property for an astrophysical black hole, these considerations could be used to narrow down the viable pool of regular extensions to the Kerr-Newman metric.</description>

      <title>Constrained Dynamics on Eccentric Conic Orbits: Dirac-Bergmann and Hamilton-Jacobi Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a Lagrangian model describing a particle constrained to move along non-degenerate conic sections, parameterized by the orbital eccentricity \( e \). In the non-relativistic regime, we apply the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm to identify a set of four second-class constraints, compute the corresponding Dirac brackets, and isolate the true physical degrees of freedom. This procedure yields a unified Hamiltonian treatment of circular (\( e = 0 \)), elliptical (\( 0 &lt; e &lt; 1 \)), parabolic (\( e = 1 \)), and hyperbolic (\( e &gt; 1 \)) trajectories. We then extend the analysis to the relativistic case, where we observe a similar constraint structure and construct the associated Dirac brackets accordingly. Finally, using the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we identify a set of non-involutive constraints; by introducing generalized brackets, we restore integrability and derive the correct equations of motion. A comparative analysis of both formalisms highlights their complementary features and deepens our understanding of the dynamics governing particles restricted to conic geometries.</description>

      <title>Affine Quantization of the Interior Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Hamiltonian formulation of a spherically symmetric spacetime that corresponds to the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole. The resulting phase space involves two independent dynamical variables along with their conjugate momenta. We quantize the associated minisuperspace using the affine quantization method, which is particularly suited for systems with positive-definite configuration variables. We then explore whether the quantum effects encoded in this wave function can lead to the avoidance of classical singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We shall investigate the inflation for the D-brane model, motivated by the modified gravity $F(\phi,T)$. This gravity has been recently introduced in the literature. The feasibility of the D-brane inflation theory in the $F(\phi,T)$-gravity has been studied in conjunction with the most recent Planck data. We shall analyze the slow-roll inflation in the context of the $F(\phi)T$-gravity, via the D-brane model. Then, we shall calculate the inflation dynamics to obtain the scalar spectral index ``$n_s$'' and the tensor-to-scalar ratio ``$r$''. Besides, we investigate the dynamics of the reheating for this model. Our model accurately covers the left-hand side of the Planck data and the D-brane inflation.</description>

      <title>Constraining noncommutative spacetime with GW150914 and GW190814</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in noncommutative geometry and string theory have stimulated increasing research on noncommutative gravity. The detection of gravitational waves~(GW) opens a new window for testing this theory using observed data. In particular, the leading correction from noncommutative gravity to the GW of compact binary coalescences appears at the second post-Newtonian~(2PN) order. This correction is proportional to the dimensionless parameter $\Lambda\equiv|\theta^{0i}|/(l_Pt_P)$, where $\theta^{0i}$ denotes the antisymmetric tensor characterizing noncommutative spacetime, and $l_P, t_P$ represent the Plank length and time, respectively. Previous study have used the phase deviation from general relativity at the 2PN order, as measured in GW150914, to constrain noncommutative gravity, resulting in an upper bound of $\sqrt{\Lambda}&lt;3.5$. Another analysis, based on multiple events from the GWTC-1 catalog, has obtained consistent bounds. In this work, we construct the noncommutative gravity waveform in the Parameterized Post-Einsteinian framework. Based on the \texttt{IMRPhenomXHM} template, we incorporate both the dominant (2,2) mode and several higher-order modes, including (2,1), (3,3), (3,2), and (4,4). We first reanalyze the GW150914 with a Bayesian parameter estimation and derive a 95th percentile upper bound on noncommutative gravity, obtaining $\sqrt{\Lambda}&lt;0.68$. We then analyze GW190814 and obtain an even tighter 95th percentile upper bound of $\sqrt{\Lambda}&lt;0.46$. This represent the strongest constraint on noncommutative gravity derived from real GW observations to date.</description>

      <title>Black Holes as Non-Abelian Anyon Condensates: Nonthermal Spectrum and Implications for the Information Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model black holes as condensates of non-Abelian anyons forming a topologically ordered shell at the horizon. Combined with area quantization, the constrained fusion Hilbert space yields a discrete entropy spectrum consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. Assuming a quantized mass spectrum with nonuniform gaps, we derive a nonthermal radiation profile with a corrected Hawking temperature and entropy, including logarithmic and inverse-area corrections. This framework localizes quantum information to the horizon without invoking entanglement across it, offering a unitary evaporation mechanism governed by topological degrees of freedom. This offers a natural setting for resolving the information paradox without recourse to firewalls, remnants, or trans-horizon entanglement. We also show that the Hawking temperature arises from classical equipartition on the shell, explaining the thermal character of the spectrum at leading order. Overall, our results provide a microscopic, algebraic approach to the black hole information paradox and establish a bridge between quantum gravity and topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Squeezed gravitons from superradiant axion fields around rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose, in (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, a novel astrophysical source of squeezed graviton states, due to superradiant axionic clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) black holes (BH). The microscopic origin of these axions is diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and compactification axions in string theory, to \cm contorted geometries exemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan theory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a Kerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance and the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The specific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are massive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a Takagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it is shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity (GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to the CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the axionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through the average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be produced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the structure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a left-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the anomalous CS effects produce the entanglement.</description>

      <title>The Construction and Application of Penrose Diagrams, with a Focus on the Maximally Analytically Extended Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed, mathematically rigorous description of the construction procedure of Penrose diagrams for the example of the maximal analytic extension of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. To this end, we first outline the basic idea underlying Penrose diagrams, state the general requirements on the spacetimes to be visualized, and give a definition of Penrose diagrams. We then construct the Penrose diagram of the maximally analytically extended Schwarzschild spacetime and discuss the characteristics and properties corresponding to this particular Penrose diagram. As an application, we work out the differences between the spacetime and null variants of the canonical advanced Eddington-Finkelstein coordinate representations of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime by explicitly constructing and visually analyzing Penrose diagrams equipped with foliations of the level sets of the respective Eddington-Finkelstein time and null coordinates. Throughout the course of the paper, we provide brief accounts of the relevant parts of the seminal publications on the exterior Schwarzschild solution by Schwarzschild himself, Kruskal, Eddington, Finkelstein, and Penrose. This paper is primarily of pedagogical nature aimed at graduate students in physics and applied mathematics (with a background in general relativity and differential geometry), serving mainly as an introduction to Penrose diagrams and coordinate representations of the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime.</description>

      <title>Disentangling spinning and nonspinning binary black hole populations with spin sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The individual component spins of binary black holes (BBH) are difficult to resolve using gravitational-wave observations but carry key signatures of the processes shaping their formation and evolution. Recent analyses have found conflicting evidence for a sub-population of black holes with negligible spin, but the Default spin magnitude population model used in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analyses cannot formally accommodate an excess of systems with zero spin. In this work, we analyze several different simulated BBH populations to demonstrate that even in the face of this mismodeling, spinning and nonspinning populations can be reliably distinguished using the Default spin magnitude population model coupled with spin sorting. While typical analyses sort the binary components by their masses, sorting the components by their spin magnitudes instead offers a complementary view of the properties of individual systems consistent with equal mass and of population-level properties, given binary evolution processes like tidal-spin up that predict asymmetric spin magnitudes among the binary components. We conclude that current observations of the BBH population are inconsistent with a fully nonspinning population, but could be explained by a population with only one spinning black hole per binary or a population with up to 80% nonspinning sources.</description>

      <title>Teleparallel gravity from the principal bundle viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine whether the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (TEGR) can be formulated as a gauge theory in the language of connections on principal bundles. We argue in favor of using either the affine bundle with the Poincar\'e group or, equivalently, the orthonormal frame bundle with the Lorentz group as the structure group. Following the framework of Trautman--where gauge symmetries are determined using the absolute elements--we set to identify the absolute elements and gauge symmetries of TEGR. The problem of a non-dynamical teleparallel connection raises the question of whether it should be treated as an absolute element. If so, the gauge group of TEGR is potentially some undetermined subgroup of the diffeomorphism group. On the other hand, if the connection is allowed to be non-dynamical but the only absolute element is taken to be the canonical 1-form of the frame bundle, we recover the whole diffeomorphism group as the gauge group of TEGR.</description>

      <title>Simulating Binary Neutron Star Mergers with Finite-temperature Equations of State: The influences of the slope of the symmetry energy and artificial heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new set of numerical-relativity simulations of merging binary neutron stars, aiming to identify possible observable signatures of the slope of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}$. To achieve this goal, we employ a set of equations of state based on a parameterization of the covariant density functional theory of nuclear matter that allows controlled variations of $L_{\rm sym}$ and the skewness $Q_{\rm sat}$, holding the latter fixed. For a set of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of state at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with subsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related structural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with theoretical expectations. On the other hand, we show that gravitational waves are unlikely to distinguish the role of $L_{\rm sym}$. In contrast to this, we find that the ejecta composition is significantly altered in our simulations, which employ an M1 moment scheme, when $L_{\rm sym}$ is varied. Based on our extracted dynamical ejecta properties, we compute r-process yields and find that they are distinct for the different $L_{\rm sym}$, especially at lower mass numbers $A \lesssim 120$. This suggests that electromagnetic counterparts are more likely to exhibit signatures; however, a direct connection to $L_{\rm sym}$ remains a challenge, given the complex interplay between details of the ejecta properties and the kilonova signal.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Spherically Symmetric Causal Diamond in Minkowski Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute a gravitational on-shell action of a finite, spherically symmetric causal diamond in $(d+2)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, finding it is proportional to the area of the bifurcate horizon $A_{\mathcal{B}}$. We then identify the on-shell action with the saddle point of the Euclidean gravitational path integral, which is naturally interpreted as a partition function. This partition function is thermal with respect to a modular Hamiltonian $K$. Consequently, we determine, from the on-shell action using standard thermodynamic identities, both the mean and variance of the modular Hamiltonian, finding $\langle K \rangle = \langle (\Delta K)^2 \rangle = \frac{A_{\mathcal{B}}}{4 G_N}$. Finally, we show that modular fluctuations give rise to fluctuations in the geometry, and compute the associated phase shift of massless particles traversing the diamond under such fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Imprints of gravitational-wave polarizations on projected tidal tensor in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) distort galaxy shapes through the tidal effect, offering a novel avenue to probe the nature of gravity. In this paper, we investigate how extra GW polarizations beyond those predicted by general relativity imprint observable signatures on galaxy shapes. Since galaxy shapes are measured as two-dimensional images projected onto the celestial sphere, we present three-dimensional statistical quantities of the projected tidal tensor sourced by the tensor perturbation. We show that the presence of extra polarization modes modifies both the amplitude and angular dependence of the correlation functions. Furthermore, we identify a distinct observational channel for probing parity violation in helicity-two and helicity-one modes. In particular, we show that if they propagate at different speeds, galaxy surveys can disentangle the source of parity violation. Our findings establish a theoretical framework for using upcoming large-scale galaxy surveys to test modified gravity theories through the polarization content of GWs.</description>

      <title>SPT-3G D1: Axion Early Dark Energy with CMB experiments and DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the most up-to-date constraints on axion early dark energy (AEDE) from cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. In particular, we assess the impact of data from ground-based CMB experiments, the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) -- both with and without $Planck$ -- on constraints on AEDE. We also highlight the impact that BAO information from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has on these constraints. From CMB data alone, we do not find statistically significant evidence for the presence of AEDE, and we find only moderate reduction in the Hubble tension. From the latest SPT data alone, we find the maximal fractional contribution of AEDE to the cosmic energy budget is $f_{\rm EDE}\,&lt;\,0.12$ at $95\,$% confidence level (CL), and the Hubble tension between the SPT and SH0ES results is reduced to the $2.3\,\sigma$ level. When combining the latest SPT, ACT, and $Planck$ datasets, we find $f_{\rm EDE}\,&lt;\,0.091$ at $95\,$% CL and the Hubble tension at the $3.3\, \sigma$ level. In contrast, adding DESI data to the CMB datasets results in mild preference for AEDE and, in some cases, non-negligible reduction in the Hubble tension. From SPT+DESI, we find $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\,0.081^{+0.037}_{-0.052}$ at $68\,$% CL, and the Hubble tension reduces to $1.5\,\sigma$. From the combination of DESI with all three CMB experiments, we get $f_{\rm EDE}\,=\, 0.071^{+0.035}_{-0.038}$ at $68\,$% CL and a weak preference for AEDE over $\Lambda$CDM. This data combination, in turn, reduces the Hubble tension to $2.3\, \sigma$. We highlight that this shift in parameters when adding the DESI dataset is a manifestation of the discrepancy currently present between DESI and CMB experiments in the concordance model $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Kaluza-Klein monopole solutions with scalar hair provied by a massive complex scalar field multiplet that minimally couples to five-dimensional Einstein gravity. Writing the scalar field multiplet in terms of the Wigner D-matrices, we introduce the ansatz of the scalar multiplet compatible with the symmetries of the Gross-Perry-Sorkin monopole, on which the scalar hair grows. We give the ansatz for a multiplet with arbitrary number of components, whereas we show numerical solutions of the hairy Kaluza-Klein monopole specifically for the cases of scalar triplet and quadruplet. These generaize the preceding study on a doublet \cite{Brihaye:2023vox}. We find that the range of the mass and angular momentum of the hairy solutions are larger for higher multiplets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic complexity, as the bulk dual of quantum complexity, encodes the geometric structure of black hole interiors. Motivated by the complexity=anything proposal, we introduce the spectral representation for generating functions associated with codimension-one and codimension-zero holographic complexity measures. These generating functions exhibit a universal slope-ramp-plateau structure, analogous to the spectral form factor in chaotic quantum systems. In such systems, quantum complexity evolves universally, displaying long-time linear growth followed by saturation at late times. By employing the generating function formalism, we demonstrate that this universal behavior originates from random matrix universality in spectral statistics and from a particular pole structure of the matrix elements of the generating functions in the energy eigenbasis. Using the residue theorem, we prove that the existence of this pole structure is both a necessary and sufficient condition for the linear growth of complexity measures. Furthermore, we show that the late-time saturation plateau arises directly from the spectral level repulsion, a hallmark of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Accretion Regimes of Neutrino-Cooled Flows onto Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino-cooled accretion disks can form in the aftermath of neutron-star mergers as well as during the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars (collapsars) and the accretion-induced collapse of rapidly rotating white dwarfs. Due to Pauli blocking as electrons become degenerate at sufficiently high accretion rates $\dot{M}$, the resulting 'self-neutronization' of the dissociated accreting plasma makes these astrophysical systems promising sources of rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis (the r-process). We present a one-dimensional general-relativistic, viscous-hydrodynamic model of neutrino-cooled accretion disks around black holes. With collapsars, super-collapsars and very massive star collapse in mind, we chart the composition of the accretion flow and systematically explore different radiatively efficient and inefficient accretion regimes with increasing $\dot M$, across a vast parameter space of $\dot{M}\sim 10^{-6}-10^6 M_\odot \,\text{s}^{-1}$, black hole masses of $M_\bullet\sim 1 - 10^4 M_\odot$ and dimensionless spins of $\chi_\bullet \in [0,1)$, as well as $\alpha$-viscosity values of $\alpha\sim 10^{-3}-1$. We show that these accretion regimes are separated by characteristic thresholds $\dot{M}_{\rm char}$ that follow power laws $\dot M_{\rm char}\propto M_{\bullet}^\alpha \alpha^\beta$ and that can be understood based on analytic approximations we derive. We find that outflows from such disks are promising sites of r-process nucleosynthesis up to $M_\bullet \lesssim 3000 M_\odot$. These give rise to lanthanide-bearing 'red' super-kilonovae transients mostly for $M_\bullet \lesssim 200-500 M_\odot$ and lanthanide suppressed 'blue' super-kilonovae for larger $M_\bullet$. Proton-rich outflows can develop specifically for large black hole masses ($M_\bullet \gtrsim 100 M_\odot$) in certain accretion regimes, which may give rise to proton-rich isotopes via the $\nu$p-process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02953v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theory of dark matter superfluidity has emerged as a compelling framework, in which the dynamics are governed by a non-relativistic $P(X)$ superfluid Lagrangian that naturally leads to Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)-like behavior when coupled to baryons at galactic scales. Notably, at cosmological scales, this effective description reproduces the standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at the background level, suggesting that cold dark matter may undergo Bose--Einstein condensation at galactic scales. In this work, we extend the non-relativistic formulation by systematically incorporating relativistic corrections within the Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) spacetime. We further perform a linear perturbation analysis in this relativistic setting to investigate the evolution of matter density fluctuations. Our results clarify the viability of the superfluid dark matter scenario in explaining large-scale structure formation and identify the parameter regimes in which it remains consistent with current cosmological observations.</description>

Abstract: Bouncing cosmologies, while offering a compelling alternative to inflationary models, face challenges from the growth of vector perturbations during the contracting phase. While linear vector instabilities can be avoided with specific initial conditions or the absence of vector degrees of freedom, we demonstrate the significant role of secondary vector perturbations generated by nonlinear interactions with scalar fluctuations. Our analysis reveals that in a broad class of single-field matter-bounce scenarios, these secondary vector perturbations get unacceptably large amplitudes, provided the curvature fluctuations are consistent with cosmic microwave background observations. This finding underscores the crucial importance of scalar-induced vector perturbations in bouncing cosmology and highlights the need for further investigation into their potential impact on the viability of these models.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Powered Numerical Relativity Surrogate for Binary Black Hole Waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave approximants are essential for gravitational-wave astronomy, allowing the coverage binary black hole parameter space for inference or match filtering without costly numerical relativity (NR) simulations, but generally trading some accuracy for computational efficiency. To reduce this trade-off, NR surrogate models can be constructed using interpolation within NR waveform space. We present a 2-stage training approach for neural network-based NR surrogate models. Initially trained on approximant-generated waveforms and then fine-tuned with NR data, these dual-stage artificial neural surrogate (\texttt{DANSur}) models offer rapid and competitively accurate waveform generation, generating millions in under 20ms on a GPU while keeping mean mismatches with NR around $10^{-4}$. Implemented in the \textsc{bilby} framework, we show they can be used for parameter estimation tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several inequalities between the curvature invariants, which impose constraints on curvature singularities. Some of the inequalities hold for a family of spacetimes which include static, Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker, and Bianchi type I metrics, independently of whether they are solutions of some particular field equations. In contrast, others hold for solutions of Einstein's gravitational field equation and a family of energy-momentum tensors (featuring ideal fluids, scalar fields and nonlinear electromagnetic fields), independently of the specific form of the spacetime metric. We illustrate different behaviour of the basic curvature invariants with numerous examples and discuss the consequences and limitations of the proven results.</description>

      <title>Model Agnostic $F(R)$ Gravity Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we construct a formalism that can reveal the general characteristics of classes of viable $F(R)$ inflationary theories. The assumptions we make is that the slow-roll era occurs, and that the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$ of the $F(R)$ gravity is positive or zero, for both the inflationary and late-time quasi de Sitter eras, a necessary condition for the stability of the de Sitter spacetime. In addition, we require that the de Sitter scalaron mass is also a monotonically increasing function of the Ricci scalar, or it has an extremum. Also the $F(R)$ gravity function is required to depend on the two known fundamental scales in cosmology, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the mass scale $m_s^2=\frac{\kappa^2 \rho_m^{(0)}}{3}$, with $\rho_m^{(0)}$ denoting the energy density of the cold dark matter at the present epoch, that is $F(R)=F(R,\Lambda,m_s^2)$. Using these general assumptions we provide the general features of viable classes of $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theories which remarkably can also simultaneously describe successfully the dark energy era. This unique feature of a unified description of the dark energy and inflationary eras stems from the requirement of the monotonicity of the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$. These viable classes are either deformations of the $R^2$ model or $\alpha$-attractors type theories. The analysis of the viability of a general $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theory is reduced in evaluating the parameter $x=\frac{R F_{RRR}}{F_{RR}}$ and the first slow-roll index of the theory, either numerically or approximately. We also disentangle the power-law $F(R)$ gravities from power-law evolution.</description>

      <title>Schott term in the binding energy for compact binaries on circular orbits at fourth post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phasing for compact binary systems on circular orbits was obtained in arXiv:2304.11185 at fourth-and-a-half post-Newtonian (4.5PN) order thanks to two main ingredients: the 4PN conservative energy (associated to a nonradiative spacetime) in terms of the orbital frequency and the 4.5PN flux in terms of the waveform frequency (i.e., the half-frequency of the $(\ell,m)=(2,2)$ mode). When obtaining the phasing, a key physical postulate was made: the expression of the binding energy in terms of the waveform frequency was assumed to be identical to the expression of the conservative energy in terms of the orbital frequency. This postulate was necessary to ensure that the frequency evolution obtained through the flux-balance law (which involves the binding energy) was independent of the choice of spacetime foliation. In this work, I show that the binding energy entering the flux-balance law differs from the 4PN conservative energy by a 4PN pseudo-Schott term, associated with radiation-reaction effects due to gravitational tails. Unlike the usual Schott terms (at 2.5PN, 3.5PN and 4.5PN), the pseudo-Schott term is not a total derivative and is in fact hereditary, so it does not vanish for circular orbits. Remarkably, the binding energy thus obtained is in perfect agreement with the one obtained using the aforementioned physical postulate, which confirms that the 4.5PN phasing associated to the waveform frequency computed in arXiv:2304.11185 is indeed correct. This result is extended to the other Poincar\'e invariants, and `thermodynamic' relations between the binding energy and angular momentum are established. Finally, the chirp and phasing associated to the orbital frequency are presented at 4.5PN, including horizon-absorption effects.</description>

      <title>Joint inference for gravitational wave signals and glitches using a data-informed glitch model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave data are often contaminated by non-Gaussian noise transients, glitches, which can bias the inference of astrophysical signal parameters. Traditional approaches either subtract glitches in a pre-processing step, or a glitch model can be included from an agnostic wavelet basis (e.g. BayesWave). In this work, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to build a parameterised model of glitches. We train a normalising flow on known glitches from the Gravity Spy catalogue, constructing an informative prior on the glitch model. By incorporating this model into the Bayesian inference analysis with Bilby, we estimate glitch and signal parameters simultaneously. We demonstrate the performance of our method through bias reduction, glitch identification and Bayesian model selection on real glitches. Our results show that this approach effectively removes glitches from the data, significantly improving source parameter estimation and reducing bias.</description>

Abstract: We develop a classification of general Carrollian structures, permitting affine connections with both torsion and non-metricity. We compare with a recent classification of general Galilean structures in order to present a unified perspective on both. Moreover, we demonstrate how both sets of structures emerge from the most general possible Lorentzian structures in their respective limits, and we highlight the role of global hyperbolicity in constraining both structures. We then leverage this work in order to construct for the first time an ultra-relativistic geometric trinity of gravitational theories, and consider connections which are simultaneously compatible with Galilean and Carrollian structures. We close by outlining a number of open questions and future prospects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate several Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet models that are compatible with the GW170817 event, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the BICEP/Keck updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We consider two distinct classes of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories, which are equally successful for GW170817-compatible model building and we examine their viability against the Atacama Cosmology Telescope data and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. The two models are distinct since the first class relates directly the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function with the scalar potential and yields $c_T^2=1$ while in the second class, the non-minimal Gauss-Bonnet scalar coupling function and the scalar potential are freely but conveniently chosen and the class of models respects the constraint $\left| c_T^2 - 1 \right| &lt; 6 \times 10^{-15}$. We provide several examples of models belonging to both the two classes of GW170817-compatible Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories and we demonstrate that Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories provide a promising theoretical framework for inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe, known as the ``dark energy problem'', remains a central challenge in cosmology. While the cosmological constant is the standard explanation, alternative models such as quintessence, phantom fluids, and Chaplygin gas have been proposed. This work investigates the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model, which is characterized by a polytropic equation of state. We explore this model within the framework of an anisotropic fluid, by means of a metric that reduces to the standard form of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime at cosmological scales. To assess the model's viability, we derive analytical expressions for the scale factor, the Hubble parameter, and the deceleration parameter. Finally, the model is tested against observational data to constrain its parameters and evaluate its consistency.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tidal response of both static and rotating black holes in anti de-Sitter spacetime. We perform the neutral scalar field perturbation for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. On the other hand, charged scalar field are used for perturbing Reissner-Nordstrom and Kerr-Newman black holes. We find that the tidal Love number for all black holes are always nonvanishing due to the presence of cosmological constant. In contrast, tidal dissipation can vanish for certain conditions depending on the scalar field's frequency and the black hole's parameters.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, the background and perturbed cosmic dynamics have been investigated using an interacting dark-fluid model by assuming energy exchange between dark matter and dark energy through a diffusion mechanism. After we solve the background expansion history for the late-time Universe, the full set of linear perturbation equations is driven using the $1+3$-covariant approach. We take into account the recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI BAO DR2), cosmic chronometers (CC), and the compilations SNIa distance moduli namely: Pantheon plus + SH0ES (PPS), DESY5, Union3, together with the redshift space distortion (RSD) and growth rate $f$ from VIPERS and SDSS collaborations for statistical analysis of the work. We then seek to constrain the best-fit cosmological parameters: $H_0$ in km/s/Mpc, $\Omega_m$, $r_d$, $M$, $\sigma_8$, $S_8$ and the interaction term $Q_m$ through the MCMC simulations. As a result, a comparison of the $H_0$ and $S_8$ values are made predicted by $\Lambda$CDM and diffusive models with the recent cosmological surveys. To evaluate the viability of the dark-fluid model in describing cosmic dynamics, the numerical results of background cosmological parameters are presented and the results show that the dark-fluid behaves like the Chaplygin gas (CG) that drives cosmic acceleration when $Q_m$ is negative, while for positive $Q_m$, it exhibits characteristics of a quintessence-like phase. From the perturbation evolution equations, the numerical results of density contrast, $\delta(z)$, growth rate, $f(z)$, and redshift space distortion, $f\sigma_8(z)$ are presented, demonstrate the impact of energy diffusion between dark matter and dark energy for the cosmic structure growth. Using the AIC and BIC Bayesian methods, a detailed statistical analysis has been performed.</description>

      <title>Gravitization Equation and Zero Energy Momentum Tensor Theorem with Cancellation Law in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the essential properties of gravitational quantum field theory (GQFT) based on spin gauge symmetry, using the general theory of quantum electrodynamics as an example. A constraint equation for the field strength of the gravigauge field is derived, serving as a gravitization equation within the spin-related gravigauge spacetime. This equation reveals how gravitational effects emerge from the non-commutative relation of the gravigauge derivative operator. By transmuting the action from gravigauge spacetime to Minkowski spacetime, we demonstrate that translational invariance results in a vanishing energy-momentum tensor in GQFT when the equations of motion are applied to all fundamental fields, including the gravigauge field. This extends the conservation law of the energy-momentum tensor in quantum field theory to a cancellation law of the energy-momentum tensor in GQFT. As a result, an equivalence between the general gravitational equation and the zero energy-momentum tensor theorem naturally arises in GQFT. Certain aspects of the Poincar\'e gauge theory are also briefly discussed. Furthermore, a GQFT incorporating the Chern-Simons action in three-dimensional spacetime is developed, based on the inhomogeneous spin gauge symmetry WS(1,2) and the global Poincar\'e symmetry PO(1,2). This framework provides a basis for exploring its connection to Witten's perspective on three-dimensional gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Overlaps in JT Gravity: From Spectral Form Factor to Generating Functions of Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between black hole interior dynamics and quantum chaos provides a crucial framework for probing quantum effects in quantum gravity. In this work, we investigate non-perturbative overlaps in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity to uncover universal signatures of quantum chaos and quantum complexity. Taking advantage of universal spectral correlators from random matrix theory, we compute the overlaps between the thermofield double (TFD) state and two distinct classes of states: fixed-length states, which encode maximal volume slices, and time-shifted TFD states. The squared overlaps naturally define probability distributions that quantify the expectation values of gravitational observables. Central to our results is the introduction of generating functions for quantum complexity measures, such as $\langle e^{-\alpha \ell} \rangle$. The time evolution of these generating functions exhibits the universal slope-ramp-plateau structure, mirroring the behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF). Using generating functions, we further demonstrate that the universal time evolution of complexity for chaotic systems, which is characterized by a linear growth followed by a late-time plateau, arises from the disappearance of the linear ramp as the regularization parameter $\alpha$ decreases. With regard to the time-shifted TFD state, we derive a surprising result: the expectation value of the time shift, which classically grows linearly, vanishes when non-perturbative quantum corrections are incorporated. This cancellation highlights a fundamental distinction between semiclassical and quantum gravitational descriptions of the black hole interior. All our findings establish generating functions as powerful probes of quantum complexity and chaos in gravitational and quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black hole (PBH) binaries experience strong gravitational perturbations in the case of their initial clustering, which significantly affects the dynamics of their mergers. In this work, we develop a new formalism to account for these perturbations and track the evolution of the binary orbital parameters distribution. Based on this approach, we calculate the merger rate of PBH binaries and demonstrate that its temporal evolution differs greatly from that of isolated binary systems. Moreover, PBH clustering produces distinctive features in the stochastic gravitational-wave background: the canonical $2/3$ spectral slope transforms to $\Omega_{\rm gw} \propto \nu^{-65/28}$ in a certain frequency band. These predictions can be probed in future gravitational wave observations, opening up new opportunities to test the clustering of PBHs and their contribution to dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We consider Einstein gravity with positive cosmological constant coupled to matter in an asymptotically de Sitter universe with sphere boundary at timelike infinity. In this setting we show that, to one-loop order and at late time, the norm of the no-boundary state vanishes, going as $e^{S_0} \frac{Z S_0^{-d(d+1)/4}}{\text{vol}(SO(d,1))}$ with $S_0$ the tree-level entropy of the static patch, $d$ the spacetime dimension, and $Z$ non-negative. We show that the presence of an observer stabilizes the norm to a large, positive value.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transparency of Near-extremal Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of electromagnetic and gravitational waves off a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the low-temperature regime where the near-horizon throat experiences large quantum fluctuations. We find that the black hole is transparent to electromagnetic and gravitational radiation of fixed helicity below a certain frequency threshold. This phenomenon arises because the angular momentum of the black hole is quantized, creating an energy gap between the spinless black hole state and the first excited spinning states. Radiation with angular momentum -- such as photons, gravitons, and partial waves of a massless scalar field, which we also study -- must supply enough energy to bridge this gap to be absorbed. Below this threshold, no absorption can occur, rendering the black hole transparent. For frequencies above the gap, the scarcity of black hole states continues to suppress the absorption cross-section relative to semiclassical predictions, making the black hole translucent rather than completely transparent. Notably, electromagnetic absorption is significantly stronger than gravitational absorption, beyond what differences in spin alone would suggest.</description>
