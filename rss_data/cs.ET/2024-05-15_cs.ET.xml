      <title>From Questions to Insightful Answers: Building an Informed Chatbot for University Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents BARKPLUG V.2, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot system built using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to enhance the user experience and access to information within academic settings.The objective of BARKPLUG V.2 is to provide information to users about various campus resources, including academic departments, programs, campus facilities, and student resources at a university setting in an interactive fashion. Our system leverages university data as an external data corpus and ingests it into our RAG pipelines for domain-specific question-answering tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system in generating accurate and pertinent responses for Mississippi State University, as a case study, using quantitative measures, employing frameworks such as Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment(RAGAS). Furthermore, we evaluate the usability of this system via subjective satisfaction surveys using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Our system demonstrates impressive quantitative performance, with a mean RAGAS score of 0.96, and experience, as validated by usability assessments.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of qudit gates and effects of spectator modes on optimal control pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14006v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qudit gates for high-dimensional quantum computing can be synthesized with high precision using numerical quantum optimal control techniques. Large circuits are broken down into modules and the tailored pulses for each module can be used as primitives for a qudit compiler. Application of the pulses of each module in the presence of extra modes may decrease their effectiveness due to crosstalk. In this paper, we address this problem by simulating qudit dynamics for circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) systems. As a test case, we take pulses for single-qudit SWAP gates optimized in isolation and then apply them in the presence of spectator modes each of which are in Fock states. We provide an experimentally relevant scaling formula that can be used as a bound on the fidelity decay. Our results show that frequency shift from spectator mode populations has to be $\lesssim 0.1\%$ of the qudit's nonlinearity in order for high-fidelity single-qudit gates to be useful in the presence of occupied spectator modes.</description>

      <title>An Abstract Model and Efficient Routing for Logical Entangling Gates on Zoned Neutral Atom Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental achievements have demonstrated the potential of neutral atom architectures for fault-tolerant quantum computing. These architectures feature the dynamic rearrangement of atoms during computation, enabling nearly arbitrary two-dimensional rearrangements. Additionally, they employ a zoned layout with dedicated regions for entangling, storage, and readout. This architecture requires design automation software that efficiently compiles quantum circuits to this hardware and takes care that atoms are in the right place at the right time. In this paper, we initiate this line of work by providing, (1) an abstract model of the novel architecture and, (2) an efficient solution to the routing problem of entangling gates. By this, we aim to maximize the parallelism of entangling gates and minimize the overhead caused by the routing of atoms between zones. In addition to that, we keep the realm of fault-tolerant quantum computing in mind and consider logical qubit arrays, each of which encodes one logical qubit. We implemented the proposed idea as a tool called NALAC and demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency by showing that it can significantly reduce the routing overhead of logical entangling gates compared to the naive approach. As part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), NALAC is publicly available as open-source at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qmap.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing with Qiskit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe Qiskit, a software development kit for quantum information science. We discuss the key design decisions that have shaped its development, and examine the software architecture and its core components. We demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for solving a problem in condensed matter physics on a quantum computer that serves to highlight some of Qiskit's capabilities, for example the representation and optimization of circuits at various abstraction levels, its scalability and retargetability to new gates, and the use of quantum-classical computations via dynamic circuits. Lastly, we discuss some of the ecosystem of tools and plugins that extend Qiskit for various tasks, and the future ahead.</description>

      <title>Measurement-driven neural-network training for integrated magnetic tunnel junction arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing scale of neural networks needed to support more complex applications has led to an increasing requirement for area- and energy-efficient hardware. One route to meeting the budget for these applications is to circumvent the von Neumann bottleneck by performing computation in or near memory. An inevitability of transferring neural networks onto hardware is that non-idealities such as device-to-device variations or poor device yield impact performance. Methods such as hardware-aware training, where substrate non-idealities are incorporated during network training, are one way to recover performance at the cost of solution generality. In this work, we demonstrate inference on hardware neural networks consisting of 20,000 magnetic tunnel junction arrays integrated on a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor chips that closely resembles market-ready spin transfer-torque magnetoresistive random access memory technology. Using 36 dies, each containing a crossbar array with its own non-idealities, we show that even a small number of defects in physically mapped networks significantly degrades the performance of networks trained without defects and show that, at the cost of generality, hardware-aware training accounting for specific defects on each die can recover to comparable performance with ideal networks. We then demonstrate a robust training method that extends hardware-aware training to statistics-aware training, producing network weights that perform well on most defective dies regardless of their specific defect locations. When evaluated on the 36 physical dies, statistics-aware trained solutions can achieve a mean misclassification error on the MNIST dataset that differs from the software-baseline by only 2 %. This statistics-aware training method could be generalized to networks with many layers that are mapped to hardware suited for industry-ready applications.</description>

      <title>Architecture-Level Modeling of Photonic Deep Neural Network Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonics is a promising technology to accelerate Deep Neural Networks as it can use optical interconnects to reduce data movement energy and it enables low-energy, high-throughput optical-analog computations.
  To realize these benefits in a full system (accelerator + DRAM), designers must ensure that the benefits of using the electrical, optical, analog, and digital domains exceed the costs of converting data between domains. Designers must also consider system-level energy costs such as data fetch from DRAM. Converting data and accessing DRAM can consume significant energy, so to evaluate and explore the photonic system space, there is a need for a tool that can model these full-system considerations.
  In this work, we show that similarities between Compute-in-Memory (CiM) and photonics let us use CiM system modeling tools to accurately model photonics systems. Bringing modeling tools to photonics enables evaluation of photonic research in a full-system context, rapid design space exploration, co-design, and comparison between systems.
  Using our open-source model, we show that cross-domain conversion and DRAM can consume a significant portion of photonic system energy. We then demonstrate optimizations that reduce conversions and DRAM accesses to improve photonic system energy efficiency by up to 3x.</description>

      <title>Efficient Shape Formation by 3D Hybrid Programmable Matter: An Algorithm for Low Diameter Intermediate Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the shape formation problem within the 3D hybrid model, where a single agent with a strictly limited viewing range and the computational capacity of a deterministic finite automaton manipulates passive tiles through pick-up, movement, and placement actions. The goal is to reconfigure a set of tiles into a specific shape termed an icicle. The icicle, identified as a dense, hole-free structure, is strategically chosen to function as an intermediate shape for more intricate shape formation tasks. It is designed for easy exploration by a finite state agent, enabling the identification of tiles that can be lifted without breaking connectivity. Compared to the line shape, the icicle presents distinct advantages, including a reduced diameter and the presence of multiple removable tiles. We propose an algorithm that transforms an arbitrary initially connected tile structure into an icicle in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ steps, matching the runtime of the line formation algorithm from prior work. Our theoretical contribution is accompanied by an extensive experimental analysis, indicating that our algorithm decreases the diameter of tile structures on average.</description>
