      <title>Machine-learning competition to grade EEG background patterns in newborns with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has the potential to support and improve expert performance in monitoring the brain function of at-risk newborns. Developing accurate and reliable ML models depends on access to high-quality, annotated data, a resource in short supply. ML competitions address this need by providing researchers access to expertly annotated datasets, fostering shared learning through direct model comparisons, and leveraging the benefits of crowdsourcing diverse expertise. We compiled a retrospective dataset containing 353 hours of EEG from 102 individual newborns from a multi-centre study. The data was fully anonymised and divided into training, testing, and held-out validation datasets. EEGs were graded for the severity of abnormal background patterns. Next, we created a web-based competition platform and hosted a machine learning competition to develop ML models for classifying the severity of EEG background patterns in newborns. After the competition closed, the top 4 performing models were evaluated offline on a separate held-out validation dataset. Although a feature-based model ranked first on the testing dataset, deep learning models generalised better on the validation sets. All methods had a significant decline in validation performance compared to the testing performance. This highlights the challenges for model generalisation on unseen data, emphasising the need for held-out validation datasets in ML studies with neonatal EEG. The study underscores the importance of training ML models on large and diverse datasets to ensure robust generalisation. The competition's outcome demonstrates the potential for open-access data and collaborative ML development to foster a collaborative research environment and expedite the development of clinical decision-support tools for neonatal neuromonitoring.</description>

      <title>Locally Permuted Low Rank Column-wise Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We precisely formulate, and provide a solution for, the Low Rank Columnwise Sensing (LRCS) problem when some of the observed data is scrambled/permuted/unlabeled. This problem, which we refer to as permuted LRCS, lies at the intersection of two distinct topics of recent research: unlabeled sensing and low rank column-wise (matrix) sensing. We introduce a novel generalization of the recently developed Alternating Gradient Descent and Minimization (AltGDMin) algorithm to solve this problem. We also develop an alternating minimization (AltMin) solution. We show, using simulation experiments, that both converge but PermutedAltGDmin is much faster than Permuted-AltMin.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Remote Tracking with State-Dependent Detection Probability: A POMDP Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a real-time tracking system where a binary Markov source is monitored by two heterogeneous sensors. Upon command, sensors send their observations to a remote sink over error-prone channels. We assume each sensor exhibits state-dependent detection accuracy and may occasionally fail to detect the source state. At most one sensor is scheduled for sampling at each time slot. We assess the effectiveness of data communication using a generic distortion function that captures the end application's objective. We derive optimal sink-side command policies to minimize the weighted sum of distortion and transmission costs. To model the uncertainty introduced by sensing failures (of the sensors) and packet loss, we formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which we then cast into a belief-MDP. Since the belief evolves continuously, the belief space is discretized into a finite grid and the belief value is quantized to the nearest grid point after each update. This formulation leads to a finite-state MDP problem, which is solved using the relative value iteration algorithm (RVIA). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed policy significantly outperforms benchmark strategies and highlights the importance of accounting for state-dependent sensing reliability in sensor scheduling.</description>

      <title>Field evaluation of a wearable instrumented headband designed for measuring head kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To study the relationship between soccer heading and the risk of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), we previously developed an instrumented headband and data processing scheme to measure the angular head kinematics of soccer headers. Laboratory evaluation of the headband on an anthropomorphic test device showed good agreement with a reference sensor for soccer ball impacts to the front of the head. In this study, we evaluate the headband in measuring the full head kinematics of soccer headers in the field. Methods: The headband was evaluated under typical soccer heading scenarios (throw-ins, goal-kicks, and corner-kicks) on a human subject. The measured time history and peak kinematics from the headband were compared with those from an instrumented mouthpiece, which is a widely accepted method for measuring head kinematics in the field. Results: The time history agreement (CORA scores) between the headband and the mouthpiece ranged from 'fair' to 'excellent', with the highest agreement for angular velocities (0.79 \pm 0.08) and translational accelerations (0.73 \pm 0.05) and lowest for angular accelerations (0.67 \pm 0.06). A Bland-Altman analysis of the peak kinematics from the headband and mouthpiece found the mean bias to be 40.9% (of the maximum mouthpiece reading) for the angular velocity, 16.6% for the translational acceleration, and-14.1% for the angular acceleration. Conclusion: The field evaluation of the instrumented headband showed reasonable agreement with the mouthpiece for some kinematic measures and impact conditions. Future work should focus on improving the headband performance across all kinematic measures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The four-dimensional nonlinear model is extended to include the inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering, enabling accurate prediction of dual-polarization four-dimensional modulation formats and probabilistically shaped constellations in high-dispersion regimes. The proposed model is validated via comparisons with the split-step Fourier method and enhanced Gaussian noise model.</description>

      <title>Uplink RSMA for Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key goals of next-generation wireless networks is to adapt to changing conditions and meet the growing demand for reliable, high-capacity communications from emerging applications. Overcoming the limitations of conventional technologies, such as fixed antenna positions, is essential to achieving this objective because it mitigates the impact of path loss on the received signal and creates strong line-of-sight links, enhancing system performance. With this in mind, the newly proposed pinching antenna systems (PASs) are a promising solution for indoor applications because they can activate antennas across a waveguide deployed in a room, thus reducing the distance between the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we investigate a two-user, two-pinching-antenna uplink PAS, in which the transmitters use rate splitting to create a more resilient framework than non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). For this network, we derive novel closed-form expressions for the outage probability. Numerical results validate these expressions, proving that the proposed rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme outperforms NOMA PAS.</description>

      <title>FetalSleepNet: A Transfer Learning Framework with Spectral Equalisation Domain Adaptation for Fetal Sleep Stage Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: This study presents FetalSleepNet, the first published deep learning approach to classifying sleep states from the ovine electroencephalogram (EEG). Fetal EEG is complex to acquire and difficult and laborious to interpret consistently. However, accurate sleep stage classification may aid in the early detection of abnormal brain maturation associated with pregnancy complications (e.g. hypoxia or intrauterine growth restriction).
  Methods: EEG electrodes were secured onto the ovine dura over the parietal cortices of 24 late gestation fetal sheep. A lightweight deep neural network originally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG using transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain adaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch.
  Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full fine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall performance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming baseline models.
  Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep learning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the fetal EEG. Beyond the laboratory, the EEG-based sleep stage classifier functions as a label engine, enabling large scale weak/semi supervised labeling and distillation to facilitate training on less invasive signals that can be acquired in the clinic, such as Doppler Ultrasound or electrocardiogram data. FetalSleepNet's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment in low power, real time, and wearable fetal monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Resilient Vital Sign Monitoring Using RIS-Assisted Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vital sign monitoring plays a critical role in healthcare and well-being, as parameters such as respiration and heart rate offer valuable insights into an individual's physiological state. While wearable devices allow for continuous measurement, their use in settings like in-home elderly care is often hindered by discomfort or user noncompliance. As a result, contactless solutions based on radar sensing have garnered increasing attention. This is due to their unobtrusive design and preservation of privacy advantages compared to camera-based systems. However, a single radar perspective can fail to capture breathing-induced chest movements reliably, particularly when the subject's orientation is unfavorable. To address this limitation, we integrate a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) that provides an additional sensing path, thereby enhancing the robustness of respiratory monitoring. We present a novel model for multi-path vital sign sensing that leverages both the direct radar path and an RIS-reflected path. We further discuss the potential benefits and improved performance our approach offers in continuous, privacy-preserving vital sign monitoring.</description>

      <title>Real-time identification and control of influential pandemic regions using graph signal variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global spread of pandemics is facilitated by the mobility of populations, transforming localized infections into widespread phenomena. To contain it, timely identification of influential regions that accelerate this process is necessary. In this work, we model infection as a temporally evolving graph signal and propose graph signal variation-based metrics to capture spatio-temporal changes. Both graph domain and time domain locality are modeled. Based on this metric, we propose an online algorithm to identify influential regions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method effectively identifies geographical regions with a higher capacity to spread the infection. Isolating these regions leads to a significant reduction in cumulative infection. Simulations, along with analyses of hybrid H1N1 data and real-world Indian COVID-19 data, underscore the utility of proposed metric in enhancing our understanding and control of infection spread</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Null-Space-Based Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has attracted sustained interest. We propose a null-space-based transmission scheme for multiuser SWIPT serving both energy users (EUs) and information users (IUs). Under a practical nonlinear energy-harvesting (EH) model and multiple waveform options, we revisit the role of dedicated energy beams (EBs). We show that, in general, dedicated EBs are unnecessary because information beams (IBs) with Gaussian signaling can simultaneously support wireless energy transfer (WET) and wireless information transfer (WIT), unless special energy-centric waveforms (e.g., deterministic sinusoidal waveforms) are employed and provide sufficient gains. Guided by these insights, we formulate an optimization problem for EB design to enable dedicated waveform transmission for WET, and we develop a low-complexity algorithm that reduces computation by ignoring the WET contribution of IBs during optimization. Numerical results corroborate that deterministic sinusoidal waveforms outperform Gaussian signaling when the received RF power lies in the EH high-efficiency region, making dedicated EBs beneficial. The proposed scheme achieves computational complexity reductions of 91.43\% and 98.54\% for the cases $M=8,,K^I=K^E=2$ and $M=16,,K^I=K^E=4$, respectively, with negligible performance loss, thereby validating the efficiency of the low-complexity algorithm.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to 6G has driven significant updates to the 3GPP channel model, particularly in modeling UE antennas and user-induced blockage for handheld devices. The 3GPP Rel.19 revision of TR 38.901 introduces a more realistic framework that captures directive antenna patterns, practical antenna placements, polarization effects, and element-specific blockage. These updates are based on high-fidelity simulations and measurements of a reference smartphone across multiple frequency ranges. By aligning link- and system-level simulations with real-world device behavior, the new model enables more accurate evaluation of 6G technologies and supports consistent performance assessment across industry and research.</description>

      <title>Robust Localization in Modern Cellular Networks using Global Map Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) signal-based localization using modern cellular networks has emerged as a promising solution to accurately locate objects in challenging environments. One of the most promising solutions for situations involving obstructed-line-of-sight (OLoS) and multipath propagation is multipathbased simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) that employs map features (MFs), such as virtual anchors. This paper presents an extended MP-SLAM method that is augmented with a global map feature (GMF) repository. This repository stores consistent MFs of high quality that are collected during prior traversals. We integrate these GMFs back into the MP-SLAM framework via a probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter, which propagates GMF intensity functions over time. Extensive simulations, together with a challenging real-world experiment using LTE RF signals in a dense urban scenario with severe multipath propagation and inter-cell interference, demonstrate that our framework achieves robust and accurate localization, thereby showcasing its effectiveness in realistic modern cellular networks such as 5G or future 6G networks. It outperforms conventional proprioceptive sensor-based localization and conventional MP-SLAM methods, and achieves reliable localization even under adverse signal conditions.</description>

      <title>SoilSound: Smartphone-based Soil Moisture Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soil moisture monitoring is essential for agriculture and environmental management, yet existing methods require either invasive probes disturbing the soil or specialized equipment, limiting access to the public. We present SoilSound, an ubiquitous accessible smartphone-based acoustic sensing system that can measure soil moisture without disturbing the soil. We leverage the built-in speaker and microphone to perform a vertical scan mechanism to accurately measure moisture without any calibration. Unlike existing work that use transmissive properties, we propose an alternate model for acoustic reflections in soil based on the surface roughness effect to enable moisture sensing without disturbing the soil. The system works by sending acoustic chirps towards the soil and recording the reflections during a vertical scan, which are then processed and fed to a convolutional neural network for on-device soil moisture estimation with negligible computational, memory, or power overhead. We evaluated the system by training with curated soils in boxes in the lab and testing in the outdoor fields and show that SoilSound achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.39% across 10 different locations. Overall, the evaluation shows that SoilSound can accurately track soil moisture levels ranging from 15.9% to 34.0% across multiple soil types, environments, and users; without requiring any calibration or disturbing the soil, enabling widespread moisture monitoring for home gardeners, urban farmers, citizen scientists, and agricultural communities in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Semantic Rate-Distortion Theory with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is ushering in a new era for communication. As a result, the establishment of a semantic communication framework is putting on the agenda. Based on a realistic semantic communication model, this paper develops a rate-distortion framework for semantic compression. Different from the existing works primarily focusing on decoder-side estimation of intrinsic meaning and ignoring its inherent issues, such as ambiguity and polysemy, we exploit a constraint of conditional semantic probability distortion to effectively capture the essential features of practical semantic exchanges in an AI-assisted communication system. With the help of the methods in rate-distortion-perception theory, we establish a theorem specifying the minimum achievable rate under this semantic constraint and a traditional symbolic constraint and obtain its closed-form limit for a particular semantic scenario. From the experiments in this paper, bounding conditional semantic probability distortion can effectively improve both semantic transmission accuracy and bit-rate efficiency. Our framework bridges information theory and AI, enabling potential applications in bandwidth-efficient semantic-aware networks, enhanced transceiver understanding, and optimized semantic transmission for AI-driven systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for high-speed, ultra-reliable, and low-latency communications in 5G and beyond networks has significantly driven up power consumption, particularly within the Radio Access Network (RAN). This surge in energy demand poses critical operational and sustainability challenges for mobile network operators, necessitating innovative solutions that enhance energy efficiency without compromising Quality of Service (QoS). Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN), spearheaded by the O-RAN Alliance, offers disaggregated, programmable, and intelligent architectures, promoting flexibility, interoperability, and cost-effectiveness. However, this disaggregated approach adds complexity, particularly in managing power consumption across diverse network components such as Open Radio Units (RUs). In this paper, we propose a hybrid xApp leveraging heuristic methods and unsupervised machine learning, integrated with digital twin technology through the TeraVM AI RAN Scenario Generator (AI-RSG). This approach dynamically manages RU sleep modes to effectively reduce energy consumption. Our experimental evaluation in a realistic, large-scale emulated Open RAN scenario demonstrates that the hybrid xApp achieves approximately 13% energy savings, highlighting its practicality and significant potential for real-world deployments without compromising user QoS.</description>

      <title>Data distribution impacts the performance and generalisability of contrastive learning-based foundation models of electrocardiograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning is a widely adopted self-supervised pretraining strategy, yet its dependence on cohort composition remains underexplored. We present Contrasting by Patient Augmented Electrocardiograms (CAPE) foundation model and pretrain on four cohorts (n = 5,203,352), from diverse populations across three continents (North America, South America, Asia). We systematically assess how cohort demographics, health status, and population diversity influence the downstream performance for prediction tasks also including two additional cohorts from another continent (Europe). We find that downstream performance depends on the distributional properties of the pretraining cohort, including demographics and health status. Moreover, while pretraining with a multi-centre, demographically diverse cohort improves in-distribution accuracy, it reduces out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation of our contrastive approach by encoding cohort-specific artifacts. To address this, we propose the In-Distribution Batch (IDB) strategy, which preserves intra-cohort consistency during pretraining and enhances OOD robustness. This work provides important insights for developing clinically fair and generalisable foundation models.</description>

      <title>Modelling the 5G Energy Consumption using Real-world Data: Energy Fingerprint is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The introduction of 5G technology has revolutionized communications, enabling unprecedented capacity, connectivity, and ultra-fast, reliable communications. However, this leap has led to a substantial increase in energy consumption, presenting a critical challenge for network sustainability. Accurate energy consumption modeling is essential for developing energy-efficient strategies, enabling operators to optimize resource utilization while maintaining network performance. To address this, we propose a novel deep learning model for 5G base station energy consumption estimation based on a real-world dataset. Unlike existing methods, our approach integrates the Base Station Identifier (BSID) as an input feature through an embedding layer, capturing unique energy patterns across different base stations. We further introduce a masked training method and an attention mechanism to enhance generalization and accuracy. Experimental results show significant improvements, reducing Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) from 12.75% to 4.98%, achieving over 60% performance gain compared to existing models. The source code for our model is available at https://github.com/RS2002/ARL.</description>

      <title>Deep Survival Analysis from Adult and Pediatric Electrocardiograms: A Multi-center Benchmark Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence applied to electrocardiography (AI-ECG) shows potential for mortality prediction, but heterogeneous approaches and private datasets have limited generalizable insights. To address this, we systematically evaluated model design choices across three large cohorts: Beth Israel Deaconess (MIMIC-IV: n = 795,546 ECGs, United States), Telehealth Network of Minas Gerais (Code-15: n = 345,779, Brazil), and Boston Children's Hospital (BCH: n = 255,379, United States). We evaluated models predicting all-cause mortality, comparing horizon-based classification and deep survival methods with neural architectures including convolutional networks and transformers, benchmarking against demographic-only and gradient boosting baselines. Top models performed well (median concordance: Code-15, 0.83; MIMIC-IV, 0.78; BCH, 0.81). Incorporating age and sex improved performance across all datasets. Classifier-Cox models showed site-dependent sensitivity to horizon choice (median Pearson's R: Code-15, 0.35; MIMIC-IV, -0.71; BCH, 0.37). External validation reduced concordance, and in some cases demographic-only models outperformed externally trained AI-ECG models on Code-15. However, models trained on multi-site data outperformed site-specific models by 5-22%. Findings highlight factors for robust AI-ECG deployment: deep survival methods outperformed horizon-based classifiers, demographic covariates improved predictive performance, classifier-based models required site-specific calibration, and cross-cohort training, even between adult and pediatric cohorts, substantially improved performance. These results emphasize the importance of model type, demographics, and training diversity in developing AI-ECG models reliably applicable across populations.</description>

      <title>Improving 3D Cellular Positioning Integrity with Bayesian RAIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring positioning integrity amid faulty measurements is crucial for safety-critical applications, making receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) indispensable. This paper introduces a Bayesian RAIM algorithm with a streamlined architecture for snapshot-type 3D cellular positioning. Unlike traditional frequentist-type RAIM algorithms, it computes the exact posterior probability density function (PDF) of the position vector as a Gaussian mixture (GM) model using efficient message passing along a factor graph. This Bayesian approach retains all crucial information from the measurements, eliminates the need to discard faulty measurements, and results in tighter protection levels (PLs) in 3D space and 1D/2D subspaces that meet target integrity risk (TIR) requirements. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the Bayesian RAIM algorithm significantly outperforms a baseline algorithm, achieving over $50\%$ PL reduction at a comparable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Superimposed Pilot-Based OTFS -- Will It Work?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a promising solution to handle doubly-selective fading, but its channel estimation is a nontrivial task in terms of maximizing spectral efficiency. Conventional pilot assignment approaches face challenges: the standard embedded pilot-based scheme suffers from low transmission rates, and the single superimposed pilot (SP)-based scheme experiences inevitable data-pilot interference, leading to coarse channel estimation. To cope with this issue, focusing on the SP-based OTFS system in channel coded scenarios, we propose a novel pilot assignment scheme and an iterative algorithm. The proposed scheme allocates multiple SPs per frame to estimate channel coefficients accurately. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm performs refined interference cancellation, utilizing a replica of data symbols generated from soft-decision outputs provided by a decoder. Assuming fair and unified conditions, we evaluate each pilot assignment scheme in terms of reliability, channel estimation accuracy, effective throughput, and computational complexity. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the multiple SP-based scheme, which balances the transmission rate and the interference cancellation performance, has the best throughput at the expense of slightly increased complexity. In addition, we confirm that the multiple SP-based scheme achieves further improved throughput due to the proposed interference cancellation algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) enables efficient spectrum utilization and reduces hardware costs for beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G networks, facilitating intelligent applications that require both high-performance communication and precise sensing capabilities. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the evolution of ISAC over the years. We examine the expansion of the spectrum across RF and optical ISAC, highlighting the role of advanced technologies, along with key challenges and synergies. We further discuss the advancements in network architecture from single-cell to multi-cell systems, emphasizing the integration of collaborative sensing and interference mitigation strategies. Moreover, we analyze the progress from single-modal to multi-modal sensing, with a focus on the integration of edge intelligence to enable real-time data processing, reduce latency, and enhance decision-making. Finally, we extensively review standardization efforts by 3GPP, IEEE, and ITU, examining the transition of ISAC-related technologies and their implications for the deployment of 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Power-Measurement-Based Channel Estimation for Beyond Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), with its enhanced degrees of freedom compared to conventional RIS, has demonstrated notable potential for enhancing wireless communication performance. However, a key challenge in employing BD-RIS lies in accurately acquiring its channel state information (CSI) with both the base station (BS) and users. Existing BD-RIS channel estimation methods rely mainly on dedicated pilot signals, which increase system overhead and may be incompatible with current communication protocols. To overcome these limitations, this letter proposes a new single-layer neural network (NN)-enabled channel estimation method utilizing only the easily accessible received power measurements at user terminals. In particular, we show that the received signal power can be expressed in a form similar to a single-layer NN, where the weights represent the BD-RIS's CSI. This structure enables the recovery of CSI using the backward propagation, based on power measurements collected under varying training reflection coefficients. Numerical results show that our proposed method can achieve a small normalized mean square error (NMSE), particularly when the number of training reflections is large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05074v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven Wi-Fi localization and tracking have shown great promise due to their lower reliance on specialized hardware compared to model-based methods. However, most existing data collection techniques provide only coarse-grained ground truth or a limited number of labeled points, significantly hindering the advancement of data-driven approaches. While systems like lidar can deliver precise ground truth, their high costs make them inaccessible to many users. To address these challenges, we propose LoFi, a vision-aided label generator for Wi-Fi localization and tracking. LoFi can generate ground truth position coordinates solely from 2D images, offering high precision, low cost, and ease of use. Utilizing our method, we have compiled a Wi-Fi tracking and localization dataset using the ESP32-S3 and a webcam. The code and dataset of this paper are available at https://github.com/RS2002/LoFi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present QuantX: a tailored suite of recipes for LLM and VLM quantization. It is capable of quantizing down to 3-bit resolutions with minimal loss in performance. The quantization strategies in QuantX take into account hardware-specific constraints to achieve efficient dequantization during inference ensuring flexible trade-off between runtime speed, memory requirement and model accuracy. Our results demonstrate that QuantX achieves performance within 6% of the unquantized model for LlaVa-v1.6 quantized down to 3-bits for multiple end user tasks and outperforms recently published state-of-the-art quantization techniques. We further integrate one particular technique from QuantX into the popular Llama.cpp framework and show its feasibility in terms of runtime compared to the mainstream quantization techniques from Llama.cpp. Lastly, this manuscript provides insights into the LLM quantization process that motivated the range of recipes and options that are incorporated in QuantX.</description>

      <title>Per-antenna power constraints: constructing Pareto-optimal precoders with cubic complexity under non-negligible noise conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precoding matrix construction is a key element of the wireless signal processing using the multiple-input and multiple-output model. It is established that the problem of global throughput optimization under per-antenna power constraints belongs, in general, to the class of monotonic optimization problems, and is unsolvable in real-time. The most widely used real-time baseline is the suboptimal solution of Zero-Forcing, which achieves a cubic complexity by discarding the background noise coefficients. This baseline, however, is not readily adapted to per-antenna power constraints, and performs poorly if background noise coefficients are not negligible. In this paper, we are going to present a computational algorithm which constructs a precoder that is SINR multiobjective Pareto-optimal under per-antenna power constraints - with a complexity that differs from that of Zero-Forcing only by a constant factor. The algorithm has a set of input parameters, changing which skews the importance of particular user throughputs: these parameters make up an efficient parameterization of the entire Pareto boundary.</description>

      <title>IS${}^3$ : Generic Impulsive--Stationary Sound Separation in Acoustic Scenes using Deep Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in audio systems capable of performing a differentiated processing of stationary backgrounds and isolated acoustic events within an acoustic scene, whether for applying specific processing methods to each part or for focusing solely on one while ignoring the other. Such systems have applications in real-world scenarios, including robust adaptive audio rendering systems (e.g., EQ or compression), plosive attenuation in voice mixing, noise suppression or reduction, robust acoustic event classification or even bioacoustics. To this end, we introduce IS${}^3$, a neural network designed for Impulsive--Stationary Sound Separation, that isolates impulsive acoustic events from the stationary background using a deep filtering approach, that can act as a pre-processing stage for the above-mentioned tasks. To ensure optimal training, we propose a sophisticated data generation pipeline that curates and adapts existing datasets for this task. We demonstrate that a learning-based approach, build on a relatively lightweight neural architecture and trained with well-designed and varied data, is successful in this previously unaddressed task, outperforming the Harmonic--Percussive Sound Separation masking method, adapted from music signal processing research, and wavelet filtering on objective separation metrics.</description>
