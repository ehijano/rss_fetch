      <title>Dynamical topological phase transition in cold Rydberg quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Study of phase transitions provide insights into how a many-body system behaves under different conditions, enabling us to understand the symmetry breaking, critical phenomena, and topological properties. Strong long-range interactions in highly excited Rydberg atoms create a versatile platform for exploring exotic emergent topological phases. Here, we report the experimental observation of dynamical topological phase transitions in cold Rydberg atomic gases under a microwave field driving. By measuring the system transmission curves while varying the probe intensity, we observe complex hysteresis trajectories characterized by distinct winding numbers as they cross the critical point. At the transition state, where the winding number flips, the topology of these hysteresis trajectories evolves into more non-trivial structures. The topological trajectories are shown to be robust against noise, confirming their rigidity in dynamic conditions. These findings contribute to the insights of emergence of complex dynamical topological phases in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Modified Fermi-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently introduced recurrence-relation ansatz applied to the Fermi-Hubbard model gives rise to a soluble model and here is used to calculate several thermodynamic observables. The constraint of unit density per site, density = 1, is applied and some of the results are compared to cases where the constraint is not imposed. The modified model exhibits a continuous phase transition (second order) reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall resistance and a ground state, first-order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Eigenoperator approach to Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory and dispersive interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern quantum physics is very modular: we first understand basic building blocks (``XXZ Hamiltonian'' ``Jaynes-Cummings'' etc.) and then combine them to explore novel effects. A typical example is placing known systems inside an optical cavity. The Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation method is particularly suited for dealing with these problems, since it casts the perturbation expansion in terms of operator corrections to a Hamiltonian, which is more intuitive than energy level corrections, as in traditional time-independent perturbation theory. However, the method lacks a systematic approach.% and has largely remained a niche topic. In these notes we discuss how \emph{eigenoperator decompositions}, a concept largely used in open quantum systems, can be employed to construct an intuitive and systematic formulation of Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory. To illustrate this we revisit various papers in the literature, old and new, and show how they can instead be solved using eigenoperators. Particular emphasis is given to perturbations that couple two systems with very different transition frequencies (highly off-resonance), leading to the so-called dispersive interactions.</description>

      <title>Flatbands in tight-binding lattices with anisotropic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider tight-binding models on Bravais lattices with anisotropic onsite potentials that vary along a given direction and are constant along the transverse one. Inspired by our previous work on flatbands in anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric Hamiltonians [Phys. Rev. A 105, L021305 (2022)], we construct an anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric Hamiltonians with an $E=0$ flatband by tuning the hoppings and the shapes of potentials. This construction is illustrated for the square lattice with bounded and unbounded potentials. Unlike flatbands in short-ranged translationally invariant Hamiltonians, we conjecture that the considered $E=0$ flatbands do not host compact localized states. Instead the flatband eigenstates exhibit a localization transition along the potential direction upon increasing the potential strength for bounded potentials. For unbounded potentials flatband eigenstates are always localized irrespective of the potential strength.</description>

      <title>Accurate simulation of Efimov physics in ultracold atomic gases with realistic three-body multichannel interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a detailed and self-contained description of a recently developed theoretical and numerical method for the simulation of three identical bosonic alkali-metal atoms near a Feshbach resonance, where the Efimov effect is induced. The method is based on a direct construction of the off-shell two-body transition matrix from exact eigenfunctions of the embedded two-body Hamiltonians, obtained using realistic parameterizations of the interaction potentials which accurately reproduce the molecular energy levels. The transition matrix is then inserted into the appropriate three-body integral equations, which may be efficiently solved on a computer. We focus especially on the power of our method in including rigorously the effects of multichannel physics on the three-body problem, which are usually accounted for only by various approximations. We demonstrate the method for ${}^7$Li, where we recently showed that a correct inclusion of this multichannel physics resolves the long-standing disagreement between theory and experiment regarding the Efimovian three-body parameter. We analyze the Efimovian enhancement of the three-body recombination rate on both sides of the Feshbach resonance, revealing strong sensitivity to the spin structure of the model thus indicating the prevalence of three-body spin-exchange physics. Finally, we discuss an extension of our methodology to the calculation of three-body bound-state energies.</description>

      <title>Measurement resolution enhanced coherence for lattice fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak measurement enables the extraction of targeted information from a quantum system while minimizing decoherence due to measurement backaction. However, in many-body quantum systems backaction can have unexpected effects on wavefunction collapse. We theoretically study a minimal many-particle model consisting of weakly measured non-interacting fermions in a one dimensional lattice. Repeated measurement of on-site occupation number with single-site resolution stochastically drives the system toward a Fock state, regardless of the initial state. This need not be the case for measurements that do not, even in principle, have single-site spatial resolution. We numerically show for systems with up to 16 sites that decreasing the spatial resolution strongly affects both the rate of stochastic evolution for each quantum trajectory and the allowed final states. The full Hilbert space can be partitioned into backaction-free subspaces (BFSs) the elements of which are indistinguishable to these measurements. Repeated measurements will drive any initial state into a single BFS, leading to a steady state that is a fixed point of the measurement process. We exactly calculate the properties of these BFSs for systems up to 32 sites and find that even for moderate reductions in measurement resolution they yield non-trivial steady state entanglement and coherence.</description>

      <title>Stability and dynamics of nonlinear excitations in a two-dimensional droplet-bearing environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We unravel stationary states in the form of dark soliton stripes, bubbles, and kinks embedded in a two-dimensional droplet-bearing setting emulated by an extended Gross-Pitaevskii approach. The existence of these configurations is corroborated through an effectively reduced potential picture demonstrating their concrete parametric regions of existence. The excitation spectra of such configurations are analyzed within the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes framework exposing the destabilization of dark soliton stripes and bubbles, while confirming the stability of droplets, and importantly unveiling spectral stability of the kink against transverse excitations. Additionally, a variational approach is constructed providing access to the transverse stability analysis of the dark soliton stripe for arbitrary chemical potentials and widths of the structure. This is subsequently compared with the stability analysis outcome demonstrating very good agreement at small wavenumbers. Dynamical destabilization of dark soliton stripes via the snake instability is showcased, while bubbles are found to feature both a splitting into a gray soliton pair and a transverse instability thereof. These results shed light on unexplored stability and instability properties of nonlinear excitations in environments featuring a competition of mean-field repulsion and beyond-mean-field attraction that can be probed by state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of interacting particles, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures exclusively the integrated quantum metric. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free fermions, we unveil an intimate connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>
