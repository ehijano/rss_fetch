      <title>Kinetic energy in random recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between unstable fixed points and chaotic dynamics in high-dimensional neural dynamics remains elusive. In this work, we investigate the kinetic energy distribution of random recurrent neural networks by combining dynamical mean-field theory with extensive numerical simulations. We find that the average kinetic energy shifts continuously from zero to a positive value at a critical value of coupling variance (synaptic gain), with a power-law behavior close to the critical point. The steady-state activity distribution is further calculated by the theory and compared with simulations on finite-size systems. This study provides a first step toward understanding the landscape of kinetic energy, which may reflect the structure of phase space for the non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Observation of Super-ballistic Brownian Motion in Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motion is a foundational problem in physics and is characterized by a mean squared displacement that scales linearly in time in thermal equilibrium, known as diffusion. At short times, the mean squared displacement becomes ballistic, scaling as t^2. This effect was predicted by Einstein in 1907 and recently observed experimentally. We report that this picture is only true on average; by conditioning specific initial velocities, we predict theoretically and confirm by experiment that the mean squared displacement becomes super-ballistic, with a power scaling law of t^(5/2). This new result is due to the colored noise of incompressible fluids, resulting in a non-zero first moment for the thermal force when conditioned on non-zero initial velocities. These results are a first step towards the unraveling of nonequilibrium dynamics of fluids.</description>

      <title>Entropy production in non-reciprocal polar active mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The out-of-equilibrium character of active systems is often twofold, arising from both the activity itself and from non-reciprocal couplings between constituents. A well-established measure to quantify the system's distance from equilibrium is the informatic entropy production rate. Here, we ask the question whether and how the informatic entropy production rate reflects collective behaviors and transitions in an active mixture with non-reciprocal polar couplings. In such systems, non-reciprocal orientational couplings can induce chiral motion of particles. At the field-theoretical level, transitions to these time-dependent chiral states are marked by so-called exceptional points. Here, we show that at a particle level, the entropy production rate within the chiral states increases with the degree of non-reciprocity, provided it is sufficiently strong. Moreover, even at small degrees of non-reciprocity, the transitions via exceptional points leave clear signatures in the entropy production rate, which exhibits pronounced peaks at coupling strengths corresponding to the field-theoretical exceptional points. Overall, the increase and peaks of the entropy production rate mirror the susceptibility of the polarization order parameter at the particle level. This correspondence is supported by a field-theoretical analysis, which reveals that, in the long-wavelength limit, the entropy production rate scales with the susceptibilities of the polarization fields.</description>

      <title>Mean first-encounter times of simultaneous random walkers with resetting on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of simultaneous random walkers with resetting on networks and derive exact analytical expressions for the mean first-encounter times of Markovian random walkers. Specifically, we consider two cases for the simultaneous dynamics of two random walkers on networks: when only one walker resets to the initial node, and when both walkers return to their initial positions. In both cases, the encounter times are expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transition matrix of the normal random walk, providing a spectral interpretation of the impact of resetting. We validate our approach through examples on rings, Cayley trees, and random networks generated using the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Watts-Strogatz, and Barab\'asi-Albert algorithms, where resetting significantly reduces encounter times. The proposed framework can be extended to other types of random walk dynamics, transport processes, or multiple-walker scenarios, with potential applications in human mobility, epidemic spreading, and search strategies in complex systems.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Model for Thermomigration in Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms involved in the thermomigration of interstitial hydrogen in metals. Using statistical thermodynamics, we develop a comprehensive mechanistic model to capture the controlling effects. Crucially, through validation against published experimental data, our results demonstrate that an electron-wind effect plays a significant role, particularly for materials in which the thermomigration direction matches the heat flux. These findings provide new insights into the factors that affect the localisation of solutes in metals. Moreover, our results indicate that atomistic models may be inadequate for detailed thermomigration studies due to the omission of electronic effects.</description>

      <title>The use of open boundaries in stochastic hydrodynamic models of nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic hydrodynamics is a central tool in the study of first order phase transitions at a fundamental level. Combined with sophisticated free energy models, e.g. as developed in classical Density Functional Theory, complex processes such as crystallization can be modeled and information such as free energy barriers, nucleation pathways and the unstable eigenvector and eigenvalues determined. The latter are particularly interesting as they play key roles in defining the natural (unbiased) order parameter and the nucleation rate respectively. As is often the case, computational realities restrict the size of system that can be modeled and this makes it difficult to achieve experimental conditions for which the volume is effectively infinite. In this paper, the use of open boundary conditions is discussed. By using an open system, the calculations become much closer to experimental conditions however, the introduction of open boundary conditions raises a number of questions concerning the stochastic model such as whether the fluctuation-dissipation relation is preserved and whether stationary points on the free energy surface remain stationary points of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum phase classification on quantum computers from machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of quantum phases of matter remains a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. We present a novel framework that combines shadow tomography with modern time-series machine learning models to enable efficient and practical quantum phase classification. Our approach leverages the definition of quantum phases based on connectivity through finite-depth local unitary circuits, generating abundant training data by applying Haar random evolution to representative quantum states for a given phase. In this way, the training data can be efficiently obtained from a quantum simulator. Additionally, we demonstrate that advanced time-series models can be used to process the training data and achieve universal quantum phase classification that does not rely on local order parameters. To validate the universality and versatility of our method, we test the model against one-dimensional quantum spin chains such as the Ising model and the axial next-nearest-neighbor Ising (ANNNI) model, showing excellent agreement with known phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Casimir Interaction between Polydisperse Colloids Trapped at a Fluid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of polydispersity on fluctuation-induced interactions between Janus colloidal particles trapped at a fluid interface. Using the scattering-matrix formalism, we calculate the thermal Casimir energy in both two- and three-body systems, considering three distinct fluctuation scenarios for the colloids: (a) fixed, (b) bobbing, and (c) bobbing and tilting. Our results reveal a pronounced sensitivity to polydispersity that strongly depends on the fluctuating boundary conditions: while fixed colloids show modest deviations, bobbing and especially bobbing+tilting configurations exhibit orders-of-magnitude amplification in the energy deviation due to polydispersity. These effects are further enhanced at large separations. Our findings highlights the interplay between geometry, colloids fluctuations, and fluctuation-induced forces, with implications for colloidal self-assembly and interface engineering.</description>

      <title>Optimal Qubit Purification and Unitary Schur Sampling via Random SWAP Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of qubit purification is to combine multiple noisy copies of an unknown pure quantum state to obtain one or more copies that are closer to the pure state. We show that a simple protocol based solely on random SWAP tests achieves the same fidelity as the Schur transform, which is optimal. This protocol relies only on elementary two-qubit SWAP tests, which project a pair of qubits onto the singlet or triplet subspaces, to identify and isolate singlet pairs, and then proceeds with the remaining qubits. For a system of $n$ qubits, we show that after approximately $T \approx n \ln n$ random SWAP tests, a sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet decreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining qubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error that is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what is known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error $\epsilon$, after only $2n \ln(n \epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests. That is, it provides a lossless method for extracting any information invariant under permutations of qubits, making it a powerful subroutine for tasks such as quantum state tomography and metrology.</description>

      <title>Information Propagation in Predator-Prey Dynamics of Turbulent Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetically confined fusion plasmas exhibit predator-prey-like cyclic oscillations through the self-regulating interaction between drift-wave turbulence and zonal flow. To elucidate the detailed mechanism and causality underlying this phenomenon, we construct a simple stochastic predator-prey model that incorporates intrinsic fluctuations and analyze its statistical properties from an information-theoretic perspective. We first show that the model exhibits persistent fluctuating cyclic oscillations called quasi-cycles due to amplification of intrinsic noise. This result suggests the possibility that the previously observed periodic oscillations in a toroidal plasma are not limit cycles but quasi-cycles, and that such quasi-cycles may be widely observed under various conditions. For this model, we further prove that information of zonal flow is propagated to turbulence. This information-theoretic analysis may provide a theoretical basis for regulating turbulence by controlling zonal flow.</description>

      <title>Global Tensor Network Renormalization for 2D Quantum systems: A new window to probe universal data from thermal transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new tensor network renormalization group (TNR) scheme based on global optimization and introduce a new method for constructing the finite-temperature density matrix of two-dimensional quantum systems. Combining these two into a new algorithm called thermal tensor network renormalization (TTNR), we obtain highly accurate conformal field theory (CFT) data at thermal transition points. This provides a new and efficient route for numerically identifying phase transitions, offering an alternative to the conventional analysis via critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics of entanglement entropy under projective charge measurements: the free fermion case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the effect of projective measurements on the quench dynamics of the bipartite entanglement entropy in one dimensional free fermionic systems. In our protocol, we consider projective measurements of a $U(1)$ conserved charge, the particle number, on some large subsystem, and study the entanglement entropies between the same subsystem and its complement. We compare the dynamics emanating from two classes of initial states, one which is an eigenstate of the charge and another which is not. Moreover, we consider the effects of a single measurement as well as multiple which are periodically performed. Using the quasiparticle picture, we obtain analytic expressions for the behaviour of the entanglement which admit a transparent physical interpretation. In general, we find that measurements introduce two distinct types of corrections to the entanglement, which can be interpreted separately as classical and quantum contributions. The classical contribution is independent of the measurement outcome and scales logarithmically with variance of the charge distribution. In contrast, the quantum contribution depends on the specific measurement outcome and can be significant for individual realizations; however, it becomes negligible when averaged over all possible outcomes. Our expressions reduce to previously known results for symmetry resolved entanglement and full counting statistics in some relevant limits, and are confirmed by an exact calculation performed on the N\'eel initial state.</description>

      <title>Partial projected ensembles and spatiotemporal structure of information scrambling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermalisation and information scrambling in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems are deeply intertwined: local subsystems dynamically approach thermal density matrices while their entropies track information spreading. Projected ensembles--ensembles of pure states conditioned on measurement outcomes of complementary subsystems--provide higher-order probes of thermalisation, converging at late times to universal maximum-entropy ensembles. In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a framework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted on projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced on a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement, tracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded outcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the PPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing how scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we demonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs) associated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an experimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs display exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting exponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate these findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics in the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point. We extend our analysis to a many-body localised (MBL) regime numerically, along with analytic results for the $\ell$-bit model. The linear and logarithmic lightcones characteristic of ergodic and MBL regimes emerge naturally from PPE dynamics, establishing it as a powerful tool for probing scrambling and deep thermalisation.</description>

      <title>Scaling of diffusion constants in perturbed easy-axis Heisenberg spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of the integrable spin-1/2 XXZ chain has witnessed substantial progress, due to the development and application of sophisticated analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, infinite-temperature magnetization transport has turned out to range from ballistic, over superdiffusive, to diffusive behavior in different parameter regimes of the anisotropy. Since integrability is rather the exception than the rule, a crucial question is the change of transport under integrability-breaking perturbations. This question includes the stability of superdiffusion at the isotropic point and the change of diffusion constants in the easy-axis regime. In our work, we study this change of diffusion constants by a variety of methods and cover both, linear response theory in the closed system and the Lindblad equation in the open system, where we throughout focus on periodic boundary conditions. In the closed system, we compare results from the recursion method to calculations for finite systems and find evidence for a continuous change of diffusion constants over the full range of perturbation strengths. In the open system weakly coupled to baths, we find diffusion constants in quantitative agreement with the ones in the closed system in a range of nonweak perturbations, but disagreement in the limit of weak perturbations. Using a simple model in this limit, we point out the possibility of a diverging diffusion constant in such an open system.</description>

Abstract: Quantum heat engines have undergone extensive studies over the last two decades. Simultaneously, the studies of the applications of stochastic resetting in various fields are on the rise. We explore the effect of stochastic resetting on the dynamics of a two-level and a three-level quantum heat engine. The extracted work is shown to increase with the resetting rate. The effective efficiency that takes into account the work done due to resetting remains constant. However, if the work done due to resetting is ignored, then the system can incorrectly imply a different behaviour, including the false inference that it is not working as an engine at all. The efficient power is observed to increase beyond that obtained in the absence of resetting, and is shown to be higher for a three-level engine.</description>

      <title>Scaling Properties of Current Fluctuations in Periodic TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study current fluctuations in the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP) on a ring with $N$ sites and $p$ particles. By introducing a deformation parameter $\gamma$, we analyze the tilted operator that governs the statistics of the time-integrated current. Employing the coordinate Bethe ansatz, we derive implicit expressions for the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), i.e. the largest eigenvalue, and the spectral gap, both in terms of Bethe roots. Their asymptotic behaviour is characterized by using the geometric structure of Cassini oval.
  In the thermodynamic limit at fixed particle density, we identify a dynamical phase transition separating fluctuation regimes. For $\gamma&gt;0$, the SCGF exhibits ballistic growth with system size, $\lambda_1 \sim N$. In contrast, for $\gamma&lt;0$, the SCGF converges to $-1$ as $N\to\infty$. This transition is reflected in the spectral gap, which controls the system's relaxation timescale. For $\gamma&gt;0$, the gap closes at polynomial speed, $\Delta \sim N^{-1}$, consistent with rapid relaxation with enhanced current. For $\gamma&lt;0$, the gap vanishes exponentially, $\Delta \sim \exp(-cN)$, signaling metastability with diminished current. Our non-perturbative results provide insights into large deviations and the relaxation dynamics in driven particle systems.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics without Averaging -- a Hard Rods Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the example of the integrable hard rods model we study the quality of the (generalized) hydrodynamic approximation on a single coarse-grained sample. This is opposed to the traditional approach which averages over an appropriate local equilibrium state. While mathematically more ambiguous, a major advantage of the new approach is that it allows us to disentangle intrinsic diffusion from `diffusion from convection' effects. For the hard rods we find intrinsic diffusion is absent, which agrees with and clarifies recent findings. Interestingly, the results also apply to not locally thermal states, demonstrating that hydrodynamics (in this model) does not require the assumption of local equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Absence of nontrivial local conserved quantities in the Hubbard model on the two or higher dimensional hypercubic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By extending the strategy developed by Shiraishi in 2019, we prove that the standard Hubbard model on the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice with $d\ge2$ does not admit any nontrivial local conserved quantities. The theorem strongly suggests that the model is non-integrable. To our knowledge, this is the first extension of Shiraishi's proof of the absence of conserved quantities to a fermionic model. Although our proof follows the original strategy of Shiraishi, it is essentially more subtle compared with the proof by Shiraishi and Tasaki of the corresponding theorem for $S=\tfrac12$ quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions; our proof requires three steps, while that of Shiraishi and Tasaki requires only two steps. It is also necessary to partially determine the conserved quantities of the one-dimensional Hubbard model to accomplish our proof.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhancement of Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium properties of many-body systems with a large number of degrees of freedom are generally expected to be described by statistical mechanics. Such expectations are closely tied to the observation of thermalization, as manifested through equipartition in time-dependent observables, which takes place both in quantum and classical systems but may look very different in comparison. By studying the dynamics of individual lattice site populations in ultracold bosonic gases, we show that the process of relaxation toward equilibrium in a quantum system can be orders of magnitude faster than in its classical counterpart. Classical chaos quantifiers reveal that this is due to a wave packet in a quantum system being able to escape regions of inefficient classical transport by a mechanism akin to tunneling. Since the presented phenomenon takes place in a broad parameter range and persists in weakly disordered systems, we expect that it occurs in a variety of many-body systems and is amenable to direct experimental verification in state-of-the-art quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries II. Coulomb Gas Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24143v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a conformal field theory that arises in the infinite-volume limit of a spin chain with $U_q(sl_2)$ global symmetry. Most operators in the theory are defect-ending operators which allows $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetry transformations to act on them in a consistent way. We use Coulomb gas techniques to construct correlation functions and compute all OPE coefficients of the model, as well as to prove that the properties imposed by the quantum group symmetry are indeed satisfied by the correlation functions. In particular, we treat the non-chiral operators present in the theory. Free boson realization elucidates the origin of the defects attached to the operators. We also comment on the role of quantum group in generalized minimal models.</description>

      <title>An EFT for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets: gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones, and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We build and discuss a low energy effective field theory for anisotropic anti-ferromagnets in presence of an external magnetic field. Such an effective theory is simple yet rich, and features a number of phenomena such as the appearance of gapped Goldstones, pseudo-Goldstones and a "spin flop" phase transition, all within the regime of validity of the theory. We also discuss in detail, the quantization procedure of the free theory in the presence of a magnetic field, which is made non-trivial by the presence of a single-time derivative term. This class of materials make a precious test field for exotic phenomena in quantum field theory. Moreover, we explicitly perform the matching of the effective theory to the short distance theory of a specific anti-ferromagnet, namely, nickel oxide. The latter is particularly relevant in light of recent proposals of employing this material towards the hunt for light dark matter. As a byproduct of our study, we also re-evaluate the role played by discrete symmetries in magnetic materials, presenting it in a way that is completely consistent with the proper low energy EFT ideology.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-giant number fluctuations and nematic order in microswimmer suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Giant number fluctuations (GNFs), whereby the standard deviation $\Delta N$ in the local number of particles $\langle N \rangle$ grows faster than $\sqrt{\langle N \rangle}$, are a hallmark property of dry active matter systems with orientational order, such as a collection of granular particles on a vibrated plate. This contrasts with momentum-conserving ("wet") active matter systems, such as suspensions of swimming bacteria, where no theoretical prediction of GNFs exist, although numerous experimental observations of such enhanced fluctuations have been reported. In this Letter, we numerically confirm the emergence of super-Gaussian number fluctuations in a 3-dimensional suspension of pusher microswimmers undergoing a transition to collective motion. These fluctuations emerge sharply above the transition, but only for sufficiently large values of the bacterial persistence length $\ell_p = v_s / \lambda$, where $v_s$ is the bacterial swimming speed and $\lambda$ the tumbling rate. Crucially, these "pseudo-GNFs" differ from true GNFs, as they only occur on length scales shorter than the typical size $\xi$ of nematic patches in the collective motion state, which is in turn proportional to the single-swimmer persistence length $\ell_p$. Our results thus suggest that observations of enhanced density fluctuations in biological active matter systems actually represent transient effects that decay away beyond mesoscopic length scales, and raises the question to what extent "true" GNFs with universal properties can exist in the presence of fluid flows.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Exceptional Steady States in Dissipative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral degeneracies in Liouvillian generators of dissipative dynamics generically occur as exceptional points, where the corresponding non-Hermitian operator becomes non-diagonalizable. Steady states, i.e. zero-modes of Liouvillians, are considered a fundamental exception to this rule since a no-go theorem excludes non-diagonalizable degeneracies there. Here, we demonstrate that the crucial issue of diverging timescales in dissipative state preparation is largely tantamount to an asymptotic approach towards the forbidden scenario of an exceptional steady state in the thermodynamic limit. With case studies ranging from NP-complete satisfiability problems encoded in a quantum master equation to the dissipative preparation of a symmetry protected topological phase, we reveal the close relation between the computational complexity of the problem at hand, and the finite size scaling towards the exceptional steady state, exemplifying both exponential and polynomial scaling. Formally treating the weight $W$ of quantum jumps in the Lindblad master equation as a parameter, we show that exceptional steady states at the physical value $W=1$ may be understood as a critical point hallmarking the onset of dynamical instability.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</description>
