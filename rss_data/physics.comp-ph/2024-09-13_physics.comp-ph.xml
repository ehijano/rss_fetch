      <title>Logarithmically complex rigorous Fourier space solution to the 1D grating diffraction problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rigorous solution of the grating diffraction problem is a fundamental step in many scientific fields and industrial applications ranging from the study of the fundamental properties of metasurfaces to the simulation of lithography masks. Fourier space methods, such as the Fourier Modal Method, are established tools for the analysis of the electromagnetic properties of periodic structures, but are too computationally demanding to be directly applied to large and multiscale optical structures. This work focuses on pushing the limits of rigorous computations of periodic electromagnetic structures by adapting a powerful tensor compression technique called the tensor train decomposition. We have found that the millions and billions of numbers produced by standard discretization schemes are inherently excessive for storing the information about diffraction problems required for computations with a given accuracy, and we show that a logarithmically growing amount of information is sufficient for reliable rigorous solution of the Maxwell's equations on an example of large period multiscale 1D grating structures.</description>

      <title>Rapid Parameter Estimation for Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) signals pose significant challenges in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy owing to their low-frequency nature and highly complex waveforms, which occupy a high-dimensional parameter space with numerous variables. Given their extended inspiral timescales and low signal-to-noise ratios, EMRI signals warrant prolonged observation periods. Parameter estimation becomes particularly challenging due to non-local parameter degeneracies, arising from multiple local maxima, as well as flat regions and ridges inherent in the likelihood function. These factors lead to exceptionally high time complexity for parameter analysis while employing traditional matched filtering and random sampling methods. To address these challenges, the present study applies machine learning to Bayesian posterior estimation of EMRI signals, leveraging the recently developed flow matching technique based on ODE neural networks. Our approach demonstrates computational efficiency several orders of magnitude faster than the traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, while preserving the unbiasedness of parameter estimation. We show that machine learning technology has the potential to efficiently handle the vast parameter space, involving up to seventeen parameters, associated with EMRI signals. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the first instance of applying machine learning, specifically the Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), to EMRI signal analysis. Our findings highlight the promising potential of machine learning in EMRI waveform analysis, offering new perspectives for the advancement of space-based GW detection and GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>Comment on Room-temperature spontaneous superradiance from single diamond nanocrystals [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper by C. Bradac et al. [Nat. Commun. 8, 1205 (2017)] discusses room-temperature superradiance from NV color centers in diamonds. It presents a new model intended to reflect experimental characteristics of this phenomenon. To validate the model, the authors provide experimental results that are subsequently compared with numerical calculations derived from the scheme. Motivated by our own experiments with the fluorescence of similar NV samples, we attempted to create a theoretical model to accurately describe experimental systems. Initially, we aimed to incorporate the numerical equations from Bradac et al.'s paper's supplement into our own theoretical framework. However, we encountered numerous issues resulting in non-physical results such as negative photon counts or non-zero asymptotic fluorescence intensity. We identified these inconsistencies and proposed amendments to rectify them. We have developed our own framework by correctly reinterpreting the terms of the master equation. The resulting formulas produce physically meaningful results consistent with experimental data.</description>

      <title>When More Data Hurts: Optimizing Data Coverage While Mitigating Diversity Induced Underfitting in an Ultra-Fast Machine-Learned Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are becoming an essential tool in materials modeling. However, optimizing the generation of training data used to parameterize the MLIPs remains a significant challenge. This is because MLIPs can fail when encountering local enviroments too different from those present in the training data. The difficulty of determining \textit{a priori} the environments that will be encountered during molecular dynamics (MD) simulation necessitates diverse, high-quality training data. This study investigates how training data diversity affects the performance of MLIPs using the Ultra-Fast Force Field (UF$^3$) to model amorphous silicon nitride. We employ expert and autonomously generated data to create the training data and fit four force-field variants to subsets of the data. Our findings reveal a critical balance in training data diversity: insufficient diversity hinders generalization, while excessive diversity can exceed the MLIP's learning capacity, reducing simulation accuracy. Specifically, we found that the UF$^3$ variant trained on a subset of the training data, in which nitrogen-rich structures were removed, offered vastly better prediction and simulation accuracy than any other variant. By comparing these UF$^3$ variants, we highlight the nuanced requirements for creating accurate MLIPs, emphasizing the importance of application-specific training data to achieve optimal performance in modeling complex material behaviors.</description>

      <title>Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number, while the inclusion of surrounding coarse element neighbors was found to improve predictions at Re=1600, but not at Re=3200.</description>

      <title>Non-universality of aging during phase separation of the two-dimensional long-range Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the aging properties of phase-separation kinetics following quenches from $T=\infty$ to a finite temperature below $T_c$ of the paradigmatic two-dimensional conserved Ising model with power-law decaying long-range interactions $\sim r^{-(2 + \sigma)}$. Physical aging with a power-law decay of the two-time autocorrelation function $C(t,t_w)\sim \left(t/t_w\right)^{-\lambda/z}$ is observed, displaying a complex dependence of the autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$ on $\sigma$. A value of $\lambda=3.500(26)$ for the corresponding nearest-neighbor model (which is recovered as the $\sigma \rightarrow \infty$ limes) is determined. The values of $\lambda$ in the long-range regime ($\sigma &lt; 1$) are all compatible with $\lambda \approx 4$. In between, a continuous crossover is visible for $1 \lesssim \sigma \lesssim 2$ with non-universal, $\sigma$-dependent values of $\lambda$. The performed Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations are primarily enabled by our novel algorithm for long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <title>AI-accelerated discovery of high critical temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new superconducting materials, particularly those exhibiting high critical temperature ($T_c$), has been a vibrant area of study within the field of condensed matter physics. Conventional approaches primarily rely on physical intuition to search for potential superconductors within the existing databases. However, the known materials only scratch the surface of the extensive array of possibilities within the realm of materials. Here, we develop an AI search engine that integrates deep model pre-training and fine-tuning techniques, diffusion models, and physics-based approaches (e.g., first-principles electronic structure calculation) for discovery of high-$T_c$ superconductors. Utilizing this AI search engine, we have obtained 74 dynamically stable materials with critical temperatures predicted by the AI model to be $T_c \geq$ 15 K based on a very small set of samples. Notably, these materials are not contained in any existing dataset. Furthermore, we analyze trends in our dataset and individual materials including B$_4$CN$_3$ and B$_5$CN$_2$ whose $T_c$s are 24.08 K and 15.93 K, respectively. We demonstrate that AI technique can discover a set of new high-$T_c$ superconductors, outline its potential for accelerating discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</description>

      <title>Digital twin of a large-aspect-ratio Rayleigh-B\'enard experiment: Role of thermal boundary conditions, measurement errors and uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Albeit laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have proven themselves successful in enhancing our understanding of long-living large-scale flow structures in horizontally extended Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, some discrepancies with respect to their size and induced heat transfer remain. This study traces these discrepancies back to their origins. We start by generating a digital twin of one standard experimental set-up. This twin is subsequently simplified in steps to understand the effect of non-ideal thermal boundary conditions, and the experimental measurement procedure is mimicked using numerical data. Although this allows explaining the increased observed size of the flow structures in the experiment relative to past numerical simulations, our data suggests that the vertical velocity magnitude has been underestimated in the experiments. A subsequent re-assessment of the latter's original data reveals an incorrect calibration model. The re-processed data show a relative increase in $u_{z}$ of roughly $24 \%$, resolving the previously observed discrepancies. This digital twin of a laboratory experiment for thermal convection at Rayleigh numbers $\Ra = \left\{ 2, 4, 7 \right\} \times 10^{5}$, a Prandtl number $\Pr = 7.1$, and an aspect ratio $\Gamma = 25$ highlights the role of different thermal boundary conditions as well as a reliable calibration and measurement procedure.</description>

      <title>Optimized effective potential forces with the plane-wave and pseudopotential method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimized effective potential (OEP) approach has so far mainly been used in benchmark studies and for the evaluation of band gaps. In this work, we extend the application of the OEP by determining the analytical ionic forces within the plane-wave and pseudopotential framework. It is first shown that, due to the constrained optimization inherent to the OEP approach, an extra term needs to be added to the standard Hellmann-Feynman expression for the forces, whenever nonlocal pseudopotentials are employed. Computing this term for functionals based on Hartree-Fock and the hybrid PBE0 functional yields forces with excellent numerical accuracy. Furthermore, results for equilibrium geometries and vibrational frequencies on a set of molecules and solids confirm that the local exchange OEP is able to reproduce results obtained with the nonlocal exchange potential. Our work opens up the possibility to study lattice dynamics using advanced orbital functionals for describing exchange and correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Tuning collective actuation of active solids by optimizing activity localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active solids, more specifically elastic lattices embedded with polar active units, exhibit collective actuation when the elasto-active feedback, generically present in such systems, exceeds some critical value. The dynamics then condensates on a small fraction of the vibrational modes, the selection of which obeys non trivial rules rooted in the nonlinear part of the dynamics. So far the complexity of the selection mechanism has limited the design of specific actuation. Here we investigate numerically how, localizing the activity on a fraction of modes, one can select non-trivial collective actuation. We perform numerical simulations of an agent based model on triangular and disordered lattices and vary the concentration and the localization of the active agents on the lattices nodes. Both contribute to the distribution of the elastic energy across the modes. We then introduce an algorithm, which, for a given fraction of active nodes, evolves the localization of the activity in such a way that the energy distribution on a few targeted modes is maximized -- or minimized. We illustrate on a specific targeted actuation, how the algorithm performs as compared to manually chosen localization of the activity. While, in the case of the ordered lattice, a well educated guess performs better than the algorithm, the latter outperform the manual trials in the case of the disordered lattice. Finally, the analysis of the results in the case of the ordered lattice leads us to introduce a design principle based on a measure of the susceptibility of the modes to be activated along certain activation paths.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dingerNet: A Universal Neural Network Solver for The Schr\"{o}dinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have facilitated numerically accurate solution of the electronic Schr\"{o}dingerNet equation (SE) by integrating various neural network (NN)-based wavefunction ansatzes with variational Monte Carlo methods. Nevertheless, such NN-based methods are all based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA) and require a separate and computationally expensive training for each nuclear configuration. In this work, we propose a novel NN architecture, Schr\"{o}dingerNet, to solve the full electronic-nuclear SE by defining a loss function designed to equalize local energies across the system. This approach is based on a rotationally invariant total wavefunction ansatz that includes both nuclear and electronic coordinates. This strategy allows for an efficient and accurate generation of a continuous potential energy surface at any geometry within the well-sampled nuclear configuration space, and also incorporates non-BO corrections, through a single training process. Comparison with benchmarks of atomic and molecular systems demonstrates its accuracy and efficiency</description>

      <title>Anti-correlation between excitations and locally-favored structures in glass-forming systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamics that are microscopic in space and time, in which particles commit to a position, so-called excitations, are considered the elementary unit of relaxation in the Dynamic Facilitation (DF) theory of the glass transition. Meanwhile, geometric motifs known as locally favored structures (LFS) are associated with vitrification in many glassformers. Recent work indicates that the probability of particles found both in locally favored structures (LFS) and excitations decreases significantly upon supercooling suggesting that there is an anti-correlation between them [Ortlieb et al, Nature Commun. 14, 2621 (2023)]. However, the spatial relationship between excitations and LFS remains unclear. By employing state-of-the-art GPU computer simulations and colloid experiments, we analyze this relationship between LFS and excitations in model glassformers. We demonstrate that there is a spatial separation between the two in deeply supercooled liquids. This may be due to the fact that LFS are well-packed, thus they are relatively stable.</description>

      <title>Quantum Natural Gradient with Geodesic Corrections for Small Shallow Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG) method enhances optimization in variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) by incorporating geometric insights from the quantum state space through the Fubini-Study metric. In this work, we extend QNG by introducing higher-order integrators and geodesic corrections using the Riemannian Euler update rule and geodesic equations, deriving an updated rule for the Quantum Natural Gradient with Geodesic Correction (QNGGC). We also develop an efficient method for computing the Christoffel symbols necessary for these corrections, leveraging the parameter-shift rule to enable direct measurement from quantum circuits. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, we demonstrate that QNGGC significantly improves convergence rates over standard QNG, highlighting the benefits of integrating geodesic corrections into quantum optimization processes. Our approach paves the way for more efficient quantum algorithms, leveraging the advantages of geometric methods.</description>

Abstract: A standard task in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the computation of localized molecular orbits known as Wannier functions. In this manuscript, we propose a new procedure for computing Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline materials. Our approach proceeds by first performing parallel transport of the Bloch functions using numerical integration. Then, using novel analysis, we show that a simple correction can be analytically computed that yields the optimally localized Wannier function. The resulting scheme is robust and capable of achieving high-order accuracy. We illustrate this in a number of numerical experiments.</description>
