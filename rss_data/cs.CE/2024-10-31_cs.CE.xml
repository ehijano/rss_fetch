      <title>An eikonal model with re-excitability for fast simulations in cardiac electrophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision cardiology based on cardiac digital twins requires accurate simulations of cardiac arrhythmias. However, detailed models, such as the monodomain model, are computationally costly and have limited applicability in practice. Thus, it desirable to have fast models that can still represent the main physiological features presented during cardiac arrhythmias. The eikonal model is an approximation of the monodomain model that is widely used to describe the arrival times of the electrical wave. However, the standard eikonal model does not generalize to the complex re-entrant dynamics that characterize the cardiac arrhythmias. In this work, we propose an eikonal model that includes the tissue re-excitability, which allows to describe re-entries. The re-excitability properties are inferred from the monodomain model. Our eikonal model also handles the tissue anisotropy and heterogeneity. We compare the eikonal model to the monodomain model in various numerical experiments in the atria and the ventricles. The eikonal model is qualitatively accurate in the simulation of re-entries and can be potentially ran in real-time, opening the door to its clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Alternative Data for Credit Underwriting Using Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22382v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alternative data provides valuable insights for lenders to evaluate a borrower's creditworthiness, which could help expand credit access to underserved groups and lower costs for borrowers. But some forms of alternative data have historically been excluded from credit underwriting because it could act as an illegal proxy for a protected class like race or gender, causing redlining. We propose a method for applying causal inference to a supervised machine learning model to debias alternative data so that it might be used for credit underwriting. We demonstrate how our algorithm can be used against a public credit dataset to improve model accuracy across different racial groups, while providing theoretically robust nondiscrimination guarantees.</description>

      <title>Property Estimation in Geotechnical Databases Using Labeled Random Finite Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sufficiency of accurate data is a core element in data-centric geotechnics. However, geotechnical datasets are essentially uncertain, whereupon engineers have difficulty with obtaining precise information for making decisions. This challenge is more apparent when the performance of data-driven technologies solely relies on imperfect databases or even when it is sometimes difficult to investigate sites physically. This paper introduces geotechnical property estimation from noisy and incomplete data within the labeled random finite set (LRFS) framework. We leverage the ability of the generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) filter, a fundamental solution for multi-object estimation, to deal with measurement uncertainties from a Bayesian perspective. In particular, this work focuses on the similarity between LRFSs and big indirect data (BID) in geotechnics as those characteristics resemble each other, which enables GLMB filtering to be exploited potentially for data-centric geotechnical engineering. Experiments for numerical study are conducted to evaluate the proposed method using a public clay database.</description>

      <title>Solving Differential Equations with Constrained Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Partial) differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental tools for describing natural phenomena, making their solution crucial in science and engineering. While traditional methods, such as the finite element method, provide reliable solutions, their accuracy is often tied to the use of computationally intensive fine meshes. Moreover, they do not naturally account for measurements or prior solutions, and any change in the problem parameters requires results to be fully recomputed. Neural network-based approaches, such as physics-informed neural networks and neural operators, offer a mesh-free alternative by directly fitting those models to the PDE solution. They can also integrate prior knowledge and tackle entire families of PDEs by simply aggregating additional training losses. Nevertheless, they are highly sensitive to hyperparameters such as collocation points and the weights associated with each loss. This paper addresses these challenges by developing a science-constrained learning (SCL) framework. It demonstrates that finding a (weak) solution of a PDE is equivalent to solving a constrained learning problem with worst-case losses. This explains the limitations of previous methods that minimize the expected value of aggregated losses. SCL also organically integrates structural constraints (e.g., invariances) and (partial) measurements or known solutions. The resulting constrained learning problems can be tackled using a practical algorithm that yields accurate solutions across a variety of PDEs, neural network architectures, and prior knowledge levels without extensive hyperparameter tuning and sometimes even at a lower computational cost.</description>

      <title>Towards Full Automation of Geometry Extraction for Biomechanical Analysis of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; Neural Network-Based versus Classical Methodologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the impact of image segmentation methods on the results of stress computation in the wall of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). We compared wall stress distributions and magnitudes calculated from geometry models obtained from classical semi-automated segmentation versus automated neural network-based segmentation. 16 different AAA contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images were semi-automatically segmented by an analyst, taking between 15 and 40 minutes of human effort per patient, depending on image quality. The same images were automatically segmented using PRAEVAorta commercial software by NUREA (https://www.nurea-soft.com/), developed based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, and automatically post-processed with an in-house MATLAB code, requiring only 1-2 minutes of computer time per patient. Aneurysm wall stress calculations, automatically performed using the BioPARR software (https://bioparr.mech.uwa.edu.au/), revealed that, compared to the classical semi-automated segmentation, the automatic neural network-based segmentation leads to equivalent stress distributions, and slightly higher peak and 99th percentile maximum principal stress values. This difference is due to consistently larger lumen surface areas in automatically segmented models as compared to classical semi-automated segmentations, resulting in greater total pressure load on the wall. However, our statistical analysis indicated that the differences in AAA wall stress obtained using the two segmentation methods are not statistically significant and fall within the typical range of inter-analyst and intra-analyst variability, justifying the use of AI-based automatic segmentation in a fully automated AAA stress computation pipeline.</description>

      <title>Fusion of Movement and Naive Predictions for Point Forecasting in Univariate Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14469v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point forecasting in univariate random walks is an important yet challenging research topic. Many attempts at this task often fail to surpass the na\"ive baseline because of the randomness of the data and the improper utilization of exogenous variables as features. In view of the limitations of existing random walk forecasting methods, this study introduces a variant definition of random walks, proposing that point forecasting can be improved beyond the na\"ive baseline through the fusion of movement and na\"ive predictions (FMNP). FMNP naturally bridges movement prediction and point forecasting. It employs an exogenous variable to provide a consistent movement prediction for the target variable and uses a linear regression to combine movement and na\"ive predictions. In forecasting five financial time series in the U.S. market with the FTSE opening price as the exogenous variable, FMNP consistently outperforms na\"ive baselines and is superior to baseline models such as ARIMA, MA, MLP, DNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM. FMNP is particularly advantageous when accurate point predictions are challenging but accurate movement predictions are attainable, translating movement predictions into point forecasts in random walk contexts.</description>

      <title>Fair Interest Rates Are Impossible for Lending Pools: Results from Options Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency lending pools are services that allow lenders to pool together assets in one cryptocurrency and loan it out to borrowers who provide collateral worth more (than the loan) in a separate cryptocurrency. Borrowers can repay their loans to reclaim their collateral unless their loan was liquidated, which happens when the value of the collateral dips significantly. Interest rates for these pools are currently set via supply and demand heuristics, which have several downsides, including inefficiency, inflexibility, and being vulnerable to manipulation. Here, we reduce lending pools to options, and then use ideas from options pricing to search for fair interest rates for lending pools. In a simplified model where the loans have a fixed duration and can only be repaid at the end of the term, we obtain analytical pricing results. We then consider a more realistic model, where loans can be repaid dynamically and without expiry. Our main theoretical contribution is to show that fair interest rates do not exist in this setting. We then show that impossibility results generalize even to models of lending pools which have no obvious reduction to options. To address these negative results, we introduce a model of lending pools with fixed fees, and model the ability of borrowers to top-up their loans to reduce the risk of liquidation. As a proof of concept, we use simulations to show how our model's predicted interest rates compare to interest rates in practice.</description>

      <title>History-Matching of Imbibition Flow in Multiscale Fractured Porous Media Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a workflow based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to model multiphase fluid flow in fractured porous media. After validating the workflow in forward and inverse modeling of a synthetic problem of flow in fractured porous media, we applied it to a real experimental dataset in which brine is injected at a constant pressure drop into a CO2 saturated naturally fractured shale core plug. The exact spatial positions of natural fractures and the dynamic in-situ distribution of fluids were imaged using a CT-scan setup. To model the targeted system, we followed a domain decomposition approach for matrix and fractures and a multi-network architecture for the separate calculation of water saturation and pressure. The flow equations in the matrix, fractures and interplay between them were solved during training. Prior to fully-coupled simulations, we proposed pre-training the model. This aided in a more efficient and successful training of the coupled system. Both for the synthetic and experimental inverse problems, we determined flow parameters within the matrix and the fractures. Multiple random initializations of network and system parameters were performed to assess the uncertainty and uniqueness of the results. The results confirmed the precision of the inverse calculated parameters in retrieving the main flow characteristics of the system. The consideration of multiscale matrix-fracture impacts is commonly overlooked in existing workflows. Accounting for them led to several orders of magnitude variations in the calculated flow properties compared to not accounting for them. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed PINNs-based workflow is the first to offer a reliable and computationally efficient solution for inverse modeling of multiphase flow in fractured porous media, achieved through history-matching noisy and multi-fidelity experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Derivative-enhanced Deep Operator Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deep operator networks (DeepONet), a class of neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces, have recently been developed as surrogate models for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work we propose a derivative-enhanced deep operator network (DE-DeepONet), which leverages derivative information to enhance the solution prediction accuracy and provides a more accurate approximation of solution-to-parameter derivatives, especially when training data are limited. DE-DeepONet explicitly incorporates linear dimension reduction of high dimensional parameter input into DeepONet to reduce training cost and adds derivative loss in the loss function to reduce the number of required parameter-solution pairs. We further demonstrate that the use of derivative loss can be extended to enhance other neural operators, such as the Fourier neural operator (FNO). Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Mesh Movement Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) accurately and efficiently is an essential and challenging problem in all scientific and engineering disciplines. Mesh movement methods provide the capability to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall mesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods are extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary geometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from scratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their applicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of inverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive, zero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and structures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary geometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting features and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh. We evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well as a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method outperforms existing learning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described above. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Amp\`ere PDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh movement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method fails.

      <title>A Generalized Framework for Multiscale State-Space Modeling with Nested Nonlinear Dynamics: An Application to Bayesian Learning under Switching Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a generalized framework for multiscale state-space modeling that incorporates nested nonlinear dynamics, with a specific focus on Bayesian learning under switching regimes. Our framework captures the complex interactions between fast and slow processes within systems, allowing for the analysis of how these dynamics influence each other across various temporal scales. We model these interactions through a hierarchical structure in which finer time-scale dynamics are nested within coarser ones, while facilitating feedback between the scales. To promote the practical application of our framework, we address the problem of identifying switching regimes and transient dynamics. In particular, we develop a Bayesian learning approach to estimate latent states and indicators corresponding to switching dynamics, enabling the model to adapt effectively to regime changes. We employ Sequential Monte Carlo, or particle filtering, for inference. We illustrate the utility of our framework through simulations. The results demonstrate that our Bayesian learning approach effectively tracks state transitions and achieves accurate identification of switching dynamics in multiscale systems.</description>
