      <title>Optomagnetism with plasmonic skyrmion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research at the frontier between optics and magnetism is revealing a wealth of innovative phenomena and avenues of exploration. Optical waves are demonstrating the capacity to induce ultrafast magnetism, while optical analogs of magnetic states, such as magnetic skyrmions, offer the prospect of novel spin-optical states. In this paper, we strengthen the synergy between light and magnetism by exploring the ability of plasmonic Neel skyrmions to create a stationary magnetic field within a thin gold film. We show that, when generated using a focused radially-polarized vortex beam, a plasmonic Neel skyrmion emerges as an optimum for inducing optomagnetism in a thin gold film. Optical skyrmions offer new degrees of freedom for enhancing and controlling optomagnetism in plasmonic nanostructures, with direct application in all-optical magnetization switching, magnetic recording, and the excitation of spin waves.</description>

      <title>Robust incoherent perfect absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coherent perfect absorber is capable of completely absorbing input waves. However, the coherent perfect absorption severely depends on the superposition of the input waves, and the perfect absorption is sensitive to the disorder of the absorber. Thus, a robust incoherent perfect absorption, being insensitive to the superposition of input waves and the system disorder, is desirable for practical applications. Here, we demonstrate that the linearly independent destructive interference at the port connections removes the constraint on the coherent input. We propose an approach using the interplay between the loss and localization to form the incoherent perfect absorption. The resonant incidence from either port is completely absorbed. Furthermore, we utilize the lattice configuration supporting the flat band to demonstrate the disorder-immune incoherent perfect absorption. Our findings provide insight into the fundamentals and applications for the perfect absorption of light, microwaves, sound, mechanical waves, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Coherent Perfect Absorption of Arbitrary Wavefronts at an Exceptional Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Coherent Perfect Absorber (CPA) exploits the interferometric nature of light to deposit all of a light field's incident energy into an otherwise weakly absorbing sample. The downside of this concept is that the necessary destructive interference in CPAs gets easily destroyed both by spectrally or spatially detuning the incoming light field. Each of these two limitations has recently been overcome by insights from exceptional-point physics and by using a degenerate cavity, respectively. Here, we show how these two concepts can be combined into a new type of cavity design, which allows broadband exceptional-point absorption of arbitrary wavefronts. We present two possible implementations of such a Massively Degenerate Exceptional-Point absorber and compare analytical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Scaling of quantum Fisher information for quantum exceptional point sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in utilizing the divergence of spectrum response rate at the exceptional point (EP) for sensing in classical systems, while the use and characterization of quantum EPs for sensing have been largely unexplored. For a quantum EP sensor, an important issue is the relation between the order of the quantum EP and the scaling of quantum Fisher information (QFI), an essential quantity for characterizing quantum sensors. Here we investigate multi-mode quadratic bosonic systems, which exhibit higher-order EP dynamics, but possess Hermitian Hamiltonians without Langevin noise, thus can be utilized for quantum sensing. We derive an exact analytic formula for the QFI, from which we establish a scaling relation between the QFI and the order of the EP. We apply the formula to study a three-mode EP sensor and a multi-mode bosonic Kitaev chain and show that the EP physics can significantly enhance the sensing sensitivity. Our work establishes the connection between two important fields: non-Hermitian EP dynamics and quantum sensing, and may find important applications in quantum information and quantum non-Hermitian physics.</description>

Abstract: The combination of an in-plane honeycomb potential and of a photonic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) emulates a photonic/polaritonic analog of bilayer graphene. We show that modulating the SOC magnitude allows to change the overall lattice periodicity, emulating any type of moir\'e-arranged bilayer graphene with a unique all-optical access to the moir\'e band topology. We show that breaking the time-reversal symmetry by an effective exciton-polariton Zeeman splitting opens a large topological gap in the array of moir\'e flat bands. This gap contains one-way topological edge states whose constant group velocity makes an increasingly sharp contrast with the flattening moir\'e bands.</description>

      <title>Effect on spectral purity due to on-chip temporal manipulation of the pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic Integrated Circuits (PIC)s are a promising contender for quantum information technologies. The spectral purity of photons is one of the key attributes of PIC photon-pair sources. The dual-pulse pump manipulation technique [1] showed &gt;99% purity in ring-resonator photon-pair sources. Here, we have developed a PIC to shape a pulse into dual, triple and quadruple pulses and investigated the effect of these pump pulse configurations on the purity. Our results show that more complex configurations over dual-pulse do not result in comparatively higher purity but allow accurate control over choosing arbitrary values of the purity.</description>

      <title>Algebraic localization-delocalization phase transition in moving potential wells on a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The localization and scattering properties of potential wells or barriers uniformly moving on a lattice are strongly dependent on the drift velocity owing to violation of the Galilean invariance of the discrete Schr\"odinger equation. Here a type of localization-delocalization phase transition of algebraic type is unravelled, which does not require any kind of disorder and arises when a power-law potential well drifts fast on a lattice. While for an algebraic exponent $\alpha$ lower than the critical value $\alpha_c=1$ dynamical delocalization is observed, for $\alpha&gt; \alpha_c$ asymptotic localization, corresponding to an asymptotic frozen dynamics, is instead realized. At the critical phase transition point $\alpha_=\alpha_c=1$ an oscillatory dynamics is found, corresponding to Bloch oscillations. An experimentally-accessible photonic platform for the observation of the predicted algebraic phase transition, based on light dynamics in synthetic mesh lattices, is suggested.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Rabi Oscillations in High Harmonic Generation Resonantly Driven by Extreme Ultraviolet Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation driven by intense extreme ultraviolet (EUV) fields merges quantum optics and attosecond science, giving rise to an appealing route for the generation of coherent EUV and soft X-ray light for high-resolution imaging and spectroscopies. We theoretically investigate ultrafast resonant dynamics during the interaction of He atoms with strong extreme ultraviolet pulses. At high driving intensities, we identify record fast attosecond Rabi oscillations imprinting observable signatures in the high harmonic spectrum. At field strengths suppressing the Coulomb potential barrier for all the bounded states, we demonstrate the survival of the attosecond two-level dynamics for several Rabi cycles. Consequently, this intense EUV laser-atom interaction reveals a new strong-field scenario where the resonant coupling of two-level bound-bound transitions prevails, contrasting with the dominance of bound-continuum transitions in the conventional strong-field infrared regimes. These findings set an interesting perspective for extreme attosecond nonlinear optics with intense short-wavelength fields.</description>

      <title>Structured free-space optical fields for transverse and longitudinal control of electron matter waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling free-electron momentum states is of high interest in electron microscopy to achieve momentum and energy resolved probing and manipulation of physical systems. Free-electron and light interactions have emerged as a powerful technique to accomplish this. Here, we demonstrate both longitudinal and transverse phase control of a slow electron wavepacket by extending the Kapitza-Dirac effect to spatially-structured pulsed laser beams. This extension enables both inelastic and elastic stimulated Compton scattering. The interaction reveals the formation of distinct electron transverse momentum orders, each demonstrating a comb-like electron energy spectrum. By exerting complete control over light parameters, including wavelength, field intensity, pulse duration, and spatial mode order, as well as their combinations, it is possible to coherently control the population of these electron energy-momentum states that are separated by a few meV energy and multiple photon momentum orders. This free-space electron-light interaction phenomenon possesses the capability to coherently control the energy and momentum of electron beams in electron microscopes. Moreover, it has the potential to facilitate the selective probing of various material excitations, including plasmons, excitons, and phonons, and performing Talbot-Lau matter-wave interferometry with transversely shaped electron beams.</description>

      <title>Soliton formation in an exciton-polariton condensate at a bound state in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) are of special interest in photonics due to their theoretically infinite radiative lifetime. Here, we design a structure composed of a GaN layer with guided exciton-polaritons and a TiO$_2$ 1D photonic crystal slab. The photonic BIC hosted by the photonic crystal slab couples with the excitons of GaN to form a polaritonic BIC with a negative mass. This allows condensation to be reached with a low threshold in a structure suitable for electrical injection, paving the way for room-temperature polariton microdevices. We study in detail how the repulsive interaction between exciton-polaritons affects the condensate distribution in reciprocal space and, consequently, the condensate's overlap with the BIC resonance and, therefore, the condensate lifetime. We study an intrinsic contribution related to the formation of a bright soliton and the extrinsic contribution related to the interaction with an excitonic reservoir induced by spatially focused non-resonant pumping. We then study the peculiar dynamics of the condensation process in a BIC state for interacting particles using Boltzmann equations and hybrid Boltzmann-Gross Pitaevskii equations. We find optimal conditions allowing one to benefit from the long lifetime of the BIC for polariton condensation in a real structure.</description>
