      <title>Utilizing Motion Matching with Deep Reinforcement Learning for Target Location Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to directly generate motion matching queries for long-term tasks, particularly targeting the reaching of specific locations. By integrating motion matching and DRL, our method demonstrates the rapid learning of policies for target location tasks within minutes on a standard desktop, employing a simple reward design. Additionally, we propose a unique hit reward and obstacle curriculum scheme to enhance policy learning in environments with moving obstacles.</description>

      <title>Attention is all you need for boosting graph convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) possess strong capabilities for processing graph data in non-grid domains. They can capture the topological logical structure and node features in graphs and integrate them into nodes' final representations. GCNs have been extensively studied in various fields, such as recommendation systems, social networks, and protein molecular structures. With the increasing application of graph neural networks, research has focused on improving their performance while compressing their size. In this work, a plug-in module named Graph Knowledge Enhancement and Distillation Module (GKEDM) is proposed. GKEDM can enhance node representations and improve the performance of GCNs by extracting and aggregating graph information via multi-head attention mechanism. Furthermore, GKEDM can serve as an auxiliary transferor for knowledge distillation. With a specially designed attention distillation method, GKEDM can distill the knowledge of large teacher models into high-performance and compact student models. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GKEDM can significantly improve the performance of various GCNs with minimal overhead. Furthermore, it can efficiently transfer distilled knowledge from large teacher networks to small student networks via attention distillation.</description>

      <title>Learning to Infer Generative Template Programs for Visual Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People grasp flexible visual concepts from a few examples. We explore a neurosymbolic system that learns how to infer programs that capture visual concepts in a domain-general fashion. We introduce Template Programs: programmatic expressions from a domain-specific language that specify structural and parametric patterns common to an input concept. Our framework supports multiple concept-related tasks, including few-shot generation and co-segmentation through parsing. We develop a learning paradigm that allows us to train networks that infer Template Programs directly from visual datasets that contain concept groupings. We run experiments across multiple visual domains: 2D layouts, Omniglot characters, and 3D shapes. We find that our method outperforms task-specific alternatives, and performs competitively against domain-specific approaches for the limited domains where they exist.</description>

      <title>A Unified Module for Accelerating STABLE-DIFFUSION: LCM-LORA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the unified module for accelerating stable-diffusion processes, specifically focusing on the lcm-lora module. Stable-diffusion processes play a crucial role in various scientific and engineering domains, and their acceleration is of paramount importance for efficient computational performance. The standard iterative procedures for solving fixed-source discrete ordinates problems often exhibit slow convergence, particularly in optically thick scenarios. To address this challenge, unconditionally stable diffusion-acceleration methods have been developed, aiming to enhance the computational efficiency of transport equations and discrete ordinates problems. This study delves into the theoretical foundations and numerical results of unconditionally stable diffusion synthetic acceleration methods, providing insights into their stability and performance for model discrete ordinates problems. Furthermore, the paper explores recent advancements in diffusion model acceleration, including on device acceleration of large diffusion models via gpu aware optimizations, highlighting the potential for significantly improved inference latency. The results and analyses in this study provide important insights into stable diffusion processes and have important ramifications for the creation and application of acceleration methods specifically, the lcm-lora module in a variety of computing environments.</description>

      <title>Frankenstein: Generating Semantic-Compositional 3D Scenes in One Tri-Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Frankenstein, a diffusion-based framework that can generate semantic-compositional 3D scenes in a single pass. Unlike existing methods that output a single, unified 3D shape, Frankenstein simultaneously generates multiple separated shapes, each corresponding to a semantically meaningful part. The 3D scene information is encoded in one single tri-plane tensor, from which multiple Singed Distance Function (SDF) fields can be decoded to represent the compositional shapes. During training, an auto-encoder compresses tri-planes into a latent space, and then the denoising diffusion process is employed to approximate the distribution of the compositional scenes. Frankenstein demonstrates promising results in generating room interiors as well as human avatars with automatically separated parts. The generated scenes facilitate many downstream applications, such as part-wise re-texturing, object rearrangement in the room or avatar cloth re-targeting.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Visual Analysis of Blood Flow in Stenoses Using Morphological Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) enabled the simulation of intricate transport processes, including flow in physiological structures, such as blood vessels. While these so-called hemodynamic simulations offer groundbreaking opportunities to solve problems at the clinical forefront, a successful translation of CFD to clinical decision-making is challenging. Hemodynamic simulations are intrinsically complex, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, which conflicts with the time-sensitive nature of clinical workflows and the fact that hospitals usually do not have the necessary resources or infrastructure to support CFD simulations. To address these transfer challenges, we propose a novel visualization system which enables instant flow exploration without performing on-site simulation. To gain insights into the viability of the approach, we focus on hemodynamic simulations of the carotid bifurcation, which is a highly relevant arterial subtree in stroke diagnostics and prevention. We created an initial database of 120 high-resolution carotid bifurcation flow models and developed a set of similarity metrics used to place a new carotid surface model into a neighborhood of simulated cases with the highest geometric similarity. The neighborhood can be immediately explored and the flow fields analyzed. We found that if the artery models are similar enough in the regions of interest, a new simulation leads to coinciding results, allowing the user to circumvent individual flow simulations. We conclude that similarity-based visual analysis is a promising approach toward the usability of CFD in medical practice.</description>

      <title>INPC: Implicit Neural Point Clouds for Radiance Field Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for reconstruction and novel-view synthesis of unbounded real-world scenes. In contrast to previous methods using either volumetric fields, grid-based models, or discrete point cloud proxies, we propose a hybrid scene representation, which implicitly encodes a point cloud in a continuous octree-based probability field and a multi-resolution hash grid. In doing so, we combine the benefits of both worlds by retaining favorable behavior during optimization: Our novel implicit point cloud representation and differentiable bilinear rasterizer enable fast rendering while preserving fine geometric detail without depending on initial priors like structure-from-motion point clouds. Our method achieves state-of-the-art image quality on several common benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we achieve fast inference at interactive frame rates, and can extract explicit point clouds to further enhance performance.</description>

      <title>Be Yourself: Bounded Attention for Multi-Subject Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have an unprecedented ability to generate diverse and high-quality images. However, they often struggle to faithfully capture the intended semantics of complex input prompts that include multiple subjects. Recently, numerous layout-to-image extensions have been introduced to improve user control, aiming to localize subjects represented by specific tokens. Yet, these methods often produce semantically inaccurate images, especially when dealing with multiple semantically or visually similar subjects. In this work, we study and analyze the causes of these limitations. Our exploration reveals that the primary issue stems from inadvertent semantic leakage between subjects in the denoising process. This leakage is attributed to the diffusion model's attention layers, which tend to blend the visual features of different subjects. To address these issues, we introduce Bounded Attention, a training-free method for bounding the information flow in the sampling process. Bounded Attention prevents detrimental leakage among subjects and enables guiding the generation to promote each subject's individuality, even with complex multi-subject conditioning. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our method empowers the generation of multiple subjects that better align with given prompts and layouts.</description>

      <title>Deep Point Cloud Normal Estimation via Triplet Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Normal estimation on 3D point clouds is a fundamental problem in 3D vision and graphics. Current methods often show limited accuracy in predicting normals at sharp features (e.g., edges and corners) and less robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel normal estimation method for point clouds. It consists of two phases: (a) feature encoding which learns representations of local patches, and (b) normal estimation that takes the learned representation as input and regresses the normal vector. We are motivated that local patches on isotropic and anisotropic surfaces have similar or distinct normals, and that separable features or representations can be learned to facilitate normal estimation. To realise this, we first construct triplets of local patches on 3D point cloud data, and design a triplet network with a triplet loss for feature encoding. We then design a simple network with several MLPs and a loss function to regress the normal vector. Despite having a smaller network size compared to most other methods, experimental results show that our method preserves sharp features and achieves better normal estimation results on CAD-like shapes.</description>

      <title>NeuS-PIR: Learning Relightable Neural Surface using Pre-Integrated Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method, namely NeuS-PIR, for recovering relightable neural surfaces using pre-integrated rendering from multi-view images or video. Unlike methods based on NeRF and discrete meshes, our method utilizes implicit neural surface representation to reconstruct high-quality geometry, which facilitates the factorization of the radiance field into two components: a spatially varying material field and an all-frequency lighting representation. This factorization, jointly optimized using an adapted differentiable pre-integrated rendering framework with material encoding regularization, in turn addresses the ambiguity of geometry reconstruction and leads to better disentanglement and refinement of each scene property. Additionally, we introduced a method to distil indirect illumination fields from the learned representations, further recovering the complex illumination effect like inter-reflection. Consequently, our method enables advanced applications such as relighting, which can be seamlessly integrated with modern graphics engines. Qualitative and quantitative experiments have shown that NeuS-PIR outperforms existing methods across various tasks on both synthetic and real datasets.

      <title>MAS: Multi-view Ancestral Sampling for 3D motion generation using 2D diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Multi-view Ancestral Sampling (MAS), a method for 3D motion generation, using 2D diffusion models that were trained on motions obtained from in-the-wild videos. As such, MAS opens opportunities to exciting and diverse fields of motion previously under-explored as 3D data is scarce and hard to collect. MAS works by simultaneously denoising multiple 2D motion sequences representing different views of the same 3D motion. It ensures consistency across all views at each diffusion step by combining the individual generations into a unified 3D sequence, and projecting it back to the original views. We demonstrate MAS on 2D pose data acquired from videos depicting professional basketball maneuvers, rhythmic gymnastic performances featuring a ball apparatus, and horse races. In each of these domains, 3D motion capture is arduous, and yet, MAS generates diverse and realistic 3D sequences. Unlike the Score Distillation approach, which optimizes each sample by repeatedly applying small fixes, our method uses a sampling process that was constructed for the diffusion framework. As we demonstrate, MAS avoids common issues such as out-of-domain sampling and mode-collapse. https://guytevet.github.io/mas-page/</description>

      <title>Ghost on the Shell: An Expressive Representation of General 3D Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The creation of photorealistic virtual worlds requires the accurate modeling of 3D surface geometry for a wide range of objects. For this, meshes are appealing since they 1) enable fast physics-based rendering with realistic material and lighting, 2) support physical simulation, and 3) are memory-efficient for modern graphics pipelines. Recent work on reconstructing and statistically modeling 3D shape, however, has critiqued meshes as being topologically inflexible. To capture a wide range of object shapes, any 3D representation must be able to model solid, watertight, shapes as well as thin, open, surfaces. Recent work has focused on the former, and methods for reconstructing open surfaces do not support fast reconstruction with material and lighting or unconditional generative modelling. Inspired by the observation that open surfaces can be seen as islands floating on watertight surfaces, we parameterize open surfaces by defining a manifold signed distance field on watertight templates. With this parameterization, we further develop a grid-based and differentiable representation that parameterizes both watertight and non-watertight meshes of arbitrary topology. Our new representation, called Ghost-on-the-Shell (G-Shell), enables two important applications: differentiable rasterization-based reconstruction from multiview images and generative modelling of non-watertight meshes. We empirically demonstrate that G-Shell achieves state-of-the-art performance on non-watertight mesh reconstruction and generation tasks, while also performing effectively for watertight meshes.</description>

      <title>Fast ellipsoidal conformal and quasi-conformal parameterization of genus-0 closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface parameterization plays a fundamental role in many science and engineering problems. In particular, as genus-0 closed surfaces are topologically equivalent to a sphere, many spherical parameterization methods have been developed over the past few decades. However, in practice, mapping a genus-0 closed surface onto a sphere may result in a large distortion due to their geometric difference. In this work, we propose a new framework for computing ellipsoidal conformal and quasi-conformal parameterizations of genus-0 closed surfaces, in which the target parameter domain is an ellipsoid instead of a sphere. By combining simple conformal transformations with different types of quasi-conformal mappings, we can easily achieve a large variety of ellipsoidal parameterizations with their bijectivity guaranteed by quasi-conformal theory. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Surf-D: Generating High-Quality Surfaces of Arbitrary Topologies Using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Surf-D, a novel method for generating high-quality 3D shapes as Surfaces with arbitrary topologies using Diffusion models. Previous methods explored shape generation with different representations and they suffer from limited topologies and poor geometry details. To generate high-quality surfaces of arbitrary topologies, we use the Unsigned Distance Field (UDF) as our surface representation to accommodate arbitrary topologies. Furthermore, we propose a new pipeline that employs a point-based AutoEncoder to learn a compact and continuous latent space for accurately encoding UDF and support high-resolution mesh extraction. We further show that our new pipeline significantly outperforms the prior approaches to learning the distance fields, such as the grid-based AutoEncoder, which is not scalable and incapable of learning accurate UDF. In addition, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy to efficiently embed various surfaces. With the pretrained shape latent space, we employ a latent diffusion model to acquire the distribution of various shapes. Extensive experiments are presented on using Surf-D for unconditional generation, category conditional generation, image conditional generation, and text-to-shape tasks. The experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Surf-D in shape generation across multiple modalities as conditions.

      <title>Dispersed Structured Light for Hyperspectral 3D Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral 3D imaging aims to acquire both depth and spectral information of a scene. However, existing methods are either prohibitively expensive and bulky or compromise on spectral and depth accuracy. In this work, we present Dispersed Structured Light (DSL), a cost-effective and compact method for accurate hyperspectral 3D imaging. DSL modifies a traditional projector-camera system by placing a sub-millimeter thick diffraction grating film front of the projector. The grating disperses structured light based on light wavelength. To utilize the dispersed structured light, we devise a model for dispersive projection image formation and a per-pixel hyperspectral 3D reconstruction method. We validate DSL by instantiating a compact experimental prototype. DSL achieves spectral accuracy of 18.8nm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) and depth error of 1mm. We demonstrate that DSL outperforms prior work on practical hyperspectral 3D imaging. DSL promises accurate and practical hyperspectral 3D imaging for diverse application domains, including computer vision and graphics, cultural heritage, geology, and biology.</description>

Abstract: We introduce LightIt, a method for explicit illumination control for image generation. Recent generative methods lack lighting control, which is crucial to numerous artistic aspects of image generation such as setting the overall mood or cinematic appearance. To overcome these limitations, we propose to condition the generation on shading and normal maps. We model the lighting with single bounce shading, which includes cast shadows. We first train a shading estimation module to generate a dataset of real-world images and shading pairs. Then, we train a control network using the estimated shading and normals as input. Our method demonstrates high-quality image generation and lighting control in numerous scenes. Additionally, we use our generated dataset to train an identity-preserving relighting model, conditioned on an image and a target shading. Our method is the first that enables the generation of images with controllable, consistent lighting and performs on par with specialized relighting state-of-the-art methods.</description>
