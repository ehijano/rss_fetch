      <title>Thermalization in Quantum Fluids of Light: A Convection-Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory for the dynamics of quantum fluids of light, deriving an effective kinetic equation in momentum space that takes the form of the convection-diffusion equation. In the particular case of two-dimensional systems with parabolic dispersion, it reduces to the Bateman--Burgers equation. The hydrodynamic analogy unifies nonlinear wave phenomena, such as shock wave formation and turbulence, with non-equilibrium Bose--Einstein condensation of photons and polaritons in optical cavities. We introduce the Reynolds number $(\textit{Re})$ and demonstrate that the condensation threshold corresponds exactly to a critical Reynolds number of unity $(\textit{Re}=1)$, beyond which $(\textit{Re} &gt; 1)$ a shock-like front emerges in the momentum space, characterized by the Bose--Einstein distribution for the particle density in states with high momentum.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.</description>

      <title>A simple magnetic field stabilization technique for atomic Bose-Einstein condensate experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple magnetic field stabilization technique in a Bose-Einstein condensate experiment. Our technique is based on the precise measurement of the current fluctuations in the main magnetic field coils and amounts to their compensation using an auxiliary coil. It has the advantage of simplicity as compensation is done using a low inductance coil that can be straightforwardly driven at the relevant frequencies (1 kHz). The performances of the different components (power supply, current transducer, electronics...) are precisely characterized. In addition, for optimal stability the ambient magnetic field is also measured and compensated. The magnetic field stability around 57 G is measured by Ramsey spectroscopy of magnetic field sensitive radiofrequency transition between two spin states of potassium 39 and the shot-to-shot fluctuations are reduced to 64(7) $\mu$G rms, i.e. at the 1 x 10 -6 level. In the context of our experiment, this result opens interesting prospects for the study of three-body interactions in Bose-Einstein condensate potassium spin mixtures.</description>

      <title>Probing Coherences and Itinerant Magnetism in a Dipolar Lattice Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the study of itinerant magnetism of lattice-trapped magnetic atoms, driven by magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, in the low-entropy and close-to-unit filling regime. We have used advanced dynamical decoupling techniques to efficiently suppress the sensitivity to magnetic field fluctuations. We have thus measured the spin coherence of an itinerant spin 3 Bose dipolar gas throughout a quantum phase transition from a superfluid phase to a Mott insulating phase. In the superfluid phase, a metastable ferromagnetic behavior is observed below a dynamical instability which occurs at lattice depths below the phase transition. In the insulating phase, the thermalization towards a paramagnetic state is driven by an interplay between intersite and superexchange interactions.</description>

      <title>Optimal control in phase space applied to minimal-time transfer of thermal atoms in optical traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.</description>

      <title>Molecular laser cooling using serrodynes: Implementation, characterization and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important effort is currently underway to extend optical cycling and laser cooling to more molecular species. Significant challenges arise in particular when multiple nuclear spins give rise to complex, resolved hyperfine spectra, as is the case for several molecular species relevant to precision tests of fundamental symmetries. We provide a detailed introduction to the use of optical spectra generated via serrodyne waveforms to address this complexity. We discuss our experimental implementation of these serrodynes, characterize their properties, and outline procedures to find optimized sideband configurations that generate strong laser cooling forces. We demonstrate the application of these techniques to barium monofluoride molecules and explore their prospects for the cooling of other species relevant to the study of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Responses of Generalized Landau Levels: Structure Factor and the Quantized Hall Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new geometric characterization of generalized Landau levels (GLLs). The GLLs are a generalization of Landau levels to non-uniform Berry curvature, and are mathematically defined in terms of a holomorphic curve -- an ideal K\"ahler band -- and its associated unitary Frenet-Serret moving frame. Here, we find that GLLs are harmonic maps from the Brillouin zone to the complex projective space and they are critical points of the Dirichlet energy functional, as well as the static structure factor up to fourth order. We also find that filled GLLs exhibit quantized Hall viscosity, similar to the ordinary Landau levels. These results establish GLLs as a versatile generalization of Landau levels.</description>

      <title>Hybridization induced quantum phase transition in bilayer Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental report on the pressure induced superconductor-insulator transition in cuprate superconductors as well as the superconductivity of the Ruddlesden-Popper-phase La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, we systematically investigated the single-orbital bilayer Hubbard model in the regime of large interlayer hybridization to mimic the pressure effects. We map out the phase diagram of interlayer hybridization versus density in the regime of intermediate to strong hybridization. In particular, we found that the sufficiently strong hybridization can destroy the $s^{\pm}$-wave pairing and induces its transition to correlated metallic, pseudogap, and Fermi liquid phases depending on the doping regime. The phase diagram hosted by the bilayer model implies its role as the versatile platform to explore the pressure effects on the two-dimensional to three-dimensional crossover physics of Hubbard-type models.</description>

      <title>A glance to Luttinger liquid and its platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) has been established as a fundamental theory for the understanding of one-dimensional quantum systems. Originally formulated as a replacement for Landau's Fermi-liquid theory, which accurately predicts the behaviour of most 3D metals but fails dramatically in 1D, the TLL description applies to a even broader class of 1D systems,including bosons and anyons. After a certain number of theoretical breakthroughs, its descriptive power has now been confirmed experimentally in different experimental platforms. They extend from organic conductors, carbon nanotubes, quantum wires, topological edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators to cold atoms, Josephson junctions, Bose liquids confined within 1D nanocapillaries and spin chains. In the ground state of such systems, quantum fluctuations become correlated on all length scales, but, counter-intuitively, no long-range order exists. In this respect, this review will illustrate the validity of conformal field theory for describing real-world systems, establishing the boundaries for its application and, on the other side will discuss the spectacular demonstration of how the quantum-critical TLL state governs the properties of many-body systems in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantum trajectories and Page-curve entanglement dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider time dynamics of entanglement entropy between a filled fermionic system and an empty reservoir. We consider scenarios (i) where the system is subjected to a dephasing mechanism and the reservoir is clean, thereby emulating expansion of effectively interacting fermions in vacuum, and (ii) where both the system and the reservoir are subjected to dephasing and thereby enabling us to address how the entanglement between the part of the effectively interacting system and its complement evolves in time. We consider two different kinds of quantum trajectory approaches, namely stochastic unitary unraveling and quantum state diffusion. For both protocols, we observe and characterize the full Page curve-like dynamics for the entanglement entropy. Depending on the protocol and the setup, we observe very distinct characteristics of the Page curve and the associated Page time and Page value. We also compute the number of fermions leaking to the reservoir and the associated current and shed light on their plausible connections with entanglement entropy. Our findings are expected to hold for a wide variety of generic interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Exact solution to the hydrodynamic equation of quantum lattice gases with dephasing noise via classical run-and-tumble processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The average state dynamics of free fermions subject to random projective measurements of local site occupation numbers is governed by a Lindblad equation with dephasing noise. In the continuous limit, the equation of motion for the correlation matrix is mapped to a hydrodynamic equation for the Wigner function, which takes the form of a linear, nonlocal partial differential equation. As a main result, we derive the analytical solution to the hydrodynamic equation using the quasiparticle picture, showing that the Wigner dynamics emerges from stochastic sampling of classical run-and-tumble processes. As an application, we recover the crossover between ballistic and diffusive transport regimes.</description>

      <title>Resonance Cascades and Number Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04361v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we are interested in situations where the existence of a contiguous cascade of quantum resonant transitions is predicated on the validity of a particular statement in number theory. The setting is a tailored one-atom one-dimensional potential with a prescribed spectrum, under a weak periodic perturbation. The former is, by now, an experimental reality [D. Cassettari, G. Mussardo and A. Trombettoni, PNAS Nexus {\bf 2}, pgac279 (2022)].
  As a case study, we look at the following trivial statement: "Any power of $3$ is an integer." Consequently, we "test" this statement in a numerical experiment where we demonstrate an unimpeded upward mobility along an equidistant, $\ln(3)$-spaced subsequence of the energy levels of a potential with a log-natural spectrum, under a frequency $\ln(3)$ time-periodic perturbation. We further show that when we "remove" $9$ from the set of integers -- by excluding the corresponding energy level from the spectrum -- the cascade halts abruptly.</description>

      <title>Improved models for ideal Fermi gas and ideal Bose gas using quantum phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09998v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, improvements are introduced into the current models of the ideal Fermi gas and the ideal Bose gas by incorporating the quantum nature of phase space, directly linked to the uncertainty principle. These improved models leverage the recently developed concepts of quantum phase space and phase space representation of quantum mechanics. The Hamiltonian operator for a gas particle and its eigenstates are first determined, and quantum statistical mechanics is used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the ideal gas. 
  Analytic expressions for thermodynamic quantities - including the grand canonical potential, particle number, internal energy, Von Neumann entropy, and pressure are derived, alongside the corresponding thermodynamic equations of state for both bosons and fermions. These corrections are particularly significant at low temperatures and in confined volumes, where quantum effects such as shape and size become prominent. The results also establish a direct link between thermodynamic functions and the quantum statistical variances of momenta. 
  Importantly, the improved models recover well-known classical relations of the ideal gas in the high-temperature and large-volume limits, ensuring consistency with classical physics. By addressing quantum corrections and their thermodynamic implications, this work provides a foundation for further applications in nanoscale systems, quantum gases, low-temperature physics, utra-cold physics and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Third-Order Exceptional Point in Non-Hermitian Spin-Orbit-Coupled cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) has seen substantial advances in both experiment and theory. However, in quantum systems, higher-order exceptional points remain of great interest and possess numerous intriguing properties yet to be fully explored. Here, we describe a \emph{PT} symmetry-protected three-level non-Hermitian system with the dissipative spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) fermions in which a third-order exceptional point (EP3) emerges when both the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system collapse into one. The band structure and its spin dynamics are explored for $^{173}$Yb fermions. We highlight the enhanced sensitivity to the external perturbation of EP3 with cubic-root energy dispersion. Additionally, we investigate the second-order exceptional point (EP2) with square-root energy dispersion in a three-level quantum system with the absence of parity symmetry, which proves that the enhanced sensitivity closely relates to the symmetries of the NH system. Furthermore, we analyze the encircling behavior of EP3 in terms of the adiabatic limit and the nonadiabatic dynamics and discover some different results from that of EP2.</description>

      <title>Induction of non-Fermi liquids by critical cavity photons at the onset of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) at a putative quantum critical point signalling the onset of superradiance, in a set-up involving cavity quantum electrodynamics. Although the finiteness of the cavity, being bounded by reflecting mirrors, endows the cavity photons with an effective mass, they become massless at the continuous phase-transition point. We consider the matter part coming from the fermions hopping on a honeycomb lattice near half-filling, featuring doped Dirac cones at two sets of inequivalent valleys. This choice is dictated by the presence of a fermion-boson interaction vertex, which can give rise to Landau damping of the critical bosons, eventually leading to an NFL phase for the fermions. To set up the quantum effective action, we identify the hot-spots of the generically anisotropic (trigonally-warped) Fermi surfaces, which give the sets of points having parallel/antiparallel tangent vectors. The cavity photons act as charge density wave (CDW) order parameters, connecting pairs of hot-spots belonging to the Fermi surface of a single valley. With these ingredients, we set upon identifying NFL phases, using the tools of dimensional regularization and renormalization-group-flow equations. Our final results indicate that stable NFL phases exist in the low-energy limit, for the projections of the flows along the CDW coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Universal corrections to the superfluid gap in a cold Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A framework for computing the superfluid gap in an effective field theory (EFT) of fermions interacting via momentum-independent contact forces is developed. The leading universal corrections in the EFT are one-loop in-medium effects at the Fermi surface, and reproduce the well-known Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov result. The complete subleading universal corrections are presented here, and include one-loop effects away from the Fermi surface, two-loop in-medium effects, as well as modifications to the fermion propagator. Together, these effects are found to reduce the gap at low densities. Applications to neutron superfluidity in neutron stars are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a Bell Test with Entangled Atoms of Different Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08356v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Bell test experiment using momentum-entangled atom pairs of different masses, specifically metastable helium isotopes 3He* and 4He*, though the method extends to other atom species. Entanglement is generated via collisions, after which the quantum states are manipulated using two independent atom interferometers, enabling precise phase control over each species. Numerical simulations predict a significant violation of Bell's inequality under realistic conditions. This proposal opens a new paradigm to study the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Gapless higher-order topology and corner states in Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</description>
