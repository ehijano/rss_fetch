      <title>On classical 1-absorbing prime submodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we aim to introduce the concept of classical 1-absorbing prime submodules of a nonzero unital module $M$ over a commutative ring $A$ with unity. A proper submodule $P$ of $M$ is said to be a classical 1-absorbing prime submodule, if for each $m\in M$ and nonunits $a,b,c\in A,$ $abcm\in P$ implies that $abm\in P$ or $cm\in P$. We give many examples and properties of classical 1-absorbing prime submodules. Also, we investiage the classical 1-absorbing prime submodules of tensor product $F\otimes M$ of a (faithfully) flat $A$-module $F$ and any $A$-module $M$. Furthermore, we determine classical prime, classical 1-absorbing prime and classical 2-absorbing submodules of amalgamated duplication $M\bowtie I$ of an $A$-module $M$ along an ideal $I$. Also, we characterize local rings $(A,\mathfrak{m})$ with $\mathfrak{m}^{2}=0$ in terms of classical 1-absorbing prime submodules.</description>

      <title>Diameter of Commuting Graphs of Lie Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the connectedness of the commuting graph of a general Lie algebra and provide a process to determine whether the commuting graph is connected or not, as well as to compute an upper bound for its diameter. In addition, we will examine the connectedness and diameter of the commuting graphs of some remarkable classes of Lie algebras, including: (1) a class of Lie algebras with one- or two-dimensional derived algebras; and (2) a class of solvable Lie algebras over the real field of dimension up to $4$.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for total positivity, compounds, and Dodgson condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $n$-by-$n$ matrix is called totally positive ($TP$) if all its minors are positive and $TP_k$ if all of its $k$-by-$k$ submatrices are $TP$. For an arbitrary totally positive matrix or $TP_k$ matrix, we investigate if the $r$th compound ($1&lt;r&lt;n$) is in turn $TP$ or $TP_k$, and demonstrate a strong negative resolution in general. Focus is then shifted to Dodgson's algorithm for calculating the determinant of a generic matrix, and we analyze whether the associated condensed matrices are possibly totally positive or $TP_k$. We also show that all condensed matrices associated with a $TP$ Hankel matrix are $TP$.</description>

      <title>Pentagram maps over rings, Grassmannians, and skewers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pentagram map is a discrete dynamical system on planar polygons. By definition, the image of a polygon $P$ under the pentagram map is the polygon $P'$ whose vertices are the intersection points of consecutive shortest diagonals of $P$. The pentagram map was introduced by R. Schwartz in 1992, and is now one of the most renowned discrete integrable systems. Several authors proposed generalizations of the pentagram map to other geometries, in particular to Grassmannians, where the role of points and lines is played by higher-dimensional subspaces, as well to skewer geometry, where both points and lines are affine lines in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. In the present paper, we develop a common framework for these kinds of generalizations. Specifically, we show that those maps can be viewed as pentagram maps in the projective plane over an appropriate ring. In general, those rings need not be division rings or commutative. We show that the Grassmannian pentagram map corresponds to the ring of matrices, while the skewer map is the pentagram map over the ring of dual numbers. Furthermore, we prove that the pentagram map remains integrable for any stably finite ground ring $R$.</description>

      <title>Invariants for singular links via the two parameter bt-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new invariant of singular links through representations of the singular braid monoid into the two parameters bt-algebra. Additionally, we recover this invariant by using the approach of Paris and Rabenda. Hence, we introduce the so called two parameter Singular bt-algebra. Finally, we provide the skein relations that define our invariant, and we prove that this invariant is more powerful than previous invariants of singular links in literature.</description>

      <title>Cohomology and deformation of compatible Hom-Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider compatible Hom-Leibniz algebra where the Hom map twists the operations in the compatible system. We consider a suitably graded Lie algebra whose Maurer-Cartan elements characterize the structure of compatible Hom-Leibniz algebras. Using this, we study cohomology, infinitesimal deformations, the Nijenhuis operator, and their relation for compatible Hom-Leibniz algebras. Finally we see the cohomology of compatible Hom-Leibniz algebra with coefficients in an arbitrary representation.</description>

      <title>The Hilbert series of the preprojective algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this short note is to prove the formula of the Hilbert series of the preprojective algebras in arbitrary characteristic by making effective use of the formulas of the Hilbert series of differential graded (dg) algebras with Adams grading. We also compute the Hilbert series of the quiver Heisenberg algebras, a special class of central extensions of preprojective algebras.</description>

      <title>Quiver Heisenberg algebras: a cubic analogue of preprojective algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a certain class of central extensions of preprojective algebras of quivers under the name quiver Heisenberg algebras (QHA). There are several classes of algebras introduced before by different researchers from different view points, which have the QHA as a special case. While these have mainly been studied in characteristic zero, we also study the case of positive characteristic. Our results show that the QHA is closely related to the representation theory of the corresponding path algebra in a similar way to the preprojective algebra.
  Among other things, one of our main results is that the QHA provides an exact sequence of bimodules over the path algebra of a quiver, which can be called the universal Auslander-Reiten sequence. Moreover, we show that the QHA provides minimal left and right approximations with respect to the powers of the radical functor. Consequently, we obtain a description of the QHA as a module over the path algebra, which in the Dynkin case, gives a categorification (as well as a generalization to the positive characteristic case) of the dimension formula by Etingof-Rains.</description>
