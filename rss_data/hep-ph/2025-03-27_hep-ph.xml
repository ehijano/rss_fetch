      <title>Signatures of quasi-Dirac neutrinos in diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for signatures of extremely long-baseline oscillations between left- and right-handed neutrinos using the high-energy astrophysical neutrino spectra measured by IceCube. We assume the astrophysical neutrino sources to be distributed in redshift following the star formation rate and use the IceCube all-sky flux measurements from TeV to PeV energies. We find, for the first time, that $\delta m^2$ in the range $2\times 10^{-19}$ to $3 \times 10^{-18}\textrm{eV}^2$ is disfavored at the $3\sigma$ confidence level, while there exists a preference for a $\delta m^2$ of $1.9 \times 10^{-19}\textrm{eV}^2$ at $2.8\sigma$. This preference for quasi-Dirac neutrinos is driven by the tension between cascade and track measurements below $30~\textrm{TeV}$.</description>

      <title>Drell-Yan production in universal theories beyond dimension-six SMEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Drell-Yan production in universal theories consistently including effects beyond dimension six in the SMEFT. Within universal SMEFT and with $C$ and $P$ conservation we find that eleven dimension-eight operators contribute in addition to the six contributing at dimension-six. We first work in an operator basis in which operators with higher derivatives of the bosonic fields have been rotated by equations of motion in favor of combinations of operators involving SM fermion currents. We derive the general form of the amplitudes consistently in the expansion to ${\cal O}(\Lambda^{-4})$ and identify eight combinations of the 17 Wilson coefficients which are physically distinguishable by studying the invariant mass distribution of the lepton pairs produced. We then introduce an extension of the parametrization of universal effects in terms of oblique parameters obtained by linearly expanding the self-energies of the electroweak gauge-bosons to ${\cal O}(q^6)$. It contains eleven oblique parameters of which only eight are generated within SMEFT at dimension-eight: $\widehat{S}$, $\widehat{T}$, $W$, $Y$, $\widehat{U}$, $X$, plus two additional which we label $W'$ and $Y'$ and show how they match at linear order with the eight identified combinations of operator coefficients. We then perform a combined analysis of a variety of LHC data on the neutral- and charged-current Drell-Yan processes with the aim of constraining the eight combinations. We compare and combine the LHC bounds with those from electroweak precision $W$ and $Z$ pole observables which can only provide constraints in four directions of the eight-parameter space. We present the results in terms of limits on the eight effective Wilson coefficients as well as on the eight oblique parameters. In each case, we study the dependence of the derived constraints on the order of the expansion considered.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological implications of a class of non-invertible selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through well-motivated models in particle physics, we demonstrate the power of a general class of selection rules from non-invertible fusion algebra that are only exact at low orders in perturbation theory. Surprisingly, these non-invertible selection rules can even be applied to the minimal extension of the Standard Model, which is to add a gauge-singlet real scalar. In this model, we show that Fibonacci fusion rules can lead to experimentally testable features for the scattering processes of the real scalar. We anticipate that this class of non-invertible selection rules can be applied to a wide range of models beyond the Standard Model. To further strengthen our methodology, we discuss a dark matter model based on the Ising fusion rules, where the dark matter is labeled by the non-invertible element in the algebra, hence its stability is preserved at all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Axion dissipation in conductive media and neutron star superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In axion electrodynamics, magnetic fields enable axion-photon mixing. Recent proposals suggest that rotating, conductive plasmas in neutron star magnetospheres could trigger axion superradiant instabilities -- an intriguing idea, given that such instabilities are typically associated with rotating black holes. In this work, we extend these investigations by properly incorporating plasma dynamics, particularly the plasma-induced photon effective mass, which suppresses the axion-photon mixing. Using two toy models for the conductive regions in the magnetosphere and accounting for fluid dynamics in both the frequency and time domain, we show that typical astrophysical plasma densities strongly inhibits the axionic instability. While our results assumes flat spacetime, the conclusions also apply to axion bound states in curved spacetimes, making neutron star superradiance less viable than previously thought. As a byproduct of our work, we provide a detailed description of axion electrodynamics in dissipative plasmas and uncover phenomena such as low-frequency axion "tails" and axion-induced electrostatic fields in dense plasmas.</description>

      <title>Two or three things particle physicists (mis)understand about (pre)heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from the end of inflation to a hot, thermal Universe, commonly referred to as (re)heating, is a critical yet often misunderstood phase in early Universe cosmology. This short review aims to provide a comprehensive, conceptually clear, and accessible introduction to the physics of (re)heating, tailored to the particle physics community. We critically examine the standard Boltzmann approach, emphasizing its limitations in capturing the intrinsically non-perturbative and non-linear dynamics that dominate the early stages of energy transfer. These include explosive particle production, inflaton fragmentation, turbulence, and thermalization; phenomena often overlooked in perturbative treatments. We survey a wide range of theoretical tools, from Boltzmann equations to lattice simulations, clarifying when each is applicable and highlighting scenarios where analytic control is still feasible. Special attention is given to model-dependent features such as (pre)heating, the role of fermions, gravitational couplings, and the impact of multifield dynamics. We also discuss exceptional cases, including Starobinsky-like models and instant (pre)heating, where (re)heating proceeds through analytically tractable channels without requiring full non-linear simulations. Ultimately, this review serves both as a practical guide and a cautionary tale, advocating for a more nuanced and physically accurate understanding of this pivotal epoch within the particle physics community.</description>

      <title>The High-Temperature Limit of the SM(EFT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the one-loop effective 3-dimensional Lagrangian that describes the high-temperature limit of the electroweak theory, to order $\mathcal{O}(g^6)$ in coupling constants $g$, including corrections due to Matsubara modes of both fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom. We clarify certain aspects of the gauge-independence of physical parameters. We also extend the calculation to the Standard Model effective field theory, paving the way, in particular, for a precise study of the electroweak phase transition within this framework.</description>

      <title>Testable dark matter solution within the seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a dark matter component in the Universe, together with the discovery of neutrino masses from the observation of the oscillation phenomenon, represents one of the most important open questions in particle physics today. A concurrent solution arises when one of the right-handed neutrinos, necessary for the generation of light neutrino masses, is itself the dark matter candidate. In this article, we study the generation of such a dark matter candidate relying solely on the presence of neutrino mixing. This tightly links the generation of dark matter with searches in laboratory experiments on top of the usual indirect dark matter probes. We find that the regions of parameter space producing the observed dark matter abundance can be probed indirectly with electroweak precision observables and charged lepton flavor violation searches. Given that the heavy neutrino masses need to lie at most around the TeV scale, probes at future colliders would further test this production mechanism.</description>

      <title>Exploiting $\nu$-dependence of projected energy correlators in HICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the recently derived factorization formula for energy-energy correlators to study the analytic structure of general $\nu$-point projected energy correlators in heavy ion collisions. The $\nu$-point projected energy correlators (or, $\nu$-correlators) are an analytically continued family of the integer $N$-point projected energy correlators, which probe correlations between $N$ final-state particles. By tracking the largest separation ($\chi$) between the $N$ particles, in vacuum, their structure is closely related to the DGLAP splitting functions and exhibits a classical scaling behavior $\sim 1/\chi$ which is modified by resummation through the anomalous dimensions. We show that, in a thermal medium, the $\nu$-correlators display non-trivial angular scaling already at the leading order in perturbation theory. We find that for non-integer values, particularly $\nu&lt;1$, medium-induced jet function is enhanced compared to $\nu&gt;1$. This is particularly manifested in the ratios of $\nu$-correlators with respect to the two-point energy correlator which encode an intrinsic angular information for $\nu&lt;1$ when compared to large $\nu$ values. Moreover, for small-$\nu$ values, the $\nu$-correlators appear to saturate at $\nu=0.01$. We further confirm our leading-order numerical computations against simulated events from JEWEL for the parton level production cross-section. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the effect of BFKL resummation for various values of $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Energy Correlators for the Odderon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the T-odd nucleon energy correlator (NEC) at small $x$ and establish its connection with the spin-dependent odderon. Probing the T-odd NEC involves measuring a single transverse spin asymmetry (SSA) for the energy pattern in the target fragmentation region in deep inelastic scattering. We find that while the inclusive energy pattern results in a vanishing SSA, a nonzero SSA emerges when restricting the measurement to charged hadrons, which are directly measured in tracking detectors. To describe this effect, we introduce the track-based NEC and evaluate its small-$x$ limit from fracture functions using the energy sum rule. The resulting SSA exhibits an opposite sign between positively and negatively charged hadrons, providing a clear experimental signature of the odderon. Furthermore, by incorporating charge weighting into the NEC, we construct a C-odd tag in the final state, eliminating potential contamination from C-even gluonic contributions. Our results demonstrate that these track-based energy-pattern observables offer a clean and sensitive probe for unveiling odderon dynamics at the future electron-ion collider.</description>

      <title>Hidden charmed decays of $X(3872)$ within the $D{\bar D}^*$ molecular framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dipionic transition of the $X(3872)$ to the $\eta_c$ was investigated using an effective Lagrangian approach. In this study, the $X(3872)$ was assumed to be a $D\bar{D}^\ast + \text{c.c.}$ bound state with the quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ and to decay via triangle and box loops. It is found that the partial decay widths arising from the box loops are one order of magnitude greater than those from the triangle ones. The decay widths are model-dependent, as characterized by the cutoff parameter introduced in the form factor. Moreover, the charged and neutral $D\bar{D}^\ast$ configurations of the $X(3872)$ and its mass also influence the decay widths. With our model parameters, the decay widths for the $X(3872)\to\pi^+\pi^-\eta_c$ can reach up to several tens of keV. We hope that the current calculations within the molecular interpretation will be helpful for the future experiments.</description>

      <title>Proton Spin Decomposition via QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for investigating the spin structure of hadrons based on the two-point function in quantum field theory. In a rotating frame, we derive two independent expressions of the two-point function and identify their equivalence, which allows for a complete decomposition of the total spin of a composite system into the angular momenta of its constituent particles. Applying this approach to the proton, we analyze its spin structure in the massless quark limit. Our results indicate that the quark spin contribution accounts for approximately 27$\%$ of the total proton spin at a low-energy scale, significantly deviating from the prediction of the non-relativistic quark model.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Velocity and Spin Dependent Exotic Interaction at the Millimeter Scale with a Diamagnetic-levitated Force Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light bosons, beyond the standard model and as prominent candidates for dark matter, can mediate velocity and spin dependent exotic interaction between electron spins and nucleons. At short ranges, it remains an open challenge to test this exotic interaction with high precision. Here, we present a method based on diamagnetic-levitated force sensor to detect the exotic interaction at the millimeter scale. Improved constraints for the coupling $g_A^e g_V^N$ are established, within the force range spanning from 0.15 mm to 1.5 mm. And the constraint $|g_A^e g_V^N| \leq 4.39 \times10^{-26}$ at $\lambda$ = 0.5 mm at the $95 \%$ confidence level, significantly surpasses previous results by more than three orders of magnitude. The diamagnetic levitation force measurement system developed here can also be repurposed to probe other exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as the exotic spin-spin interaction. This system provides a platform for the exploration of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Effect of $\alpha$-clusters on particle production in O$-$O and p$-$O collisions at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, O$-$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7 TeV and p$-$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 9.9 TeV are studied using PYTHIA8/Angantyr model for heavy-ion collisions. The theoretically predicted $\alpha$-cluster structure of oxygen nucleus is implemented in the model to investigate the effect of initial configuration of oxygen nucleus on final state observables. The results obtained from $\alpha$-cluster structure are compared with those obtained from Woods-Saxon nuclear charge density distribution. The Angantyr model simulation showed that the radial distribution of oxygen nucleus in $\alpha$-cluster configuration is more compact in comparison to the Woods-Saxon distribution. The results on charged and identified particle pseudorapidity distribution is obtained in the two initial state configuration of the oxygen nucleus. The results demonstrated that the effect of initial geometrical configuration is more distinct in the non-central collisions in comparison to the central collisions for both O$-$O and p$-$O collisions.</description>

      <title>Four-loop anomalous dimension of flavor non-singlet twist-two operator of general Lorentz spin in QCD: zeta(3) term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the anomalous dimension of the flavor non-singlet twist-two quark operator of arbitrary Lorentz spin N at four loops in QCD and construct its contribution proportional to zeta(3) in analytic form by applying advanced methods of number theory on the available knowledge of low-N moments. In conjunction with similar results on the zeta(5) and zeta(4) contributions, this completes our knowledge of the transcendental part of the considered anomalous dimension. This also provides important constraints on the as-yet elusive all-N form of the rational part. Via Mellin transformation, we thus obtain the exact functional form in x of the respective piece of the non-singlet Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi splitting function at four loops. This allows us to appreciably reduce the theoretical uncertainty in the approximation of that splitting function otherwise amenable from the first few low-N moments.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Dark Universe: A European Strategy for Axions and other WISPs Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions and other very weakly interacting slim (with $m &lt;$ 1 GeV) particles (WISPs) are a common feature of several extensions of the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The search of WISPs was already recommended in the last update of the European strategy on particle physics (ESPP). After that, the physics case for WISPs has gained additional momentum. Indeed, WISPs may provide a new paradigm to explain the nature of dark matter and puzzling astrophysical and particle physics observations. This document briefly summarizes current searches for WISPs and the perspectives in this research field for the next decade, ranging from their theoretical underpinning, over their indirect observational consequences in astrophysics, to their search in laboratory experiments. It is stressed that in Europe a rich, diverse, and low-cost experimental program is already underway with the potential for one or more game-changing discoveries. In this context, it is also reported the role of the EU funded COST Action ''Cosmic WISPers in the Dark Universe: Theory, astrophysics, and experiments'' (CA21106, https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA21106) in coordinating and supporting WISPs searches in Europe, shaping a roadmap to track the strategy to guarantee a European leadership in this field of research. This document has been submitted in March 2025 as an input to the update process of the ESPP.</description>

      <title>Gravitational $p \to \Delta^+ $ transition form factors in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proton to $\Delta^+$ resonance transitional gravitational form factors are calculated to leading one-loop order using chiral perturbation theory. We take into account the leading electromagnetic and strong isospin-violating effects to obtain non-vanishing contributions. The loop contributions to the transition form factors are found to be free of power-counting violating pieces, which is consistent with the absence of tree-level diagrams at the considered order. Our results involve no free parameters and can be regarded as predictions of chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Single-inclusive hadron production in electron-positron annihilation at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-inclusive hadron production in electron-positron annihilation (SIA) represents the cleanest process for investigating the dynamics of parton hadronization, as encapsulated in parton fragmentation functions. In this letter, we present, for the first time, the analytical computation of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) corrections to the coefficient functions for SIA at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) accuracy, achieving the highest precision to date for hadron production processes. Utilizing the BaBar measurement as a benchmark, we assess the phenomenological implications of this high-precision calculation. Our findings demonstrate a substantial reduction in scale uncertainties at N$^3$LO and offer an improved description of the experimental data compared to lower-order calculations. This advancement underscores the importance of higher-order corrections in achieving a more accurate understanding of hadronization processes.</description>

      <title>Chiral Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing quantum chromo dynamics (QCD) from three to arbitrarily many color degrees of freedom suggests that baryons can be described as solitons in an effective meson theory whose interaction strength decreases with the number of colors. The exact form of that theory is unknown, but at low energies chiral symmetry and its breaking are considered as the construction recipes for modeling the theory. The Skyrmion is a static, localized solution in a non-linear field theory for pions and it is the most prominent version of a soliton in a chirally symmetric meson theory. Upon quantization it reproduces the spectrum of the low-lying baryons and their static properties reasonably well. Extending that theory by vector mesons improves on the agreement between predicted and empirical data. Chiral solitons within models for the quark flavor dynamics facilitate the investigation of nucleon structure functions. Here we provide a pedagogical overview of these facets.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Precision Data as a Gateway to Light Higgsinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects of probing weak-scale higgsinos through electroweak precision measurements at a future $e^+ e^-$ collider. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, higgsinos mix with winos and binos after electroweak symmetry breaking, forming charginos and neutralinos. These states contribute to electroweak precision observables, which can be measured with high accuracy at future $e^+ e^-$ colliders. Their contributions depend on the mixing structure, as evidenced by the generation of the oblique parameters $\hat{S}$ and $\hat{T}$, in addition to the $W$ and $Y$ parameters, which arise even in the absence of mixing. We demonstrate that higgsinos with masses up to $\sim 500~\mathrm{GeV}$ can be probed through future electroweak precision experiments, highlighting their significance in probing weak-scale supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Constraining axion-chiral parameters with pulsar timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The arrival time of electromagnetic signals traveling in chiral cosmic media is investigated in the context of axion electrodynamics. Considering that the interstellar medium (ISM) is described by a cold, ionized, chiral plasma, we derive the time delay between two traveling signals, expressed in terms of a modified dispersion measure (DM) which receives additional contribution from the chiral parameters. Faraday rotation angle is also considered in this chiral plasma scenario, yielding modified rotation measures (RM). Using DMs data from five pulsars, we establish constraints on the chiral parameter magnitude at the order of $10^{-23}$ - $10^{-22}$ GeV. On the other hand, the Faraday rotation retrieved from RM measurements implied upper constraints as tight as $10^{-36}$ GeV. By applying the obtained RM limits, we estimate that the axion-photon coupling magnitude is restrained to the level of 1 part in $10^{17}$ GeV$^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize recent results for four-quark states with hidden and open flavor obtained from a four-quark Bethe-Salpeter/Faddeev-Yakubowsky equation. The approach dynamically predicts the leading internal two-body clusters such as meson-meson, hadroquarkonium or diquark-antidiquark components. For hidden-flavor states, the meson-meson or hadroquarkonium configurations are dominant, while the diquark contributions are small. For open-flavor states, the situation is different and depends on the quark content: The $T_{bb}^-$ is a mixture of various components, where the diquark-antidiquark components are dominant, whereas the $T_{cc}^+$ is practically entirely dominated by $DD^\ast$ due to its proximity to the threshold. We also provide details on the analytic continuations and extrapolations to extract states above thresholds.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium chiral condensate in AdS/QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the chiral condensate at finite temperature in AdS/QCD in a time-dependent background, in which the position of the black-hole horizon $z_h$ changes with time, producing an increasing or decreasing temperature. Conformal invariance is broken, as in the soft-wall model, by a static quadratic dilaton. Two different scenarios are analysed: in the first a general power-law time dependence is assumed for $z_h$, while in the second the energy-momentum tensor at late times reproduces the one found in viscous hydrodynamics. Depending on the rate at which the system evolves, the transition shifts toward lower temperatures. If the chiral condensate is far from equilibrium at low temperatures, oscillations around its equilibrium value are observed before thermalization. A prethermalization stage is found in the chiral limit if the initial condition is set at a temperature close to the critical one. In the hydrodynamic setup the evolution of the medium is slow enough, and the chiral condensate soon matches the equilibrium curve.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in and Freeze-out production of Higgs Portal Majorana Fermionic Dark Matter during and after Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the production of Majorana fermionic dark matter (DM) via the Higgs portal, considering both freeze-in and freeze-out mechanisms during and after the post-inflationary reheating phase. We assume that the Universe is reheated through the decay of the inflaton into a pair of massless fermions. Our analysis focuses on how the non-standard evolution of the Hubble expansion rate and the thermal bath temperature during reheating influence DM production. Additionally, we examine the impact of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), distinguishing between scenarios where DM freeze-in or freeze-out occurs before or after EWSB. We further explore the viable DM parameter space and its compatibility with current and future detection experiments, including XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), XLZD, and collider searches. Moreover, we incorporate constraints from the Lyman-$\alpha$ bound to ensure consistency with small-scale structure formation.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Neural Likelihood Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Likelihood ratios are used for a variety of applications in particle physics data analysis, including parameter estimation, unfolding, and anomaly detection. When the data are high-dimensional, neural networks provide an effective tools for approximating these ratios. However, neural network training has an inherent stochasticity that limits their precision. A widely-used approach to reduce these fluctuations is to train many times and average the output (ensembling). We explore different approaches to ensembling and pretraining neural networks for stabilizing likelihood ratio estimation. For numerical studies focus on unbinned unfolding with OmniFold, as it requires many likelihood ratio estimations. We find that ensembling approaches that aggregate the models at step 1, before pushing the weights to step 2 improve both bias and variance of final results. Variance can be further improved by pre-training, however at the cost increasing bias.</description>

      <title>Can the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma be measured from the multiplicity and mean $p_T$ of ultracentral heavy-ion collisions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean transverse momentum $\langle p_T \rangle$ of hadrons has been observed experimentally and in numerical simulations to have a power-law dependence on the hadronic multiplicity $N$ in ultracentral relativistic heavy-ion collisions: $\langle p_{T} \rangle \propto N^{b_{\rm UC}}$. It has been put forward that this exponent $b_{\rm UC}$ is the speed of sound of quark-gluon plasma measured at a temperature determined from $\langle p_T \rangle$. We study step by step the connection between (i) the energy and entropy of hydrodynamic simulations and (ii) experimentally measurable observables. We show that an argument based on energy and entropy should yield an exponent equal to the pressure over energy density $P/\varepsilon$, rather than the speed of sound $c_s^2$. We discuss the importance of the ``effective volume'' needed for the thermodynamics arguments. Our results indicate that the agreement of $b_{\rm UC}$ with $c_s^2$ rather than $P/\varepsilon$ is accidental.</description>

      <title>Inclusive hadroproduction of charmonia-bottomonia pairs in the CGC framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this preprint we analyze the inclusive hadroproduction of heavy charmonia-bottomonia pairs in the Color Glass Condensate framework in the dilute-dense approximation. The production mechanisms can be classified by number of gluons emitted from projectile as Single- and Double Parton Scattering. We analyzed separately both types of contributions and evaluated the corresponding impact factors in the leading order in strong coupling $\alpha_{s}$. For the Double Parton Scattering the impact factors factorize into a product of impact factors of single charmonia and bottomonia production cross-sections, and the cross-section in the large-$N_{c}$ limit reduces to the well-known pocket formula. For the Single Parton Scattering we found that the cross-section of the process is sensitive to dipole, quadrupole, sextupole and octupole scattering amplitudes (correlators of Wilson lines), thus opening possibility to study phenomenologically these novel objects. We also made phenomenological estimates of the cross-sections in the dilute approximation and found that the suggested approach provides a fair qualitative description of the LHCb data for $J/\psi+\Upsilon(1S)$ production.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a dark energy model in which a quintessence field $\phi$ rolls near the vicinity of a local maximum of its potential characterized by the simplest $S$ self-dual form $V(\phi) = \Lambda \ {\rm sech}(\sqrt{2} \, \phi/M_p)$, where $M_p$ is the reduced Planck mass and $\Lambda \sim 10^{-120} M_p^4$ is the cosmological constant. We confront the model with Swampland ideas and show that the $S$-dual potential is consistent with the distance conjecture, the de Sitter conjecture, and the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture. We also examine the compatibility of this phenomenological model with the intriguing DESI DR2 results and show that the shape of the $S$-dual potential is almost indistinguishable from the axion-like potential, $V (\phi) = m_a^2 \ f_a^2 \ [ 1 + \cos(\phi/f_a)]$, with $m_a$ and $f_a$ parameters fitted by the DESI Collaboration to accommodate the DR2 data.</description>

      <title>How Much NEC Breaking Can the Universe Endure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum fields can notoriously violate the null energy condition (NEC). In a cosmological context, NEC violation can lead to, e.g., dark energy at late times with an equation-of-state parameter smaller than $-1$ and nonsingular bounces at early times. However, it is expected that there should still be a limit in semiclasssical gravity to how much `negative energy' can accumulate over time and in space as a result of quantum effects. In the course of formulating quantum-motivated energy conditions, the smeared null energy condition has emerged as a recent proposal. This condition conjectures the existence of a semilocal bound on negative energy along null geodesics, which is expected to hold in semiclassical gravity. In this work, we show how the smeared null energy condition translates into theoretical constraints on NEC-violating cosmologies. Specifically, we derive the implied bounds on dark energy equation-of-state parameters and an inequality between the duration of a bouncing phase and the growth rate of the Hubble parameter at the bounce. In the case of dark energy, we identify the parameter space over which the smeared null energy condition is consistent with the recent constraints from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).</description>

      <title>Spotting Stasis in Cosmological Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As discussed in a number of recent papers, cosmological stasis is a phenomenon wherein the abundances of multiple cosmological energy components with different equations of state remain constant for an extended period despite the expansion of the universe. One of the most intriguing aspects of the stasis phenomenon is that it can give rise to cosmological epochs in which the effective equation-of-state parameter $\langle w \rangle$ for the universe is constant, but differs from the canonical values associated with matter, radiation, vacuum energy, etc. Indeed, during such a stasis epoch, the spatial average of the energy density of the universe evolves in precisely the same manner as it would have evolved if the universe were instead dominated by a perfect fluid with an equation-of-state parameter equal to $\langle w \rangle$. However, as we shall demonstrate, this equivalence is broken at the level of the perturbations of the energy density. To illustrate this point, we consider a stasis epoch involving matter and radiation and demonstrate that within this stasis background the density perturbations associated with a spectator matter component with exceedingly small energy density exhibit a power-law growth that persists across the entire duration of the stasis epoch. This growth can potentially lead to significant enhancements of structure at small scales. Such enhancements are not only interesting in their own right, but may also provide a way of observationally distinguishing between a stasis epoch and an epoch of perfect-fluid domination -- even if the universe has the same equation of state in both cases.</description>

      <title>Conditional Deep Generative Models for Simultaneous Simulation and Reconstruction of Entire Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Particle-flow Neural Assisted Simulations (Parnassus) framework of fast simulation and reconstruction to entire collider events. In particular, we use two generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) tools, continuous normalizing flows and diffusion models, to create a set of reconstructed particle-flow objects conditioned on truth-level particles from CMS Open Simulations. While previous work focused on jets, our updated methods now can accommodate all particle-flow objects in an event along with particle-level attributes like particle type and production vertex coordinates. This approach is fully automated, entirely written in Python, and GPU-compatible. Using a variety of physics processes at the LHC, we show that the extended Parnassus is able to generalize beyond the training dataset and outperforms the standard, public tool Delphes.</description>

      <title>A Linear Collider Vision for the Future of Particle Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we review the physics opportunities at linear $e^+e^-$ colliders with a special focus on high centre-of-mass energies and beam polarisation, take a fresh look at the various accelerator technologies available or under development and, for the first time, discuss how a facility first equipped with a technology mature today could be upgraded with technologies of tomorrow to reach much higher energies and/or luminosities. In addition, we will discuss detectors and alternative collider modes, as well as opportunities for beyond-collider experiments and R\&amp;D facilities as part of a linear collider facility (LCF). The material of this paper will support all plans for $e^+e^-$ linear colliders and additional opportunities they offer, independently of technology choice or proposed site, as well as R\&amp;D for advanced accelerator technologies. This joint perspective on the physics goals, early technologies and upgrade strategies has been developed by the LCVision team based on an initial discussion at LCWS2024 in Tokyo and a follow-up at the LCVision Community Event at CERN in January 2025. It heavily builds on decades of achievements of the global linear collider community, in particular in the context of CLIC and ILC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of particle phenomena is a rapidly advancing field of research. With the widespread availability of quantum simulators, a given quantum system can be simulated in numerous ways, offering flexibility in implementation and exploration. Here, we perform quantum simulation of neutrino propagation in matter, a phenomenon that plays a crucial role in neutrino oscillations. We present quantum circuits with novel gate arrangements to simulate neutrino propagation in both constant and varying matter density profiles. The oscillation probabilities are determined by encoding and measuring the qubit states in the neutrino flavor basis, showing excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Dynamics and Energy Dissipation of Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically explore the interplay between time-dependent magnetic fields and energy density evolution in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), focusing on ultra-relativistic and magnetized conformal fluids. Three characteristic magnetic field evolution models (Type-1, Type-2, Type-3), parameterized to reflect temporal profiles observed in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, are integrated into a (1 + 1) D Bjorken-flow framework. For both fluid types, stronger magnetic fields universally suppress energy dissipation, with suppression magnitudes ordered as Type-1 $&gt;$ Type-2 $&gt;$ Type-3, driven by distinct decay rates of magnetic energy. To bridge QCD physics with macroscopic dynamics, we further incorporate a temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility ($\chi_{m}(T)$) derived from lattice QCD, capturing the transition from diamagnetic hadronic matter ($\chi_{m} &lt; 0$) to paramagnetic quark-gluon plasma ($\chi_{m} &gt; 0$). Our simulations reveal that $\chi_{m}(T)$ introduces a feedback loop: delayed energy dissipation sustains higher temperatures, reinforcing paramagnetic behavior and altering field evolution. These results quantify the critical role of magnetic field dynamics in regulating QGP thermalization and highlight the necessity of QCD-informed susceptibilities for realistic RMHD modeling.</description>

      <title>Strategy for measuring energy spectra of air shower components using a hybrid detector station</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the energy spectrum of air shower components crucial for understanding primary cosmic rays and the physical processes governing their interactions in the atmosphere. However, accurately measuring the energy of shower particles reaching the ground is challenging due to the inherent simplicity of typical cosmic ray experiments.
  This study takes advantage of a hybrid detector station and introduces an analysis for assessing the energy spectra of air shower components. The station is composed of a scintillator surface detector (SSD), a water-Cherenkov detector (WCD), and resistive plate chambers (RPCs). Our results demonstrate that the combination of data from these detectors enables precise assessment of the energy spectrum of electromagnetic particles and low-energy muons, independent of potential detector ageing effects.</description>

      <title>Experimental Signatures for Identifying Distinct Origins of Color Field Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20522v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signatures for non-abelian dynamics have long been central to QCD and QGP. Equally important are they in spin systems and laser-plasma interactions, where they emerge as effective interactions. Distinguishing experimentally gauge inequivalent sources (and hence potentials) that produce the same field tensor is one major task in this endeavour. As a step in this direction, this paper investigates how physically distinct sources which produce the same color electric field (uniform and constant) may be distinguished experimentally in a gauge-invariant manner. We first study the motion of a test particle in such fields and show that the resultant trajectories are counterintuitive. We then examine the radiation emitted - both gluonic and photonic and show that each source (independent non-abelian configuration) leaves a unique signature in the energy spectra, laying the ground for application to specific physical systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of quark core sizes of baryons in neutron star matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the quark substructure of hadrons and the equation of state of high density neutron star matter by using the Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, which is an effective quark theory based on QCD. The interaction between quarks fully respects the chiral and flavor symmetries. Guided by the success of various low energy theorems, we assume that the explicit breaking of these symmetries occurs only via the current quark masses, and all other symmetry breakings are of dynamical nature. In order to take into account the effects of the finite quark core sizes of the baryons on the equation of state, we make use of an excluded volume framework which respects thermodynamic consistency. The effects generated by the swelling quark cores generally act repulsively and lead to an increase of the pressure with increasing baryon density. On the other hand, in neutron star matter they also lead to a decrease of the density window where hyperons appear, because it becomes energetically more favorable to convert the faster moving nucleons into hyperons. Our quantitative analysis shows that the net effect of the excluded volume is too small to solve the long standing "hyperon puzzle," which is posed by the large observed masses of neutron stars. Thus the puzzle persists in a relativistic effective quark theory which takes into account the short range repulsion between baryons caused by their finite and swelling quark core sizes in a phenomenological way.</description>

      <title>Aspects of canonical differential equations for Calabi-Yau geometries and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how a method to construct canonical differential equations for multi-loop Feynman integrals recently introduced by some of the authors can be extended to cases where the associated geometry is of Calabi-Yau type and even beyond. This can be achieved by supplementing the method with information from the mixed Hodge structure of the underlying geometry. We apply these ideas to specific classes of integrals whose associated geometry is a one-parameter family of Calabi-Yau varieties, and we argue that the method can always be successfully applied to those cases. Moreover, we perform an in-depth study of the properties of the resulting canonical differential equations. In particular, we show that the resulting canonical basis is equivalent to the one obtained by an alternative method recently introduced in the literature. We apply our method to non-trivial and cutting-edge examples of Feynman integrals necessary for gravitational wave scattering, further showcasing its power and flexibility.</description>

      <title>The Scalar Size of the Pion from Lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the pion scalar form factor and associated radii with fully controlled systematics. Lattice results are computed on a large set of 17 gauge ensembles with $N_f=2+1$ Wilson Clover-improved sea quarks. These ensembles cover four values of the lattice spacing between $a=0.049\mathrm{fm}$ and $a=0.086\mathrm{fm}$, a pion mass range of $130 - 350\mathrm{MeV}$ and various physical volumes. A precise determination of the notorious quark-disconnected contributions facilitates an unprecedented momentum resolution for the form factor, particularly on large and fine ensembles in the vicinity of physical quark mass. A large range of source-sink separations $1.0\mathrm{fm} \lesssim t_\mathrm{sep} \lesssim 3.25\mathrm{fm}$ is used to reliably extract the relevant ground state matrix elements at vanishing and non-vanishing momentum transfer. This allows us for the first time to obtain the scalar radii from a $z$-expansion parametrization of the $Q^2$-dependence of the resulting form factors rather than a simple, linear approximation at small momentum transfer. The physical extrapolation for the radii is carried out using three-flavor NLO chiral perturbation theory to parametrize the quark mass dependence in terms of three low-energy constants, including the first lattice determination of $L_4^r$. Systematic uncertainties on the final results related to the ground state extraction, form factor parametrization as well as the physical extrapolation are accounted for via model averages based on the Akaike Information Criterion.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Constants of Chiral Perturbation Theory from Pion Scalar Form Factors in $N_f=2+1$-Flavor Lattice QCD with Controlled Errors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the low-energy constants (LECs) $f_0$, $L_4^r$ and $L_5^r$ of SU(3) Chiral Perturbation Theory ($\chi$PT) from a lattice QCD calculation of the scalar form factors of the pion with fully controlled systematics. Lattice results are computed on a large set of $N_f=2+1$ gauge ensembles covering four lattice spacings $a\in[0.049,0.086]\mathrm{fm}$, pion masses $M_\pi\in[130,350]\mathrm{MeV}$, and various large physical volumes. By determining the notorious quark-disconnected contributions with unprecedented precision and using a large range of source-sink separations $t_\mathrm{sep}\in[1.0,3.25]\mathrm{fm}$, we are able for the first time to obtain the scalar radii from a $z$-expansion parameterization of the form factors rather than a simple linear approximation at small momentum transfer. The LECs are obtained from the physical extrapolation of the radii using NLO SU(3) NLO $\chi$PT to parameterize the quark mass dependence. Systematic uncertainties are estimated via model averages based on the Akaike Information Criterion. Our determination of $L_4^r$ is the first lattice determination to obtain a result not compatible with zero.</description>

      <title>Immortality through the dark forces: Dark-charge primordial black holes as dark matter candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fact that no Hawking radiation from the final stages of evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) has yet been observed places stringent bounds on their allowed contribution to dark matter. Concretely, for Schwarzschild PBHs, i.e., uncharged and non-rotating black holes, this rules out black hole masses of less than $10^{-15} M_{\odot}$. In this article, we propose that by including an additional 'dark' $U(1)$ charge one can significantly lower the PBHs' Hawking temperature, slowing down their evaporation process and significantly extending their lifetimes. With this, PBHs again become a viable option for dark matter candidates over a large mass range. We will explore in detail the effects of varying the dark electron (lightest dark charged fermion) mass and charge on the evaporation dynamics. For instance, we will show that by allowing the dark electron to have a sufficiently high mass and/or low charge, our approach suppresses both Hawking radiation and the Schwinger effect, effectively extending even the lifespan of PBHs with masses smaller than $10^{-15} M_{\odot}$ beyond the current age of the universe. We will finally present a new lower bound on the allowed mass range for dark-charged PBHs as a function of the dark electron charge and mass, showing that the PBHs' mass can get to at least as low as $10^{-24}M_\odot$ depending on the dark electron properties. This demonstrates that the phenomenology of the evaporation of PBHs is ill-served by a focus solely on Schwarzschild black holes.</description>

      <title>Nuclear recoil detection with color centers in bulk lithium fluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present initial results on nuclear recoil detection based on the fluorescence of color centers created by nuclear recoils in lithium fluoride. We use gamma rays, fast and thermal neutrons, and study the difference in responses they induce, showing that this type of detector is rather insensitive to gamma rays. We use light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to image nuclear recoil tracks from fast and thermal neutron interactions deep inside a cubic-centimeter sized crystal and demonstrate automated feature extraction in three dimensions using machine learning tools. The number, size, and topology of the events agree with expectations based on simulations with TRIM. These results constitute the first step towards 10-1000g scale detectors with single-event sensitivity for applications such as the detection of dark matter particles, reactor neutrinos, and neutrons.</description>

      <title>Detectability of the chiral gravitational wave background from audible axions with the LISA-Taiji network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral gravitational wave background (GWB) can be produced by axion-like fields in the early universe. We perform parameter estimation for two types of chiral GWB with the LISA-Taiji network: axion-dark photon coupling and axion-Nieh-Yan coupling. We estimate the spectral parameters of these two mechanisms induced by axion and determine the normalized model parameters using the Fisher information matrix. For highly chiral GWB signals that we choose to analyze in the mHz band, the normalized model parameters are constrained with a relative error less than $6.7\%$ (dark photon coupling) and $2.2\%$ (Nieh-Yan coupling) at the one-sigma confidence level. The circular polarization parameters are constrained with a relative error around $21\%$ (dark photon coupling) and $6.2\%$ (Nieh-Yan coupling) at the one-sigma confidence level.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the coalescence behavior of Coulomb-Schr\"odinger atomic wave functions from an operator product expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:1809.09023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the coalescence behavior of the atomic Schr\"odinger wave functions from the angle of an operator product expansion (OPE) within the nonrelativistic Coulomb-Schr\"odinger effective field theory. We take the electron-nucleus coalescence as an explicit example to demonstrate our formalism, where the celebrated Kato's cusp condition can be easily reproduced. An exact OPE relation is rigorously proved to all orders in perturbation theory. Our approach can be readily extended to ascertain the multi-particle coalescence behaviors of atomic wave functions, as well as to take relativistic effects into account.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching Beyond Kinematics: Generating Jets with Particle-ID and Trajectory Displacement Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the first generative model trained on the JetClass dataset. Our model generates jets at the constituent level, and it is a permutation-equivariant continuous normalizing flow (CNF) trained with the flow matching technique. It is conditioned on the jet type, so that a single model can be used to generate the ten different jet types of JetClass. For the first time, we also introduce a generative model that goes beyond the kinematic features of jet constituents. The JetClass dataset includes more features, such as particle-ID and track impact parameter, and we demonstrate that our CNF can accurately model all of these additional features as well. Our generative model for JetClass expands on the versatility of existing jet generation techniques, enhancing their potential utility in high-energy physics research, and offering a more comprehensive understanding of the generated jets.</description>

      <title>Model Independent Tests of the Hadronic Vacuum Polarization Contribution to the Muon $g$$-$$2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contributions to the muon $g$$-$$2$ are the crucial quantity to resolve whether new physics is present or not in the comparison between the Standard Model (SM) prediction and experimental measurements at Fermilab. They are commonly and historically determined via dispersion relations using a vast catalogue of experimentally measured, low-energy $e^+e^-\to \,\rm{hadrons}$ cross section data as input. These dispersive estimates result in a SM prediction that exhibits a muon $g$$-$$2$ discrepancy of more than $5\sigma$ when compared to experiment. However, recent lattice QCD evaluations of the HVP and a new hadronic cross section measurement from the CMD-3 experiment favor a no-new-physics scenario and, therefore, exhibit a common tension with the previous $e^+e^-\to \,\rm{hadrons}$ data. This study explores the current and future implications of these two scenarios on other observables that are also sensitive to the HVP contributions in the hope that they may provide independent tests of the current tensions observed in the muon $g$$-$$2$.</description>

      <title>Transition signatures for electron-positron pair creation in space-time inhomogeneous electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of electron-positron pair creation through multi-photon absorption in a space-time dependent electric field is analyzed using computational quantum field theory. Our findings reveal two distinct pair creation channels: the symmetric and asymmetric transition channels. We propose that the asymmetric transition channel arises from the inherent spatial inhomogeneity of intense laser pulses. By mapping the field-theoretical model of laser-assisted multi-photon pair creation onto a quantum-mechanical time-dependent framework, a semi-analytical solution that captures the asymmetric transition signatures of vacuum decay is derived. Additionally, it is demonstrated that neglecting spatial inhomogeneity leads to erroneous transition amplitudes and incorrect identification of pair creation channels. Furthermore, we have established that asymmetric transition channels substantially enhance the creation of electron-positron pairs for a given laser pulse energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Xenon and argon are the two noble gases used in tonne scale dark matter direct detection experiments. We compare the detection capability of both target elements for interactions due to a pseudoscalar mediator including loop-level contributions to the cross section. At tree-level this type of interaction depends on the nuclear spin and would thus not be detectable in argon-based detectors, since Ar has spin zero. However, at the loop-level the same interaction yields spin-independent contributions that would be detectable in an argon target and are not negligible with respect to the tree-level interactions in xenon, because these are momentum suppressed. In fact, the loop-level contributions are also important for xenon-based experiments at low recoil energies, which could change their discovery reach for this interaction.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the direct detection of the Higgsino-(and Wino-)like neutralino dark matter: Spin-dependent interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lightest neutralino ($\tilde{\chi}_1^0$) is a promising dark matter (DM) candidate in the R-parity conserving minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). In this work, we focus on dominantly Higgsino-like and Wino-like $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ DM, with small admixtures of gauginos and Higgsinos, respectively. In particular, we explore large one-loop corrections to the $\tilde{\chi}_1^0 \tilde{\chi}_1^0Z$ vertex, which can significantly affect the estimation of the spin-dependent $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$-nucleon scattering cross-section in the regions where such DM candidates are viable. We have used the on-shell renormalization scheme to estimate the relevant counterterm contributions. In the parameter region where $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$ is dominantly Higgsino-like, the radiative corrections (including the contributions from the respective counterterms) are substantial and can enhance the $\tilde{\chi}_1^0\tilde{\chi}_1^0Z$ vertex by up to $\sim 120\%$ for the benchmark scenarios we have considered. Further, for an almost pure Wino-like $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$, the increment in the $\tilde{\chi}_1^0\tilde{\chi}_1^0Z$ vertex is up to $15\%$. The corresponding cross-sections with the proton and the neutron can be changed by up to about $50\%$. In addition, including the electroweak box diagrams, the cross-sections can be significantly enhanced, in particular, for the Wino-like $\tilde{\chi}_1^0$.</description>

      <title>Phase transition analogs in laser collisions with a dark-field setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser pulse collisions are a promising tool for the investigation of light-by-light scattering phenomena induced by quantum vacuum fluctuations. Using the numerical code based on the vacuum emission picture and put forward in Blinne et al. (2019), we observe a strong dependence of the signal features on the transverse profiles of the colliding laser pulses in the interaction region. For a probe beam tailored such as to feature an annular far-field profile and a pronounced on-axis focus peak counterpropagating a pump beam at zero impact parameter, the signal's main emission direction can undergo the analog of a phase transition with the beam-waist ratio of the pulses serving as a control parameter. Depending on the pump's beam profile, this phase transition can be first order (e.g., for a pump with a flat-top far-field profile) or second order (e.g., for a Gaussian pump). From the simulation data, we determine the critical point and extract the corresponding critical exponent for the second-order transition of the main emission direction of the signal in the far field. For this, we improve the performance of the above numerical code, using the phase transition analogs as an example to illustrate the capabilities and limitations of the code and current workflows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for heavy $W'$ bosons in their decay modes to a lepton and a heavy neutrino offers a promising avenue for probing new physics beyond the Standard Model. This work focuses on such a signature with an energetic lepton plus a fat jet, originating from the heavy neutrino and containing a lepton. We have employed the jet substructure techniques to isolate the embedded lepton as a subjet of the fat jet. The Lepton Subjet Fraction ($LSF$) and Lepton Mass Drop ($LMD$) variables constructed from the lepton subjet help in separating the signal region from the background. We further study the polarization properties of the $W'$ coupling to the lepton and heavy neutrino through the decay products of the neutrino. Instead of relying on a specific model, we employ generic couplings and explore the discrimination power. Jet substructure-based angular variables $z_\ell$, $z_\theta$, and $z_k$ are combined to form BDT scores to obtain better separation power between left-chiral ($V-A$) and right-chiral ($V+A$) coupling configurations. By using $CL_s$ type profile likelihood estimator, we could achieve $\sim$ 2$\sigma$ $-$ 3$\sigma$ significance of excluding one coupling configuration in favour of the other.</description>

      <title>Precise predictions for $t \bar t H$ production at the LHC: inclusive cross section and differential distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first fully differential next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD calculation for the production of a top-antitop quark pair in association with a Higgs boson ($t \bar t H$) at hadron colliders. The computation is exact, except for the finite part of the two-loop virtual contribution, which we estimate using two different methods that yield consistent results within their respective uncertainties. The first method relies on a soft-Higgs factorisation formula that we develop up to the three-loop order. The second is based on a high-energy expansion in the small top-mass limit. Combining the newly computed corrections with the complete set of next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD+EW results provides the most advanced perturbative prediction currently available at the LHC for both inclusive and differential $t \bar t H$ cross sections. The uncertainties due to the missing exact two-loop contribution are conservatively estimated to be at the percent level, both for the total cross section and for most of the differential distributions, and therefore subleading compared to the residual perturbative uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Correlating $A \to \gamma\gamma$ with electric dipole moments in the two Higgs doublet model in light of the diphoton excesses at 95 GeV and 152 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the correlations between new scalar boson decays to photons and electric dipole moments (EDMs) in the CP-violating flavor-aligned two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). It is convenient to work in the Higgs basis $\{{H}_1, {H}_2\}$ where only the first Higgs doublet field ${H}_1$ acquires a vacuum expectation value. In light of the LHC Higgs data, which agree well with Standard Model (SM) predictions, it follows that the parameters of the 2HDM are consistent with the Higgs alignment limit. In this parameter regime, the observed SM-like Higgs boson resides almost entirely in ${H}_1$, and the other two physical neutral scalars, which reside almost entirely in ${H}_2$, are approximate eigenstates of CP (denoted by the CP-even $H$ and the CP-odd $A$). In the Higgs basis, the scalar potential term $\bar{Z}_7 {H}_1^\dagger {H}_2 {H}_2^\dagger {H}_2+{\rm h.c.}$ governs the charged-Higgs loop contributions to the decay of $H$ and $A$ to photons. If $ \text{Re } \bar{Z}_7 \, \text{Im } \bar{Z}_7 \neq 0$, then CP-violating effects are present and allow for an $H^+ H^- A$ coupling, which can yield a sizable branching ratio for $A\to\gamma\gamma$. These CP-violating effects also generate non-zero EDMs for the electron, the neutron and the proton. We examine these correlations for the cases of $m_{A}=95$ GeV and $m_{A}=152$ GeV where interesting excesses in the diphoton spectrum have been observed at the LHC. These excesses can be explained via the decay of $A$ while being consistent with the experimental bound for the electron EDM in regions of parameter space that can be tested with future neutron and proton EDM measurements. This allows for the interesting possibility where the 95 GeV diphoton excess can be identified with $A$, while $m_H\simeq 98$ GeV can account for the best fit to the LEP excess in $e^+e^-\to ZH$ with $H\to b\bar b$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the newly observed $T_{c\bar{s}}$ state in the $D_{s1}(2460)^{+} \rightarrow D_{s}^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ reaction by the LHCb Collaboration, we investigate the amplitude of this decay to explore the origins and properties of the open-charm tetraquark state based on the final state interaction. The invariant mass distributions of $D_{s}^{+}\pi^{+}$ and $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ are well reproduced by the $S$-wave scattering amplitudes of the coupled channel systems $D_{s}\pi$ and $\pi\pi$. However, neither the tree-level nor both the tree-level and $\pi\pi$ coupled channel scattering contributions can describe the experimental data well, which indicates that the $D_{s}\pi$ coupled channel scattering is required. We find that the $T_{c\bar{s}}$ and $f_{0}(500)$ resonances are dynamically generated from the pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar meson interaction within the chiral unitary approach. In addition, we find the corresponding poles and also calculate the $S$-wave scattering length for the $DK$ channel, which is on the same scale as the result extracted from the experiment. We propose that the $T_{c\bar{s}}$ and $f_{0}(500)$ resonances in the $D_{s1}(2460)^{+} \rightarrow D_{s}^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ reaction are hadronic molecular type particles.</description>

      <title>Two portals to GeV sterile neutrinos : dipole versus mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive sterile neutrinos, also known as heavy neutral leptons, can have a mixing with active neutrinos, $\theta$, as well as a dipole coupling to the photon, $d$. We study the interplay between these two portals, considering the production from meson decays of sterile neutrinos with mass $0.1$ GeV $\lesssim M_N \lesssim 10$ GeV, at beam-dump facilities such as NA62 and SHiP, and at the FASER2 experiment. These sterile neutrinos can be long-lived and decay into a photon in a distant detector, via the dipole operator. We find that all these experiments will be sensitive to values of $d$ which are presently unconstrained. The experimental reach varies strongly with the mass $M_N$ and the mixing $\theta$, and one observes specific correlations with the flavour of active neutrinos. The SHiP experiment will mark a jump in sensitivity: (i) it will probe a sterile dipole as small as $d\sim 10^{-8}$ GeV$^{-1}$, thus testing new physics well above the electroweak scale; (ii) it may detect the active-sterile dipole to the level predicted by electroweak loops, if $\theta$ is close to the present bound.</description>

      <title>Permuted Charged Lepton Correction in the Framework of Dirac Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Dirac neutrino mass model is proposed, based on an extended group structure of $SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y \otimes A_4 \otimes Z_3 \otimes Z_{10}$ with the Type-I seesaw mechanism. This work explores the impact of parametrization and permutation in the charged lepton diagonalizing matrix, driven by free parameters in the charged lepton sector, on the predictions of observable parameters. Some interesting consequences on the neutrino mass hierarchies, mixing angles and the Dirac CP phase are observed. The framework also finds application in the study of charged lepton flavour violation and dark matter.</description>

      <title>Calculating the EFT likelihood via saddle-point expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the functional approach for calculating the EFT likelihood by applying the saddle-point expansion. We demonstrate that, after suitable reformulation, the likelihood expression is consistent with the path integral required to be computed in the theory of false vacuum decay. In contrast to the saddle-point approximation, the application of the saddle-point expansion necessitates more nuanced considerations, particularly concerning the treatment of the negative eigenvalues of the second derivative of the action at the saddle point. We illustrate that a similar issue arises in the likelihood calculation, which requires approximating the original integral contour through the combination of the steepest descent contours in the field space. As a concrete example, we focus on calculating the EFT likelihood under a Gaussian distribution and propose a general procedure for computing the likelihood using the saddle-point expansion method for arbitrary partition functions. Precise computation of the likelihood will benefit Bayesian forward modeling, thereby enabling more reliable theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Future collider constraints on top-quark operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present updated constraints on the top-quark sector of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory using data available from Tevatron, LEP and the LHC. Bounds are obtained for the Wilson coefficients from a global fit including the relevant two-fermion operators, four-quark operators and two-quark two-lepton operators. We compare the current bounds with the prospects for the high luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider and future lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Supernova production of axion-like particles coupling to electrons, reloaded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the production of axion-like particles (ALPs) coupled to electrons at tree-level in a relativistic plasma. We explicitly demonstrate the equivalence between pseudoscalar and derivative couplings, incorporate previously neglected processes for the first time-namely, semi-Compton production ($\gamma e^-\rightarrow a e^-$) and pair annihilation ($e^+e^-\rightarrow a\gamma$)-and derive analytical expressions for the bremsstrahlung ($e^- N\to e^- N a$) production rate, enabling a more computationally efficient evaluation of the ALP flux. Additionally, we assess uncertainties in the production rate arising from electron thermal mass corrections, electron-electron Coulomb interactions, and the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect. The ALP emissivity is made available in a public repository as a function of the ALP mass, the temperature, and the electron chemical potential of the plasma. Finally, we examine the impact of ALP production and subsequent decays on astrophysical observables, deriving the leading bounds on ALPs coupling to electrons. At small couplings, the dominant constraints come from the previously neglected decay $a\to e^+ e^-\gamma$, except for a region of fireball formation where SN 1987A X-ray observations offer the best probe. At large couplings, bounds are dominated by the energy deposition argument, with a recently developed new prescription for the trapping regime.</description>

      <title>Fermion Masses and Mixings in String Theory with Dirac Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19458v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape on a $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold in IIA string theory, we have found only two models that accurately account for all standard model fermion masses and mixings. The models are dual to each other under the exchange of two SU(2) sectors and feature 12 adjoint scalars, the maximum number allowed in the landscape, whose linear combination yields the two light Higgs eigenstates. Dirac neutrino-masses in normal ordering $(50.6,~10.6,~6.2)\pm 0.1$~meV satisfying both the experimental as well as swampland constraints.</description>

      <title>Advection Algorithms for Quantum Neutrino Moment Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino transport in compact objects is an inherently challenging multi-dimensional problem. This difficulty is compounded if one includes flavor transformation -- an intrinsically quantum phenomenon requiring one to follow the coherence between flavors and thus necessitating the introduction of complex numbers. To reduce the computational burden, simulations of compact objects that include neutrino transport often make use of momentum-angle-integrated moments (the lowest order ones being commonly referred to as the energy density and flux) and these quantities can be generalized to include neutrino flavor, i.e., they become quantum moments. Numerous finite-volume approaches to solving the moment evolution equations for classical neutrino transport have been developed based on solving a Riemann problem at cell interfaces. In this paper we describe our generalization of a Riemann solver for quantum moments, specifically decomposing complex numbers in terms of a (signed) magnitude and phase instead of real and imaginary parts. We then test our new algorithm in numerous cases showing a neutrino fast flavor instability, varying from toy models with analytic solutions to snapshots from neutron star merger simulations. Compared to previous algorithms for neutrino transport with flavor mixing, we find uniformly smaller growth rates of the flavor transformation along with concomitantly larger length-scales, and that the results are a better match with the growth rates seen from multi-angle codes.</description>

      <title>Association of 220 PeV Neutrino KM3-230213A with Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14471v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration announced the detection of a 220 PeV neutrino from the celestial coordinates RA=94.3\degree~ and Dec=-7.8\degree~ on 13 February 2023 at 01:16:47 UTC \cite{KM3NeT:2025npi}. The source for this extra-ordinary cosmic neutrino, designated KM3-230213A, is not identified yet but there has been speculation that it might be associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB~090401B \cite{Amelino-Camelia:2025lqn}. The purpose of this report is to search the association of this 220 PeV neutrino with potential GRB sources from a more general consideration of Lorentz invariance violation (LV) without predefined LV scale. We try to associate this extra-ordinary neutrino with potential GRBs within angular separation of 1\degree, 3\degree~ and 5\degree~ respectively and the results are listed in Table 1. We find the constraints $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.3\times 10^{18}$~GeV for subluminal LV violation and $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.6\times 10^{19}$~GeV for superluminal LV violation if KM3-230213A is a GRB neutrino.</description>
