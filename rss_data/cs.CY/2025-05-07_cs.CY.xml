      <title>The Precautionary Principle and the Innovation Principle: Incompatible Guides for AI Innovation Governance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In policy debates concerning the governance and regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), both the Precautionary Principle (PP) and the Innovation Principle (IP) are advocated by their respective interest groups. Do these principles offer wholly incompatible and contradictory guidance? Does one necessarily negate the other? I argue here that provided attention is restricted to weak-form PP and IP, the answer to both of these questions is "No." The essence of these weak formulations is the requirement to fully account for type-I error costs arising from erroneously preventing the innovation's diffusion through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory red-lighting) as well as the type-II error costs arising from erroneously allowing the innovation to diffuse through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory green-lighting). Within the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model developed here, weak-PP red-light (weak-IP green-light) determinations are optimal for sufficiently small (large) ratios of expected type-I to type-II error costs. For intermediate expected cost ratios, an amber-light 'wait-and-monitor' policy is optimal. Regulatory sandbox instruments allow AI testing and experimentation to take place within a structured environment of limited duration and societal scale, whereby the expected cost ratio falls within the 'wait-and-monitor' range. Through sandboxing regulators and innovating firms learn more about the expected cost ratio, and what respective adaptations -- of regulation, of technical solution, of business model, or combination thereof, if any -- are needed to keep the ratio out of the weak-PP red-light zone.</description>

      <title>Aligning Large Language Models with Healthcare Stakeholders: A Pathway to Trustworthy AI Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wide exploration of large language models (LLMs) raises the awareness of alignment between healthcare stakeholder preferences and model outputs. This alignment becomes a crucial foundation to empower the healthcare workflow effectively, safely, and responsibly. Yet the varying behaviors of LLMs may not always match with healthcare stakeholders' knowledge, demands, and values. To enable a human-AI alignment, healthcare stakeholders will need to perform essential roles in guiding and enhancing the performance of LLMs. Human professionals must participate in the entire life cycle of adopting LLM in healthcare, including training data curation, model training, and inference. In this review, we discuss the approaches, tools, and applications of alignments between healthcare stakeholders and LLMs. We demonstrate that LLMs can better follow human values by properly enhancing healthcare knowledge integration, task understanding, and human guidance. We provide outlooks on enhancing the alignment between humans and LLMs to build trustworthy real-world healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing tutoring systems by leveraging tailored promptings and domain knowledge with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have reignited interest in their impact on Computer-based Learning (CBL). AI-driven tools like ChatGPT and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have enhanced learning experiences through personalisation and flexibility. ITSs can adapt to individual learning needs and provide customised feedback based on a student's performance, cognitive state, and learning path. Despite these advances, challenges remain in accommodating diverse learning styles and delivering real-time, context-aware feedback. Our research aims to address these gaps by integrating skill-aligned feedback via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) into prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs) and developing an application to enhance learning through personalised tutoring in a computer science programming context. The pilot study evaluated a proposed system using three quantitative metrics: readability score, response time, and feedback depth, across three programming tasks of varying complexity. The system successfully sorted simulated students into three skill-level categories and provided context-aware feedback. This targeted approach demonstrated better effectiveness and adaptability compared to general methods.</description>

      <title>A Computational Model of Inclusive Pedagogy: From Understanding to Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human education transcends mere knowledge transfer, it relies on co-adaptation dynamics -- the mutual adjustment of teaching and learning strategies between agents. Despite its centrality, computational models of co-adaptive teacher-student interactions (T-SI) remain underdeveloped. We argue that this gap impedes Educational Science in testing and scaling contextual insights across diverse settings, and limits the potential of Machine Learning systems, which struggle to emulate and adaptively support human learning processes. To address this, we present a computational T-SI model that integrates contextual insights on human education into a testable framework. We use the model to evaluate diverse T-SI strategies in a realistic synthetic classroom setting, simulating student groups with unequal access to sensory information. Results show that strategies incorporating co-adaptation principles (e.g., bidirectional agency) outperform unilateral approaches (i.e., where only the teacher or the student is active), improving the learning outcomes for all learning types. Beyond the testing and scaling of context-dependent educational insights, our model enables hypothesis generation in controlled yet adaptable environments. This work bridges non-computational theories of human education with scalable, inclusive AI in Education systems, providing a foundation for equitable technologies that dynamically adapt to learner needs.</description>

      <title>AI Education in a Mirror: Challenges Faced by Academic and Industry Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to evolve, the gap between academic AI education and real-world industry challenges remains an important area of investigation. This study provides preliminary insights into challenges AI professionals encounter in both academia and industry, based on semi-structured interviews with 14 AI experts - eight from industry and six from academia. We identify key challenges related to data quality and availability, model scalability, practical constraints, user behavior, and explainability. While both groups experience data and model adaptation difficulties, industry professionals more frequently highlight deployment constraints, resource limitations, and external dependencies, whereas academics emphasize theoretical adaptation and standardization issues. These exploratory findings suggest that AI curricula could better integrate real-world complexities, software engineering principles, and interdisciplinary learning, while recognizing the broader educational goals of building foundational and ethical reasoning skills.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Obstacles: Challenges of Gender Inequality in Undergraduate ICT Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Gender inequality is a widely discussed issue across various sectors, including Information Technology and Communication (ICT). In Brazil, women represent less than 18% of ICT students in higher education. Prior studies highlight gender-related barriers that discourage women from staying in ICT. However, they provide limited insights into their perceptions as undergraduate students and the factors influencing their participation and confidence. Goal: This study explores the perceptions of women undergraduate students in ICT regarding gender inequality. Method: A survey of 402 women from 18 Brazilian states enrolled in ICT courses was conducted using a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses. Results: Women students reported experiencing discriminatory practices from peers and professors, both inside and outside the classroom. Gender stereotypes were found to undermine their self-confidence and self-esteem, occasionally leading to course discontinuation. Conclusions: Factors such as lack of representation, inappropriate jokes, isolation, mistrust, and difficulty being heard contribute to harmful outcomes, including reduced participation and reluctance to take leadership roles. Addressing these issues is essential to creating a safe and respectful learning environment for all students.</description>

      <title>Understanding University Students' Use of Generative AI: The Roles of Demographics and Personality Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of generative AI (GAI) among university students is rapidly increasing, yet empirical research on students' GAI use and the factors influencing it remains limited. To address this gap, we surveyed 363 undergraduate and graduate students in the United States, examining their GAI usage and how it relates to demographic variables and personality traits based on the Big Five model (i.e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability, and intellect/imagination). Our findings reveal: (a) Students in higher academic years are more inclined to use GAI and prefer it over traditional resources. (b) Non-native English speakers use and adopt GAI more readily than native speakers. (c) Compared to White, Asian students report higher GAI usage, perceive greater academic benefits, and express a stronger preference for it. Similarly, Black students report a more positive impact of GAI on their academic performance. Personality traits also play a significant role in shaping perceptions and usage of GAI. After controlling demographic factors, we found that personality still significantly predicts GAI use and attitudes: (a) Students with higher conscientiousness use GAI less. (b) Students who are higher in agreeableness perceive a less positive impact of GAI on academic performance and express more ethical concerns about using it for academic work. (c) Students with higher emotional stability report a more positive impact of GAI on learning and fewer concerns about its academic use. (d) Students with higher extraversion show a stronger preference for GAI over traditional resources. (e) Students with higher intellect/imagination tend to prefer traditional resources. These insights highlight the need for universities to provide personalized guidance to ensure students use GAI effectively, ethically, and equitably in their academic pursuits.</description>

      <title>Urban Forms Across Continents: A Data-Driven Comparison of Lausanne and Philadelphia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding urban form is crucial for sustainable urban planning and enhancing quality of life. This study presents a data-driven framework to systematically identify and compare urban typologies across geographically and culturally distinct cities. Using open-source geospatial data from OpenStreetMap, we extracted multidimensional features related to topography, multimodality, green spaces, and points of interest for the cities of Lausanne, Switzerland, and Philadelphia, USA. A grid-based approach was used to divide each city into Basic Spatial Units (BSU), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) were applied to cluster BSUs based on their urban characteristics. The results reveal coherent and interpretable urban typologies within each city, with some cluster types emerging across both cities despite their differences in scale, density, and cultural context. Comparative analysis showed that adapting the grid size to each city's morphology improves the detection of shared typologies. Simplified clustering based solely on network degree centrality further demonstrated that meaningful structural patterns can be captured even with minimal feature sets. Our findings suggest the presence of functionally convergent urban forms across continents and highlight the importance of spatial scale in cross-city comparisons. The framework offers a scalable and transferable approach for urban analysis, providing valuable insights for planners and policymakers aiming to enhance walkability, accessibility, and well-being. Limitations related to data completeness and feature selection are discussed, and directions for future work -- including the integration of additional data sources and human-centered validation -- are proposed.</description>

      <title>The Cognitive Foundations of Economic Exchange: A Modular Framework Grounded in Behavioral Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in multi-agent AI is modeling social cooperation under realistic behavioral constraints. Many foundational concepts in economics and ethics such as "trust" or "morality" are often defined informally, without operational criteria or cognitive grounding, which limits their testability and implementation in artificial agents. Drawing on converging empirical evidence from primate behavior, infant cognition, and economic anthropology, we propose a conceptual framework composed of three cognitively minimal mechanisms: individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost return sensitivity. This framework reframes trust as a graded cognitive expectation, providing a simulateable basis for reciprocal exchange in artificial agents, and enabling the bottom-up emergence of scalable cooperation and institutional dynamics.</description>

      <title>Navigating Privacy and Trust: AI Assistants as Social Support for Older Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI assistants are increasingly integrated into older adults' daily lives, offering new opportunities for social support and accessibility while raising important questions about privacy, autonomy, and trust. As these systems become embedded in caregiving and social networks, older adults must navigate trade-offs between usability, data privacy, and personal agency across different interaction contexts. Although prior work has explored AI assistants' potential benefits, further research is needed to understand how perceived usefulness and risk shape adoption and engagement. This paper examines these dynamics and advocates for participatory design approaches that position older adults as active decision makers in shaping AI assistant functionality. By advancing a framework for privacy-aware, user-centered AI design, this work contributes to ongoing discussions on developing ethical and transparent AI systems that enhance well-being without compromising user control.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Large Language Models on K-12 Education in Rural India: A Thematic Analysis of Student Volunteer's Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-driven education, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to address learning disparities in rural K-12 schools. However, research on AI adoption in rural India remains limited, with existing studies focusing primarily on urban settings. This study examines the perceptions of volunteer teachers on AI integration in rural education, identifying key challenges and opportunities. Through semi-structured interviews with 23 volunteer educators in Rajasthan and Delhi, we conducted a thematic analysis to explore infrastructure constraints, teacher preparedness, and digital literacy gaps. Findings indicate that while LLMs could enhance personalized learning and reduce teacher workload, barriers such as poor connectivity, lack of AI training, and parental skepticism hinder adoption. Despite concerns over over-reliance and ethical risks, volunteers emphasize that AI should be seen as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for traditional teaching. Given the potential benefits, LLM-based tutors merit further exploration in rural classrooms, with structured implementation and localized adaptations to ensure accessibility and equity.</description>

      <title>Ruled by the Representation Space: On the University's Embrace of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the implications of universities' rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) for studying, teaching, and research by analyzing the logics underpinning their representation space. It argues that by uncritically adopting LLMs, the University surrenders its autonomy to a field of heteronomy, that of generative AI, whose norms are not democratically shaped. Unlike earlier forms of rule-based AI, which sought to exclude human judgment and interpretation, generative AI's new normative rationality is explicitly based on the automation of moral judgment, valuation, and interpretation. By integrating LLMs into pedagogical and research contexts before establishing a critical framework for their use, the University subjects itself to being governed by contingent, ever-evolving, and domain-non-specific norms that structure the model's virtual representation space and thus everything it generates.</description>

      <title>A Unifying Bias-aware Multidisciplinary Framework for Investigating Socio-Technical Issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to bring together the disciplines of social science (SS) and computer science (CS) in the design and implementation of a novel multidisciplinary framework for systematic, transparent, ethically-informed, and bias-aware investigation of socio-technical issues. For this, various analysis approaches from social science and machine learning (ML) were applied in a structured sequence to arrive at an original methodology of identifying and quantifying objects of inquiry. A core feature of this framework is that it highlights where bias occurs and suggests possible steps to mitigate it. This is to improve the robustness, reliability, and explainability of the framework and its results. Such an approach also ensures that the investigation of socio-technical issues is transparent about its own limitations and potential sources of bias. To test our framework, we utilised it in the multidisciplinary investigation of the online harms encountered by minoritised ethnic (ME) communities when accessing and using digitalised social housing services in the UK. We draw our findings from 100 interviews with ME individuals in four cities across the UK to understand ME vulnerabilities when accessing and using digitalised social housing services. In our framework, a sub-sample of interviews focusing on ME individuals residing in social housing units were inductively coded. This resulted in the identification of the topics of discrimination, digital poverty, lack of digital literacy, and lack of English proficiency as key vulnerabilities of ME communities. Further ML techniques such as Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis were used within our framework where we found that Black African communities are more likely to experience these vulnerabilities in the access, use and outcome of digitalised social housing services.</description>

      <title>Doing Audits Right? The Role of Sampling and Legal Content Analysis in Systemic Risk Assessments and Independent Audits in the Digital Services Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central requirement of the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) is that online platforms undergo internal and external audits. A key component of these audits is the assessment of systemic risks, including the dissemination of illegal content, threats to fundamental rights, impacts on democratic processes, and gender-based violence. The DSA Delegated Regulation outlines how such audits should be conducted, setting expectations for both platforms and auditors. This article evaluates the strengths and limitations of different qualitative and quantitative methods for auditing these systemic risks and proposes a mixed-method approach for DSA compliance. We argue that content sampling, combined with legal and empirical analysis, offers a viable method for risk-specific audits. First, we examine relevant legal provisions on sample selection for audit purposes. We then assess sampling techniques and methods suitable for detecting systemic risks, focusing on how representativeness can be understood across disciplines. Finally, we review initial systemic risk assessment reports submitted by platforms, analyzing their testing and sampling methodologies. By proposing a structured, mixed-method approach tailored to specific risk categories and platform characteristics, this article addresses the challenge of evidence-based audits under the DSA. Our contribution emphasizes the need for adaptable, context-sensitive auditing strategies and adds to the emerging field of DSA compliance research.</description>

Abstract: Assessing how well a large language model (LLM) understands human, rather than merely text, remains an open challenge. To bridge the gap, we introduce Sentient Agent as a Judge (SAGE), an automated evaluation framework that measures an LLM's higher-order social cognition. SAGE instantiates a Sentient Agent that simulates human-like emotional changes and inner thoughts during interaction, providing a more realistic evaluation of the tested model in multi-turn conversations. At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its emotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a numerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on 100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score correlates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings and utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also build a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source models that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems (GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in conventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena). SAGE thus provides a principled, scalable and interpretable tool for tracking progress toward genuinely empathetic and socially adept language agents.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Structured Knowledge: A Concept Map-Based Approach for High-Quality Multiple Choice Question Generation with Effective Distractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high-quality MCQs, especially those targeting diverse cognitive levels and incorporating common misconceptions into distractor design, is time-consuming and expertise-intensive, making manual creation impractical at scale. Current automated approaches typically generate questions at lower cognitive levels and fail to incorporate domain-specific misconceptions. This paper presents a hierarchical concept map-based framework that provides structured knowledge to guide LLMs in generating MCQs with distractors. We chose high-school physics as our test domain and began by developing a hierarchical concept map covering major Physics topics and their interconnections with an efficient database design. Next, through an automated pipeline, topic-relevant sections of these concept maps are retrieved to serve as a structured context for the LLM to generate questions and distractors that specifically target common misconceptions. Lastly, an automated validation is completed to ensure that the generated MCQs meet the requirements provided. We evaluate our framework against two baseline approaches: a base LLM and a RAG-based generation. We conducted expert evaluations and student assessments of the generated MCQs. Expert evaluation shows that our method significantly outperforms the baseline approaches, achieving a success rate of 75.20% in meeting all quality criteria compared to approximately 37% for both baseline methods. Student assessment data reveal that our concept map-driven approach achieved a significantly lower guess success rate of 28.05% compared to 37.10% for the baselines, indicating a more effective assessment of conceptual understanding. The results demonstrate that our concept map-based approach enables robust assessment across cognitive levels and instant identification of conceptual gaps, facilitating faster feedback loops and targeted interventions at scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present 30 Day Me, a habit formation application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to help users break down their goals into manageable, actionable steps and track their progress. Central to the app is the 30DAYGEN system, which generates 3,531 unique 30-day challenges sourced from over 15K webpages, and enables runtime search of challenge ideas aligned with user-defined goals. We showcase how LLMs can be harnessed to rapidly construct domain specific content corpora for behavioral and educational purposes, and propose a practical pipeline that incorporates effective LLM enhanced approaches for content generation and semantic deduplication.</description>

      <title>Towards High-Fidelity Synthetic Multi-platform Social Media Datasets via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media datasets are essential for research on a variety of topics, such as disinformation, influence operations, hate speech detection, or influencer marketing practices. However, access to social media datasets is often constrained due to costs and platform restrictions. Acquiring datasets that span multiple platforms, which is crucial for understanding the digital ecosystem, is particularly challenging. This paper explores the potential of large language models to create lexically and semantically relevant social media datasets across multiple platforms, aiming to match the quality of real data. We propose multi-platform topic-based prompting and employ various language models to generate synthetic data from two real datasets, each consisting of posts from three different social media platforms. We assess the lexical and semantic properties of the synthetic data and compare them with those of the real data. Our empirical findings show that using large language models to generate synthetic multi-platform social media data is promising, different language models perform differently in terms of fidelity, and a post-processing approach might be needed for generating high-fidelity synthetic datasets for research. In addition to the empirical evaluation of three state of the art large language models, our contributions include new fidelity metrics specific to multi-platform social media datasets.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Impact of Group Interactions on Climate-related Opinion Change in Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics models describe the evolution of behavioral changes within social networks and are essential for informing strategies aimed at fostering positive collective changes, such as climate action initiatives. When applied to social media interactions, these models typically represent social exchanges in a dyadic format to allow for a convenient encoding of interactions into a graph where edges represent the flow of information from one individual to another. However, this structural assumption fails to adequately reflect the nature of group discussions prevalent on many social media platforms. To address this limitation, we present a temporal hypergraph model that effectively captures the group dynamics inherent in conversational threads, and we apply it to discussions about climate change on Reddit. This model predicts temporal shifts in stance towards climate issues at the level of individual users. In contrast to traditional studies in opinion dynamics that typically rely on simulations or limited empirical validation, our approach is tested against a comprehensive ground truth estimated by a large language model at the level of individual user comments. Our findings demonstrate that using hypergraphs to model group interactions yields superior predictions of the microscopic dynamics of opinion formation, compared to state-of-the-art models based on dyadic interactions. Although our research contributes to the understanding of these complex social systems, significant challenges remain in capturing the nuances of how opinions are formed and evolve within online spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article describes SafeTab-H, a disclosure avoidance algorithm applied to the release of the U.S. Census Bureau's Detailed Demographic and Housing Characteristics File B (Detailed DHC-B) as part of the 2020 Census. The tabulations contain household statistics about household type and tenure iterated by the householder's detailed race, ethnicity, or American Indian and Alaska Native tribe and village at varying levels of geography. We describe the algorithmic strategy which is based on adding noise from a discrete Gaussian distribution and show that the algorithm satisfies a well-studied variant of differential privacy, called zero-concentrated differential privacy. We discuss how the implementation of the SafeTab-H codebase relies on the Tumult Analytics privacy library. We also describe the theoretical expected error properties of the algorithm and explore various aspects of its parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Cognitio Emergens: Agency, Dimensions, and Dynamics in Human-AI Knowledge Co-Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific knowledge creation is fundamentally transforming as humans and AI systems evolve beyond tool-user relationships into co-evolutionary epistemic partnerships. When AlphaFold revolutionized protein structure prediction, researchers described engaging with an epistemic partner that reshaped how they conceptualized fundamental relationships. This article introduces Cognitio Emergens (CE), a framework addressing critical limitations in existing models that focus on static roles or narrow metrics while failing to capture how scientific understanding emerges through recursive human-AI interaction over time. CE integrates three components addressing these limitations: Agency Configurations describing how authority distributes between humans and AI (Directed, Contributory, Partnership), with partnerships dynamically oscillating between configurations rather than following linear progression; Epistemic Dimensions capturing six specific capabilities emerging through collaboration across Discovery, Integration, and Projection axes, creating distinctive "capability signatures" that guide development; and Partnership Dynamics identifying forces shaping how these relationships evolve, particularly the risk of epistemic alienation where researchers lose interpretive control over knowledge they formally endorse. Drawing from autopoiesis theory, social systems theory, and organizational modularity, CE reveals how knowledge co-creation emerges through continuous negotiation of roles, values, and organizational structures. By reconceptualizing human-AI scientific collaboration as fundamentally co-evolutionary, CE offers a balanced perspective that neither uncritically celebrates nor unnecessarily fears AI's evolving role, instead providing conceptual tools for cultivating partnerships that maintain meaningful human participation while enabling transformative scientific breakthroughs.</description>

      <title>Validating the Effectiveness of a Large Language Model-based Approach for Identifying Children's Development across Various Free Play Settings in Kindergarten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free play is a fundamental aspect of early childhood education, supporting children's cognitive, social, emotional, and motor development. However, assessing children's development during free play poses significant challenges due to the unstructured and spontaneous nature of the activity. Traditional assessment methods often rely on direct observations by teachers, parents, or researchers, which may fail to capture comprehensive insights from free play and provide timely feedback to educators. This study proposes an innovative approach combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with learning analytics to analyze children's self-narratives of their play experiences. The LLM identifies developmental abilities, while performance scores across different play settings are calculated using learning analytics techniques. We collected 2,224 play narratives from 29 children in a kindergarten, covering four distinct play areas over one semester. According to the evaluation results from eight professionals, the LLM-based approach achieved high accuracy in identifying cognitive, motor, and social abilities, with accuracy exceeding 90% in most domains. Moreover, significant differences in developmental outcomes were observed across play settings, highlighting each area's unique contributions to specific abilities. These findings confirm that the proposed approach is effective in identifying children's development across various free play settings. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating LLMs and learning analytics to provide child-centered insights into developmental trajectories, offering educators valuable data to support personalized learning and enhance early childhood education practices.</description>

Abstract: Public deliberation, as in open discussion of issues of public concern, often suffers from scattered and shallow discourse, poor sensemaking, and a disconnect from actionable policy outcomes. This paper introduces BCause, a discussion system leveraging generative AI and human-machine collaboration to transform unstructured dialogue around public issues (such as urban living, policy changes, and current socio-economic transformations) into structured, actionable democratic processes. We present three innovations: (i) importing and transforming unstructured transcripts into argumentative discussions, (ii) geo-deliberated problem-sensing via a Telegram bot for local issue reporting, and (iii) smart reporting with customizable widgets (e.g., summaries, topic modelling, policy recommendations, clustered arguments). The system's human-AI partnership preserves critical human participation to ensure ethical oversight, contextual relevance, and creative synthesis.</description>

Abstract: The AI research community plays a vital role in shaping the scientific, engineering, and societal goals of AI research. In this position paper, we argue that focusing on the highly contested topic of `artificial general intelligence' (`AGI') undermines our ability to choose effective goals. We identify six key traps -- obstacles to productive goal setting -- that are aggravated by AGI discourse: Illusion of Consensus, Supercharging Bad Science, Presuming Value-Neutrality, Goal Lottery, Generality Debt, and Normalized Exclusion. To avoid these traps, we argue that the AI research community needs to (1) prioritize specificity in engineering and societal goals, (2) center pluralism about multiple worthwhile approaches to multiple valuable goals, and (3) foster innovation through greater inclusion of disciplines and communities. Therefore, the AI research community needs to stop treating `AGI' as the north-star goal of AI research.</description>

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) has sparked significant debate over balancing the interests of creative rightsholders and AI developers. As GenAI models are trained on vast datasets that often include copyrighted material, questions around fair compensation and proper attribution have become increasingly urgent. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework called Content ARCs (Authenticity, Rights, Compensation). By combining open standards for provenance and dynamic licensing with data attribution, and decentralized technologies, Content ARCs create a mechanism for managing rights and compensating creators for using their work in AI training. We characterize several nascent works in the AI data licensing space within Content ARCs and identify where challenges remain to fully implement the end-to-end framework.</description>

      <title>Social Opinions Prediction Utilizes Fusing Dynamics Equation with LLM-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08717v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context where social media emerges as a pivotal platform for social movements and shaping public opinion, accurately simulating and predicting the dynamics of user opinions is of significant importance. Such insights are vital for understanding social phenomena, informing policy decisions, and guiding public opinion. Unfortunately, traditional algorithms based on idealized models and disregarding social data often fail to capture the complexity and nuance of real-world social interactions. This study proposes the Fusing Dynamics Equation-Large Language Model (FDE-LLM) algorithm. This innovative approach aligns the actions and evolution of opinions in Large Language Models (LLMs) with the real-world data on social networks. The FDE-LLM devides users into two roles: opinion leaders and followers. Opinion leaders use LLM for role-playing and employ Cellular Automata(CA) to constrain opinion changes. In contrast, opinion followers are integrated into a dynamic system that combines the CA model with the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. This innovative design significantly improves the accuracy of the simulation. Our experiments utilized four real-world datasets from Weibo. The result demonstrates that the FDE-LLM significantly outperforms traditional Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) algorithms and LLM-based algorithms. Additionally, our algorithm accurately simulates the decay and recovery of opinions over time, underscoring LLMs potential to revolutionize the understanding of social media dynamics.</description>

      <title>CounterQuill: Investigating the Potential of Human-AI Collaboration in Online Counterspeech Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online hate speech has become increasingly prevalent on social media platforms, causing harm to individuals and society. While efforts have been made to combat this issue through content moderation, the potential of user-driven counterspeech as an alternative solution remains underexplored. Existing counterspeech methods often face challenges such as fear of retaliation and skill-related barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce CounterQuill, an AI-mediated system that assists users in composing effective and empathetic counterspeech. CounterQuill provides a three-step process: (1) a learning session to help users understand hate speech and counterspeech; (2) a brainstorming session that guides users in identifying key elements of hate speech and exploring counterspeech strategies; and (3) a co-writing session that enables users to draft and refine their counterspeech with CounterQuill. We conducted a within-subjects user study with 20 participants to evaluate CounterQuill in comparison to ChatGPT. Results show that CounterQuill's guidance and collaborative writing process provided users a stronger sense of ownership over their co-authored counterspeech. Users perceived CounterQuill as a writing partner and thus were more willing to post the co-written counterspeech online compared to the one written with ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing inspired paintings: reinterpreting classical masterpieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to apply a quantum computing technique to compose artworks. The main idea is to revisit three paintings of different styles and historical periods: ''Narciso'', painted circa 1597-1599 by Michelangelo Merisi (Caravaggio), ''Les fils de l'homme'', painted in 1964 by Rene Magritte and ''192 Farben'', painted in 1966 by Gerard Richter. We utilize the output of a quantum computation to change the composition in the paintings, leading to a paintings series titled ''Quantum Transformation I, II, III''. In particular, the figures are discretized into square lattices and the order of the pieces is changed according to the result of the quantum simulation. We consider an Ising Hamiltonian as the observable in the quantum computation and its time evolution as the final outcome. From a classical subject to abstract forms, we seek to combine classical and quantum aesthetics through these three art pieces. Besides experimenting with hardware runs and circuit noise, our goal is to reproduce these works as physical oil paintings on wooden panels. With this process, we complete a full circle between classical and quantum techniques and contribute to rethinking Art practice in the era of quantum computing technologies.</description>

Abstract: This study addresses the growing concern of information asymmetry in consumer contracts, exacerbated by the proliferation of online services with complex Terms of Service that are rarely even read. Even though research on automatic analysis methods is conducted, the problem is aggravated by the general focus on English-language Machine Learning approaches and on major jurisdictions, such as the European Union. We introduce a new methodology and a substantial dataset addressing this gap. We propose a novel annotation scheme with four categories and a total of 20 classes, and apply it on 50 online Terms of Service used in Chile. Our evaluation of transformer-based models highlights how factors like language- and/or domain-specific pre-training, few-shot sample size, and model architecture affect the detection and classification of potentially abusive clauses. Results show a large variability in performance for the different tasks and models, with the highest macro-F1 scores for the detection task ranging from 79% to 89% and micro-F1 scores up to 96%, while macro-F1 scores for the classification task range from 60% to 70% and micro-F1 scores from 64% to 80%. Notably, this is the first Spanish-language multi-label classification dataset for legal clauses, applying Chilean law and offering a comprehensive evaluation of Spanish-language models in the legal domain. Our work lays the ground for future research in method development for rarely considered legal analysis and potentially leads to practical applications to support consumers in Chile and Latin America as a whole.</description>

      <title>Firewalls to Secure Dynamic LLM Agentic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future LLM agents are likely to communicate on behalf of users with other entity-representing agents on tasks that entail long-horizon plans with interdependent goals. Current work does not focus on such agentic networks, nor does it address their challenges. Thus, we first identify the required properties of agents' communication, which should be proactive and adaptable. It needs to satisfy 1) privacy: agents should not share more than what is needed for the task, and 2) security: the communication must preserve integrity and maintain utility against selfish entities. We design a use case (travel planning) as a testbed that exemplifies these requirements, and we show examples of how this can go wrong. Next, we propose a practical design, inspired by established network security principles, for constrained LLM agentic networks that balance adaptability, security, and privacy. Our framework automatically constructs and updates task-specific rules from prior simulations to build firewalls. We offer layers of defense to 1) convert free-form input to a task-specific protocol, 2) dynamically abstract users' data to a task-specific degree of permissiveness, and 3) self-correct the agents' trajectory.</description>

      <title>Grassroots Democratic Federation: Fair Governance of Large-Scale, Decentralized, Sovereign Digital Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grassroots Democratic Federation aims to address the egalitarian formation and the fair democratic governance of large-scale, decentralized, sovereign digital communities, the size of the EU, the US, existing social networks, and even humanity at large. A grassroots democratic federation evolves via the grassroots formation of digital communities and their consensual federation. Such digital communities may form according to geography, jurisdiction, affiliations, relations, interests, or causes. Small communities (say up to 100 members) govern themselves; larger communities -- no matter how large -- are governed by a small assembly elected by sortition among its members. Earlier work on Grassroots Democratic Federation explored the fair sortition of the assemblies of a federation in a static setting: Given a federation, populate its assemblies with members satisfying ex ante and ex post fairness conditions on the participation of members of a community in its assembly, and on the representation of child communities in the assembly of their parent community.
  In practice, we expect a grassroots democratic federation to grow and evolve dynamically and in all directions -- bottom-up, top-down, and middle-out. To address that, we formally specify this dynamic setting and adapt the static fairness conditions to it: The ex post condition on the fair representation of a child community becomes a condition that must always hold; the ex ante conditions in expectation on the fair participation of an individual and on the fair representation of a child community become conditions satisfied in actuality in the limit, provided the federation structure eventually stabilizes. We then present a protocol that satisfies these fairness conditions.</description>
