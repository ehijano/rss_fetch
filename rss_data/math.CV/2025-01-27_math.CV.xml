      <title>Free infinite divisibility, fractional convolution powers, and Appell polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20488v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initiated by a result of Gorin and Marcus [Int. Math. Res. Not., (3):883--913, 2020] and an observation of Steinerberger [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 147(11):4733--4744, 2019], there has been a recent growing body of literature connecting repeated differentiation of polynomials to free additive convolution semigroups in free probability. Roughly, this connection states that in the large degree limit the empirical measure of the roots after many derivatives is, up to a rescaling, the original empirical measure of the roots raised to a free additive convolution power. If the original real roots satisfy some bounds and the number of derivatives is such that the remaining degree is fixed, then these high derivatives converge to the Hermite polynomials. In the context of convolution semigroups and finite free probability these results have a natural interpretation as a central limit theorem for repeated differentiation. We consider the case when these root bounds are removed and identify the potential limits of repeated differentiation as the real rooted Appell sequences. We prove that a sequence of polynomials is in the domain of attraction of an Appell sequence exactly when the empirical measures of the roots are, up to a rescaling, in the domain of attraction of a free infinitely divisible distribution naturally associated to the Appell sequence. We additionally extend these notions of infinite divisibility and fractional convolution semigroups to rectangular finite free probability. Our approach is based on the finite free R-transform of the polynomials, providing a step towards an analytic theory of finite free probability. These transforms provide a clear connection between Appell polynomials and free infinitely divisible distributions, where the finite free R-transform of a real rooted Appell polynomial is a truncated version of the R-transform of an infinitely divisible distribution.</description>

      <title>Hardy operators: In the footsteps of Brown, Halmos, and Shields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the two classical Hardy operators $\mathcal{H}_{1}$ on $L^2(0, 1)$ and $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ on $L^2(0, \infty)$ initially studied by Brown, Halmos and Shields. Particular emphasis is given to the construction of explicit cyclic and $*$-cyclic vectors in conjunction with a characterization of their invariant and reducing subspaces. We also provide a complete description of the frame vectors for $I - \mathcal{H}_{1}^{*}$.</description>

      <title>Composition of analytic paraproducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed analytic function $g$ on the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$, we consider the analytic paraproducts induced by $g$, which are defined by $T_gf(z)= \int_0^z f(\zeta)g'(\zeta)\,d\zeta$, $S_gf(z)= \int_0^z f'(\zeta)g(\zeta)\,d\zeta$, and $M_gf(z)= f(z)g(z)$.
  The boundedness of these operators on various spaces of analytic functions on $\mathbb{D}$ is well understood. The original motivation for this work is to understand the boundedness of compositions of two of these operators, for example $T_g^2, \,T_gS_g,\, M_gT_g$, etc. Our methods yield a characterization of the boundedness of a large class of operators contained in the algebra generated by these analytic paraproducts acting on the classical weighted Bergman and Hardy spaces in terms of the symbol $g$. In some cases it turns out that this property is not affected by cancellation, while in others it requires stronger and more subtle restrictions on the oscillation of the symbol $g$ than the case of a single paraproduct.</description>

      <title>Sharp Invertibility in Quotient Algebras of $H^\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider inner functions $\Theta$ with the zero set $\mathcal Z(\Theta)$ such that the quotient algebra $H^\infty / \Theta H^\infty$ satisfies the Strong Invertibility Property (SIP), that is for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there exists $\delta&gt;0$ such that the conditions $f \in H^\infty$, $\|[f]\|_{H^\infty/ \Theta H^\infty}=1$, $\inf_{\mathcal Z(\Theta)} |f| \ge 1-\delta$ imply that $[f]$ is invertible in $H^\infty / \Theta H^\infty$ and $\| 1/ [f] \|_{H^\infty/ \Theta H^\infty}\le 1+\varepsilon$. We prove that the SIP is equivalent to the maximal asymptotic growth of $\Theta $ away from its zero set. We also describe inner functions satisfying the SIP in terms of the narrowness of their sublevel sets and relate the SIP to the Weak Embedding Property introduced by P.Gorkin, R.Mortini, and N.Nikolski as well as to inner functions whose Frostman shifts are Carleson--Newman Blaschke products. We finally study divisors of inner functions satisfying the SIP. We describe geometrically the zero set of inner functions such that all its divisors satisfy the SIP. We also prove that a closed subset $E$ of the unit circle is of finite entropy if and only if any singular inner function associated to a singular measure supported on $E$ is a divisor of an inner function satisfying the SIP.</description>

      <title>Bergman projection induced by radial weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.09837v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of when the Bergman projection $P_\omega$ induced by a radial weight $\omega$ on the unit disc is a bounded operator from one space into another is of primordial importance in the theory of Bergman spaces. The long-standing problem of describing the radial weights $\omega$ such that $P_\omega$ is bounded on the Lebesgue space $L^p_\omega$ had been known to experts since decades before it was formally posed by Dostani\'c in 2004. A natural limit case of this setting is when $P_\omega$ acts from $L^\infty$ to the Bloch space. The surjectivity of the operator becomes another relevant question in this limit case.
  The main findings of this study are shortly listed as follows. We establish characterizations of the radial weights $\omega$ on the unit disc such that $P_\omega:L^\infty\to\mathcal{B}$ is bounded and/or acts surjectively, or the dual of $A^1_\omega$ is isomorphic to the Bloch space $\mathcal{B}$ under the $A^2_\omega$-pairing. We also solve the problem posed by Dostani\'c under a weak regularity hypothesis on the weight involved. With regard to Littlewood-Paley estimates, we describe the radial weights $\omega$ such that the norm of any function in $A^p_\omega$ is comparable to the norm in $L^p_\omega$ of its derivative times the distance from the boundary. This last-mentioned result solves another well-known problem on the area. All characterizations can be given in terms of doubling conditions on moments and/or tail integrals $\int_r^1\omega(t)\,dt$ of $\omega$, and are therefore easy to interpret.
  We also make substantial progress about the two weight inequality
  $$
  \|P_\omega(f)\|_{L^p_\nu}\le C\|f\|_{L^p_\nu},\quad f\in L^p_\nu, \quad 1&lt;p&lt;\infty.
  $$ for radial weights $\omega$ and $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Quadratic varieties of small codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X \subset \mathbb P^{n+c}$ be a nondegenerate smooth projective variety of dimension $n$ defined by quadratic equations. For such varieties, P. Ionescu and F. Russo proved the Hartshorne conjecture on complete intersections, which states that X is a complete intersection provided that $n\geq 2c+1$. As the extremal case, they also classified $X$ with $n=2c$. In this paper, we classify $X$ with $n=2c-1$.</description>
