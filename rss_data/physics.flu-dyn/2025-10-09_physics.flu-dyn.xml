      <title>Stability of vortex lattices in rotating flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex lattices -- highly ordered arrays of vortices -- are known to arise in quantum systems such as type II superconductors and Bose-Einstein condensates. More recently, similar arrangements have been reported in classical rotating fluids. However, the mechanisms governing their formation, stability, and eventual breakdown remain poorly understood. We explore the dynamical stability of vortex lattices in three-dimensional rotating flows. To that end we construct controlled initial conditions consisting of vortex lattices superimposed on turbulent backgrounds. We then characterize their evolution across different Rossby numbers and domain geometries. By introducing an Ekman drag we are able to reach a steady state where vortex lattices persist with near constant amplitude up until spontaneous breakup of the lattice, or an equivalent of ``melting,'' occurs. We examine an ensemble of runs in order to determine the mean lifetime of the lattice as a function of the system parameters. Our results reveal that the stability of the lattices is a memory-less random process whose mean life-time depends sensitively on the system parameters that if finely tuned can lead to very long lived lattice states. These metastable states exhibit statistical properties reminiscent of critical systems and can offer insight into long-lived vortex patterns observed in planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Elasto-viscous regime in coalescence of viscoelastic droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a regime transition in the coalescence of concentrated polymeric droplets in a pendant-pendant configuration. While Newtonian droplet coalescence has been extensively studied with distinct identification of viscous and inertial regimes, the presence of polymers introduces additional regimes governed by elasticity and molecular relaxation effects. The coalescence process is typically characterized by the neck radius, $R$, of the liquid bridge connecting the two droplets, following a power-law relation with time: $R=at^{b}$. Most of the existing studies, including Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, report a unique value of $b$ for a given fluid. In contrast, our findings reveal that elasticity induces a temporal transition from one $b$ values to another, marking a shift in the coalescence regime. In particular, our measured $b$ value falls in the sub-Newtonian regime, highlighting the role of elasticity in governing the dynamics. We conducted two-dimensional simulations using a volume-of-fluid framework with the exponential Phan-Thien-Tanner model, which quantitatively reproduced Newtonian benchmarks and accurately captured viscoelasticity induced neck growth in close agreement with experiments. Furthermore, we determined the curvature experimentally, as the assumptions typically employed in the literature to approximate axial curvature are not universally valid.</description>

      <title>CFD Analysis of Taylor Bubble in a Co-Flow Microchannel with Newtonian and Non-Newtonian Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a CFD based model to understand the Taylor bubble behavior in Newtonian and non-Newtonian liquids flowing through a confined co-flow microchannel. Systematic investigation is carried out to explore the influence of surface tension, inlet velocities, and apparent viscosity on the bubble length, shape, velocity, and film thickness around the bubble. Aqueous solutions of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with different concentrations are considered as power-law liquid to address the presence of non-Newtonian continuous phase on Taylor bubble. In all cases, bubble length was found to decrease with increasing Capillary number, inlet gas-liquid velocity ratio, and CMC concentration. However, bubble velocity increased due to increasing liquid film thickness around the bubble. At higher Capillary number and inlet velocity ratio, significant changes in bubble shapes are observed. With increasing CMC concentration, bubble formation frequency and velocity increased, but length decreased.</description>

      <title>CFD analysis of microfluidic droplet formation in non-Newtonian liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-dimensional, volume-of-fluid (VOF) based CFD model is presented to investigate droplet formation in a microfluidic T-junction. Genesis of Newtonian droplets in non-Newtonian liquid is numerically studied and characterized in three different regimes, viz., squeezing, dripping and jetting. Various influencing factors such as, continuous and dispersed phase flow rates, interfacial tension, and non-Newtonian rheological parameters are analyzed to understand droplet formation mechanism. Droplet shape is reported by defining a deformation index. Near spherical droplets are realized in dripping and jetting regimes. However, plug shaped droplets are observed in squeezing regime. It is found that rheological parameters have significant effect on the droplet length, volume, and its formation regime. The formation frequency increases with increasing effective viscosity however, the droplet volume decreases. This work effectively provides the fundamental insights into microfluidic droplet formation characteristics in non-Newtonian liquids.</description>

      <title>Regulation of droplet size and flow regime by geometrical confinement in a microfluidic flow-focusing device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a coupled level set and volume of fluid-based computational fluid dynamics model to analyze the droplet formation mechanism in a square flow-focusing microchannel. We demonstrate a flexible manipulation of droplet formation and flow regime based on the modified flow-focusing microchannel with a constricted orifice. Furthermore, we have systematically studied the influence of geometrical confinement, flow rate, and interfacial tension on the droplet formation regime, length, volume, velocity, and shape. Three different flow regimes, namely squeezing, dripping, and jetting, are observed, and the flow regime maps are formulated based on the Reynolds and capillary numbers. After an extensive numerical investigation, we described the boundaries between the different regimes. Droplet shape is also quantified based on the deformation index value. Plug-shaped droplets are observed in the squeezing regime, and near spherical droplets are found in the dripping and jetting regimes. Our study provides insights into the transition of a regime under various geometrical confinement and fluid properties. The results reveal that the modified flow-focusing microchannel can substantially enhance dripping while decreasing the squeezing regime, which is of paramount importance from the standpoint of producing high throughput stable and monodisperse microdroplets. Eventually, this work emphasizes the importance of geometrical confinement, fluid properties, and flow conditions on the droplet formation process in a flow-focusing microchannel that can effectively provide helpful guidelines on the design and operations of such droplet-based microfluidic systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning enhanced parametric Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations at the full and reduced order levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we focus on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models and their exploitation to build reliable reduced order models to further accelerate predictions for real-time applications and many-query scenarios. Specifically, we investigate how machine learning can be employed to enhance the predictive capabilities of the model, both at the Full Order Model (FOM) and Reduced Order Model (ROM) levels. We explore a novel integration of these two areas. We generate the FOM snapshots, essential for ROM construction, using a data-driven RANS model: the $\nu_t$-Vector Basis Neural Network. This is the first time that these machine learning procedure generalizes a large parametric variation, and we propose tailored training strategies to increase the accuracy of the FOM model. At the ROM level, we compare the results obtained by standard Proper Orthogonal Decomposition in an intrusive Galerkin setting (PODG) and POD Neural Network approach (PODNN). The numerical validation is based on a classic turbulent flow benchmark: the flow in a square duct. Our investigation reveals that the PODG method, proves unstable and inaccurate for turbulent flow prediction, while PODNN demonstrates superior performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Active Control of Turbulent Airfoil Flows Using Adjoint-based Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We train active neural-network flow controllers using a deep learning PDE augmentation method to optimize lift-to-drag ratios in turbulent airfoil flows at Reynolds number $5\times10^4$ and Mach number 0.4. Direct numerical simulation and large eddy simulation are employed to model compressible, unconfined flow over two- and three-dimensional semi-infinite NACA 0012 airfoils at angles of attack $\alpha = 5^\circ$, $10^\circ$, and $15^\circ$. Control actions, implemented through a blowing/suction jet at a fixed location and geometry on the upper surface, are adaptively determined by a neural network that maps local pressure measurements to optimal jet total pressure, enabling a sensor-informed control policy that responds spatially and temporally to unsteady flow conditions. The sensitivities of the flow to the neural network parameters are computed using the adjoint Navier-Stokes equations, which we construct using automatic differentiation applied to the flow solver. The trained flow controllers significantly improve the lift-to-drag ratios and reduce flow separation for both two- and three-dimensional airfoil flows, especially at $\alpha = 5^\circ$ and $10^\circ$. The 2D-trained models remain effective when applied out-of-sample to 3D flows, which demonstrates the robustness of the adjoint-trained control approach. The 3D-trained models capture the flow dynamics even more effectively, which leads to better energy efficiency and comparable performance for both adaptive (neural network) and offline (simplified, constant-pressure) controllers. These results underscore the effectiveness of this learning-based approach in improving aerodynamic performance.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic flow of an Oldroyd-B fluid through a slowly varying contraction-expansion channel: pressure drop and elastic stress relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscoelastic fluid flows in narrow non-uniform geometries are ubiquitous in various engineering applications and physiological flow systems. For such flows, one of the key interests is understanding how fluid viscoelasticity affects the flow rate-pressure drop relation, which remains not fully understood. We analyze the flow of the Oldroyd-B fluid in slowly varying contraction-expansion channels, commonly referred to as constrictions. Unlike most previous theoretical studies focusing on contracting channels, we consider a constriction geometry and present a theory for calculating the elastic stresses and flow rate-pressure drop relation at low and high Deborah ($De$) numbers. We apply lubrication theory and consider the ultra-dilute limit, in which the velocity approximates a parabolic and Newtonian profile. This results in a one-way coupling between the velocity and elastic stresses, allowing us to derive closed-form expressions for the elastic stresses and pressure drop for arbitrary values of $De$. We validate our theoretical predictions with numerical simulations, finding excellent agreement. We identify the physical mechanisms governing the pressure drop behavior and compare our results for the constriction with previous predictions for the contraction. At low $De$, the pressure drop in the constriction monotonically decreases with $De$, similar to the contraction. However, at high $De$, in contrast to a linear decrease for the contraction, the pressure drop across the constriction reaches a plateau due to the vanishing contribution of elastic normal stresses, leaving elastic shear stresses as the sole driver of the reduction. Furthermore, we elucidate the spatial relaxation of elastic stresses and pressure gradient in the exit channel following both constriction and contraction geometries, showing that the relaxation length is significantly shorter in the case of a constriction.</description>

      <title>Subcritical transition and multistability in liquid metal magnetoconvection with sidewalls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motionless conducting state of liquid metal convection with an applied vertical magnetic field confined in a vessel with insulating side walls becomes linearly unstable to wall modes through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Nevertheless, we show that the transition proceeds subcritically, with stable finite-amplitude solutions with different symmetries existing at parameter values beneath this linear stability threshold. Under increased thermal driving, the branch born from the linear instability becomes unstable and solutions are attracted to the most subcritical branch, which follows a quasiperiodic route to chaos. Thus, we show that the transition to turbulence is controlled by this subcritical branch and hence, turbulent solutions have no connection to the initial linear instability. This is further quantified by observing that the subcritical equilibrium solution sets the spatial symmetry of the turbulent mean flow and thus, organises large-scale structures in the turbulent regime.</description>

      <title>On internal wave whispering gallery modes in channels and critical-slope wave attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal waves are an important feature of stratified fluids, both in oceanic and lake basins and in other settings. Many works have been published on the generic feature of internal wave trapping onto planar wave attractors and super-attractors in 2\&amp;3D and the exceptional class of standing global internal wave modes. However, most of these works did not deal with waves that escape trapping. By using continuous symmetries we analytically prove the existence of internal wave Whispering Gallery Modes (WGMs), internal waves that propagate continuously without getting trapped by attractors. WGMs neutral stability with respect to different perturbations enable whispering gallery beams, a continuum of rays propagating together coherently. The systems' continuous symmetries also enable projection onto 2D planes that yield effective 2D billiards preserving the original dynamics.
  By examining rays deviating from these WGMs in parabolic channels we discover a new type of wave attractor which is located along the channel instead of across it as in previous works. This new wave attractor leads to a re-understanding of WGMs as sitting at the border between the two basins of attraction.
  Finally, both critical-slope wave attractors and whispering gallery beams are used to propose explanations for along-channel energy fluxes in submarine canyons and tidal energy intensification near critical slopes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modeling and Upscaling of Hydrodynamic Transport in Geological Fractures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing hydrodynamic transport in fractured rocks is essential for carbon storage and geothermal energy production. Multiscale heterogeneities lead to anomalous solute transport, with breakthrough-curve (BTC) tailing and nonlinear growth of plume moments. We study purely advective transport in synthetic fractures with prescribed relative closure $ \sigma_a/\langle a \rangle $ and correlation length $ L_c $. For each geometry we generate multiple realizations and solve steady, depth-averaged Stokes flow under the lubrication approximation. Flow heterogeneity persists up to $ L_c $. The ensemble-averaged velocity PDFs are insensitive to $ L_c $ but strongly affected by $ \sigma_a/\langle a \rangle $, particularly their low-velocity power-law scaling. A time-domain random walk (TDRW) yields plume moments and outlet BTCs: the mean longitudinal position grows linearly in time, while the variance shows early ballistic scaling and a late-time regime controlled by the low-velocity power law with exponent $ \alpha $, which depends on $ \sigma_a/\langle a \rangle $. BTC properties, including peak broadening and tail scaling, are likewise governed by $ \alpha $. We further model advection with a one-dimensional continuous-time random walk (CTRW) that uses only the velocity PDF, flow tortuosity, and $ L_c $. CTRW results closely match TDRW and enable analytical predictions of asymptotic transport scalings.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking bifurcations and sub-harmonic lock-in of a flexible splitter plate in cylinder wake flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the flow past a flexible splitter plate attached to the rear of a fixed circular cylinder at a low Reynolds number of 150. A systematic exploration of the plate length ($L/D$), flexibility coefficient ($S^{*}$), and mass ratio ($m^{*}$) reveals new laws and phenomena. The large-amplitude vibration of the structure is attributed to a resonance phenomenon induced by fluid-structure interaction. The modal decomposition indicates that resonance arises from the coupling between the first and second structural modes, where the excitation of the second structural mode plays a critical role. Due to the combined effects of added mass and periodic stiffness variations, the two modes become synchronized, oscillating at the same frequency while maintaining a fixed phase difference of $\pi/2$. This further results in the resonant frequency being locked at half of the second natural frequency, which is approximately three times the first natural frequency. A reduction in plate length and an increase in mass ratio are both associated with a narrower resonant locking range, while a higher mass ratio also shifts this range toward lower frequencies. A symmetry-breaking bifurcation is observed for cases with $L/D\leq3.5$, whereas for $L/D=4.0$, the flow remains in a steady state with a stationary splitter plate prior to the onset of resonance. For cases with a short flexible plate and a high mass ratio, the shortened resonance interval causes the plate to return to the symmetry-breaking stage after resonance, gradually approaching an equilibrium position determined by the flow field characteristics at high flexibility coefficients.</description>

      <title>Mass Conservation on Rails -- Rethinking Physics-Informed Learning of Ice Flow Vector Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To reliably project future sea level rise, ice sheet models require inputs that respect physics. Embedding physical principles like mass conservation into models that interpolate Antarctic ice flow vector fields from sparse &amp; noisy measurements not only promotes physical adherence but can also improve accuracy and robustness. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) impose physics as soft penalties, offering flexibility but no physical guarantees, we instead propose divergence-free neural networks (dfNNs), which enforce local mass conservation exactly via a vector calculus trick. Our comparison of dfNNs, PINNs, and unconstrained NNs on ice flux interpolation over Byrd Glacier suggests that "mass conservation on rails" yields more reliable estimates, and that directional guidance, a learning strategy leveraging continent-wide satellite velocity data, boosts performance across models.</description>

      <title>In-space manufacturing of optical lenses: Fluidic Shaping aboard the International Space Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-space manufacturing technologies are vital for enabling advanced space missions and addressing logistical limitations of space exploration. While additive manufacturing has progressed rapidly, it still falls short of delivering the ultra-smooth surfaces required for optical elements. Fluidic Shaping is a novel method that harnesses surface tension under microgravity to form optical components with exceptionally smooth surfaces. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of Fluidic Shaping as a method for manufacturing optical components in space through two experiments performed aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Ax-1 mission. The first experiment involved fabricating centimeter-scale polymer lenses, solidifying them via ultraviolet (UV) curing, and analyzing the resultant optics upon their return to Earth. While sub-nanometric surface smoothness was achieved, some polymer lenses displayed unexpected thermo-chemical deformations, indicating complex polymerization dynamics unique to the microgravity environment. In the second experiment, a large-scale, 172 mm diameter water lens was deployed, confirming Fluidic Shaping's scalability and demonstrating basic optical functionality through image analysis. These experiments collectively underline the technique's relevance for both small-scale optics and large-aperture applications. Our results highlight critical considerations for future research, including optimizing polymerization processes and refining liquid-handling methods to advance practical, in-space optical manufacturing capabilities.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Linear Systems Pathway for Solving Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic pathway for solving differential equations within the quantum linear systems framework by combining block encoding with Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). The approach is demonstrated on a complex tridiagonal linear system and extended to problems in computational fluid dynamics: the heat equation with mixed boundary conditions and the nonlinear Burgers' equation. Our scaling analysis of the heat equation shows how discretization influences the minimum singular value and the polynomial degree required for QSVT, identifying circuit-depth overhead as a key bottleneck. For Burgers' equation, we illustrate how Carleman-linearized nonlinear dynamics can be efficiently block encoded and solved within the QSVT framework. These results highlight both the potential and limitations of current methods, underscoring the need for efficient estimation of minimum singular value, depth-reduction techniques, and benchmarks against classical reachability. This pathway lays a foundation for advancing quantum linear system methods toward large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Effects of Wall Roughness on Coupled Flow and Heat Transport in Fractured Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heat transfer in fractured media is governed by the interplay between advective transport along rough-walled fractures and conductive transport, both within the fractures and in the surrounding low-permeability matrix. Flow localization induced by aperture heterogeneity, combined with matrix conduction, gives rise to anomalous thermal behavior. To capture these effects, we develop a stochastic modeling framework that couples a time-domain random walk (TDRW) representation of advective and conductive transport in the fractures with a semi-analytical model of conductive heat exchange with the matrix. Matrix trapping times follow a L\'evy-Smirnov distribution derived from first-passage theory, capturing the heavy-tailed dynamics typical of fractured systems. Heat flux at the fracture-matrix interface is computed via a nonlocal convolution integral based on Duhamel's principle, accounting for thermal memory effects. The model is validated against analytical benchmarks and finite-element simulations. Monte Carlo simulations over stochastic aperture fields quantify the influence of fracture closure, correlation length, and P\'eclet number. Results reveal a transition from superdiffusive to subdiffusive regimes, driven by the competition between advective transport along preferential paths, dispersion induced by aperture variability, and matrix-driven heat conduction. In the long-time regime, heat exchange exhibits a characteristic $t^{-1/2}$ decay. At early times, limited thermal penetration into the matrix leads to weaker interfacial fluxes, underscoring the role of matrix thermal inertia. The proposed framework enables physically consistent and computationally efficient simulations of thermal transport in complex fractured systems, with implications for geothermal energy, subsurface thermal storage, and engineered heat exchange in low-permeability environments.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Aeroacoustic Shape Optimization at Low Reynolds Numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of gradient-free aeroacoustic shape optimization using the Flux Reconstruction (FR) approach to study two-dimensional flow at low Reynolds numbers. The Overall Sound Pressure Level (OASPL) is computed via the direct acoustic approach, and optimization is performed using the gradient-free Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) algorithm. The proposed framework is assessed across three problems. First, flow over an open cavity is investigated at a Reynolds number of $Re=1500$ and free-stream Mach number of $M_\infty = 0.15$, resulting in a $7.9dB$ noise reduction. The second case considers tandem cylinders at $Re=200$ and $M_\infty = 0.2$, achieving a $16.5 dB$ noise reduction by optimizing the distance between the cylinders and their diameter ratio. Finally, a NACA0012 airfoil is optimized at $Re=10,000$ and $M_\infty = 0.2$ to reduce trailing edge noise. The airfoil's shape is optimized to generate a new 4-digit NACA airfoil at an appropriate angle of attack to reduce OASPL while maintaining the baseline time-averaged lift coefficient and preventing an increase in the baseline time-averaged drag coefficient. The optimized airfoil is silent at $0dB$ and the drag coefficient is decreased by $24.95\%$. These results demonstrate the feasibility of shape optimization using MADS and FR for aeroacoustic design.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Free Aeroacoustic Shape Optimization Using Large Eddy Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an aeroacoustic shape optimization framework that relies on high-order Flux Reconstruction (FR), the gradient-free Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS) optimization algorithm, and Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Our parallel implementation ensures consistent runtime for each optimization iteration, regardless of the number of design parameters, provided sufficient resources are available. The objective is to minimize the Overall Sound Pressure Level (OASPL) at a near-field observer by computing it directly from the flow field. We evaluate this framework across three problems. First, an open deep cavity is considered at a free-stream Mach number of $M_\infty=0.15$ and Reynolds number of $Re=1500$, reducing the OASPL by $12.9~dB$. Next, we considered tandem cylinders at $Re=1000$ and $M_\infty=0.2$, achieving over $11~dB$ noise reduction by optimizing cylinder spacing and diameter ratio. Lastly, a baseline NACA0012 airfoil at $Re=23000$ and $M_\infty=0.2$ is optimized to generate a new 4-digit NACA airfoil at an appropriate angle of attack to minimize the OASPL while ensuring the baseline time-averaged lift coefficient is maintained and prevent any increase in the baseline time-averaged drag coefficient. The OASPL and mean drag coefficient are reduced by $5.7~dB$ and more than $7\%$, respectively. These results highlight the feasibility and effectiveness of our aeroacoustic shape optimization framework.</description>

      <title>Hovering of an actively driven fluid-lubricated foil</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental observations of a harmonically excited elastic foil hovering near a wall while supporting substantial weight, we develop a theoretical framework that describes the underlying physical effects. Using elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory, we quantify how the dynamic deformation of the soft foil couples to the viscous fluid flow in the intervening gap. Our analysis shows that the soft foil rectifies the reversible forcing, breaking time-reversal symmetry; the relative spatial support of the forcing determines whether the sheet is attracted to or repelled from the wall. A simple scaling law predicts the time-averaged equilibrium hovering height and the maximum weight the sheet can sustain before detaching from the surface. Numerical simulations of the governing equation corroborate our theoretical predictions, are in qualitative agreement with experiments, and might explain the behavior of organisms while providing design principles for soft robotics.</description>

Abstract: The statistical features of homogeneous, isotropic, two-dimensional stochastic turbulence are discussed. We derive some rigorous bounds for the mean value of the bulk energy dissipation rate $\mathbb{E} [\varepsilon ]$ and enstrophy dissipation rates $\mathbb{E} [\chi] $ for 2D flows sustained by a variety of stochastic driving forces. We show that $$\mathbb{E} [ \varepsilon ] \rightarrow 0 \hspace{0.5cm}\mbox{and} \hspace{0.5cm} \mathbb{E} [ \chi ] \lesssim \mathcal{O}(1)$$ in the inviscid limit, consistent with the dual-cascade in 2D turbulence.</description>

      <title>Learning Non-Ideal Vortex Flows Using the Differentiable Vortex Particle Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vortex flows are ubiquitous in both natural processes and engineering applications, including phenomena such as typhoons, water currents, and aerospace fluid dynamics. The vortex particle method, a computational approach grounded in vortex dynamics, has been extensively applied in aerodynamics, oceanography, turbulence, and aeroacoustics. With the recent introduction of machine learning into computational fluid dynamics, a hybrid framework known as the differentiable vortex particle method (DVPM) has been proposed, which integrates the vortex particle method with deep learning to enable efficient learning and prediction. However, the original formulation of DVPM is limited to ideal vortex flow conditions, such as inviscid flows without non-conservative body forces, which significantly restricts its practical applicability. In this study, we extend the differentiable vortex particle method beyond idealized flow scenarios to encompass more realistic, non-ideal conditions, including viscous flow and flow subjected to non-conservative body forces. We establish the Lamb-Oseen vortex as a benchmark case, representing a fundamental viscous vortex flow in fluid mechanics. This selection offers significant analytical advantages, as the Lamb-Oseen vortex possesses an exact analytical solution derived from the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, thereby providing definitive ground truth data for training and validation purposes. Through rigorous evaluation across a spectrum of Reynolds numbers, we demonstrate that DVPM achieves superior accuracy in modeling the Lamb-Oseen vortex compared to conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). Our results substantiate DVPM's robust capabilities in modeling non-ideal vortex flows, establishing its distinct advantages over contemporary deep learning methodologies in fluid dynamics applications.</description>

      <title>Pinning mediated coalescence-induced lateral droplet motion on nanotextured superhydrophobic surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Droplets coalescing on a superhydrophobic surface exhibit coalescence-induced droplet jumping. However, water vapor condensing on a superhydrophobic surface can result in simultaneous formation of condensate droplets with two distinct wetting states, cassie state (CS) and partially wetting (PW) state. Droplets in PW state exhibit high contact angle but are connected to the substrate though a thin liquid condensate column. Coalescence between CS and PW droplets has been recently identified as a possible mechanism for generating droplets exhibiting in-plane roaming motion during dropwise condensation on nanotextured superhydrophobic surfaces. Here, we systematically investigate this phenomenon through experiments on coalescence between sessile droplets in CS and PW state on a nanostructured superhydrophobic surface endowed with a micro-scale hydrophilic spot. Here, a sessile droplet carefully placed on the hydrophilic spot simulates the PW state. Overall, our investigations demonstrate that when a CS droplet coalesces with a PW droplet pinned to a hydrophilic defect, the interaction generates substantial in-plane momentum. We find that when the coalescing CS and PW droplets are nearly of the same size and about ~3 to ~3.5 times the size of the hydrophilic spot pinning the PW droplet, the vertical momentum generation is nearly completely suppressed, and the resulting maxima in in-plane momentum results in detachment of merged droplet from hydrophilic spot and its subsequent in-plane motion.</description>

      <title>VICON: Vision In-Context Operator Networks for Multi-Physics Fluid Dynamics Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-Context Operator Networks (ICONs) have demonstrated the ability to learn operators across diverse partial differential equations using few-shot, in-context learning. However, existing ICONs process each spatial point as an individual token, severely limiting computational efficiency when handling dense data in higher spatial dimensions. We propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON), which integrates vision transformer architectures to efficiently process 2D data through patch-wise operations while preserving ICON's adaptability to multiphysics systems and varying timesteps. Evaluated across three fluid dynamics benchmarks, VICON significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines: DPOT and MPP, reducing the averaged last-step rollout error by 37.9% compared to DPOT and 44.7% compared to MPP, while requiring only 72.5% and 34.8% of their respective inference times. VICON naturally supports flexible rollout strategies with varying timestep strides, enabling immediate deployment in imperfect measurement systems where sampling frequencies may differ or frames might be dropped - common challenges in real-world settings - without requiring retraining or interpolation. In these realistic scenarios, VICON exhibits remarkable robustness, experiencing only 24.41% relative performance degradation compared to 71.37%-74.49% degradation in baseline methods, demonstrating its versatility for deploying in realistic applications. Our scripts for processing datasets and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Eydcao/VICON.</description>
