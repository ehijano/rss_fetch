      <title>Electronic structure of SLSiN under charge density modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles density-functional theory calculations were carried out to assess how incremental unit-cell charging alters the electronic behavior of SLSiN (single-layer Si$_3$N$_4$). The net charge per cell was systematically tuned from $n\,=\,0$ (the neutral/reference configuration) to $n\,=\,\pm\,1,\pm\,2$, and $\pm\,3$ elementary charges, and for each charged configuration the band structure and density of states were evaluated at the PBE level. In its neutral state, SLSiN exhibits zero electronegativity, signifying both its indifference to additional electron density and its intrinsic stability when integrated into heterostructures. Altogether, these results reveal that precise control of the charge density can drive SLSiN across an insulator-to-metal transition.</description>

      <title>AutoMAT: A Hierarchical Framework for Autonomous Alloy Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alloy discovery is central to advancing modern industry but remains hindered by the vastness of compositional design space and the costly validation. Here, we present AutoMAT, a hierarchical and autonomous framework grounded in and validated by experiments, which integrates large language models, automated CALPHAD-based simulations, and AI-driven search to accelerate alloy design. Spanning the entire pipeline from ideation to validation, AutoMAT achieves high efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability without the need for manually curated large datasets. In a case study targeting a lightweight, high-strength alloy, AutoMAT identifies a titanium alloy with 8.1% lower density and comparable yield strength relative to the state-of-the-art reference, achieving the highest specific strength among all comparisons. In a second case targeting high-yield-strength high-entropy alloys, AutoMAT achieves a 28.2% improvement in yield strength over the base alloy. In both cases, AutoMAT reduces the discovery timeline from years to weeks, illustrating its potential as a scalable and versatile platform for next-generation alloy design.</description>

      <title>External magnetic field suppression of carbon diffusion in iron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: External magnetic fields reduce diffusion of carbon in BCC iron, but the physical mechanism is not understood. Using DFT calculations with magnetic moments sampled from a Heisenberg model, we calculate diffusivities of carbon in iron at high temperatures and with field. Our model reproduces the measured suppression of diffusivity from field. We find that increasing magnetic disorder flattens the electron density of states compared with the ferromagnetic case, which distorts the octahedral cages around carbon, lowering the activation barrier to diffusion; an applied field reverses these trends.</description>

      <title>Optically Reconfigurable Electrodes for Dielectric Elastomer Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optically addressable and configurable electrode architecture for dielectric elastomer actuators and arrays is described. It is based on embedding photoconductive, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowires in the DEA to create electrodes. Normally, a network of ZnO nanowires is electrically insulating but it becomes conductive in the presence of UV light with a photon energy above the optical bandgap. Taking advantage of this characteristic optical induced switching behavior, we create an optically addressable electrode design, and create new, localized capacitor structures. As the ZnO nanowires are only conductive where, and when, illuminated the effective electrode structure is not fixed, as is the case with CNT and carbon-black electrodes currently used in DEAs. This provides greater, previously unattainable, freedom in the design of dielectric elastomer actuators for soft robotics and devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of a phase transition in KTaO$_3$ induced by residual niobium impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of a phase transition in a KTaO$_3$ crystal, corresponding to a paraelectric-to-ferroelectric transition. The crystal was placed inside a copper cavity to form a dielectric-loaded microwave cavity, and the transition was observed to occur near 134 K. As the cavity was cooled, the frequencies of both transverse electric and transverse magnetic resonant modes decreased (corresponding to an increase in permittivity). The mode frequencies converge at the transition temperature (near 134 K) and, below this point, reverse their tuning direction, increasing their frequency with decreasing temperature. This behaviour corresponds to a decrease in dielectric permittivity and is atypical for pure KTaO$_3$. To investigate further, we conducted impurity analysis using Laser Ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), revealing a significant concentration ($\sim$ 7\%) of niobium (Nb) in the crystal. This suggests that the observed phase transition is driven by residual Nb impurities, which induce ferroelectricity in an otherwise paraelectric host. Similar crystals with a lower concentration ($&lt;$ 2\%) did not undergo a phase transition but exhibited a loss peak at this temperature. These findings have practical implications for the design of tunable devices, for example, resonator-based dark matter detectors, where low-loss material phase stability and tunability are crucial.</description>

      <title>Unveiling two-dimensional electron systems on ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor $\mathrm{\beta}$-Ga$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors promise to revolutionize power electronics, yet a fundamental understanding of their interfacial electronic structure has been hindered by the absence of direct experimental observation. Here, we report the first momentum-resolved observation of two-dimensional electron systems on a UWBG material, enabled by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) on high-purity $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ single crystals. Alkaline-metal-induced electron doping forms an isotropic circular Fermi surface, achieving a sheet carrier density of up to $1.0\times10^{14}$ $\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$. Self-consistent Poisson-Schr\"odinger calculations show that the electrons are confined within 1.2 nm of the surface and reveal an internal electric field of $18$ MV cm$^{-1}$. Crucially, our measurements reveal a pronounced renormalization of the electronic band structure: a series of carrier-density-dependent ARPES measurements shows that as the carrier density increases from $2\times10^{13}$ to $1.0\times10^{14}$ $\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, the effective mass anomalously increases, nearly doubling to a final value of 0.48 $\textit{m}_{\mathrm{e}}$. This trend is notably opposite to that reported for other oxide semiconductors, pointing towards a unique renormalization mechanism in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Our findings establish the interfacial electronic structure of $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and demonstrate that UWBG materials provide fertile ground for exploring carrier-density-driven electronic phenomena, opening new avenues for future quantum and power devices.</description>

      <title>Nd3+ Doping-induced Leakage Currents Suppression in High-temperature 0.7BiFeO3-0.3BaTiO3 Lead-free Piezoceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BiFeO3 has attracted much attention as a potential candidate for replacing conventional, lead based piezoelectric materials due to its remarkable spontaneous polarization and high Curie temperature. However, its inherent high leakage currents, which lead to low piezoelectric response and poor temperature stability, have severely limited its practical applications. In this study, lead free piezoelectric ceramics of the 0.7BiFeO3-0.3BaTiO3 (BF-BT) system were prepared, and their microstructures along with high-temperature electrical performance were modulated by introducing Nd3+. The results indicate that moderate Nd doping improves lattice symmetry and reduces oxygen vacancy-related defect dipoles, thereby effectively suppressing leakage currents at temperatures above 75{\deg}C. The Nddoped samples exhibit significantly lower leakage current densities, reduced by over 99% compared to the undoped ceramics, reaching values as low as 10-5Acm-2. They also show higher resistivity under elevated temperatures and electric fields, offering notable improvements in thermal stability over the undoped counterparts. In addition, the Nd-doped samples achieved piezoelectric coefficients as high as 172 pC N -1 at room temperature while still maintaining high dielectric and piezoelectric responses at elevated temperatures. This work not only provides an effective way to solve the leakage current problem of BF-BT ceramics in high temperature applications but also indicates a new design strategy for optimizing the high temperature stability of lead free piezoelectric materials, which shows a broad application prospect in the field of high-temperature sensors and actuators.</description>

      <title>Origin of Suppressed Ferroelectricity in k-Ga$_2$O$_3$: Interplay Between Polarization and Lattice Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large discrepancy between experimental and theoretical remanent polarization and coercive field limits the applications of wide-band-gap ferroelectric materials. Here, using a machine-learning potential trained on ab-initio molecular dynamics data, we identify a new mechanism of the interplay between polarization domain wall (PDW) and lattice domain wall (LDW) in ferroelectric k-phase gallium oxide (Ga2O3), which reconciles predictions with experimental observations. Our results reveal that the reversal of out-of-plane polarization is achieved through in-plane sliding and shear of the Ga-O sublayers. This pathway creates strong anisotropy in PDW propagation, and crucially leads to topologically forbidden PDW propagation across the 120 degree LDWs observed in synthesized samples. The resulting stable network of residual domain walls bypasses slow nucleation and suppresses the observable polarization and coercive field. These insights highlight the potential for tailoring the ferroelectric response in k-Ga2O3 from lattice-domain engineering.</description>

      <title>Stability by Design: Atomistic Insights into Hydrolysis-Driven MOF Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous materials formed by interconnected metal atoms via organic linkers, resulting in high surface area and tuneable porosity, making them exceptional candidates for CO2 capture. However, their stability and efficacy in humid conditions are not fully understood, often limiting their commercial applications. Here, we estimate the stability of seven common Zn-based MOFs using reactive molecular dynamics (MD) along with metadynamics sampling to determine hydrolysis energetics at conditions representative of low water concentration limit. The reactions' free energy surfaces (FESs) showed that water stability strongly depends on its linker size and chemistry. Our findings indicate zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of MOFs, exhibit higher water stability than iso-reticular metal-organic frameworks (IRMOFs). We further attempt to correlate hydrolysis energy barrier with the physicochemical descriptors of these MOFs. This study provides insights into the critical factors and fundamental implications for developing stable porous materials for carbon capture technologies.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the impact of point defects on the structural, electronic, and mechanical behaviour of chromium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect engineering offers an important route to property tuning of nanostructured coatings for advanced applications. Transition metal nitrides, such as CrN, are widely used for their mechanical resilience, but their nitrogen-rich analogue CrN2 remains poorly understood, especially at the atomic scale. This study employs density functional theory to investigate the energetics as well as how intrinsic defects (vacancies, interstitials, and anti-sites) and extrinsic impurities (hydrogen and oxygen) influence the structural, electronic, magnetic, and mechanical response of CrN2, in comparison to the more commonly studied CrN. With directional N-N bonding and semiconducting character, CrN2 shows high sensitivity to defect incorporation, including local spin polarisation, gap states, and mechanical softening. In contrast, CrN's metallic character enables effective screening of similar defects, preserving its structural, magnetic, electronic and mechanical integrity. However, hydrogen induces anisotropic distortions and mechanical degradation in CrN, while oxygen enhances hardness. These findings reveal how defect chemistry and bonding anisotropy govern mechanical performance, with implications for nanoscale control in coatings design.</description>

      <title>Constructing material network representations for intelligent amorphous alloys design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing high-performance amorphous alloys is demanding for various applications. But this process intensively relies on empirical laws and unlimited attempts. The high-cost and low-efficiency nature of the traditional strategies prevents effective sampling in the enormous material space. Here, we propose material networks to accelerate the discovery of binary and ternary amorphous alloys. The network topologies reveal hidden material candidates that were obscured by traditional tabular data representations. By scrutinizing the amorphous alloys synthesized in different years, we construct dynamical material networks to track the history of the alloy discovery. We find that some innovative materials designed in the past were encoded in the networks, demonstrating their predictive power in guiding new alloy design. These material networks show physical similarities with several real-world networks in our daily lives. Our findings pave a new way for intelligent materials design, especially for complex alloys.</description>

      <title>Interstitially bridged van der Waals interface enabling stacking-fault-free, layer-by-layer epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) crystals are prone to twisting, sliding, and buckling due to inherently weak interlayer interactions. While thickness-controlled vdW structures have attracted considerable attention as ultrathin semiconducting channels, the deterministic synthesis of stacking-fault-free multilayers remains a persistent challenge. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of single-crystalline hexagonal bilayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, enabled by the incorporation of Mo interstitials between layers during layer-by-layer deposition. The resulting bilayers exhibit exceptional structural robustness, maintaining their crystallinity and suppressing both rotational and translational interlayer misalignments even after transfer processes. Atomic-resolution analysis reveals that the Mo interstitials are located at a single sublattice site within the hexagonal lattice, where they form tetrahedral bonds with sulfur atoms from both MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers, effectively anchoring the interlayer registry. Density functional theory calculations further indicate that these Mo atoms act as nucleation centers, promoting the selective formation of the hexagonal bilayer phase. This approach offers a robust strategy for the deterministic growth of multilayer vdW crystals with precisely controlled stacking order and enhanced interlayer coupling.</description>

      <title>Giant magneto-cubic in-plane Hall effect in a nonmagnetic material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-plane Hall effect (IPHE) triggered by an external magnetic field applied in the transport plane has attracted significant experimental attentions in recent few years 1-6. However, most experiments focus on magnetic materials, where the existence of magnetic ordering may complicate understanding the physics behind, and the relatively small signal magnitudes limit the application of the effect. Here, we report a giant IPHE in a nonmagnetic half-Heusler compound LuAuSn, with a magnitude exceeding all the previously reported values. A -period of IPHE and the consistent cubic dependence on the magnetic field are observed, realizing the long-sought theoretical prediction of magneto-cubic IPHE under threefold rotational symmetry7-9 in an unexpected material. The scaling law analysis and first-principles calculations indicate that extrinsic side jump and skew scattering processes from both impurity and phonon scatterings dominate the observed effect. These findings unravel a new type of magneto-nonlinear IPHE, and its large magnitude and wide-temperature operation may open the door to practical applications of IPHE.</description>

      <title>Microstructure of Silicon Anodes in Solid-State Batteries -- From Crystalline to Amorphous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon offers great promise as a potential anode active material and the optimum alternative to lithium metal in all-solid-state lithium-ion batteries. However, its practical application is limited by severe volume expansion (~300%) during lithiation, leading to cracking upon delithiation. In this study, we investigated the microstructural evolution of microcrystalline silicon electrodes in a solid-electrolyte-free environment using cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) during electrochemical cycling. A controlled workflow prevents ambient exposure, and cryo-TEM ensures structural integrity. After the first lithiation, the electrode shows a heterogeneous mix of crystalline Li15Si4, various amorphous LixSi phases, and residual crystalline silicon. After delithiation, the structure becomes predominantly amorphous with thread-like features and minimal remaining crystallinity. By the 10th delithiation, the microstructure is more uniform, with thread-like regions mainly at grain boundaries. Our results reveal that starting from a crystalline phase, a stationary microstructure emerges in bulk silicon only after several cycles. Thus, to have a more controlled behavior of the electrode and minimize cracking, the starting material should be carefully chosen along with an optimized electrode architecture to help stabilize the microstructure throughout cycling.</description>

      <title>Chemical Treatment-Induced Indirect-to-Direct Bandgap Transition in MoS2: Impact on Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique electrical and optical properties of emerging two-dimensional transition metal dichal-cogenides (TMDs) present compelling advantages over conventional semiconductors, including Si, Ge, and GaAs. Nevertheless, realising the full potential of TMDs in electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as transistors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and photodetectors, is con-strained by high contact resistance. This limitation arises from their low intrinsic carrier concen-trations and the current insufficiency of doping strategies for atomically thin materials. Notably, chemical treatment with 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE) has been demonstrated as an effective post-growth method to enhance the n-type electrical conductivity of TMDs. Despite the well-documented electrical improvements post-DCE treatment, its effects on optical properties, specifically the retention of optical characteristics and excitonic behaviour, are not yet clearly under-stood. Here, we systematically investigate the layer- and time-dependent optical effects of DCE on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations. Our PL results reveal a rapid reduction in the indirect bandgap transition, with the direct transition remaining unaffected. DFT confirms that chlorine (Cl) atoms bind to sulphur vacancies, creating mid-gap states that facilitate non-radiative recom-bination, explaining the observed indirect PL suppression. This work demonstrates DCE's utility not only for n-type doping but also for optical band structure engineering in MoS2 by selec-tively suppressing indirect transitions, potentially opening new avenues for 2D optoelectronic device design.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic modeling of binaries in Cr-Fe-Mo-Nb-Ni supported by first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic descriptions of all binaries within the Cr-Fe-Mo-Nb-Ni system have been complied and, where necessary, remodeled. Notably, the Cr-Fe and Fe-Mo systems have been remodeled using comprehensive sublattice models for the topologically close-packed (TCP) phases of Laves_C14, sigma, and mu according to their Wyckoff positions. These refinements are supported by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), in conjunction with available experimental data in the literature. The resulting models offer improved accuracy in describing the TCP phases. For instance, the predicted site occupancies of sigma in Cr-Fe show excellent agreement with experimental observations. The present work provides a robust foundation for CALPHAD modeling and the design of complex, multi-component materials, particularly those based on Fe-based and Ni-based alloys.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast X-ray sonography reveals the spatial heterogeneity of the laser-induced magneto-structural phase transition in FeRh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions are governed by both intrinsic and extrinsic heterogeneities, yet capturing their spatio-temporal dynamics remains a challenge. While ultrafast techniques track phase changes on femtosecond timescales, the spatial complexity and stochastic nature of the processes often remain hidden. Here, we present an experimental approach that combines well-established ultrafast hard-X-ray diffraction with a propagating strain pulse as a universal and non-invasive probe. This ultrafast X-ray sonography can capture the spatio-temporal phase heterogeneity in great detail by resolving the phase-specific strain response. We apply this approach to the antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic magneto-structural phase transition in FeRh and identify the ferromagnetic phase to nucleate at the surface as narrow columnar domains of approximately $30\,\text{nm}$ diameter. Besides reconciling the diverse experimental results in the literature on FeRh, X-ray sonography offers a versatile platform for investigating a wide range of phase transitions accompanied by structural changes.</description>

      <title>Wrinkle Mediated Phase Transitions in In$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline phase transitions in two-dimensional materials enable precise control over electronic and ferroic properties, making them attractive materials for memory and energy storage applications. In$_2$Se$_3$ is particularly promising because its $\alpha$ and $\beta'$ phases are both stable at room temperature but exhibit distinct ferroic behaviors. However, achieving reliable reversible switching between these states remains challenging. Here, we show that controlled $\beta'\rightarrow\alpha$ phase transitions in 2D In$_2$Se$_3$ become accessible through laser-induced wrinkling, establishing a room-temperature approach for manipulating ferroic states in In$_2$Se$_3$ thin films. Combined with thermal annealing for phase recovery, this approach eliminates cryogenic steps and mechanical perturbation while harnessing accumulated internal strain to generate multiphase heterostructures and direct domain reorganization. This pathway for phase transitions in In$_2$Se$_3$ opens the door for further development in ferroic device architectures and phase-change memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Large anisotropic magnetoresistance in $\alpha$-MnTe induced by strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\alpha\textrm{-MnTe}$ is a p-type semiconducting altermagnet with a N\'eel temperature near 300K. Due to the strong spin-orbit coupling and the altermagnetic symmetry, Kramers degeneracy is lifted in the valence band maxima along the $\Gamma$-K line and the A point. However, the energy difference is found to be small, and any small shift in the spectrum can dramatically change the overall transport behavior. Here we show that a strain modulating the [0001] axis of the unit cell by $\sim\pm0.5\%$ can significantly change the transport signature, switching the thermal window between the two regions of the valence band. When the $\Gamma$-K line is dominating, the planar Hall effect and the anisotropic magnetoresistance can be modulated by an order of magnitude, with the maximum up to $\sim30\%$.</description>

      <title>Scanning Tunneling Microscope Tip-Induced Formation of Bi Bilayers on Bi$_2$Te$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the formation of Bi(111) bilayer (BL) islands and crater structures on Bi$_2$Te$_3$(111) surfaces induced by voltage pulses from an STM tip. Pulses above a threshold voltage ($+3$ V) produce craters $\sim 0.5$ microns in diameter, similar to the size of the tip. Redeposited material self-assembles into a network of atomically ordered islands with a lattice constant identical to the underlying Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface. The island size monotonically decreases over several microns from the pulse site, until the pristine Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface is recovered. We assign these islands to Bi BL based on atomic resolution images, analysis of step heights, and tunneling spectroscopy. The dependence of bilayer formation on bias polarity and the evidence for defect diffusion together suggest a mechanism driven by the interplay of field evaporation and tunneling-current-induced Joule heating.</description>

      <title>Perovskite-R1: A Domain-Specialized LLM for Intelligent Discovery of Precursor Additives and Experimental Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as a leading contender in next-generation photovoltaic technologies, owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiencies and advantageous material properties. Despite these advances, challenges such as long-term stability, environmental sustainability, and scalable manufacturing continue to hinder their commercialization. Precursor additive engineering has shown promise in addressing these issues by enhancing both the performance and durability of PSCs. However, the explosive growth of scientific literature and the complex interplay of materials, processes, and device architectures make it increasingly difficult for researchers to efficiently access, organize, and utilize domain knowledge in this rapidly evolving field. To address this gap, we introduce Perovskite-R1, a specialized large language model (LLM) with advanced reasoning capabilities tailored for the discovery and design of PSC precursor additives. By systematically mining and curating 1,232 high-quality scientific publications and integrating a comprehensive library of 33,269 candidate materials, we constructed a domain-specific instruction-tuning dataset using automated question-answer generation and chain-of-thought reasoning. Fine-tuning the QwQ-32B model on this dataset resulted in Perovskite-R1, which can intelligently synthesize literature insights and generate innovative and practical solutions for defect passivation and the selection of precursor additives. Experimental validation of several model-proposed strategies confirms their effectiveness in improving material stability and performance. Our work demonstrates the potential of domain-adapted LLMs in accelerating materials discovery and provides a closed-loop framework for intelligent, data-driven advancements in perovskite photovoltaic research.</description>

      <title>Unconventional charge density wave in Kagome metal BaFe2Al9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The charge density wave (CDW) is a macroscopic quantum state characterized by long-range lattice distortion and modulated charge density. Conventionally, CDWs compete with other electronic orders (e.g. superconductivity) and are suppressed under hydrostatic pressure. Intriguingly, the Kagome-variant metal BaFe2Al9, crystallized in a three-dimensional structure, exhibits pressure-enhanced CDW ordering, where the transition temperature (TCDW) rises from ~110 K to room temperature near 3.6 GPa. The lattice structure was checked by both powder and single crystal x-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD data reveals an abnormal lattice expansion along a axis near 4-5 GPa upon compression. The strongly suppressed diffraction intensity and splitting diffraction spots from single crystal indicates cracking and breakdown to smaller pieces, indicative of an intrinsic first-order transition character. This anomalous response implies a CDW mechanism dominated by electron-electron and/or electron-phonon correlations, distinct from Fermi-surface nesting in conventional systems. Concomitant dome-shaped pressure-dependent resistance suggests competing electronic phases. Our work establishes BaFe2Al9 as a 3D Kagome platform with unconventional CDW behavior and strong electron-phonon coupling, which provides an alternative platform to explore the electron correlation induced exotic electronic states and other potential emergent quantum phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators are a new class of insulators with conducting surface state. Most of the topological insulators are chalcogenides, where a tiny amount of chalcogen vacancy destroys the predicted bulk insulating state and results in a metallic or semimetallic bulk electrical transport. BaBiO$_3$ (BBO) is an interesting large bandgap (0.7 eV) insulator that upon hole doping becomes a superconductor and is theoretically predicted to show a topological insulating state under electron doping. We have explored electron doping through the chemical substitution of fluorine atoms at the oxygen site. The single crystals of BBO and fluorine doped BBO were synthesized via a one-step solid-state technique. The single crystals of pure BBO and 10 % F -doped BBO (BaBiO$_{2.7}$F$_{0.3}$) are chemically single-phase samples and crystallize in monoclinic I2/m crystal structure. The core level and valence band X-ray photoelectron spectra confirm electron doping in the 10% fluorine-doped BBO. 20 % F-doped BBO appears to be a multiphase sample, confirmed by back-scattered electron (BSE) imaging and X-ray diffraction. This article reports on the successful growth of pure and F-doped BBO using a one-step solid-state technique and discusses the effect of F-doping on structural and electronic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory successfully explains the melting mechanism of two-dimensional isotropic lattices as a two-step process driven by the unbinding of topological defects. By considering the elastic theory of the square lattice, we extend the KTHNY theory to melting of square lattice solids. In addition to the familiar elastic constants that govern the theory -- the Young's modulus and the Poisson ratio -- a third constant controlling the anisotropy of the medium emerges. This modifies both the logarithmic and angular interactions between the topological defects. Despite this modification, the extended theory retains the qualitative features of the isotropic case, predicting a two-step melting with an intermediate tetratic phase. However, some subtle differences arise, including a modified bound on the translational correlation exponent and the absence of universal values for the Young's modulus at the solid-to-tetratic phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent spacetime analogs in condensed matter systems have opened a fascinating window into simulating aspects of gravitational physics in controlled laboratory environments. In this work, we develop a comprehensive nonlinear analog gravity framework within a topological material, incorporating the impact of Berry curvature on the hydrodynamic flow of electrons. Unlike prevalent studies in existing literature limited to linear perturbations, we derive and analyze a fully nonlinear wave equation governing radial perturbations of density and velocity fields, which dynamically generate an effective acoustic metric. Taking the example of graphene as a representative system, and calculating its properties from first principles, we numerically demonstrate the formation of evolving acoustic horizons and quantify analog Hawking temperatures in experimentally accessible regimes. Our findings suggest that topological materials can serve as versatile platforms to probe rich gravitational phenomena, including horizon dynamics and quasi-thermal emission, beyond conventional linear approximations. This work lays the groundwork for exploring nonlinear emergent spacetime in a broad class of quantum materials, bridging condensed matter physics and gravitational analogs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to inscribe information on single photons at high speeds is a crucial requirement for quantum applications such as quantum communication and measurement-based photonic quantum computation. Nowadays, most experimental implementations employ phase modulators in single-pass, Mach-Zehnder interferometer or Michelson interferometer configurations to encode information on photonic qubits. However, these approaches are intrinsically sensitive to environmental influences, limiting the achievable quantum error rates in practice. We report on the first demonstration of a polarization encoder for single-photon qubits based on a free-space Sagnac interferometer, showcasing inherent phase stability and overcoming previous error rate limitations. Telecom-wavelength single photons emitted by a quantum dot are modulated by the encoder under a repetition rate of 152 MHz. A quantum bit error rate of 0.69(2)% is achieved, marking the lowest error rate reported to date for high-speed information encoding on single photons. This work represents a key advance towards robust, scalable, and low-error quantum information processing with single photon sources.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale Frustrated Josephson Coupling and Multi-condensate Visualization in FeSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a Josephson junction involving multi-band superconductors, competition between inter-band and inter-junction Josephson coupling gives rise to frustration and spatial disjunction of superfluid densities among superconducting condensates. Such frustrated coupling manifests as quantum interference of Josephson currents from different tunneling channels and becomes tunable if channel transparency can be varied. To explore these unconventional effects in the prototypical $s^\pm$-wave superconductor FeSe, we use atomic resolution scanned Josephson tunneling microscopy SJTM for condensate resolved imaging and junction tuning -- capabilities unattainable in macroscopic Josephson devices with fixed characteristics. We quantitatively demonstrate frustrated Josephson tunneling by examining two tunneling inequalities. The relative transparency of two parallel tunneling pathways is found tunable, revealing a tendency towards a 0-pi transition with decreasing SJTM junction resistance. Simultaneous visualization of both superconducting condensates reveals anti correlated superfluid modulations, highlighting the role of inter-band scattering. Our study establishes SJTM as a powerful tool enabling new research frontiers of multi condensate superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: Interatomic potentials are key to uncovering microscopic structure-property relationships, essential for multiscale simulations and high-throughput experiments. For metallic glasses, their disordered atomic structure makes the development of potentials particularly challenging, resulting in the scarcity of chemistry-specific parametrizations for this important class of materials. We address this gap by introducing an efficient methodology to design machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), benchmarked on the CuZrAl system. Using a Lennard-Jones surrogate model, swap-Monte Carlo sampling, and single-point Density Functional Theory (DFT) corrections, we capture amorphous structures spanning 14 decades of supercooling. These representative configurations, competing with the experimental time scale, enable robust model training across diverse states, while minimizing the need for extensive DFT datasets. The resulting MLIP matches the experimental data and predictions of the classical embedded atom method (EAM) for structural, dynamical, energetic, and mechanical properties. This approach offers a scalable path to develop accurate MLIPs for complex metallic glasses, including emerging multi-component and high-entropy systems.</description>

      <title>BaTiO$_3$ -- SrTiO$_3$ composites: a microscopic study on paraelectric cubic inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Composites of ferroelectric and paraelectric perovskites have attracted a lot of attention due to their application potential in energy storage as well as novel computing and memory devices. So far the main focus of research has been on superlattices and ferroelectric particles in a paraelectric matrix, while the impact of paraelectric inclusions on the ferroelectric matrix is surprisingly underrepresented. To close this gap in knowledge we perform molecular dynamics simulations using an $ab\ initio$ derived effective Hamiltonian for BaTiO$_3$--SrTiO$_3$ and reveal the dependency of phase stability and phase transitions on the size and distances of paraelectric inclusions. We discuss how the combination of compressive strain and depolarization fields at the SrTiO$_3$ interfaces induces large local polarization, complex domain structures and coexisting phases as well as diffuse phase transitions and reduced coercive fields.</description>

      <title>Wettability and sp2/sp3 ratio effects on supercapacitor performance of N-doped hydrogenated amorphous Carbon Nanofoam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsed laser-deposited amorphous carbon nanofoams are potential candidate for electrochemical energy storage applications due to ultra-light weight, large volumetric void fractions, and co-existence of sp, sp2 and sp3 carbon hybridization. It is known that charge storage in carbon nanostructures containing disordered sp2-domains is determined by their wettability, surface area, and porosity. However, their charge-storage performance is limited to the areal capacitance of the order of a few mF/cm2. We enhanced the supercapacitor performance of nitrogen-doped amorphous carbon nanofoam by engineering its wettability and sp2-C/sp3-C ratio by vacuum annealing. The specific capacitance was enhanced by about fifty times and the device voltage increased from 0.8 to 1.1 V compared to as-grown carbon nanofoam. In addition, we examined for the first time the initial increase in specific capacitance of the aqueous symmetric supercapacitor with respect to the scan rate, employing in-situ measurements coupling Raman spectroscopy and electrochemistry. We attribute this effect, observed but generally not explained in previous works in the literature, to the electrochemical activation induced by structural changes during the charge storage performance. This optimization of pulsed laser deposited carbon nanofoam may open an avenue for fabricating lightweight and porous nanostructures for advanced macro-to-micro-supercapacitor devices.</description>

      <title>Permeation and thermal desorption model of hydrogen in steel: a sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a fully physical model of the hydrogen diffusion and trapping kinetics in metals, integrating permeation and thermal desorption within a unified framework. Based on the McNabb and Foster approach, it requires only binding energy and number density of trap sites. It correctly reproduces the physics of the system and the results of the analytical solutions of the permeation kinetics. It is also capable of reproducing thermal desorption spectra with considerable accuracy. The sensitivity analysis has elucidated the relationships among the processing conditions and the parameters commonly used to characterize permeation and thermal desorption experiments. An equation empirically derived from the simulation results, expressing the dependence of time lag in desorption on specimen thickness, number density of occupied trap sites, and cathodic concentration, is proposed. In summary, the model represents a valuable tool in supporting the interpretation and rationalization of experiments also from a quantitative viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dirac magnons in van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of magnon-magnon interactions in the two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr$_3$ focusing on its honeycomb lattice structure. Motivated by earlier theoretical predictions of temperature-induced spectral shifts and van Hove singularities in the magnon dispersion~\cite{PhysRevX.8.011010}, we go beyond the commonly used thermal magnon approximation by applying second-order perturbation theory in a fully numerical framework. Our analysis uncovers significant deviations from previous analysis: in particular, the predicted singularities are absent, consistent with recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements~\cite{PhysRevLett.129.127201}. Moreover, we find that the temperature dependence of the renormalized magnon spectrum exhibits a distinct $T^3$ behavior for the optical magnon branch, while retaining $T^2$ behavior for the acoustic or down magnon band. This feature sheds new light on the collective dynamics of Dirac magnons and their interactions. We further compare the honeycomb case with a triangular Bravais lattice, relevant for ferromagnetic monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, and show that both systems lack singular features while displaying quite distinct thermal trends.</description>

      <title>Extending Nonlocal Kinetic Energy Density Functionals to Isolated Systems via a Density-Functional-Dependent Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wang-Teter-like nonlocal kinetic energy density functional (KEDF) in the framework of orbital-free density functional theory, while successful in some bulk systems, exhibits a critical Blanc-Cances instability [J. Chem. Phys. 122, 214106 (2005)] when applied to isolated systems, where the total energy becomes unbounded from below. We trace this instability to the use of an ill-defined average charge density, which causes the functional to simultaneously violate the scaling law and the positivity of the Pauli energy. By rigorously constructing a density-functional-dependent kernel, we resolve these pathologies while preserving the formal exactness of the original framework. By systematically benchmarking single-atom systems of 56 elements, we find the resulting KEDF retains computational efficiency while achieving an order-of-magnitude accuracy enhancement over the WT KEDF. In addition, the new KEDF preserves WT's superior accuracy in bulk metals, outperforming the semilocal functionals in both regimes.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic magnetization dynamics in tensile-strained ultrathin yttrium iron garnets with tunable magnetic anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a significant reduction of low-temperature damping losses in tensile-strained, ultrathin Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) films grown by pulsed laser deposition, exhibiting ultralow damping constants and tunable magnetic anisotropy. Comparative broadband FMR measurements show that tensile-strained YIG films on Gd3Sc2Ga3O12 (GSGG) retain low damping even at nanometer thicknesses and cryogenic temperatures, outperforming relaxed films on Gd3Ga5O12. Based on static magnetometry measurements and microstructural characterization, we attribute these enhanced dynamic properties to the suppression of interdiffusion across the YIG/GSGG interface, resulting from enhanced chemical stability and favorable growth kinetics by the presence of Sc. Our findings highlight the importance of chemical and kinetic factors in achieving few-nanometer-thick YIG film with negligible low-temperature damping dissipation and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for cryogenic spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of a Disorder Driven Electronic Smectic Phase in Nonsymmorphic Square-Net Semimetal GdSbTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18893v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic liquid crystal (ELC) phases are spontaneous symmetry breaking states believed to arise from strong electron correlation in quantum materials such as cuprates and iron pnictides. Here, we report a direct observation of a smectic phase in a weakly correlated nonsymmorphic square-net semimetal GdSbxTe2-x. Incommensurate smectic charge modulation and intense local unidirectional nanostructure, which coexist with Dirac fermions across Fermi level, are visualized by using spectroscopic imaging - scanning tunneling microscopy. As materials with highly mobile carriers are mostly weakly correlated, the discovery of such an ELC phase are anomalous and raise questions on the origin of their emergence. Specifically, we demonstrate how chemical substitution generates these symmetry breaking phases before the system undergoes a charge density wave (CDW) - orthorhombic structural transition. Our results highlight the importance of impurities in realizing ELC phases and present a new material platform for exploring the interplay among quenched disorder, Dirac fermions and electron correlation.</description>

      <title>N\'eel Spin-Orbit Torque in Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin and Anomalous Hall Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interplay between magnetic ordering and topological electrons not only enables new topological phases but also underpins electrical control of magnetism. Here we extend the Kane-Mele model to include the exchange coupling to a collinear background antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, which can describe transition metal trichalcogenides. Owing to the spin-orbit coupling and staggered on-site potential, the system could exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall and quantum spin Hall effects in the absence of a net magnetization. Besides the chiral edge states, these topological phases support a staggered Edelstein effect through which an applied electric field can generate opposite non-equilibrium spins on the two AFM sublattices, realizing the N\'eel-type spin-orbit torque (NSOT). Contrary to known NSOTs in AFM metals driven by conduction currents, our NSOT arises from pure adiabatic currents devoid of Joule heating, while being a bulk effect not carried by the edge currents. By virtue of the NSOT, the electric field of a microwave can drive the AFM dynamics with a remarkably high efficiency. Compared to the ordinary AFM resonance driven by the magnetic field, the new mechanism can enhance the resonance amplitude by more than one order of magnitude and the absorption rate of the microwave power by over two orders of magnitude. Our findings unravel an incredible way to exploit AFM topological phases to achieve ultrafast magnetic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phase diagram of finite-layer nickelates Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the successful prediction of the superconducting phase diagram for infinite-layer nickelates, here we calculate the superconducting $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ vs. the number of layers $n$ for finite-layer nickelates using the dynamical vertex approximation. To this end, we start with density functional theory, and include local correlations non-perturbatively by dynamical mean-field theory for $n=2$ to 7. For all $n$, the Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital crosses the Fermi level, but for $n&gt;4$ there are additional $(\pi, \pi)$ pockets or tubes that slightly enhance the layer-averaged hole doping of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals beyond the leading $1/n$ contribution stemming from the valence electron count. We finally calculate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ for the single-orbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Hubbard model by dynamical vertex approximation.</description>
