      <title>Exploring $ \Lambda{\text-} $ and $ \Xi{\text -}$triton correlation functions in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, $ \Lambda{\text -} $triton(t) momentum correlation functions, to be measured in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, are explored.
  Mainly, STAR detector acquired data for Au+Au collisions at $ \sqrt{s_{NN}} =3 $ GeV provides an opportunity to explore the $ \Lambda t $ correlation function.
  A Kurihara's isle-type and spin-averaged $ \Lambda t $ potential is employed.
  The strengths of $\Lambda t$ potential is tuned in a such way to reproduce the experimental ground state energy of $_{\Lambda}^{4}H$ $ \left(\Lambda+t\right) $.
  Since the new measurements by the STAR Collaboration present a significant
  increase in the $\Lambda$ binding energy of the hypertriton and $_{\Lambda}^{4}H$ hypernuclei,
  I investigate the sensitivity of correlation function by strengthen the $\Lambda t$ potential. Besides, even though there is no experimental data on the $ \Xi{\text -} $triton interaction yet, an estimate of its momentum correlation functions by taking $ \Xi{\text -} $triton potential from the literature is given.</description>

      <title>Signature of the Gravity Wave Phase Shift in a Cold Quark Star with a Nonconvex Multicomponent van der Waals Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate nonclassical Bethe - Zel'dovich-Thompson (BZT) rarefaction shocks and the QCD phase transition in the dense core of a cold quark star in beta equilibrium subject to the multicomponent van der Waals (MvdW) equation of state (EoS) as a model of internal structure. When this system is expressed in terms of multiple components it can be used to explore the impact of a phase transition from a hadronic state to a quark plasma state with a complex clustering structure. The clustering can take the form of colored diquarks or triquarks and bound colorless meson, baryon, or hyperon states at the phase transition boundary. The resulting multicomponent EoS system is nonconvex which can give rise to nonclassical BZT phase changing shock waves. Using the BZT shock wave condition we find constraints on the quark density and examine how this changes the compactness and tidal deformability of the compact core. These results are then combined with the TOV equations to find the changes in the mass-radius relationship. These states are compared to the recent astrophysical high mass neutron star systems which may provide evidence for a core that has undergone a quark-gluon phase transition such as PSR 0943+10 or GW 190814.</description>

      <title>Fastest spinning millisecond pulsars: indicators for quark matter in neutron stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study rotating hybrid stars, with a particular emphasis on the effect of a deconfinement phase transition on their properties at high spin. Our analysis is based on a hybrid equation of state with a phase transition from hypernuclear matter to color-superconducting quark matter, where both phases are described within a relativistic density functional approach. By varying the vector and diquark couplings of quark matter, we obtain different hybrid star sequences with varying extension of the quark matter core, ensuring consistency with astrophysical constraints from mass, radius and tidal deformability measurements. We demonstrate the impact of an increasing rotational frequency on the maximum gravitational mass, the central energy density of compact stars, the rise of the quasi-radial oscillations and non-axisymmetric instabilities. We demonstrate that for the most favorable parameter sets with a strong vector coupling, hybrid star configurations with color-superconducting quark matter core can describe the fastest spinning and heaviest galactic pulsar J0952-0607, while it is out of reach for the purely hadronic hypernuclear star configuration.
  We also revise the previously proposed empirical relation between the Kepler frequency, gravitational mass, and radius of non-rotating neutron stars, obtained based on the assumption that all neutron stars, up to the heaviest, are hadronic. We show how the phase transition to quark matter alters this relation and, consequently, the constraints on the dense matter equation of state. Our findings reveal that incorporating the hybrid equation of state has significant implications for the constraints on the properties of strongly interacting matter and neutron stars, placing the upper limit on $R_{1.4}\leq14.90$ km (considering the 716 Hz frequency limit from J1748+2446ad) and $R_{1.4}\leq$11.90~km (for 1000 Hz).</description>

      <title>Efficacious qubit mappings for quantum simulations of the $^{12}$C rotational band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving atomic nuclei from first principles places enormous demands on computational resources, which grow exponentially with increasing number of particles and the size of the space they occupy. We present first quantum simulations based on the variational quantum eigensolver for the low-lying structure of the $^{12}$C nucleus that provide acceptable bound-state energies even in the presence of noise. We achieve this by taking advantage of two critical developments. First, we utilize an almost perfect symmetry of atomic nuclei that, in a complete symmetry-adapted basis, drastically reduces the size of the model space. Second, we use the efficacious Gray encoding, for which it has been recently shown that it is resource efficient, especially when coupled with a near band-diagonal structure of the nuclear Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Enhancing radioisotope identification in gamma spectra with transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods in gamma spectroscopy have the potential to provide accurate, real-time classification of unknown radioactive samples. However, obtaining sufficient experimental training data is often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, and models trained solely on synthetic data can struggle to generalize to the unpredictable range of real-world operating scenarios. In this work, we pretrain a model using physically derived synthetic data and subsequently leverage transfer learning techniques to fine-tune the model for a specific target domain. This paradigm enables us to embed physical principles during the pretraining step, thus requiring less data from the target domain compared to classical machine learning methods. Results of this analysis indicate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform those trained exclusively on synthetic data or solely on target-domain data, particularly in the intermediate data regime (${\approx} 10^4$ training samples). This conclusion is consistent across four different machine learning architectures (MLP, CNN, Transformer, and LSTM) considered in this study. This research serves as proof of concept for applying transfer learning techniques to application scenarios where access to experimental data is limited.</description>

      <title>Investigation of $\pi N$ contributions to nucleon matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate an improved method to extract nucleon matrix elements from lattice 3-point functions using a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) with nucleon and pion-nucleon interpolating fields. Our method avoids the computation of the costly three-point functions that have pion-nucleon interpolators at both source and sink. We demonstrate that excited state contamination from $N\pi$ is minimized in nucleon matrix elements of the scalar, vector, pseudoscalar, axial, and tensor currents and discuss our results based on a physical-point ensemble with a pion mass value of 131 MeV. We find that the GEVP is most significant for the isovector pseudoscalar and axial currents.</description>

      <title>Toward a Direct Measurement of Partial Restoration of Chiral Symmetry at J-PARC E16 via Density-induced Chiral Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The degeneracy of chiral partners is an ideal signal for measuring the restoration of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry in QCD. In this work, we investigate the observability of the $\phi$ - $f_1(1420)$ degeneracy in the J-PARC E16 experiment, which measures di-electrons emitted from 30 GeV pA collisions. We for this purpose make use of an effective Lagrangian approach, which naturally incorporates the broken charge-conjugation symmetry in nuclear matter and the ensuing anomaly-induced mixing between vector and axial-vector mesons, to compute the spectral function relevant for the experimental measurement. The real-time dynamics of the pA collision is obtained from a transport simulation. Including experimental background and resolution effects on top of that, we find that a signal of the $\phi$ - $f_1(1420)$ mixing can be observed around 2.5 $\sigma$ with the Run2 statistics planned for the J-PARC E16 experiment with an ideal mixing strength.</description>

      <title>Implementation and investigation of electron-nucleus scattering in NEUT neutrino event generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding nuclear effects is essential for improving the sensitivity of neutrino oscillation measurements. Validating nuclear models solely through neutrino scattering data is challenging due to limited statistics and the broad energy spectrum of neutrinos. In contrast, electron scattering experiments provide abundant high-precision data with various monochromatic energies and angles. Since both neutrinos and electrons interact via electroweak interactions, the same nuclear models can be applied to simulate both interactions. Thus, high-precision electron scattering data is essential for validating the nuclear models used in neutrino experiments. To enable this, the author has newly implemented electron scattering in the \texttt{NEUT} neutrino event generator, covering two interaction modes: quasielastic (QE) and single pion production. \texttt{NEUT} predictions of QE agree well with numerical calculations, supporting the validity of this implementation. From comparisons with \texttt{NEUT} predictions and inclusive electron scattering data, the momentum-dependent binding energy correction is derived, corresponding to effects beyond the plane wave impulse approximation. The impact of this correction on neutrino interactions is also evaluated. Significant differences in charged lepton kinematics are observed, with approximately 20\,MeV of peak shift in the reconstructed neutrino energy distribution, which is important for accurately measuring neutrino oscillation parameters. It is expected to serve as a foundation for future discussions on electron scattering using \texttt{NEUT}.</description>

Abstract: We review recent experimental and theoretical results for the electromagnetic form factors of hyperons (Y) in the timelike region, accessible in the reactions $e^+e^-\to \bar YY$. Specifically, we focus on the final states $\bar \Lambda\Lambda$, $\bar\Lambda\Sigma^0$/$\bar \Sigma^0\Lambda$, $\bar \Sigma\Sigma$, $\bar \Xi\Xi$, and $\bar\Omega\Omega$.

      <description>arXiv:2412.07572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approach of direct integration of the three-dimensional Faddeev equations with respect to the breakup T-matrix in momentum space for three bodies of different masses is presented. The Faddeev equations are written out explicitly without the requirement for symmetry or antisymmetry of two-body t matrices, taking into account the difference in the masses of three interacting particles. An algorithm for the algebraic search for non-relativistic wave functions of a system of three bodies of different masses is described. A significant change in the domain of logarithmic singularities of the integral kernels of the Faddeev equations from the choice of masses of interacting particles is demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of the $X(1880)$, the structure around the $\bar{p}p$ threshold that appears in the $3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ invariant mass spectrum in the decay process of $J/\psi \to \gamma 3(\pi^+\pi^-)$. Nucleon-antinucleon rescattering is taken into account in our analysis, and the decay amplitude of $J/\psi \to \gamma 3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ can be obtained by the distorted wave Born approximation. With these amplitudes, we analyze the contributions to the $X(1880)$ from different partial waves. Our analysis suggests that the $X(1880)$ should be isoscalar $0^{-+}$, and it is generated by the threshold behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use chiral perturbation theory to study the long distance regime of transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMD PDFs). Chiral corrections to the TMD PDFs are computed from proton to pion/baryon splittings. For consistent power counting, we find that the fraction of the proton's momentum that a pion may carry must be kept small. We make predictions for a $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ asymmetry in the proton's TMD PDFs and find that the effective theory gives a natural exponential suppression of the TMD PDF at long distances. We then explore the effects that additional nonperturbative physics may have on the TMD $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ asymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate kaonic atom states based on the latest high precision data of the $2p$ states of the kaonic atoms in $^3$He and $^4$He (J-PARC E62). We consider the phenomenological form for the optical potential proportional to the nuclear density distributions and determine the potential parameters by the latest data. We find two sets of potential parameters for each of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He that reproduce the data. We then extract the potential parameters consistent with the data of $^3$He and $^4$He atoms simultaneously. Using the potential, we investigate the structure of the kaonic atoms and kaonic nuclei for various nuclei up to Sn. We also report the optical potential parameters suited for the global description of the atomic data, the possible strong isospin dependence of the potential, and the different strength of the data of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He in the restrictions on the potential parameters. In addition, we find that the study of the $1s$ states of the kaonic helium atom is very interesting as a next step, and the determination of the orbital angular momenta of the kaonic nuclear states is helpful for the unified understandings of the atomic and nuclear bound states of kaon because of the mutual influence between the atomic and the nuclear states of kaon with the same orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic study of the $ \Omega \alpha $ interaction in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-particle momentum correlation between the Omega-baryon ($\Omega$) and the $^{4}He (\alpha) $ in high-energy heavy ion collisions is explored.
  Such correlations as an alternative source of information can help us further understand the interaction between $ \Omega $ and nucleons (N).
  $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials in the single-folding potential approach are constructed by employing two different available $\Omega N $ interactions in $^{5}S_{2}$ channel, i.e, one is based on the (2 + 1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations near the physical point by the HAL QCD collaboration, and another is based on the meson exchanges with effective Lagrangian, where in the latter case coupled channels effect is considered.
  It is found that the correlation functions at small size source depends on the used potential model. This implicitly means that at high density nuclear medium, $ \Omega \alpha $ momentum correlation could drive the feature of $ \Omega N $ interactions.
  Moreover, by extracting the scattering length and the effective range from obtained $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials, the correlation functions are calculated within the Lednicky-Lyuboshits (LL) formalism.
  It is shown that since the $\Omega\alpha $ has large interaction range, the LL formula leads to different results at small source size.</description>

Abstract: The statistical hadronization model has been successful in extracting information at chemical freeze-out in heavy-ion collisions. At RHIC, with a collision energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, many different ion species have been used for $A$+$A$ collisions. This allows for a scan across the charge fraction $Y_Q=Z/A$, where $Z$ is the proton number and $A$ is the baryon number. We first make predictions for $A$+$A$ collisions that do not yet have published experimental data on hadron yield ratios (O+O, Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr). We then use both the experimental and predicted yield ratios to perform thermal fits across $Y_Q$, enabling us to extract $s/n_B$ and other thermodynamic information at chemical freeze-out. Using the relation between $s/n_B$ and $Y_Q$, we can calculate a new constraint on the finite temperature equation of state at finite densities. We discuss implications of this constraint and propose future runs that can help connect to the equation of state relevant for neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Enabled Intensity Interferometry in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important tool in studying the sub-femtoscale spacetime structure of matter in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) intensity interferometry of identical particles in the final state of such collisions. We show here that a variant of an entanglement enabled intensity interferometry ($E^2 I^2$) proposed by Cotler and Wilczek provides a powerful alternative to HBT interferometry in extracting fundamental nonperturbative features of QCD at high energies. In particular, we show that the spatial distributions of color singlet (pomeron) configurations in nuclei can be obtained from exclusive resonant decays of $\rho$-mesons into $\pi^\pm$-pairs in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions (UPCs) at RHIC and the LHC. The $E^2 I^2$ framework developed here is quite general. It can be employed to extract information on the spin structure of pomeron couplings as well as enhance the discovery potential for rare odderon configurations from exclusive vector meson decays into few-particle final states both in UPCs and at the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Generating ultra-compact neutron stars with bosonic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the properties of neutron stars admixed with selfinteracting scalar bosonic dark matter. The dark matter interaction is described by a generalized $\phi^n$ power-law potential. We perform a stability analysis of these two-fluid objects by studying the onset of the unstable radial modes. We find ultra-compact neutron star-dark matter configurations where the neutron star matter is confined to a core radius of values below $7$ km which is unreachable for pure neutron stars. The total gravitational maximum mass of these ultra-compact configurations can have values of $3.4 \, M_\odot$. With our general ansatz of the power-law potential we show that the compactness of these solutions can be extreme, i.e. the compactness is $C = 1/3$ or even larger, making them compact enough to have a light-ring mimicking black holes. These ultra-compact objects are stable and possess a dark matter halo while having a hadronic matter core. With the addition of dark matter to neutron stars recent unusual mass-radius measurements of compact stars can be explained. We conclude that apparently contradictory measurements of neutron star masses and radii could be not only an indication of the presence of dark matter around a the hadronic matter core which is stabilized by the gravitational potential of dark matter but could also serve to disentangle the selfinteraction strength of dark matter. Our work points to a stiff equation of state for the dark matter fluid, rather than a soft one.</description>

      <title>Polarizabilities from kaon Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polarizabilities of light pseudoscalar mesons can be extracted from differential cross sections for Compton scattering near threshold. While this has been accomplished for charged pions employing Primakoff reactions, a corresponding measurement for kaons will be affected by the presence of the $K^*(892)$ resonance not too far from threshold. We propose a method to extend the energy range serviceable for this purpose by reconstructing the $K^*(892)$ contribution model-independently from its $K\pi$ intermediate state, using dispersion theory. We point out that, in contrast to the charged-pion analog, there is likely no strong hierarchy between sum and difference of electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities; we discuss the sensitivity to disentangling both by improved experimental angular coverage.</description>

      <title>Constraining Jet Quenching in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jet suppression and modification is a hallmark feature of heavy-ion collisions. This can be attributed to an accumulated set of effects, including radiative and elastic energy loss and reabsorption of thermalized energy within the jet cone, which are encoded in a quenching weight, determining the probability distribution for a shift of the $p_T$ (energy loss). We perform a data-driven analysis, based on Bayesian inference, to extract information about the energy-loss distribution experienced by propagating jets using generic and flexible parametrizations. We first establish the consistency between different data-sets and, thereby, provide evidence for the universality of the quark/gluon quenching weights for different observables. Furthermore, we extract that the color dependence of energy loss is slightly bigger than what expected from Casimir scaling, pointing to the importance of multi-parton quenching within high-$p_T$ jets at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics in heavy and light-ion collisions -- II) Determining the origin of collective behavior in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the first measurements of the same ion species in OO collisons at RHIC and LHC, we propose an observable to distinguish whether collective behavior builds up through a hydrodynamic expansion of a strongly interacting QGP or few final state re-scatterings. Our procedure allows to disentangle the effects of the initial state geometry and the dynamical response mechanism on anisotropic flow. We validate its ability to discriminate between systems with different interaction rates using results from event-by-event simulations in kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics in action: effective field theory and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics (CAMHD) provides a low-energy effective framework for describing chiral fluids in the presence of dynamical electromagnetic fields and axial anomaly. This theory finds applications across diverse physical systems, including heavy-ion collisions, the early universe, and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. Along with Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective theories, holographic models serve as a complementary tool to provide a systematic formulation of CAMHD that goes beyond the weak coupling regime. In this work, we explore holographic models with $U(1)_A \times U(1)$ symmetry, where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ field is rendered dynamical through mixed boundary conditions applied to the bulk gauge field and the axial anomaly is introduced via a Chern-Simons bulk term. Through a detailed holographic SK analysis, we demonstrate that the low-energy effective action derived from this model aligns precisely with the SK field theory proposed by Landry and Liu and, in fact, it generalizes it to scenarios with finite background axial field. This alignment not only validates the holographic model but also paves the way for its use in exploring unresolved aspects of CAMHD, such as the recently proposed chiral magnetic electric separation wave and nonlinear chiral instabilities.</description>
