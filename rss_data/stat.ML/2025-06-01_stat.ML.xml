      <title>Boosting In-Context Learning in LLMs Through the Lens of Classical Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new tasks with just a few examples, but their predictions often suffer from systematic biases, leading to unstable performances in classification. While calibration techniques are proposed to mitigate these biases, we show that, in the logit space, many of these methods are equivalent to merely shifting the LLM's decision boundary without having the ability to alter its orientation. This proves inadequate when biases cause the LLM to be severely misdirected. To address these limitations and provide a unifying framework, we propose Supervised Calibration (SC), a loss-minimization based framework which learns an optimal, per-class affine transformation of the LLM's predictive probabilities in the logit space without requiring external data beyond the context. By using a more expressive functional class, SC not only subsumes many existing calibration methods in ICL as special cases, but also enables the ability to alter and even completely reverse the orientation of the LLM's decision boundary. Furthermore, SC's loss-based nature facilitates the seamless integration of two purpose-built regularization techniques: context-invariance and directional trust-region. The former is designed to tackle the instability issue in ICL, while the latter controls the degree of calibration. Finally, SC delivers state-of-the-art performance over calibration baselines in the 4-shot, 8-shot, and 16-shot settings across all nine datasets for Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, LLaMA-2-7B-chat, and Qwen2-7B-Instruct.</description>

      <title>Gibbs randomness-compression proposition: An efficient deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proposition that connects randomness and compression put forward via Gibbs entropy over set of measurement vectors associated with a compression process. The proposition states that a lossy compression process is equivalent to {\it directed randomness} that preserves information content. The proposition originated from the observed behaviour in newly proposed {\it Dual Tomographic Compression} (DTC) compress-train framework. This is akin to tomographic reconstruction of layer weight matrices via building compressed sensed projections, so called {\it weight rays}. This tomographic approach is applied to previous and next layers in a dual fashion, that triggers neuronal-level pruning. This novel model compress-train scheme appear in iterative fashion and act as smart neural architecture search, Experiments demonstrated utility of this dual-tomography producing state-of-the-art performance with efficient compression during training, accelerating and supporting lottery ticket hypothesis. However, random compress-train iterations having similar performance demonstrated the connection between randomness and compression from statistical physics perspective, we formulated so called {\it Gibbs randomness-compression proposition}, signifying randomness-compression relationship via Gibbs entropy. Practically, DTC framework provides a promising approach for massively energy and resource efficient deep learning training approach.</description>

      <title>Conformal Object Detection by Sequential Risk Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in object detectors have led to their adoption for industrial uses. However, their deployment in critical applications is hindered by the inherent lack of reliability of neural networks and the complex structure of object detection models. To address these challenges, we turn to Conformal Prediction, a post-hoc procedure which offers statistical guarantees that are valid for any dataset size, without requiring prior knowledge on the model or data distribution. Our contribution is manifold: first, we formally define the problem of Conformal Object Detection (COD) and introduce a novel method, Sequential Conformal Risk Control (SeqCRC), that extends the statistical guarantees of Conformal Risk Control (CRC) to two sequential tasks with two parameters, as required in the COD setting. Then, we propose loss functions and prediction sets suited to applying CRC to different applications and certification requirements. Finally, we present a conformal toolkit, enabling replication and further exploration of our methods. Using this toolkit, we perform extensive experiments, yielding a benchmark that validates the investigated methods and emphasizes trade-offs and other practical consequences.</description>

      <title>Performative Risk Control: Calibrating Models for Reliable Deployment under Performativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibrating blackbox machine learning models to achieve risk control is crucial to ensure reliable decision-making. A rich line of literature has been studying how to calibrate a model so that its predictions satisfy explicit finite-sample statistical guarantees under a fixed, static, and unknown data-generating distribution. However, prediction-supported decisions may influence the outcome they aim to predict, a phenomenon named performativity of predictions, which is commonly seen in social science and economics. In this paper, we introduce Performative Risk Control, a framework to calibrate models to achieve risk control under performativity with provable theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we provide an iteratively refined calibration process, where we ensure the predictions are improved and risk-controlled throughout the process. We also study different types of risk measures and choices of tail bounds. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by numerical experiments on the task of predicting credit default risk. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to study statistically rigorous risk control under performativity, which will serve as an important safeguard against a wide range of strategic manipulation in decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>A Mathematical Perspective On Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning is a methodology for linking different data modalities; the canonical example is linking image and text data. The methodology is typically framed as the identification of a set of encoders, one for each modality, that align representations within a common latent space. In this work, we focus on the bimodal setting and interpret contrastive learning as the optimization of (parameterized) encoders that define conditional probability distributions, for each modality conditioned on the other, consistent with the available data. This provides a framework for multimodal algorithms such as crossmodal retrieval, which identifies the mode of one of these conditional distributions, and crossmodal classification, which is similar to retrieval but includes a fine-tuning step to make it task specific.
  The framework we adopt also gives rise to crossmodal generative models. This probabilistic perspective suggests two natural generalizations of contrastive learning: the introduction of novel probabilistic loss functions, and the use of alternative metrics for measuring alignment in the common latent space. We study these generalizations of the classical approach in the multivariate Gaussian setting. In this context we view the latent space identification as a low-rank matrix approximation problem. This allows us to characterize the capabilities of loss functions and alignment metrics to approximate natural statistics, such as conditional means and covariances; doing so yields novel variants on contrastive learning algorithms for specific mode-seeking and for generative tasks. The framework we introduce is also studied through numerical experiments on multivariate Gaussians, the labeled MNIST dataset, and on a data assimilation application arising in oceanography.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Learning for Heterogeneous Data via Integrating Shared and Task-Specific Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has become an essential machine learning tool for addressing multiple learning tasks simultaneously and has been effectively applied across fields such as healthcare, marketing, and biomedical research. However, to enable efficient information sharing across tasks, it is crucial to leverage both shared and heterogeneous information. Despite extensive research on MTL, various forms of heterogeneity, including distribution and posterior heterogeneity, present significant challenges. Existing methods often fail to address these forms of heterogeneity within a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a dual-encoder framework to construct a heterogeneous latent factor space for each task, incorporating a task-shared encoder to capture common information across tasks and a task-specific encoder to preserve unique task characteristics. Additionally, we explore the intrinsic similarity structure of the coefficients corresponding to learned latent factors, allowing for adaptive integration across tasks to manage posterior heterogeneity. We introduce a unified algorithm that alternately learns the task-specific and task-shared encoders and coefficients. In theory, we investigate the excess risk bound for the proposed MTL method using local Rademacher complexity and apply it to a new but related task. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing data integration methods across various settings. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves superior predictive performance for time to tumor doubling across five distinct cancer types in PDX data.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Distribution for t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding with Generalized Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a well-known algorithm for visualizing high-dimensional data by finding low-dimensional representations. In this paper, we study the convergence of t-SNE with generalized kernels and extend the results of Auffinger and Fletcher in 2023. Our work starts by giving a concrete formulation of generalized input and output kernels. Then we prove that under certain conditions, the t-SNE algorithm converges to an equilibrium distribution for a wide range of input and output kernels as the number of data points diverges.</description>

      <title>Two failure modes of deep transformers and how to avoid them: a unified theory of signal propagation at initialisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the right initialisation for neural networks is crucial to ensure smooth training and good performance. In transformers, the wrong initialisation can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse, where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse, where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While the right initialisation has been extensively studied in feed-forward networks, an exact description of signal propagation through a full transformer block has so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal propagation through vanilla transformer blocks with self-attention layers, layer normalisation, skip connections and ReLU MLP. To treat the self-attention layer, we draw on a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from statistical physics. We identify and characterise two regimes governed by the variance of the query and key initialisations: a low-variance regime, where we recover the known rank collapse behaviour; and a previously unexplored high-variance regime, where signal is preserved but \textit{entropy collapse} occurs. In the low-variance regime, we calculate the critical strength for the residual connection to ensure signal propagation. Our theory yields trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation hyper-parameters for a given architecture. Experiments with BERT-style models trained on TinyStories validate our predictions. Our theoretical framework gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual connections that guarantees smooth training.</description>

      <title>Predictive posterior sampling from non-stationnary Gaussian process priors via Diffusion models with application to climate data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian models based on Gaussian processes (GPs) offer a flexible framework to predict spatially distributed variables with uncertainty. But the use of nonstationary priors, often necessary for capturing complex spatial patterns, makes sampling from the predictive posterior distribution (PPD) computationally intractable. In this paper, we propose a two-step approach based on diffusion generative models (DGMs) to mimic PPDs associated with non-stationary GP priors: we replace the GP prior by a DGM surrogate, and leverage recent advances on training-free guidance algorithms for DGMs to sample from the desired posterior distribution. We apply our approach to a rich non-stationary GP prior from which exact posterior sampling is untractable and validate that the issuing distributions are close to their GP counterpart using several statistical metrics. We also demonstrate how one can fine-tune the trained DGMs to target specific parts of the GP prior. Finally we apply the proposed approach to solve inverse problems arising in environmental sciences, thus yielding state-of-the-art predictions.</description>

      <title>Impact of Bottleneck Layers and Skip Connections on the Generalization of Linear Denoising Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern deep neural networks exhibit strong generalization even in highly overparameterized regimes. Significant progress has been made to understand this phenomenon in the context of supervised learning, but for unsupervised tasks such as denoising, several open questions remain. While some recent works have successfully characterized the test error of the linear denoising problem, they are limited to linear models (one-layer network). In this work, we focus on two-layer linear denoising autoencoders trained under gradient flow, incorporating two key ingredients of modern deep learning architectures: A low-dimensional bottleneck layer that effectively enforces a rank constraint on the learned solution, as well as the possibility of a skip connection that bypasses the bottleneck. We derive closed-form expressions for all critical points of this model under product regularization, and in particular describe its global minimizer under the minimum-norm principle. From there, we derive the test risk formula in the overparameterized regime, both for models with and without skip connections. Our analysis reveals two interesting phenomena: Firstly, the bottleneck layer introduces an additional complexity measure akin to the classical bias-variance trade-off -- increasing the bottleneck width reduces bias but introduces variance, and vice versa. Secondly, skip connection can mitigate the variance in denoising autoencoders -- especially when the model is mildly overparameterized. We further analyze the impact of skip connections in denoising autoencoder using random matrix theory and support our claims with numerical evidence.</description>

      <title>K$^2$IE: Kernel Method-based Kernel Intensity Estimators for Inhomogeneous Poisson Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel method-based intensity estimators, formulated within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), and classical kernel intensity estimators (KIEs) have been among the most easy-to-implement and feasible methods for estimating the intensity functions of inhomogeneous Poisson processes. While both approaches share the term "kernel", they are founded on distinct theoretical principles, each with its own strengths and limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel regularized kernel method for Poisson processes based on the least squares loss and show that the resulting intensity estimator involves a specialized variant of the representer theorem: it has the dual coefficient of unity and coincides with classical KIEs. This result provides new theoretical insights into the connection between classical KIEs and kernel method-based intensity estimators, while enabling us to develop an efficient KIE by leveraging advanced techniques from RKHS theory. We refer to the proposed model as the kernel method-based kernel intensity estimator (K$^2$IE). Through experiments on synthetic datasets, we show that K$^2$IE achieves comparable predictive performance while significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art kernel method-based estimator in computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Knockoff-Guided Compressive Sensing: A Statistical Machine Learning Framework for Support-Assured Signal Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Knockoff-guided compressive sensing framework, referred to as \TheName{}, which enhances signal recovery by leveraging precise false discovery rate (FDR) control during the support identification phase. Unlike LASSO, which jointly performs support selection and signal estimation without explicit error control, our method guarantees FDR control in finite samples, enabling more reliable identification of the true signal support. By separating and controlling the support recovery process through statistical Knockoff filters, our framework achieves more accurate signal reconstruction, especially in challenging scenarios where traditional methods fail. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating how FDR control directly ensures recovery performance under weaker conditions than traditional $\ell_1$-based compressive sensing methods, while maintaining accurate signal reconstruction. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed Knockoff-based method consistently outperforms LASSO-based and other state-of-the-art compressive sensing techniques. In simulation studies, our method improves F1-score by up to 3.9x over baseline methods, attributed to principled false discovery rate (FDR) control and enhanced support recovery. The method also consistently yields lower reconstruction and relative errors. We further validate the framework on real-world datasets, where it achieves top downstream predictive performance across both regression and classification tasks, often narrowing or even surpassing the performance gap relative to uncompressed signals. These results establish \TheName{} as a robust and practical alternative to existing approaches, offering both theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance through statistically grounded support selection.</description>

      <title>Generalization Dynamics of Linear Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models trained on finite datasets with $N$ samples from a target distribution exhibit a transition from memorisation, where the model reproduces training examples, to generalisation, where it produces novel samples that reflect the underlying data distribution. Understanding this transition is key to characterising the sample efficiency and reliability of generative models, but our theoretical understanding of this transition is incomplete. Here, we analytically study the memorisation-to-generalisation transition in a simple model using linear denoisers, which allow explicit computation of test errors, sampling distributions, and Kullback-Leibler divergences between samples and target distribution. Using these measures, we predict that this transition occurs roughly when $N \asymp d$, the dimension of the inputs. When $N$ is smaller than the dimension of the inputs $d$, so that only a fraction of relevant directions of variation are present in the training data, we demonstrate how both regularization and early stopping help to prevent overfitting. For $N &gt; d$, we find that the sampling distributions of linear diffusion models approach their optimum (measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence) linearly with $d/N$, independent of the specifics of the data distribution. Our work clarifies how sample complexity governs generalisation in a simple model of diffusion-based generative models and provides insight into the training dynamics of linear denoisers.</description>

In particular, we propose to estimate an optimal shrinkage coefficient by setting $\alpha$ as the solution to a suitably chosen objective function; namely the leave-one-out cross-validated (LOOCV) log-likelihood loss. Since LOOCV is computationally prohibitive even for moderate sample size $n$, we propose a computationally efficient approximation for the LOOCV log-likelihood loss that eliminates the need for invoking the RTME procedure $n$ times for each sample left out during the LOOCV procedure. This approximation yields an $O(n)$ reduction in the running time complexity for the LOOCV procedure, which results in a significant speedup for computing the LOOCV estimate. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach on synthetic high-dimensional data sampled from heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, as well as on real high-dimensional datasets for object recognition, face recognition, and handwritten digit's recognition. Our experiments show that the proposed approach is efficient and consistently more accurate than other methods in the literature for shrinkage coefficient estimation.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics of extensive-width Bayesian neural networks near interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For three decades statistical mechanics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. However, the theoretically tractable models, e.g., perceptrons, random features models and kernel machines, or multi-index models and committee machines with few neurons, remained simple compared to those used in applications. In this paper we help reducing the gap between practical networks and their theoretical understanding through a statistical physics analysis of the supervised learning of a two-layer fully connected network with generic weight distribution and activation function, whose hidden layer is large but remains proportional to the inputs dimension. This makes it more realistic than infinitely wide networks where no feature learning occurs, but also more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed inner weights. We focus on the Bayes-optimal learning in the teacher-student scenario, i.e., with a dataset generated by another network with the same architecture. We operate around interpolation, where the number of trainable parameters and of data are comparable and feature learning emerges. Our analysis uncovers a rich phenomenology with various learning transitions as the number of data increases. In particular, the more strongly the features (i.e., hidden neurons of the target) contribute to the observed responses, the less data is needed to learn them. Moreover, when the data is scarce, the model only learns non-linear combinations of the teacher weights, rather than "specialising" by aligning its weights with the teacher's. Specialisation occurs only when enough data becomes available, but it can be hard to find for practical training algorithms, possibly due to statistical-to-computational~gaps.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Bayesian Optimization Via In-Context Direct Optimum Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimization of expensive black-box functions is ubiquitous in science and engineering. A common solution to this problem is Bayesian optimization (BO), which is generally comprised of two components: (i) a surrogate model and (ii) an acquisition function, which generally require expensive re-training and optimization steps at each iteration, respectively. Although recent work enabled in-context surrogate models that do not require re-training, virtually all existing BO methods still require acquisition function maximization to select the next observation, which introduces many knobs to tune, such as Monte Carlo samplers and multi-start optimizers. In this work, we propose a completely in-context, zero-shot solution for BO that does not require surrogate fitting or acquisition function optimization. This is done by using a pre-trained deep generative model to directly sample from the posterior over the optimum point. We show that this process is equivalent to Thompson sampling and demonstrate the capabilities and cost-effectiveness of our foundation model on a suite of real-world benchmarks. We achieve an efficiency gain of more than 35x in terms of wall-clock time when compared with Gaussian process-based BO, enabling efficient parallel and distributed BO, e.g., for high-throughput optimization.</description>

      <title>Confidential Guardian: Cryptographically Prohibiting the Abuse of Model Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cautious predictions -- where a machine learning model abstains when uncertain -- are crucial for limiting harmful errors in safety-critical applications. In this work, we identify a novel threat: a dishonest institution can exploit these mechanisms to discriminate or unjustly deny services under the guise of uncertainty. We demonstrate the practicality of this threat by introducing an uncertainty-inducing attack called Mirage, which deliberately reduces confidence in targeted input regions, thereby covertly disadvantaging specific individuals. At the same time, Mirage maintains high predictive performance across all data points. To counter this threat, we propose Confidential Guardian, a framework that analyzes calibration metrics on a reference dataset to detect artificially suppressed confidence. Additionally, it employs zero-knowledge proofs of verified inference to ensure that reported confidence scores genuinely originate from the deployed model. This prevents the provider from fabricating arbitrary model confidence values while protecting the model's proprietary details. Our results confirm that Confidential Guardian effectively prevents the misuse of cautious predictions, providing verifiable assurances that abstention reflects genuine model uncertainty rather than malicious intent.</description>

      <title>A2 Copula-Driven Spatial Bayesian Neural Network For Modeling Non-Gaussian Dependence: A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the A2 Copula Spatial Bayesian Neural Network (A2-SBNN), a predictive spatial model designed to map coordinates to continuous fields while capturing both typical spatial patterns and extreme dependencies. By embedding the dual-tail novel Archimedean copula viz. A2 directly into the network's weight initialization, A2-SBNN naturally models complex spatial relationships, including rare co-movements in the data. The model is trained through a calibration-driven process combining Wasserstein loss, moment matching, and correlation penalties to refine predictions and manage uncertainty. Simulation results show that A2-SBNN consistently delivers high accuracy across a wide range of dependency strengths, offering a new, effective solution for spatial data modeling beyond traditional Gaussian-based approaches.</description>

      <title>The Rich and the Simple: On the Implicit Bias of Adam and SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adam is the de facto optimization algorithm for several deep learning applications, but an understanding of its implicit bias and how it differs from other algorithms, particularly standard first-order methods such as (stochastic) gradient descent (GD), remains limited. In practice, neural networks trained with SGD are known to exhibit simplicity bias -- a tendency to find simple solutions. In contrast, we show that Adam is more resistant to such simplicity bias. To demystify this phenomenon, in this paper, we investigate the differences in the implicit biases of Adam and GD when training two-layer ReLU neural networks on a binary classification task involving synthetic data with Gaussian clusters. We find that GD exhibits a simplicity bias, resulting in a linear decision boundary with a suboptimal margin, whereas Adam leads to much richer and more diverse features, producing a nonlinear boundary that is closer to the Bayes' optimal predictor. This richer decision boundary also allows Adam to achieve higher test accuracy both in-distribution and under certain distribution shifts. We theoretically prove these results by analyzing the population gradients. To corroborate our theoretical findings, we present empirical results showing that this property of Adam leads to superior generalization across datasets with spurious correlations where neural networks trained with SGD are known to show simplicity bias and don't generalize well under certain distributional shifts.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Inductive Biases of Neural Networks on Boolean Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are renowned for their ability to generalise well across diverse tasks, even when heavily overparameterized. Existing works offer only partial explanations (for example, the NTK-based task-model alignment explanation neglects feature learning). Here, we provide an end-to-end, analytically tractable case study that links a network's inductive prior, its training dynamics including feature learning, and its eventual generalisation. Specifically, we exploit the one-to-one correspondence between depth-2 discrete fully connected networks and disjunctive normal form (DNF) formulas by training on Boolean functions. Under a Monte Carlo learning algorithm, our model exhibits predictable training dynamics and the emergence of interpretable features. This framework allows us to trace, in detail, how inductive bias and feature formation drive generalisation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive finite element type decomposition of Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of approximate Gaussian processes (GP) obtained by taking a linear combination of compactly supported basis functions with the basis coefficients endowed with a dependent Gaussian prior distribution. This general class includes a popular approach that uses a finite element approximation of the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) associated with Mat\'ern GP. We explored another scalable alternative popularly used in the computer emulation literature where the basis coefficients at a lattice are drawn from a Gaussian process with an inverse-Gamma bandwidth. For both approaches, we study concentration rates of the posterior distribution. We demonstrated that the SPDE associated approach with a fixed smoothness parameter leads to a suboptimal rate despite how the number of basis functions and bandwidth are chosen when the underlying true function is sufficiently smooth. On the flip side, we showed that the later approach is rate-optimal adaptively over all smoothness levels of the underlying true function if an appropriate prior is placed on the number of basis functions. Efficient computational strategies are developed and numerics are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the predictive capabilities of echo state networks (ESNs) for the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (gKS) equation, an archetypal nonlinear PDE that exhibits spatiotemporal chaos. We introduce a novel methodology that integrates ESNs with transfer learning, aiming to enhance predictive performance across various parameter regimes of the gKS model. Our research focuses on predicting changes in long-term statistical patterns of the gKS model that result from varying the dispersion relation or the length of the spatial domain. We use transfer learning to adapt ESNs to different parameter settings and successfully capture changes in the underlying chaotic attractor.</description>

      <title>On the Expressive Power of Mixture-of-Experts for Structured Complex Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-experts networks (MoEs) have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in modern deep learning. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical foundations underlying their ability to model complex tasks remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the expressive power of MoEs in modeling complex tasks with two common structural priors: low-dimensionality and sparsity. For shallow MoEs, we prove that they can efficiently approximate functions supported on low-dimensional manifolds, overcoming the curse of dimensionality. For deep MoEs, we show that $\cO(L)$-layer MoEs with $E$ experts per layer can approximate piecewise functions comprising $E^L$ pieces with compositional sparsity, i.e., they can exhibit an exponential number of structured tasks. Our analysis reveals the roles of critical architectural components and hyperparameters in MoEs, including the gating mechanism, expert networks, the number of experts, and the number of layers, and offers natural suggestions for MoE variants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of statistical methodologies on studying groundwater has been significant in the last several decades, due to cheaper computational abilities and presence of technologies that enable us to extract and measure more and more data. This paper focuses on the validation of statistical methodologies that are in practice and continue to be at the earliest disposal of the researcher, demonstrating how traditional time-series models and modern neural networks may be a viable option to analyze and make viable forecasts from data commonly available in this domain, and suggesting a copula-based strategy to obtain directional dependencies of groundwater level, spatially. This paper also proposes a sphere of model validation, seldom addressed in this domain: the model longevity or the model shelf-life. Use of such validation techniques not only ensure lower computational cost while maintaining reasonably high accuracy, but also, in some cases, ensure robust predictions or forecasts, and assist in comparing multiple models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational inference often struggles with the posterior geometry exhibited by complex hierarchical Bayesian models. Recent advances in flow-based variational families and Variationally Inferred Parameters (VIP) each address aspects of this challenge, but their formal relationship is unexplored. Here, we prove that the combination of VIP and a full-rank Gaussian can be represented exactly as a forward autoregressive flow augmented with a translation term and input from the model's prior. Guided by this theoretical insight, we introduce the Model-Informed Flow (MIF) architecture, which adds the necessary translation mechanism, prior information, and hierarchical ordering. Empirically, MIF delivers tighter posterior approximations and matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across a suite of hierarchical and non-hierarchical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Taming Hyperparameter Sensitivity in Data Attribution: Practical Selection Without Costly Retraining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data attribution methods, which quantify the influence of individual training data points on a machine learning model, have gained increasing popularity in data-centric applications in modern AI. Despite a recent surge of new methods developed in this space, the impact of hyperparameter tuning in these methods remains under-explored. In this work, we present the first large-scale empirical study to understand the hyperparameter sensitivity of common data attribution methods. Our results show that most methods are indeed sensitive to certain key hyperparameters. However, unlike typical machine learning algorithms -- whose hyperparameters can be tuned using computationally-cheap validation metrics -- evaluating data attribution performance often requires retraining models on subsets of training data, making such metrics prohibitively costly for hyperparameter tuning. This poses a critical open challenge for the practical application of data attribution methods. To address this challenge, we advocate for better theoretical understandings of hyperparameter behavior to inform efficient tuning strategies. As a case study, we provide a theoretical analysis of the regularization term that is critical in many variants of influence function methods. Building on this analysis, we propose a lightweight procedure for selecting the regularization value without model retraining, and validate its effectiveness across a range of standard data attribution benchmarks. Overall, our study identifies a fundamental yet overlooked challenge in the practical application of data attribution, and highlights the importance of careful discussion on hyperparameter selection in future method development.</description>

      <title>GradPower: Powering Gradients for Faster Language Model Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose GradPower, a lightweight gradient-transformation technique for accelerating language model pre-training. Given a gradient vector $g=(g_i)_i$, GradPower first applies the elementwise sign-power transformation: $\varphi_p(g)=({\rm sign}(g_i)|g_i|^p)_{i}$ for a fixed $p&gt;0$, and then feeds the transformed gradient into a base optimizer. Notably, GradPower requires only a single-line code change and no modifications to the base optimizer's internal logic, including the hyperparameters. When applied to Adam (termed AdamPower), GradPower consistently achieves lower terminal loss across diverse architectures (LLaMA, Qwen2MoE), parameter scales (66M to 2B), datasets (C4, OpenWebText), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). The most pronounced gains are observed when training modern mixture-of-experts models with warmup-stable-decay schedules. GradPower also integrates seamlessly with other state-of-the-art optimizers, such as Muon, yielding further improvements. Finally, we provide theoretical analyses that reveal the underlying mechanism of GradPower and highlights the influence of gradient noise.</description>

      <title>Sample-optimal learning of quantum states using gentle measurements</title>

Abstract: Gentle measurements of quantum states do not entirely collapse the initial state. Instead, they provide a post-measurement state at a prescribed trace distance $\alpha$ from the initial state together with a random variable used for quantum learning of the initial state. We introduce here the class of $\alpha-$locally-gentle measurements ($\alpha-$LGM) on a finite dimensional quantum system which are product measurements on product states and prove a strong quantum Data-Processing Inequality (qDPI) on this class using an improved relation between gentleness and quantum differential privacy. We further show a gentle quantum Neyman-Pearson lemma which implies that our qDPI is asymptotically optimal (for small $\alpha$). This inequality is employed to show that the necessary number of quantum states for prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$ is of order $1/(\epsilon^2 \alpha^2)$ for both quantum tomography and quantum state certification. Finally, we propose an $\alpha-$LGM called quantum Label Switch that attains these bounds. It is a general implementable method to turn any two-outcome measurement into an $\alpha-$LGM.</description>

      <title>Binary Cumulative Encoding meets Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting have explored formulating regression via classification task. By discretizing the continuous target space into bins and predicting over a fixed set of classes, these approaches benefit from stable training, robust uncertainty modeling, and compatibility with modern deep learning architectures. However, most existing methods rely on one-hot encoding that ignores the inherent ordinal structure of the underlying values. As a result, they fail to provide information about the relative distance between predicted and true values during training. In this paper, we propose to address this limitation by introducing binary cumulative encoding (BCE), that represents scalar targets into monotonic binary vectors. This encoding implicitly preserves order and magnitude information, allowing the model to learn distance-aware representations while still operating within a classification framework. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed for BCE, incorporating residual and dilated convolutions to enable fast and expressive temporal modeling. Through extensive experiments on benchmark forecasting datasets, we show that our approach outperforms widely used methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting, while requiring fewer parameters and enabling faster training.</description>

      <title>Quick-Draw Bandits: Quickly Optimizing in Nonstationary Environments with Extremely Many Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canonical algorithms for multi-armed bandits typically assume a stationary reward environment where the size of the action space (number of arms) is small. More recently developed methods typically relax only one of these assumptions: existing non-stationary bandit policies are designed for a small number of arms, while Lipschitz, linear, and Gaussian process bandit policies are designed to handle a large (or infinite) number of arms in stationary reward environments under constraints on the reward function. In this manuscript, we propose a novel policy to learn reward environments over a continuous space using Gaussian interpolation. We show that our method efficiently learns continuous Lipschitz reward functions with $\mathcal{O}^*(\sqrt{T})$ cumulative regret. Furthermore, our method naturally extends to non-stationary problems with a simple modification. We finally demonstrate that our method is computationally favorable (100-10000x faster) and experimentally outperforms sliding Gaussian process policies on datasets with non-stationarity and an extremely large number of arms.</description>

      <title>Adapting to Linear Separable Subsets with Large-Margin in Differentially Private Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of differentially private empirical risk minimization (DP-ERM) for binary linear classification. We obtain an efficient $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithm with an empirical zero-one risk bound of $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{1}{\gamma^2\varepsilon n} + \frac{|S_{\mathrm{out}}|}{\gamma n}\right)$ where $n$ is the number of data points, $S_{\mathrm{out}}$ is an arbitrary subset of data one can remove and $\gamma$ is the margin of linear separation of the remaining data points (after $S_{\mathrm{out}}$ is removed). Here, $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides only logarithmic terms. In the agnostic case, we improve the existing results when the number of outliers is small. Our algorithm is highly adaptive because it does not require knowing the margin parameter $\gamma$ or outlier subset $S_{\mathrm{out}}$. We also derive a utility bound for the advanced private hyperparameter tuning algorithm.</description>

      <title>AXIOM: Learning to Play Games in Minutes with Expanding Object-Centric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance in various domains, but struggle with data efficiency compared to human learning, which leverages core priors about objects and their interactions. Active inference offers a principled framework for integrating sensory information with prior knowledge to learn a world model and quantify the uncertainty of its own beliefs and predictions. However, active inference models are usually crafted for a single task with bespoke knowledge, so they lack the domain flexibility typical of DRL approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture that integrates a minimal yet expressive set of core priors about object-centric dynamics and interactions to accelerate learning in low-data regimes. The resulting approach, which we call AXIOM, combines the usual data efficiency and interpretability of Bayesian approaches with the across-task generalization usually associated with DRL. AXIOM represents scenes as compositions of objects, whose dynamics are modeled as piecewise linear trajectories that capture sparse object-object interactions. The structure of the generative model is expanded online by growing and learning mixture models from single events and periodically refined through Bayesian model reduction to induce generalization. AXIOM masters various games within only 10,000 interaction steps, with both a small number of parameters compared to DRL, and without the computational expense of gradient-based optimization.</description>

      <title>Consistent line clustering using geometric hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional data analysis often represents data as a weighted graph with pairwise similarities, but many problems do not naturally fit this framework. In line clustering, points in a Euclidean space must be grouped so that each cluster is well approximated by a line segment. Since any two points define a line, pairwise similarities fail to capture the structure of the problem, necessitating the use of higher-order interactions modeled by geometric hypergraphs. We encode geometry into a 3-uniform hypergraph by treating sets of three points as hyperedges whenever they are approximately collinear. The resulting hypergraph contains information about the underlying line segments, which can then be extracted using community recovery algorithms. In contrast to classical hypergraph block models, latent geometric constraints in this construction introduce significant dependencies between hyperedges, which restricts the applicability of many standard theoretical tools. We aim to determine the fundamental limits of line clustering and evaluate hypergraph-based line clustering methods. To this end, we derive information-theoretic thresholds for exact and almost exact recovery for data generated from intersecting lines on a plane with additive Gaussian noise. We develop a polynomial-time spectral algorithm and show that it succeeds under noise conditions that match the information-theoretic bounds up to a polylogarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>Nested Nonparametric Instrumental Variable Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14249v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several causal parameters in short panel data models are functionals of a nested nonparametric instrumental variable regression (nested NPIV). Recent examples include mediated, time varying, and long term treatment effects identified using proxy variables. In econometrics, examples arise in triangular simultaneous equations and hedonic price systems. However, it appears that explicit mean square convergence rates for nested NPIV are unknown, preventing inference on some of these parameters with generic machine learning. A major challenge is compounding ill posedness due to the nested inverse problems. To limit how ill posedness compounds, we introduce two techniques: relative well posedness, and multiple robustness to ill posedness. With these techniques, we provide explicit mean square rates for nested NPIV and efficient inference for recently identified causal parameters. Our nonasymptotic analysis accommodates neural networks, random forests, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. It extends to causal functions, e.g. heterogeneous long term treatment effects.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Additive Value Functions: Interpretable Reinforcement Learning with an Application to Surgical Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a nonparametric additive model for estimating interpretable value functions in reinforcement learning, with an application in optimizing postoperative recovery through personalized, adaptive recommendations. While reinforcement learning has achieved significant success in various domains, recent methods often rely on black-box approaches such as neural networks, which hinder the examination of individual feature contributions to a decision-making policy. Our novel method offers a flexible technique for estimating action-value functions without explicit parametric assumptions, overcoming the limitations of the linearity assumption of classical algorithms. By incorporating local kernel regression and basis expansion, we obtain a sparse, additive representation of the action-value function, enabling local approximation and retrieval of nonlinear, independent contributions of select state features and the interactions between joint feature pairs. We validate our approach through a simulation study and apply it to spine disease recovery, uncovering recommendations aligned with clinical knowledge. This method bridges the gap between flexible machine learning techniques and the interpretability required in healthcare applications, paving the way for more personalized interventions.</description>

      <title>Information Leakage Detection through Approximate Bayes-optimal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In today's data-driven world, the proliferation of publicly available information raises security concerns due to the information leakage (IL) problem. IL involves unintentionally exposing sensitive information to unauthorized parties via observable system information. Conventional statistical approaches rely on estimating mutual information (MI) between observable and secret information for detecting ILs, face challenges of the curse of dimensionality, convergence, computational complexity, and MI misestimation. Though effective, emerging supervised machine learning based approaches to detect ILs are limited to binary system sensitive information and lack a comprehensive framework. To address these limitations, we establish a theoretical framework using statistical learning theory and information theory to quantify and detect IL accurately. Using automated machine learning, we demonstrate that MI can be accurately estimated by approximating the typically unknown Bayes predictor's log-loss and accuracy. Based on this, we show how MI can effectively be estimated to detect ILs. Our method performs superior to state-of-the-art baselines in an empirical study considering synthetic and real-world OpenSSL TLS server datasets.</description>

      <title>Binary Hypothesis Testing for Softmax Models and Leverage Score Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Softmax distributions are widely used in machine learning, including Large Language Models (LLMs), where the attention unit uses softmax distributions. We abstract the attention unit as the softmax model, where given a vector input, the model produces an output drawn from the softmax distribution (which depends on the vector input). We consider the fundamental problem of binary hypothesis testing in the setting of softmax models. That is, given an unknown softmax model, which is known to be one of the two given softmax models, how many queries are needed to determine which one is the truth? We show that the sample complexity is asymptotically $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ where $\epsilon$ is a certain distance between the parameters of the models. Furthermore, we draw an analogy between the softmax model and the leverage score model, an important tool for algorithm design in linear algebra and graph theory. The leverage score model, on a high level, is a model which, given a vector input, produces an output drawn from a distribution dependent on the input. We obtain similar results for the binary hypothesis testing problem for leverage score models.</description>

      <title>Addressing Misspecification in Simulation-based Inference through Data-driven Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by steady progress in deep generative modeling, simulation-based inference (SBI) has emerged as the workhorse for inferring the parameters of stochastic simulators. However, recent work has demonstrated that model misspecification can compromise the reliability of SBI, preventing its adoption in important applications where only misspecified simulators are available. This work introduces robust posterior estimation~(RoPE), a framework that overcomes model misspecification with a small real-world calibration set of ground-truth parameter measurements. We formalize the misspecification gap as the solution of an optimal transport~(OT) problem between learned representations of real-world and simulated observations, allowing RoPE to learn a model of the misspecification without placing additional assumptions on its nature. RoPE demonstrates how OT and a calibration set provide a controllable balance between calibrated uncertainty and informative inference, even under severely misspecified simulators. Results on four synthetic tasks and two real-world problems with ground-truth labels demonstrate that RoPE outperforms baselines and consistently returns informative and calibrated credible intervals.</description>

      <title>Robust random graph matching in Gaussian models via vector approximate message passing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the matching recovery problem between a pair of correlated Gaussian Wigner matrices with a latent vertex correspondence. We are particularly interested in a robust version of this problem such that our observation is a perturbed input $(A+E,B+F)$ where $(A,B)$ is a pair of correlated Gaussian Wigner matrices and $E,F$ are adversarially chosen matrices supported on an unknown $\epsilon n * \epsilon n$ principle minor of $A,B$, respectively. We propose a vector approximate message passing (vector AMP) algorithm that succeeds in polynomial time as long as the correlation $\rho$ between $(A,B)$ is a non-vanishing constant and $\epsilon = o\big( \tfrac{1}{(\log n)^{20}} \big)$.
  The main methodological inputs for our result are the iterative random graph matching algorithm proposed in \cite{DL22+, DL23+} and the spectral cleaning procedure proposed in \cite{IS24+}. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first efficient random graph matching type algorithm that is robust under any adversarial perturbations of $n^{1-o(1)}$ size.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Framework for Ranking LLM-Based Chatbots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, with frameworks like Chatbot Arena providing pioneering platforms for evaluating these models. By facilitating millions of pairwise comparisons based on human judgments, Chatbot Arena has become a cornerstone in LLM evaluation, offering rich datasets for ranking models in open-ended conversational tasks. Building upon this foundation, we propose a statistical framework that incorporates key advancements to address specific challenges in pairwise comparison analysis. First, we introduce a factored tie model that enhances the ability to handle ties -- an integral aspect of human-judged comparisons -- significantly improving the model's fit to observed data. Second, we extend the framework to model covariance between competitors, enabling deeper insights into performance relationships and facilitating intuitive groupings into performance tiers. Third, we resolve optimization challenges arising from parameter non-uniqueness by introducing novel constraints, ensuring stable and interpretable parameter estimation. Through rigorous evaluation and extensive experimentation, our framework demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in modeling pairwise comparison data. To support reproducibility and practical adoption, we release leaderbot, an open-source Python package implementing our models and analyses.</description>

Abstract: We provide a new online learning algorithm for tackling the Multinomial Logit Bandit (MNL-Bandit) problem. Despite the challenges posed by the combinatorial nature of the MNL model, we develop a novel Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-based method that achieves Pareto optimality by balancing regret minimization and estimation error of the assortment revenues and the MNL parameters. We develop theoretical guarantees characterizing the tradeoff between regret and estimation error for the MNL-Bandit problem through information-theoretic bounds, and propose a modified UCB algorithm that incorporates forced exploration to improve parameter estimation accuracy while maintaining low regret. Our analysis sheds critical insights into how to optimally balance the collected revenues and the treatment estimation in dynamic assortment optimization.</description>

      <title>Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis: Information Geometry Approach for Dimensionality Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised dimensionality reduction aims to map labeled data to a low-dimensional feature space while maximizing class discriminability. Directly computing discriminability is often impractical, so an alternative approach is to learn features that maximize a distance or dissimilarity measure between classes. The Fisher-Rao distance is an important information geometry distance in statistical manifolds. It is induced by the Fisher information metric, a tool widely used for understanding neural representations. Despite its theoretical and pratical appeal, Fisher-Rao distances between classes have not been used as a maximization objective in supervised feature learning. Here, we present Supervised Quadratic Feature Analysis (SQFA), a linear dimensionality reduction method that maximizes Fisher-Rao distances between class distributions, by exploiting the information geometry of the symmetric positive definite manifold. SQFA maximizes distances using first- and second-order statistics, and its features allow for quadratic discriminability (i.e. QDA performance) matching or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets. We theoretically motivate Fisher-Rao distances as a proxy for quadratic discriminability, and compare its performance to other popular distances (e.g. Wasserstein distances). SQFA provides a flexible state-of-the-art method for dimensionality reduction. Its successful use of Fisher-Rao distances between classes motivates future research directions.</description>

Abstract: We examine limits of in-context learning (ICL) in transformer models trained from scratch, focusing on function approximation tasks as a controlled setting to uncover fundamental behaviors. While we show empirically that transformer models can generalize, approximating unseen classes of polynomial (non linear) functions, they cannot generalize beyond certain values. We provide both empirical and mathematical arguments explaining that these limitations stem from architectural components, namely layer normalization and the attention scoring function, softmax. Together, our findings reveal structural constraints on ICL that are often masked in more complex NLP tasks but that need to be understood to improve robustness and interpretability in transformer-based models.</description>

      <title>Identifying Metric Structures of Deep Latent Variable Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep latent variable models learn condensed representations of data that, hopefully, reflect the inner workings of the studied phenomena. Unfortunately, these latent representations are not statistically identifiable, meaning they cannot be uniquely determined. Domain experts, therefore, need to tread carefully when interpreting these. Current solutions limit the lack of identifiability through additional constraints on the latent variable model, e.g. by requiring labeled training data, or by restricting the expressivity of the model. We change the goal: instead of identifying the latent variables, we identify relationships between them such as meaningful distances, angles, and volumes. We prove this is feasible under very mild model conditions and without additional labeled data. We empirically demonstrate that our theory results in more reliable latent distances, offering a principled path forward in extracting trustworthy conclusions from deep latent variable models.</description>

      <title>Robust Distributed Estimation: Extending Gossip Algorithms to Ranking and Trimmed Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of robust estimation in gossip algorithms over arbitrary communication graphs. Gossip algorithms are fully decentralized, relying only on local neighbor-to-neighbor communication, making them well-suited for situations where communication is constrained. A fundamental challenge in existing mean-based gossip algorithms is their vulnerability to malicious or corrupted nodes. In this paper, we show that an outlier-robust mean can be computed by globally estimating a robust statistic. More specifically, we propose a novel gossip algorithm for rank estimation, referred to as \textsc{GoRank}, and leverage it to design a gossip procedure dedicated to trimmed mean estimation, coined \textsc{GoTrim}. In addition to a detailed description of the proposed methods, a key contribution of our work is a precise convergence analysis: we establish an $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ rate for rank estimation and an $\mathcal{O}(\log(t)/t)$ rate for trimmed mean estimation, where by $t$ is meant the number of iterations. Moreover, we provide a breakdown point analysis of \textsc{GoTrim}. We empirically validate our theoretical results through experiments on diverse network topologies, data distributions and contamination schemes.</description>

      <title>M-learner:A Flexible And Powerful Framework To Study Heterogeneous Treatment Effect In Mediation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method, termed the M-learner, for estimating heterogeneous indirect and total treatment effects and identifying relevant subgroups within a mediation framework. The procedure comprises four key steps. First, we compute individual-level conditional average indirect/total treatment effect Second, we construct a distance matrix based on pairwise differences. Third, we apply tSNE to project this matrix into a low-dimensional Euclidean space, followed by K-means clustering to identify subgroup structures. Finally, we calibrate and refine the clusters using a threshold-based procedure to determine the optimal configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach specifically designed to capture treatment effect heterogeneity in the presence of mediation. Experimental results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Application to the real-world Jobs II dataset highlights the broad adaptability and potential applicability of our method.Code is available at https: //anonymous.4open.science/r/M-learner-C4BB.</description>

      <title>Enabling Differentially Private Federated Learning for Speech Recognition: Benchmarks, Adaptive Optimizers and Gradient Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) have been extensively studied, their application to automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training large transformer models. Specifically, large models further exacerbate issues in FL as they are particularly susceptible to gradient heterogeneity across layers, unlike the relatively uniform gradient behavior observed in shallow models. As a result, prior works struggle to converge with standard optimization techniques, even in the absence of DP mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work establishes a competitive, practical recipe for FL with DP in the context of ASR. To address this gap, we establish \textbf{the first benchmark for FL with DP in end-to-end ASR}. Our approach centers on per-layer clipping and layer-wise gradient normalization: theoretical analysis reveals that these techniques together mitigate clipping bias and gradient heterogeneity across layers in deeper models. Consistent with these theoretical insights, our empirical results show that FL with DP is viable under strong privacy guarantees, provided a population of at least several million users. Specifically, we achieve user-level (7.2, $10^{-9}$)-DP (resp. (4.5, $10^{-9}$)-DP) with only a 1.3% (resp. 4.6%) absolute drop in word error rate when extrapolating to high (resp. low) population scales for FL with DP in ASR. Although our experiments focus on ASR, the underlying principles we uncover - particularly those concerning gradient heterogeneity and layer-wise gradient normalization - offer broader guidance for designing scalable, privacy-preserving FL algorithms for large models across domains.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-based Effect Measures for Compositional Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18501v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing effect measures for compositional features are inadequate for many modern applications, for example, in microbiome research, since they display traits such as high-dimensionality and sparsity that can be poorly modelled with traditional parametric approaches. Further, assessing -- in an unbiased way -- how summary statistics of a composition (e.g., racial diversity) affect a response variable is not straightforward. We propose a framework based on hypothetical data perturbations which defines interpretable statistical functionals on the compositions themselves, which we call average perturbation effects. These effects naturally account for confounding that biases frequently used marginal dependence analyses. We show how average perturbation effects can be estimated efficiently by deriving a perturbation-dependent reparametrization and applying semiparametric estimation techniques. We analyze the proposed estimators empirically on simulated and semi-synthetic data and demonstrate advantages over existing techniques on data from New York schools and microbiome data.</description>

      <title>(Accelerated) Noise-adaptive Stochastic Heavy-Ball Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic heavy ball momentum (SHB) is commonly used to train machine learning models, and often provides empirical improvements over stochastic gradient descent. By primarily focusing on strongly-convex quadratics, we aim to better understand the theoretical advantage of SHB and subsequently improve the method. For strongly-convex quadratics, Kidambi et al. (2018) show that SHB (with a mini-batch of size $1$) cannot attain accelerated convergence, and hence has no theoretical benefit over SGD. They conjecture that the practical gain of SHB is a by-product of using larger mini-batches. We first substantiate this claim by showing that SHB can attain an accelerated rate when the mini-batch size is larger than a threshold $b^*$ that depends on the condition number $\kappa$. Specifically, we prove that with the same step-size and momentum parameters as in the deterministic setting, SHB with a sufficiently large mini-batch size results in an $O\left(\exp(-\frac{T}{\sqrt{\kappa}}) + \sigma \right)$ convergence when measuring the distance to the optimal solution in the $\ell_2$ norm, where $T$ is the number of iterations and $\sigma^2$ is the variance in the stochastic gradients. We prove a lower-bound which demonstrates that a $\kappa$ dependence in $b^*$ is necessary. To ensure convergence to the minimizer, we design a noise-adaptive multi-stage algorithm that results in an $O\left(\exp\left(-\frac{T}{\sqrt{\kappa}}\right) + \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{T}}\right)$ rate when measuring the distance to the optimal solution in the $\ell_2$ norm. We also consider the general smooth, strongly-convex setting and propose the first noise-adaptive SHB variant that converges to the minimizer at an $O(\exp(-\frac{T}{\kappa}) + \frac{\sigma^2}{T})$ rate when measuring the distance to the optimal solution in the squared $\ell_2$ norm. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Learning Distances from Data with Normalizing Flows and Score Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density-based distances (DBDs) provide a principled approach to metric learning by defining distances in terms of the underlying data distribution. By employing a Riemannian metric that increases in regions of low probability density, shortest paths naturally follow the data manifold. Fermat distances, a specific type of DBD, have attractive properties, but existing estimators based on nearest neighbor graphs suffer from poor convergence due to inaccurate density estimates. Moreover, graph-based methods scale poorly to high dimensions, as the proposed geodesics are often insufficiently smooth. We address these challenges in two key ways. First, we learn densities using normalizing flows. Second, we refine geodesics through relaxation, guided by a learned score model. Additionally, we introduce a dimension-adapted Fermat distance that scales intuitively to high dimensions and improves numerical stability. Our work paves the way for the practical use of density-based distances, especially in high-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>A Dirichlet stochastic block model for composition-weighted networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network data are observed in various applications where the individual entities of the system interact with or are connected to each other, and often these interactions are defined by their associated strength or importance. Clustering is a common task in network analysis that involves finding groups of nodes displaying similarities in the way they interact with the rest of the network. However, most clustering methods use the strengths of connections between entities in their original form, ignoring the possible differences in the capacities of individual nodes to send or receive edges. This often leads to clustering solutions that are heavily influenced by the nodes' capacities. One way to overcome this is to analyse the strengths of connections in relative rather than absolute terms, expressing each edge weight as a proportion of the sending (or receiving) capacity of the respective node. This, however, induces additional modelling constraints that most existing clustering methods are not designed to handle. In this work we propose a stochastic block model for composition-weighted networks based on direct modelling of compositional weight vectors using a Dirichlet mixture, with the parameters determined by the cluster labels of the sender and the receiver nodes. Inference is implemented via an extension of the classification expectation-maximisation algorithm that uses a working independence assumption, expressing the complete data likelihood of each node of the network as a function of fixed cluster labels of the remaining nodes. A model selection criterion is derived to aid the choice of the number of clusters. The model is validated using simulation studies, and showcased on network data from the Erasmus exchange program and a bike sharing network for the city of London.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13448v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has proved a promising alternative for conventional local heuristics in score-based approaches to learning directed acyclic causal graphs (DAGs) from observational data. However, the intricate acyclicity constraint still challenges the efficient exploration of the vast space of DAGs in existing methods. In this study, we introduce ALIAS (reinforced dAg Learning wIthout Acyclicity conStraints), a novel approach to causal discovery powered by the RL machinery. Our method features an efficient policy for generating DAGs in just a single step with an optimal quadratic complexity, fueled by a novel parametrization of DAGs that directly translates a continuous space to the space of all DAGs, bypassing the need for explicitly enforcing acyclicity constraints. This approach enables us to navigate the search space more effectively by utilizing policy gradient methods and established scoring functions. In addition, we provide compelling empirical evidence for the strong performance of ALIAS in comparison with state-of-the-arts in causal discovery over increasingly difficult experiment conditions on both synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction via score ratio matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based dimension reduction decreases the cost of Bayesian inference and probabilistic modeling by identifying maximally informative (and informed) low-dimensional projections of the data and parameters, allowing high-dimensional problems to be reformulated as cheaper low-dimensional problems. A broad family of such techniques identify these projections and provide error bounds on the resulting posterior approximations, via eigendecompositions of certain diagnostic matrices. Yet these matrices require gradients or even Hessians of the log-likelihood, excluding the purely data-driven setting and many problems of simulation-based inference. We propose a framework, derived from score-matching, to extend gradient-based dimension reduction to problems where gradients are unavailable. Specifically, we formulate an objective function to directly learn the score ratio function needed to compute the diagnostic matrices, propose a tailored parameterization for the score ratio network, and introduce regularization methods that capitalize on the hypothesized low-dimensional structure. We also introduce a novel algorithm to iteratively identify the low-dimensional reduced basis vectors more accurately with limited data based on eigenvalue deflation methods. We show that our approach outperforms standard score-matching for problems with low-dimensional structure, and demonstrate its effectiveness for PDE-constrained Bayesian inverse problems and conditional generative modeling.</description>

      <title>SWIFT: Mapping Sub-series with Wavelet Decomposition Improves Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent work on time-series prediction, Transformers and even large language models have garnered significant attention due to their strong capabilities in sequence modeling. However, in practical deployments, time-series prediction often requires operation in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices, which are unable to handle the computational overhead of large models. To address such scenarios, some lightweight models have been proposed, but they exhibit poor performance on non-stationary sequences. In this paper, we propose $\textit{SWIFT}$, a lightweight model that is not only powerful, but also efficient in deployment and inference for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). Our model is based on three key points: (i) Utilizing wavelet transform to perform lossless downsampling of time series. (ii) Achieving cross-band information fusion with a learnable filter. (iii) Using only one shared linear layer or one shallow MLP for sub-series' mapping. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that $\textit{SWIFT}$ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, offering a promising method for edge computing and deployment in this task. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the number of parameters in $\textit{SWIFT-Linear}$ is only 25\% of what it would be with a single-layer linear model for time-domain prediction.

      <description>arXiv:2502.06516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minority samples are underrepresented instances located in low-density regions of a data manifold, and are valuable in many generative AI applications, such as data augmentation, creative content generation, etc. Unfortunately, existing diffusion-based minority generators often rely on computationally expensive guidance dedicated for minority generation. To address this, here we present a simple yet powerful guidance-free approach called Boost-and-Skip for generating minority samples using diffusion models. The key advantage of our framework requires only two minimal changes to standard generative processes: (i) variance-boosted initialization and (ii) timestep skipping. We highlight that these seemingly-trivial modifications are supported by solid theoretical and empirical evidence, thereby effectively promoting emergence of underrepresented minority features. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Boost-and-Skip greatly enhances the capability of generating minority samples, even rivaling guidance-based state-of-the-art approaches while requiring significantly fewer computations.

      <title>Active Advantage-Aligned Online Reinforcement Learning with Offline Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) enhances policies through direct interactions with the environment, but faces challenges related to sample efficiency. In contrast, offline RL leverages extensive pre-collected data to learn policies, but often produces suboptimal results due to limited data coverage. Recent efforts integrate offline and online RL in order to harness the advantages of both approaches. However, effectively combining online and offline RL remains challenging due to issues that include catastrophic forgetting, lack of robustness to data quality and limited sample efficiency in data utilization. In an effort to address these challenges, we introduce A3RL, which incorporates a novel confidence aware Active Advantage Aligned (A3) sampling strategy that dynamically prioritizes data aligned with the policy's evolving needs from both online and offline sources, optimizing policy improvement. Moreover, we provide theoretical insights into the effectiveness of our active sampling strategy and conduct diverse empirical experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating that our method outperforms competing online RL techniques that leverage offline data.

      <title>Physics-Informed Generative Modeling of Wireless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning the site-specific distribution of the wireless channel within a particular environment of interest is essential to exploit the full potential of machine learning (ML) for wireless communications and radar applications. Generative modeling offers a promising framework to address this problem. However, existing approaches pose unresolved challenges, including the need for high-quality training data, limited generalizability, and a lack of physical interpretability. To address these issues, we combine the physics-related compressibility of wireless channels with generative modeling, in particular, sparse Bayesian generative modeling (SBGM), to learn the distribution of the underlying physical channel parameters. By leveraging the sparsity-inducing characteristics of SBGM, our methods can learn from compressed observations received by an access point (AP) during default online operation. Moreover, they are physically interpretable and generalize over system configurations without requiring retraining.</description>

      <title>Approaching the Harm of Gradient Attacks While Only Flipping Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning systems deployed in distributed or federated environments are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, particularly availability attacks -adding imperceptible perturbations to training data, thereby rendering the trained model unavailable. Prior research in distributed machine learning has demonstrated such adversarial effects through the injection of gradients or data poisoning. In this study, we aim to enhance comprehension of the potential of weaker (and more probable) adversaries by posing the following inquiry: Can availability attacks be inflicted solely through the flipping of a subset of training labels, without altering features, and under a strict flipping budget? We analyze the extent of damage caused by constrained label flipping attacks. Focusing on a distributed classification problem, (1) we propose a novel formalization of label flipping attacks on logistic regression models and derive a greedy algorithm that is provably optimal at each training step. (2) To demonstrate that availability attacks can be approached by label flipping alone, we show that a budget of only $0.1\%$ of labels at each training step can reduce the accuracy of the model by $6\%$, and that some models can perform worse than random guessing when up to $25\%$ of labels are flipped. (3) We shed light on an interesting interplay between what the attacker gains from more write-access versus what they gain from more flipping budget. (4) we define and compare the power of targeted label flipping attack to that of an untargeted label flipping attack.</description>

      <title>Should We Simultaneously Calibrate Multiple Computer Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an increasing number of applications designers have access to multiple computer models which typically have different levels of fidelity and cost. Traditionally, designers calibrate these models one at a time against some high-fidelity data (e.g., experiments). In this paper, we question this tradition and assess the potential of calibrating multiple computer models at the same time. To this end, we develop a probabilistic framework that is founded on customized neural networks (NNs) that are designed to calibrate an arbitrary number of computer models. In our approach, we (1) consider the fact that most computer models are multi-response and that the number and nature of calibration parameters may change across the models, and (2) learn a unique probability distribution for each calibration parameter of each computer model, (3) develop a loss function that enables our NN to emulate all data sources while calibrating the computer models, and (4) aim to learn a visualizable latent space where model-form errors can be identified. We test the performance of our approach on analytic and engineering problems to understand the potential advantages and pitfalls in simultaneous calibration of multiple computer models. Our method can improve predictive accuracy, however, it is prone to non-identifiability issues in higher-dimensional input spaces that are normally constrained by underlying physics.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Self-Attention Dynamics: An Energy-Agnostic Perspective from Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, to investigate more general SA architectures capable of oscillatory dynamics without necessarily admitting an energy function, we analyze the Jacobian matrix of the state. We reveal that normalization layers effectively normalize the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, forcing the dynamics close to a critical state. This significantly enhances inference performance. Furthermore, we utilize the Jacobian perspective to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Group Relative Policy Optimization: Insights into On-Policy and Off-Policy Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in both on-policy and off-policy optimization regimes. Our motivation comes from recent work on off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which improves training stability, sampling efficiency, and memory usage. In addition, a recent analysis of GRPO suggests that estimating the advantage function with off-policy samples could be beneficial. Building on these observations, we adapt GRPO to the off-policy setting. We show that both on-policy and off-policy GRPO objectives yield an improvement in the reward. This result motivates the use of clipped surrogate objectives in the off-policy version of GRPO. We then compare the empirical performance of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards in post-training using both GRPO variants. Our results show that off-policy GRPO either significantly outperforms or performs on par with its on-policy counterpart.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effectiveness of multimodal data in forecasting SARS-COV-2 case surges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic response relied heavily on statistical and machine learning models to predict key outcomes such as case prevalence and fatality rates. These predictions were instrumental in enabling timely public health interventions that helped break transmission cycles. While most existing models are grounded in traditional epidemiological data, the potential of alternative datasets, such as those derived from genomic information and human behavior, remains underexplored. In the current study, we investigated the usefulness of diverse modalities of feature sets in predicting case surges. Our results highlight the relative effectiveness of biological (e.g., mutations), public health (e.g., case counts, policy interventions) and human behavioral features (e.g., mobility and social media conversations) in predicting country-level case surges. Importantly, we uncover considerable heterogeneity in predictive performance across countries and feature modalities, suggesting that surge prediction models may need to be tailored to specific national contexts and pandemic phases. Overall, our work highlights the value of integrating alternative data sources into existing disease surveillance frameworks to enhance the prediction of pandemic dynamics.</description>
