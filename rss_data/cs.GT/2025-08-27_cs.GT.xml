      <title>Facilitating Matches on Allocation Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a setting where goods are allocated to agents by way of an allocation platform (e.g., a matching platform). An ``allocation facilitator'' aims to increase the overall utility/social-good of the allocation by encouraging (some of the) agents to relax (some of) their restrictions. At the same time, the advice must not hurt agents who would otherwise be better off. Additionally, the facilitator may be constrained by a ``bound'' (a.k.a. `budget'), limiting the number and/or type of restrictions it may seek to relax. We consider the facilitator's optimization problem of choosing an optimal set of restrictions to request to relax under the aforementioned constraints. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We provide a formal definition of the problem, including the participation guarantees to which the facilitator should adhere. We define a hierarchy of participation guarantees and also consider several social-good functions. (ii) We provide polynomial algorithms for solving various versions of the associated optimization problems, including one-to-one and many-to-one allocation settings. (iii) We demonstrate the benefits of such facilitation and relaxation, and the implications of the different participation guarantees, using extensive experimentation on three real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Combinatorial Optimization Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a class of cooperative games, called d Partitioned Compbinatorial Optimization Games (PCOGs). The input of PCOG consists of a set of agents and a combinatorial structure (typically a graph) with a fixed optimization goal on this structure (e.g., finding a minimum dominating set on a graph) such that the structure is divided among the agents. The value of each coalition of agents is derived from the optimal solution for the part of the structure possessed by the coalition. We study two fundamental questions related to the core: Core Stability Verification and Core Stability Existence. We analyze the algorithmic complexity of both questions for four classic graph optimization tasks: minimum vertex cover, minimum dominating set, minimum spanning tree, and maximum matching.</description>

      <title>Bias-Adjusted LLM Agents for Human-Like Decision-Making via Behavioral Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human decision-making, but their intrinsic biases often diverge from real human behavior--limiting their ability to reflect population-level diversity. We address this challenge with a persona-based approach that leverages individual-level behavioral data from behavioral economics to adjust model biases. Applying this method to the ultimatum game--a standard but difficult benchmark for LLMs--we observe improved alignment between simulated and empirical behavior, particularly on the responder side. While further refinement of trait representations is needed, our results demonstrate the promise of persona-conditioned LLMs for simulating human-like decision patterns at scale.</description>

      <title>Learning in Repeated Multi-Objective Stackelberg Games with Payoff Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study payoff manipulation in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games, where a leader may strategically influence a follower's deterministic best response, e.g., by offering a share of their own payoff. We assume that the follower's utility function, representing preferences over multiple objectives, is unknown but linear, and its weight parameter must be inferred through interaction. This introduces a sequential decision-making challenge for the leader, who must balance preference elicitation with immediate utility maximisation. We formalise this problem and propose manipulation policies based on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), which guide the leader in selecting actions and offering incentives that trade off short-term gains with long-term impact. We prove that under infinite repeated interactions, longEU converges to the optimal manipulation. Empirical results across benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach improves cumulative leader utility while promoting mutually beneficial outcomes, all without requiring explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of the follower's utility function.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Approach to Collaborative Document Writing (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a model for collaborative text aggregation in which an agent community coauthors a document, modeled as an unordered collection of paragraphs, using a dynamic mechanism: agents propose paragraphs and vote on those suggested by others. We formalize the setting and explore its realizations, concentrating on voting mechanisms that aggregate votes into a single, dynamic document. We focus on two desiderata: the eventual stability of the process and its expected social welfare. Following an impossibility result, we describe several aggregation methods and report on agent-based simulations that utilize natural language processing (NLP) and large-language models (LLMs) to model agents and their contexts. Using these simulations, we demonstrate promising results regarding the possibility of rapid convergence to a high social welfare collaborative text.</description>

      <title>Consistent Opponent Modeling of Static Opponents in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution; namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it is available.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Online Learning in Symmetric Cone Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce symmetric cone games (SCGs), a broad class of multi-player games where each player's strategy lies in a generalized simplex (the trace-one slice of a symmetric cone). This framework unifies a wide spectrum of settings, including normal-form games (simplex strategies), quantum games (density matrices), and continuous games with ball-constrained strategies. It also captures several structured machine learning and optimization problems, such as distance metric learning and Fermat-Weber facility location, as two-player zero-sum SCGs. To compute approximate Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum SCGs, we propose a single online learning algorithm: Optimistic Symmetric Cone Multiplicative Weights Updates (OSCMWU). Unlike prior methods tailored to specific geometries, OSCMWU provides closed-form, projection-free updates over any symmetric cone and achieves an optimal $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$ iteration complexity for computing $\epsilon$-saddle points. Our analysis builds on the Optimistic Follow-the-Regularized-Leader framework and hinges on a key technical contribution: We prove that the symmetric cone negative entropy is strongly convex with respect to the trace-one norm. This result extends known results for the simplex and spectraplex to all symmetric cones, and may be of independent interest.</description>
