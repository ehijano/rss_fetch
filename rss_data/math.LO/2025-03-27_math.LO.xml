      <title>Uniform validity of atomic Kreisel-Putnam rule in monotonic proof-theoretic semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proof-theoretic semantics (PTS) is normally understood today as Base-Extension Semantics (B-eS), i.e., as a theory of proof-theoretic consequence over atomic proof systems. Intuitionistic logic (IL) has been proved to be incomplete over a number of variants of B-eS, including a monotonic one where introduction rules play a prior role (miB-eS). In its original formulation by Prawitz, however, PTS consequence is not a primitive, but a derived notion. The main concept is that of argument structure valid relative to atomic systems and assignments of reductions for eliminating generalised detours of inferences in non-introduction form. This is called Proof-Theoretic Validity (P-tV), and it can be given in a monotonic and introduction-based form too (miP-tV). It is unclear whether, and under what conditions, the incompleteness results proved for IL over miB-eS can be transferred to miP-tV. As has been remarked, the main problem seems to be that the notion of argumental validity underlying the miB-eS notion of consequence is one where reductions are either forced to be non-uniform, or non-constructive. Building on some Prawitz-fashion incompleteness proofs for IL based on the notion of (intuitionistic) construction, I provide in what follows a set of reductions which are surely uniform (however uniformity is defined) and constructive, and which make atomic Kreisel-Putnam rule logically valid over miP-tV, thus implying the incompleteness of IL over a Prawitzian (monotonic, introduction-based) framework strictly understood.</description>

      <title>Weight, net weight, and elementary submodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we prove several theorems that are related to some results and problems from [6]. We answer two of the main problems that were raised in [6]. First we give a ZFC example of a Hausdorff space in $C(\omega_1)$ that has uncountable net weight. Then we prove that after adding any number of Cohen reals to a model of CH, in the extension every regular space in $C(\omega_1)$ has countable net weight. We prove in ZFC that for any regular topology of uncountable weight on $\omega_1$ there is a non-stationary subset that has uncountable weight as well. Moreover, if all final segments of $\omega_1$ have uncountable weight then the assumption of regularity can be dropped. By [6], the analogous statements for the net weight are independent from ZFC. Our proofs of all these results make essential use of elementary submodels.</description>

      <title>Measures that violate the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple \(P_\lambda\)-point on a regular cardinal \(\kappa\) is a uniform ultrafilter on \(\kappa\) with a mod-bounded decreasing generating sequence of length \(\lambda\).
  We prove that if there is a simple $P_\lambda$-point ultrafilter over $\kappa&gt;\omega$, then $\lambda=\mathfrak{d}_\kappa=\mathfrak{b}_\kappa=\mathfrak{u}_\kappa=\mathfrak{r}_\kappa=\mathfrak{s}_\kappa$. We show that such ultrafilters appear in the models of \cite{GartiBen-Neria,BROOKETAYLOR201737}. We improve the lower bound for the consistency strength of the existence of a $P_{\kappa^{++}}$-point to a $2$-strong cardinal. Finally, we apply our arguments to obtain non-trivial lower bounds for (1) the statement that the generalized tower number $\mathfrak{t}_\kappa$ is greater than $\kappa^+$ and $\kappa$ is measurable, (2) the preservation of measurability after the generalized Mathias forcing, and (3) variations of filter games of \cite{NIELSEN_WELCH_2019,HolySchlicht:HierarchyRamseyLikeCardinals,MagForZem} in the case $2^\kappa&gt;\kappa^+$.</description>

      <title>Fractal Boundaries of Constructivity: A Meta-Theoretical Critique of Countability and Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All constructive methods employed in modern mathematics produce only countable sets, even when designed to transcend countability. We show that any constructive argument for uncountability -- excluding diagonalization techniques -- effectively generates only countable fragments within a closed formal system. We formalize this limitation as the "fractal boundary of constructivity", the asymptotic limit of all constructive extensions under syntactically enumerable rules. A central theorem establishes the impossibility of fully capturing the structure of the continuum within any such system. We further introduce the concept of "fractal countability", a process-relative refinement of countability based on layered constructive closure. This provides a framework for analyzing definability beyond classical recursion without invoking uncountable totalities. We interpret the continuum not as an object constructively realizable, but as a horizon of formal expressibility.</description>

      <title>The Schr\"oder-Bernstein property for operators on Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that the complete theory of a Hilbert space equipped with a normal operator has the Schr\"oder-Berenstein property. This in particular answers a question of Argoty, Berenstein, and the first-named author. We also prove an analogous statement for unbounded self-adjoint operators.</description>

      <title>More on setwise climbability properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two types of variations of setwise climbability properties, which have been introduced by the second author as fragments of Jensen's square principles. We show that variations of the first type are equivalent to known principles and that they are consistent with the Proper Forcing Axiom(PFA). On the other hand, those of the second type can be characterized as Martin-type axioms for some classes of posets defined in terms of a new variation of generalized Banach-Mazur games, and they are no longer consistent with PFA. We also study how large fragments of PFA are consistent with these principles.</description>

      <title>Ranking theories via encoded $\beta$-models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranking theories according to their strength is a recurring motif in mathematical logic. We introduce a new ranking of arbitrary (not necessarily recursively axiomatized) theories in terms of the encoding power of their $\beta$-models: $T\prec_\beta U$ if every $\beta$-model of $U$ contains a countable coded $\beta$-model of $T$. The restriction of $\prec_\beta$ to theories with $\beta$-models is well-founded. We establish fundamental properties of the attendant ranking. First, though there are continuum-many theories, every theory has countable $\prec_\beta$-rank. Second, the $\prec_\beta$-ranks of $\mathcal{L}_\in$ theories are cofinal in $\omega_1$. Third, assuming $V=L$, the $\prec_\beta$-ranks of $\mathcal{L}_2$ theories are cofinal in $\omega_1$. Finally, $\delta^1_2$ is the supremum of the $\prec_\beta$-ranks of finitely axiomatized theories.</description>

      <title>Propositional inclusion atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inclusion atoms are standard dependencies used in database theory and dependence logic. We give an alternative completeness proof for the axiomatization of inclusion atoms with and without restrictions on repeated variables. The alternative proof implies completeness of the systems for inclusion atoms not only in the first-order setting but also in the propositional setting, previously not covered by the literature. The result is extended to propositional inclusion atoms with Boolean constants, introducing a complete axiomatization and showing that no such axiomatization can be k-ary. We also show that the decision problems for the inclusion atoms considered are, like inclusion atoms without repeated variables, PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>On the hierarchy of natural theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.05794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a well-known empirical phenomenon that natural axiomatic theories are pre-well-ordered by consistency strength. Without a precise mathematical definition of "natural," it is unclear how to study this phenomenon mathematically. We will discuss the significance of this problem and survey some strategies that have recently been developed for addressing it. These strategies emphasize the role of reflection principles and ordinal analysis and draw on analogies with research in recursion theory. We will conclude with a discussion of open problems and directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Reflection ranks via infinitary derivations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.03521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is no infinite sequence of $\Pi^1_1$-sound extensions of $\mathsf{ACA}_0$ each of which proves $\Pi^1_1$-reflection of the next. This engenders a well-founded ``reflection ranking'' of $\Pi^1_1$-sound extensions of $\mathsf{ACA}_0$. For any $\Pi^1_1$-sound theory $T$ extending $\mathsf{ACA}^+_0$, the reflection rank of $T$ equals the proof-theoretic ordinal of $T$. This provides an alternative characterization of the notion of ``proof-theoretic ordinal,'' which is one of the central concepts of proof theory. In this note we provide an alternative proof of this theorem using cut-elimination for infinitary derivations.</description>

      <title>Modal definability in Kripke's theory of truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17091v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Outline of a Theory of Truth, Kripke introduces some of the central concepts of the logical study of truth and paradox. He informally defines some of these -- such as groundedness and paradoxicality -- using modal locutions. We introduce a modal language for regimenting these informal definitions. Though groundedness and paradoxicality are expressible in the modal language, we prove that intrinsicality -- which Kripke emphasizes but does not define modally -- is not. We characterize the modally definable relations and completely axiomatize the modal semantics.</description>

      <title>Finite central extensions of o-minimal groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We answer in the affirmative a conjecture of Berarducci, Peterzil and Pillay \cite{BPP10} for solvable groups, which is an o-minimal version of a particular case of Milnor's isomorphism conjecture \cite{jM83}. We prove that every abstract finite central extension of a definably connected solvable definable group in an o-minimal structure is equivalent to a definable (hence topological) finite central extension. The proof relies on an o-minimal adaptation of the higher inflation-restriction exact sequence due to Hochschild and Serre. As in \cite{jM83}, we also prove in o-minimal expansions of real closed fields that the conjecture reduces to definably simple groups.</description>
