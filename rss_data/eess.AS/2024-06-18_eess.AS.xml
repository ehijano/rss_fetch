      <title>Gender Representation in TV and Radio: Automatic Information Extraction methods versus Manual Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between automatic information extraction descriptors and manual analyses to describe gender representation disparities in TV and Radio. Automatic descriptors, including speech time, facial categorization and speech transcriptions are compared with channel reports on a vast 32,000-hour corpus of French broadcasts from 2023. Findings reveal systemic gender imbalances, with women underrepresented compared to men across all descriptors. Notably, manual channel reports show higher women's presence than automatic estimates and references to women are lower than their speech time. Descriptors share common dynamics during high and low audiences, war coverage, or private versus public channels. While women are more visible than audible in French TV, this trend is inverted in news with unseen journalists depicting male protagonists. A statistical test shows 3 main effects influencing references to women: program category, channel and speaker gender.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Speaker Identity Coding in Self-supervised Models and Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speaker identity plays a significant role in human communication and is being increasingly used in societal applications, many through advances in machine learning. Speaker identity perception is an essential cognitive phenomenon that can be broadly reduced to two main tasks: recognizing a voice or discriminating between voices. Several studies have attempted to identify acoustic correlates of identity perception to pinpoint salient parameters for such a task. Unlike other communicative social signals, most efforts have yielded inefficacious conclusions. Furthermore, current neurocognitive models of voice identity processing consider the bases of perception as acoustic dimensions such as fundamental frequency, harmonics-to-noise ratio, and formant dispersion. However, these findings do not account for naturalistic speech and within-speaker variability. Representational spaces of current self-supervised models have shown significant performance in various speech-related tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that self-supervised representations from different families (e.g., generative, contrastive, and predictive models) are significantly better for speaker identification over acoustic representations. We also show that such a speaker identification task can be used to better understand the nature of acoustic information representation in different layers of these powerful networks. By evaluating speaker identification accuracy across acoustic, phonemic, prosodic, and linguistic variants, we report similarity between model performance and human identity perception. We further examine these similarities by juxtaposing the encoding spaces of models and humans and challenging the use of distance metrics as a proxy for speaker proximity. Lastly, we show that some models can predict brain responses in Auditory and Language regions during naturalistic stimuli.</description>

      <title>Phoneme Discretized Saliency Maps for Explainable Detection of AI-Generated Voice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Phoneme Discretized Saliency Maps (PDSM), a discretization algorithm for saliency maps that takes advantage of phoneme boundaries for explainable detection of AI-generated voice. We experimentally show with two different Text-to-Speech systems (i.e., Tacotron2 and Fastspeech2) that the proposed algorithm produces saliency maps that result in more faithful explanations compared to standard posthoc explanation methods. Moreover, by associating the saliency maps to the phoneme representations, this methodology generates explanations that tend to be more understandable than standard saliency maps on magnitude spectrograms.</description>

      <title>AVR: Synergizing Foundation Models for Audio-Visual Humor Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present, AVR application for audio-visual humor detection. While humor detection has traditionally centered around textual analysis, recent advancements have spotlighted multimodal approaches. However, these methods lean on textual cues as a modality, necessitating the use of ASR systems for transcribing the audio-data. This heavy reliance on ASR accuracy can pose challenges in real-world applications. To address this bottleneck, we propose an innovative audio-visual humor detection system that circumvents textual reliance, eliminating the need for ASR models. Instead, the proposed approach hinges on the intricate interplay between audio and visual content for effective humor detection.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Children's ASR with Supervised and Self-supervised Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) have achieved state-of-the-art results for various speech tasks in supervised (e.g. Whisper) or self-supervised systems (e.g. WavLM). However, the performance of SFMs for child ASR has not been systematically studied. In addition, there is no benchmark for child ASR with standard evaluations, making the comparisons of novel ideas difficult. In this paper, we initiate and present a comprehensive benchmark on several child speech databases based on various SFMs (Whisper, Wav2vec2.0, HuBERT, and WavLM). Moreover, we investigate finetuning strategies by comparing various data augmentation and parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods. We observe that the behaviors of these methods are different when the model size increases. For example, PEFT matches the performance of full finetuning for large models but worse for small models. To stabilize finetuning using augmented data, we propose a perturbation invariant finetuning (PIF) loss as a regularization.</description>

      <title>SOA: Reducing Domain Mismatch in SSL Pipeline by Speech Only Adaptation for Low Resource ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, speech foundation models have gained popularity due to their superiority in finetuning downstream ASR tasks. However, models finetuned on certain domains, such as LibriSpeech (adult read speech), behave poorly on other domains (child or noisy speech). One solution could be collecting as much labeled and diverse data as possible for joint finetuning on various domains. However, collecting target domain speech-text paired data and retraining the model is often costly and computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective method, speech only adaptation (SOA), based on speech foundation models (Wav2vec 2.0), which requires only speech input data from the target domain. Specifically, the Wav2vec 2.0 feature encoder is continually pretrained with the Wav2vec 2.0 loss on both the source and target domain data for domain adaptation, while the contextual encoder is frozen. Compared to a source domain finetuned model with the feature encoder being frozen during training, we find that replacing the frozen feature encoder with the adapted one provides significant WER improvements to the target domain while preserving the performance of the source domain. The effectiveness of SOA is examined on various low resource or domain mismatched ASR settings, including adult-child and clean-noisy speech.</description>

      <title>Articulatory Phonetics Informed Controllable Expressive Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expressive speech synthesis aims to generate speech that captures a wide range of para-linguistic features, including emotion and articulation, though current research primarily emphasizes emotional aspects over the nuanced articulatory features mastered by professional voice actors. Inspired by this, we explore expressive speech synthesis through the lens of articulatory phonetics. Specifically, we define a framework with three dimensions: Glottalization, Tenseness, and Resonance (GTR), to guide the synthesis at the voice production level. With this framework, we record a high-quality speech dataset named GTR-Voice, featuring 20 Chinese sentences articulated by a professional voice actor across 125 distinct GTR combinations. We verify the framework and GTR annotations through automatic classification and listening tests, and demonstrate precise controllability along the GTR dimensions on two fine-tuned expressive TTS models. We open-source the dataset and TTS models.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Audio Segmentation for Long-form Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech segmentation is an essential part of speech translation (ST) systems in real-world scenarios. Since most ST models are designed to process speech segments, long-form audio must be partitioned into shorter segments before translation. Recently, data-driven approaches for the speech segmentation task have been developed. Although the approaches improve overall translation quality, a performance gap exists due to a mismatch between the models and ST systems. In addition, the prior works require large self-supervised speech models, which consume significant computational resources. In this work, we propose a segmentation model that achieves better speech translation quality with a small model size. We propose an ASR-with-punctuation task as an effective pre-training strategy for the segmentation model. We also show that proper integration of the speech segmentation model into the underlying ST system is critical to improve overall translation quality at inference time.</description>

      <title>MINT: a Multi-modal Image and Narrative Text Dubbing Dataset for Foley Audio Content Planning and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foley audio, critical for enhancing the immersive experience in multimedia content, faces significant challenges in the AI-generated content (AIGC) landscape. Despite advancements in AIGC technologies for text and image generation, the foley audio dubbing remains rudimentary due to difficulties in cross-modal scene matching and content correlation. Current text-to-audio technology, which relies on detailed and acoustically relevant textual descriptions, falls short in practical video dubbing applications. Existing datasets like AudioSet, AudioCaps, Clotho, Sound-of-Story, and WavCaps do not fully meet the requirements for real-world foley audio dubbing task. To address this, we introduce the Multi-modal Image and Narrative Text Dubbing Dataset (MINT), designed to enhance mainstream dubbing tasks such as literary story audiobooks dubbing, image/silent video dubbing. Besides, to address the limitations of existing TTA technology in understanding and planning complex prompts, a Foley Audio Content Planning, Generation, and Alignment (CPGA) framework is proposed, which includes a content planning module leveraging large language models for complex multi-modal prompts comprehension. Additionally, the training process is optimized using Proximal Policy Optimization based reinforcement learning, significantly improving the alignment and auditory realism of generated foley audio. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly advances the field of foley audio dubbing, providing robust solutions for the challenges of multi-modal dubbing. Even when utilizing the relatively lightweight GPT-2 model, our framework outperforms open-source multimodal large models such as LLaVA, DeepSeek-VL, and Moondream2. The dataset is available at https://github.com/borisfrb/MINT .</description>

      <title>Double Multi-Head Attention Multimodal System for Odyssey 2024 Speech Emotion Recognition Challenge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As computer-based applications are becoming more integrated into our daily lives, the importance of Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) has increased significantly. Promoting research with innovative approaches in SER, the Odyssey 2024 Speech Emotion Recognition Challenge was organized as part of the Odyssey 2024 Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop. In this paper we describe the Double Multi-Head Attention Multimodal System developed for this challenge. Pre-trained self-supervised models were used to extract informative acoustic and text features. An early fusion strategy was adopted, where a Multi-Head Attention layer transforms these mixed features into complementary contextualized representations. A second attention mechanism is then applied to pool these representations into an utterance-level vector. Our proposed system achieved the third position in the categorical task ranking with a 34.41% Macro-F1 score, where 31 teams participated in total.</description>

      <title>Revisiting and Improving Scoring Fusion for Spoofing-aware Speaker Verification Using Compositional Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusing outputs from automatic speaker verification (ASV) and spoofing countermeasure (CM) is expected to make an integrated system robust to zero-effort imposters and synthesized spoofing attacks. Many score-level fusion methods have been proposed, but many remain heuristic. This paper revisits score-level fusion using tools from decision theory and presents three main findings. First, fusion by summing the ASV and CM scores can be interpreted on the basis of compositional data analysis, and score calibration before fusion is essential. Second, the interpretation leads to an improved fusion method that linearly combines the log-likelihood ratios of ASV and CM. However, as the third finding reveals, this linear combination is inferior to a non-linear one in making optimal decisions. The outcomes of these findings, namely, the score calibration before fusion, improved linear fusion, and better non-linear fusion, were found to be effective on the SASV challenge database.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Accent Modeling with Disentangling for Multi-Speaker Multi-Accent TTS Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing speech across different accents while preserving the speaker identity is essential for various real-world customer applications. However, the individual and accurate modeling of accents and speakers in a text-to-speech (TTS) system is challenging due to the complexity of accent variations and the intrinsic entanglement between the accent and speaker identity. In this paper, we present a novel approach for multi-speaker multi-accent TTS synthesis, which aims to synthesize voices of multiple speakers, each with various accents. Our proposed approach employs a multi-scale accent modeling strategy to address accent variations at different levels. Specifically, we introduce both global (utterance level) and local (phoneme level) accent modeling, supervised by individual accent classifiers to capture the overall variation within accented utterances and fine-grained variations between phonemes, respectively. To control accents and speakers separately, speaker-independent accent modeling is necessary, which is achieved by adversarial training with speaker classifiers to disentangle speaker identity within the multi-scale accent modeling. Consequently, we obtain speaker-independent and accent-discriminative multi-scale embeddings as comprehensive accent features. Additionally, we propose a local accent prediction model that allows to generate accented speech directly from phoneme inputs. Extensive experiments are conducted on an accented English speech corpus. Both objective and subjective evaluations show the superiority of our proposed system compared to baselines systems. Detailed component analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of global and local accent modeling, and speaker disentanglement on multi-speaker multi-accent speech synthesis.</description>

      <title>Continual Test-time Adaptation for End-to-end Speech Recognition on Noisy Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) has made significant strides but still struggles with performance on out-of-domain (OOD) samples due to domain shifts in real-world scenarios. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods address this issue by adapting models using test samples at inference time. However, current ASR TTA methods have largely focused on non-continual TTA, which limits cross-sample knowledge learning compared to continual TTA. In this work, we propose a Fast-slow TTA framework for ASR, which leverages the advantage of continual and non-continual TTA. Within this framework, we introduce Dynamic SUTA (DSUTA), an entropy-minimization-based continual TTA method for ASR. To enhance DSUTA's robustness on time-varying data, we propose a dynamic reset strategy that automatically detects domain shifts and resets the model, making it more effective at handling multi-domain data. Our method demonstrates superior performance on various noisy ASR datasets, outperforming both non-continual and continual TTA baselines while maintaining robustness to domain changes without requiring domain boundary information.</description>

      <title>Self-Distillation Prototypes Network: Learning Robust Speaker Representations without Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training speaker-discriminative and robust speaker verification systems without explicit speaker labels remains a persisting challenge. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised speaker verification approach, Self-Distillation Prototypes Network (SDPN), which effectively facilitates self-supervised speaker representation learning. SDPN assigns the representation of the augmented views of an utterance to the same prototypes as the representation of the original view, thereby enabling effective knowledge transfer between the views. Originally, due to the lack of negative pairs in the SDPN training process, the network tends to align positive pairs very closely in the embedding space, a phenomenon known as model collapse. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a diversity regularization term to embeddings in SDPN. Comprehensive experiments on the VoxCeleb datasets demonstrate the superiority of SDPN in self-supervised speaker verification. SDPN sets a new state-of-the-art on the VoxCeleb1 speaker verification evaluation benchmark, achieving Equal Error Rate 1.80%, 1.99%, and 3.62% for trial VoxCeleb1-O, VoxCeleb1-E and VoxCeleb1-H respectively, without using any speaker labels in training.</description>

      <title>Performance Improvement of Language-Queried Audio Source Separation Based on Caption Augmentation From Large Language Models for DCASE Challenge 2024 Task 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a prompt-engineering-based text-augmentation approach applied to a language-queried audio source separation (LASS) task. To enhance the performance of LASS, the proposed approach utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate multiple captions corresponding to each sentence of the training dataset. To this end, we first perform experiments to identify the most effective prompts for caption augmentation with a smaller number of captions. A LASS model trained with these augmented captions demonstrates improved performance on the DCASE 2024 Task 9 validation set compared to that trained without augmentation. This study highlights the effectiveness of LLM-based caption augmentation in advancing language-queried audio source separation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When using artificial neural networks for multichannel speech enhancement, filtering is often achieved by estimating a complex-valued mask that is applied to all or one reference channel of the input signal. The estimation of this mask is based on the noisy multichannel signal and, hence, can exploit spatial and spectral cues simultaneously. While it has been shown that exploiting spatial and spectral cues jointly is beneficial for the speech enhancement result, the mechanics of the interplay of the two inside the neural network are still largely unknown. In this contribution, we investigate how two conceptually different neural spatiospectral filters (NSSFs) exploit spatial cues depending on the training target signal and show that, while one NSSF always performs spatial filtering, the other one is selective in leveraging spatial information depending on the task at hand. These insights provide better understanding of the information the NSSFs use to make their prediction and, thus, allow to make informed decisions regarding their design and deployment.</description>

      <title>An Exploration of Length Generalization in Transformer-Based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Transformer architectures has facilitated remarkable progress in speech enhancement. Training Transformers using substantially long speech utterances is often infeasible as self-attention suffers from quadratic complexity. It is a critical and unexplored challenge for a Transformer-based speech enhancement model to learn from short speech utterances and generalize to longer ones. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the length generalization problem in speech enhancement with Transformer. Our findings first establish that position embedding provides an effective instrument to alleviate the impact of utterance length on Transformer-based speech enhancement. Specifically, we explore four different position embedding schemes to enable length generalization. The results confirm the superiority of relative position embeddings (RPEs) over absolute PE (APEs) in length generalization.</description>

      <title>DiTTo-TTS: Efficient and Scalable Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale diffusion models have shown outstanding generative abilities across multiple modalities including images, videos, and audio. However, text-to-speech (TTS) systems typically involve domain-specific modeling factors (e.g., phonemes and phoneme-level durations) to ensure precise temporal alignments between text and speech, which hinders the efficiency and scalability of diffusion models for TTS. In this work, we present an efficient and scalable Diffusion Transformer (DiT) that utilizes off-the-shelf pre-trained text and speech encoders. Our approach addresses the challenge of text-speech alignment via cross-attention mechanisms with the prediction of the total length of speech representations. To achieve this, we enhance the DiT architecture to suit TTS and improve the alignment by incorporating semantic guidance into the latent space of speech. We scale the training dataset and the model size to 82K hours and 790M parameters, respectively. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the large-scale diffusion model for TTS without domain-specific modeling not only simplifies the training pipeline but also yields superior or comparable zero-shot performance to state-of-the-art TTS models in terms of naturalness, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Our speech samples are available at https://ditto-tts.github.io.</description>

      <title>GigaSpeech 2: An Evolving, Large-Scale and Multi-domain ASR Corpus for Low-Resource Languages with Automated Crawling, Transcription and Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of speech technology has been spurred by the rapid increase in dataset sizes. Traditional speech models generally depend on a large amount of labeled training data, which is scarce for low-resource languages. This paper presents GigaSpeech 2, a large-scale, multi-domain, multilingual speech recognition corpus. It is designed for low-resource languages and does not rely on paired speech and text data. GigaSpeech 2 comprises about 30,000 hours of automatically transcribed speech, including Thai, Indonesian, and Vietnamese, gathered from unlabeled YouTube videos. We also introduce an automated pipeline for data crawling, transcription, and label refinement. Specifically, this pipeline uses Whisper for initial transcription and TorchAudio for forced alignment, combined with multi-dimensional filtering for data quality assurance. A modified Noisy Student Training is developed to further refine flawed pseudo labels iteratively, thus enhancing model performance. Experimental results on our manually transcribed evaluation set and two public test sets from Common Voice and FLEURS confirm our corpus's high quality and broad applicability. Notably, ASR models trained on GigaSpeech 2 can reduce the word error rate for Thai, Indonesian, and Vietnamese on our challenging and realistic YouTube test set by 25% to 40% compared to the Whisper large-v3 model, with merely 10% model parameters. Furthermore, our ASR models trained on Gigaspeech 2 yield superior performance compared to commercial services. We believe that our newly introduced corpus and pipeline will open a new avenue for low-resource speech recognition and significantly facilitate research in this area.</description>

      <title>AV-CrossNet: an Audiovisual Complex Spectral Mapping Network for Speech Separation By Leveraging Narrow- and Cross-Band Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adding visual cues to audio-based speech separation can improve separation performance. This paper introduces AV-CrossNet, an audiovisual (AV) system for speech enhancement, target speaker extraction, and multi-talker speaker separation. AV-CrossNet is extended from the CrossNet architecture, which is a recently proposed network that performs complex spectral mapping for speech separation by leveraging global attention and positional encoding. To effectively utilize visual cues, the proposed system incorporates pre-extracted visual embeddings and employs a visual encoder comprising temporal convolutional layers. Audio and visual features are fused in an early fusion layer before feeding to AV-CrossNet blocks. We evaluate AV-CrossNet on multiple datasets, including LRS, VoxCeleb, and COG-MHEAR challenge. Evaluation results demonstrate that AV-CrossNet advances the state-of-the-art performance in all audiovisual tasks, even on untrained and mismatched datasets.</description>

      <title>1000 African Voices: Advancing inclusive multi-speaker multi-accent speech synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in speech synthesis have enabled many useful applications like audio directions in Google Maps, screen readers, and automated content generation on platforms like TikTok. However, these systems are mostly dominated by voices sourced from data-rich geographies with personas representative of their source data. Although 3000 of the world's languages are domiciled in Africa, African voices and personas are under-represented in these systems. As speech synthesis becomes increasingly democratized, it is desirable to increase the representation of African English accents. We present Afro-TTS, the first pan-African accented English speech synthesis system able to generate speech in 86 African accents, with 1000 personas representing the rich phonological diversity across the continent for downstream application in Education, Public Health, and Automated Content Creation. Speaker interpolation retains naturalness and accentedness, enabling the creation of new voices.</description>

      <title>Towards Signal Processing In Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the idea of applying signal processing inside a Large Language Model (LLM). With the recent explosion of generative AI, our work can help bridge two fields together, namely the field of signal processing and large language models. We draw parallels between classical Fourier-Transforms and Fourier Transform-like learnable time-frequency representations for every intermediate activation signal of an LLM. Once we decompose every activation signal across tokens into a time-frequency representation, we learn how to filter and reconstruct them, with all components learned from scratch, to predict the next token given the previous context. We show that for GPT-like architectures, our work achieves faster convergence and significantly increases performance by adding a minuscule number of extra parameters when trained for the same epochs. We hope this work paves the way for algorithms exploring signal processing inside the signals found in neural architectures like LLMs and beyond.</description>

      <title>Connected Speech-Based Cognitive Assessment in Chinese and English</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10272v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel benchmark dataset and prediction tasks for investigating approaches to assess cognitive function through analysis of connected speech. The dataset consists of speech samples and clinical information for speakers of Mandarin Chinese and English with different levels of cognitive impairment as well as individuals with normal cognition. These data have been carefully matched by age and sex by propensity score analysis to ensure balance and representativity in model training. The prediction tasks encompass mild cognitive impairment diagnosis and cognitive test score prediction. This framework was designed to encourage the development of approaches to speech-based cognitive assessment which generalise across languages. We illustrate it by presenting baseline prediction models that employ language-agnostic and comparable features for diagnosis and cognitive test score prediction. The models achieved unweighted average recall was 59.2% in diagnosis, and root mean squared error of 2.89 in score prediction.</description>

      <title>Soft Language Identification for Language-Agnostic Many-to-One End-to-End Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language-agnostic many-to-one end-to-end speech translation models can convert audio signals from different source languages into text in a target language. These models do not need source language identification, which improves user experience. In some cases, the input language can be given or estimated. Our goal is to use this additional language information while preserving the quality of the other languages. We accomplish this by introducing a simple and effective linear input network. The linear input network is initialized as an identity matrix, which ensures that the model can perform as well as, or better than, the original model. Experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully enhance the specified language, while keeping the language-agnostic ability of the many-to-one ST models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) speech representation models, trained on large speech corpora, have demonstrated effectiveness in extracting hierarchical speech embeddings through multiple transformer layers. However, the behavior of these embeddings in specific tasks remains uncertain. This paper investigates the multi-layer behavior of the WavLM model in anti-spoofing and proposes an attentive merging method to leverage the hierarchical hidden embeddings. Results demonstrate the feasibility of fine-tuning WavLM to achieve the best equal error rate (EER) of 0.65%, 3.50%, and 3.19% on the ASVspoof 2019LA, 2021LA, and 2021DF evaluation sets, respectively. Notably, We find that the early hidden transformer layers of the WavLM large model contribute significantly to anti-spoofing task, enabling computational efficiency by utilizing a partial pre-trained model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art ASRs show suboptimal performance for child speech. The scarcity of child speech limits the development of child speech recognition (CSR). Therefore, we studied child-to-child voice conversion (VC) from existing child speakers in the dataset and additional (new) child speakers via monolingual and cross-lingual (Dutch-to-German) VC, respectively. The results showed that cross-lingual child-to-child VC significantly improved child ASR performance. Experiments on the impact of the quantity of child-to-child cross-lingual VC-generated data on fine-tuning (FT) ASR models gave the best results with two-fold augmentation for our FT-Conformer model and FT-Whisper model which reduced WERs with ~3% absolute compared to the baseline, and with six-fold augmentation for the model trained from scratch, which improved by an absolute 3.6% WER. Moreover, using a small amount of "high-quality" VC-generated data achieved similar results to those of our best-FT models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toxicity classification for voice heavily relies on the semantic content of speech. We propose a novel framework that utilizes cross-modal learning to integrate the semantic embedding of text into a multilabel speech toxicity classifier during training. This enables us to incorporate textual information during training while still requiring only audio during inference. We evaluate this classifier on large-scale datasets with real-world characteristics to validate the effectiveness of this framework. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate that general-purpose semantic text embeddings are rich and aligned with speech for toxicity classification purposes. Conducting experiments across multiple languages at scale, we show improvements in voice toxicity classification across five languages and different toxicity categories.</description>

      <title>How Should We Extract Discrete Audio Tokens from Self-Supervised Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete audio tokens have recently gained attention for their potential to bridge the gap between audio and language processing. Ideal audio tokens must preserve content, paralinguistic elements, speaker identity, and many other audio details. Current audio tokenization methods fall into two categories: Semantic tokens, acquired through quantization of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models, and Neural compression-based tokens (codecs). Although previous studies have benchmarked codec models to identify optimal configurations, the ideal setup for quantizing pretrained SSL models remains unclear. This paper explores the optimal configuration of semantic tokens across discriminative and generative tasks. We propose a scalable solution to train a universal vocoder across multiple SSL layers. Furthermore, an attention mechanism is employed to identify task-specific influential layers, enhancing the adaptability and performance of semantic tokens in diverse audio applications.</description>

      <title>Speech Emotion Recognition Using CNN and Its Use Case in Digital Healthcare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process of identifying human emotion and affective states from speech is known as speech emotion recognition (SER). This is based on the observation that tone and pitch in the voice frequently convey underlying emotion. Speech recognition includes the ability to recognize emotions, which is becoming increasingly popular and in high demand. With the help of appropriate factors (such modalities, emotions, intensities, repetitions, etc.) found in the data, my research seeks to use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish emotions from audio recordings and label them in accordance with the range of different emotions. I have developed a machine learning model to identify emotions from supplied audio files with the aid of machine learning methods. The evaluation is mostly focused on precision, recall, and F1 score, which are common machine learning metrics. To properly set up and train the machine learning framework, the main objective is to investigate the influence and cross-relation of all input and output parameters. To improve the ability to recognize intentions, a key condition for communication, I have evaluated emotions using my specialized machine learning algorithm via voice that would address the emotional state from voice with the help of digital healthcare, bridging the gap between human and artificial intelligence (AI).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Speech Assessment (ASA) has seen notable advancements with the utilization of self-supervised features (SSL) in recent research. However, a key challenge in ASA lies in the imbalanced distribution of data, particularly evident in English test datasets. To address this challenge, we approach ASA as an ordinal classification task, introducing Weighted Vectors Ranking Similarity (W-RankSim) as a novel regularization technique. W-RankSim encourages closer proximity of weighted vectors in the output layer for similar classes, implying that feature vectors with similar labels would be gradually nudged closer to each other as they converge towards corresponding weighted vectors. Extensive experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach in improving ordinal classification performance for ASA. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid model that combines SSL and handcrafted features, showcasing how the inclusion of handcrafted features enhances performance in an ASA system.</description>

      <title>SingMOS: An extensive Open-Source Singing Voice Dataset for MOS Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In speech generation tasks, human subjective ratings, usually referred to as the opinion score, are considered the "gold standard" for speech quality evaluation, with the mean opinion score (MOS) serving as the primary evaluation metric. Due to the high cost of human annotation, several MOS prediction systems have emerged in the speech domain, demonstrating good performance. These MOS prediction models are trained using annotations from previous speech-related challenges. However, compared to the speech domain, the singing domain faces data scarcity and stricter copyright protections, leading to a lack of high-quality MOS-annotated datasets for singing. To address this, we propose SingMOS, a high-quality and diverse MOS dataset for singing, covering a range of Chinese and Japanese datasets. These synthesized vocals are generated using state-of-the-art models in singing synthesis, conversion, or resynthesis tasks and are rated by professional annotators alongside real vocals. Data analysis demonstrates the diversity and reliability of our dataset. Additionally, we conduct further exploration on SingMOS, providing insights for singing MOS prediction and guidance for the continued expansion of SingMOS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech recognition is an essential start ring of human-computer interaction, and recently, deep learning models have achieved excellent success in this task. However, when the model training and private data provider are always separated, some security threats that make deep neural networks (DNNs) abnormal deserve to be researched. In recent years, the typical backdoor attacks have been researched in speech recognition systems. The existing backdoor methods are based on data poisoning. The attacker adds some incorporated changes to benign speech spectrograms or changes the speech components, such as pitch and timbre. As a result, the poisoned data can be detected by human hearing or automatic deep algorithms. To improve the stealthiness of data poisoning, we propose a non-neural and fast algorithm called Random Spectrogram Rhythm Transformation (RSRT) in this paper. The algorithm combines four steps to generate stealthy poisoned utterances. From the perspective of rhythm component transformation, our proposed trigger stretches or squeezes the mel spectrograms and recovers them back to signals. The operation keeps timbre and content unchanged for good stealthiness. Our experiments are conducted on two kinds of speech recognition tasks, including testing the stealthiness of poisoned samples by speaker verification and automatic speech recognition. The results show that our method has excellent effectiveness and stealthiness. The rhythm trigger needs a low poisoning rate and gets a very high attack success rate.</description>

      <title>Robust Channel Learning for Large-Scale Radio Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research in speaker verification has increasingly focused on achieving robust and reliable recognition under challenging channel conditions and noisy environments. Identifying speakers in radio communications is particularly difficult due to inherent limitations such as constrained bandwidth and pervasive noise interference. To address this issue, we present a Channel Robust Speaker Learning (CRSL) framework that enhances the robustness of the current speaker verification pipeline, considering data source, data augmentation, and the efficiency of model transfer processes. Our framework introduces an augmentation module that mitigates bandwidth variations in radio speech datasets by manipulating the bandwidth of training inputs. It also addresses unknown noise by introducing noise within the manifold space. Additionally, we propose an efficient fine-tuning method that reduces the need for extensive additional training time and large amounts of data. Moreover, we develop a toolkit for assembling a large-scale radio speech corpus and establish a benchmark specifically tailored for radio scenario speaker verification studies. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methodology effectively enhances performance and mitigates degradation caused by radio transmission in speaker verification tasks. The code will be available on Github.</description>

      <title>Joint Audio and Symbolic Conditioning for Temporally Controlled Text-to-Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present JASCO, a temporally controlled text-to-music generation model utilizing both symbolic and audio-based conditions. JASCO can generate high-quality music samples conditioned on global text descriptions along with fine-grained local controls. JASCO is based on the Flow Matching modeling paradigm together with a novel conditioning method. This allows music generation controlled both locally (e.g., chords) and globally (text description). Specifically, we apply information bottleneck layers in conjunction with temporal blurring to extract relevant information with respect to specific controls. This allows the incorporation of both symbolic and audio-based conditions in the same text-to-music model. We experiment with various symbolic control signals (e.g., chords, melody), as well as with audio representations (e.g., separated drum tracks, full-mix). We evaluate JASCO considering both generation quality and condition adherence, using both objective metrics and human studies. Results suggest that JASCO is comparable to the evaluated baselines considering generation quality while allowing significantly better and more versatile controls over the generated music. Samples are available on our demo page https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/JASCO.</description>

      <title>CoSTA: Code-Switched Speech Translation using Aligned Speech-Text Interleaving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Code-switching is a widely prevalent linguistic phenomenon in multilingual societies like India. Building speech-to-text models for code-switched speech is challenging due to limited availability of datasets. In this work, we focus on the problem of spoken translation (ST) of code-switched speech in Indian languages to English text. We present a new end-to-end model architecture COSTA that scaffolds on pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) modules (that are more widely available for many languages). Speech and ASR text representations are fused using an aligned interleaving scheme and are fed further as input to a pretrained MT module; the whole pipeline is then trained end-to-end for spoken translation using synthetically created ST data. We also release a new evaluation benchmark for code-switched Bengali-English, Hindi-English, Marathi-English and Telugu- English speech to English text. COSTA significantly outperforms many competitive cascaded and end-to-end multimodal baselines by up to 3.5 BLEU points.</description>

      <title>SPEAR: Receiver-to-Receiver Acoustic Neural Warping Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SPEAR, a continuous receiver-to-receiver acoustic neural warping field for spatial acoustic effects prediction in an acoustic 3D space with a single stationary audio source. Unlike traditional source-to-receiver modelling methods that require prior space acoustic properties knowledge to rigorously model audio propagation from source to receiver, we propose to predict by warping the spatial acoustic effects from one reference receiver position to another target receiver position, so that the warped audio essentially accommodates all spatial acoustic effects belonging to the target position. SPEAR can be trained in a data much more readily accessible manner, in which we simply ask two robots to independently record spatial audio at different positions. We further theoretically prove the universal existence of the warping field if and only if one audio source presents. Three physical principles are incorporated to guide SPEAR network design, leading to the learned warping field physically meaningful. We demonstrate SPEAR superiority on both synthetic, photo-realistic and real-world dataset, showing the huge potential of SPEAR to various down-stream robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>Outlier Reduction with Gated Attention for Improved Post-training Quantization in Large Sequence-to-sequence Speech Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the improvement of post-training quantization (PTQ) after knowledge distillation in the Whisper speech foundation model family. We address the challenge of outliers in weights and activation tensors, known to impede quantization quality in transformer-based language and vision models. Extending this observation to Whisper, we demonstrate that these outliers are also present when transformer-based models are trained to perform automatic speech recognition, necessitating mitigation strategies for PTQ. We show that outliers can be reduced by a recently proposed gating mechanism in the attention blocks of the student model, enabling effective 8-bit quantization, and lower word error rates compared to student models without the gating mechanism in place.</description>

Abstract: Accurately detecting dysfluencies in spoken language can help to improve the performance of automatic speech and language processing components and support the development of more inclusive speech and language technologies. Inspired by the recent trend towards the deployment of large language models (LLMs) as universal learners and processors of non-lexical inputs, such as audio and video, we approach the task of multi-label dysfluency detection as a language modeling problem. We present hypotheses candidates generated with an automatic speech recognition system and acoustic representations extracted from an audio encoder model to an LLM, and finetune the system to predict dysfluency labels on three datasets containing English and German stuttered speech. The experimental results show that our system effectively combines acoustic and lexical information and achieves competitive results on the multi-label stuttering detection task.</description>

      <title>NAST: Noise Aware Speech Tokenization for Speech Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech tokenization is the task of representing speech signals as a sequence of discrete units. Such representations can be later used for various downstream tasks including automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, etc. More relevant to this study, such representation serves as the basis of Speech Language Models. In this work, we tackle the task of speech tokenization under the noisy setup and present NAST: Noise Aware Speech Tokenization for Speech Language Models. NAST is composed of three main components: (i) a predictor; (ii) a residual encoder; and (iii) a decoder. We evaluate the efficiency of NAST considering several spoken language modeling tasks and show that NAST is superior to the evaluated baselines across all setups. Lastly, we analyze NAST and show its disentanglement properties and robustness to signal variations in the form of noise, reverberation, pitch-shift, and time-stretch. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/ShovalMessica/NAST.</description>

      <title>Identification of Physical Properties in Acoustic Tubes Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is a method for numerical simulation that incorporates a loss function corresponding to the governing equations into a neural network. While PINNs have been explored for their utility in inverse analysis, their application in acoustic analysis remains limited. This study presents a method to identify loss parameters in acoustic tubes using PINNs. We categorized the loss parameters into two groups: one dependent on the tube's diameter and another constant, independent of it. The latter were set as the trainable parameters of the neural network. The problem of identifying the loss parameter was formulated as an optimization problem, with the physical properties being determined through this process. The neural network architecture employed was based on our previously proposed ResoNet, which is designed for analyzing acoustic resonance. The efficacy of the proposed method is assessed through both forward and inverse analysis, specifically through the identification of loss parameters. The findings demonstrate that it is feasible to accurately identify parameters that significantly impact the sound field under analysis. By merely altering the governing equations in the loss function, this method could be adapted to various sound fields, suggesting its potential for broad application.</description>

      <title>SMRU: Split-and-Merge Recurrent-based UNet for Acoustic Echo Cancellation and Noise Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of deep neural networks has spawned the rapid development of acoustic echo cancellation and noise suppression, and plenty of prior arts have been proposed, which yield promising performance. Nevertheless, they rarely consider the deployment generality in different processing scenarios, such as edge devices, and cloud processing. To this end, this paper proposes a general model, termed SMRU, to cover different application scenarios. The novelty lies in two-fold. First, a multi-scale band split layer and band merge layer are proposed to effectively fuse local frequency bands for lower complexity modeling. Besides, by simulating the multi-resolution feature modeling characteristic of the classical UNet structure, a novel recurrent-dominated UNet is devised. It consists of multiple variable frame rate blocks, each of which involves the causal time down-/up-sampling layer with varying compression ratios and the dual-path structure for inter- and intra-band modeling. The model is configured from 50 M/s to 6.8 G/s in terms of MACs, and the experimental results show that the proposed approach yields competitive or even better performance over existing baselines, and has the full potential to adapt to more general scenarios with varying complexity requirements.</description>

      <title>AnoPatch: Towards Better Consistency in Machine Anomalous Sound Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large pre-trained models have demonstrated dominant performances in multiple areas, where the consistency between pre-training and fine-tuning is the key to success. However, few works reported satisfactory results of pre-trained models for the machine anomalous sound detection (ASD) task. This may be caused by the inconsistency of the pre-trained model and the inductive bias of machine audio, resulting in inconsistency in data and architecture. Thus, we propose AnoPatch which utilizes a ViT backbone pre-trained on AudioSet and fine-tunes it on machine audio. It is believed that machine audio is more related to audio datasets than speech datasets, and modeling it from patch level suits the sparsity of machine audio. As a result, AnoPatch showcases state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances on the DCASE 2020 ASD dataset and the DCASE 2023 ASD dataset. We also compare multiple pre-trained models and empirically demonstrate that better consistency yields considerable improvement.</description>

      <title>MusicScore: A Dataset for Music Score Modeling and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music scores are written representations of music and contain rich information about musical components. The visual information on music scores includes notes, rests, staff lines, clefs, dynamics, and articulations. This visual information in music scores contains more semantic information than audio and symbolic representations of music. Previous music score datasets have limited sizes and are mainly designed for optical music recognition (OMR). There is a lack of research on creating a large-scale benchmark dataset for music modeling and generation. In this work, we propose MusicScore, a large-scale music score dataset collected and processed from the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP). MusicScore consists of image-text pairs, where the image is a page of a music score and the text is the metadata of the music. The metadata of MusicScore is extracted from the general information section of the IMSLP pages. The metadata includes rich information about the composer, instrument, piece style, and genre of the music pieces. MusicScore is curated into small, medium, and large scales of 400, 14k, and 200k image-text pairs with varying diversity, respectively. We build a score generation system based on a UNet diffusion model to generate visually readable music scores conditioned on text descriptions to benchmark the MusicScore dataset for music score generation. MusicScore is released to the public at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ZheqiDAI/MusicScore.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a groundbreaking end-to-end (E2E) framework for decoding invasive brain signals, marking a significant advancement in the field of speech neuroprosthesis. Our methodology leverages the comprehensive reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) to facilitate direct decoding. By fully integrating LLMs, we achieve results comparable to the state-of-the-art cascade models. Our findings underscore the immense potential of E2E frameworks in speech neuroprosthesis, particularly as the technology behind brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and the availability of relevant datasets continue to evolve. This work not only showcases the efficacy of combining LLMs with E2E decoding for enhancing speech neuroprosthesis but also sets a new direction for future research in BCI applications, underscoring the impact of LLMs in decoding complex neural signals for communication restoration. Code will be made available at https://github.com/FsFrancis15/BrainLLM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perceiving and understanding non-speech sounds and non-verbal speech is essential to making decisions that help us interact with our surroundings. In this paper, we propose GAMA, a novel General-purpose Large Audio-Language Model (LALM) with Advanced Audio Understanding and Complex Reasoning Abilities. We build GAMA by integrating an LLM with multiple types of audio representations, including features from a custom Audio Q-Former, a multi-layer aggregator that aggregates features from multiple layers of an audio encoder. We fine-tune GAMA on a large-scale audio-language dataset, which augments it with audio understanding capabilities. Next, we propose CompA-R (Instruction-Tuning for Complex Audio Reasoning), a synthetically generated instruction-tuning (IT) dataset with instructions that require the model to perform complex reasoning on the input audio. We instruction-tune GAMA with CompA-R to endow it with complex reasoning abilities, where we further add a soft prompt as input with high-level semantic evidence by leveraging event tags of the input audio. Finally, we also propose CompA-R-test, a human-labeled evaluation dataset for evaluating the capabilities of LALMs on open-ended audio question-answering that requires complex reasoning. Through automated and expert human evaluations, we show that GAMA outperforms all other LALMs in literature on diverse audio understanding tasks by margins of 1%-84%. Further, GAMA IT-ed on CompA-R proves to be superior in its complex reasoning and instruction following capabilities.</description>

      <title>Exploring In-Context Learning of Textless Speech Language Model for Speech Classification Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ever since the development of GPT-3 in the natural language processing (NLP) field, in-context learning (ICL) has played an essential role in utilizing large language models (LLMs). By presenting the LM utterance-label demonstrations at the input, the LM can accomplish few-shot learning without relying on gradient descent or requiring explicit modification of its parameters. This enables the LM to perform various downstream tasks in a black-box manner. Despite the success of ICL in NLP, little work is exploring the possibility of ICL in speech processing. This study is the first work exploring ICL for speech classification tasks with textless speech LM. We first show that the current speech LM lacks the ICL capability. We then perform warmup training on the speech LM, equipping the LM with demonstration learning capability. This paper explores and proposes the first speech LM capable of performing unseen classification tasks in an ICL manner.</description>

      <title>Array Geometry-Robust Attention-Based Neural Beamformer for Moving Speakers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although mask-based beamforming is a powerful speech enhancement approach, it often requires manual parameter tuning to handle moving speakers. Recently, this approach was augmented with an attention-based spatial covariance matrix aggregator (ASA) module, enabling accurate tracking of moving speakers without manual tuning. However, the deep neural network model used in this module is limited to specific microphone arrays, necessitating a different model for varying channel permutations, numbers, or geometries. To improve the robustness of the ASA module against such variations, in this paper we investigate three approaches: training with random channel configurations, employing the transform-average-concatenate method to process multi-channel input features, and utilizing robust input features. Our experiments on the CHiME-3 and DEMAND datasets show that these approaches enable the ASA-augmented beamformer to track moving speakers across different microphone arrays unseen in training.</description>

Abstract: We propose mixture to mixture (M2M) training, a weakly-supervised neural speech separation algorithm that leverages close-talk mixtures as a weak supervision for training discriminative models to separate far-field mixtures. Our idea is that, for a target speaker, its close-talk mixture has a much higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the target speaker than any far-field mixtures, and hence could be utilized to design a weak supervision for separation. To realize this, at each training step we feed a far-field mixture to a deep neural network (DNN) to produce an intermediate estimate for each speaker, and, for each of considered close-talk and far-field microphones, we linearly filter the DNN estimates and optimize a loss so that the filtered estimates of all the speakers can sum up to the mixture captured by each of the considered microphones. Evaluation results on a 2-speaker separation task in simulated reverberant conditions show that M2M can effectively leverage close-talk mixtures as a weak supervision for separating far-field mixtures.</description>

      <title>Less Peaky and More Accurate CTC Forced Alignment by Label Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) models are known to have peaky output distributions. Such behavior is not a problem for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but it can cause inaccurate forced alignments (FA), especially at finer granularity, e.g., phoneme level. This paper aims at alleviating the peaky behavior for CTC and improve its suitability for forced alignment generation, by leveraging label priors, so that the scores of alignment paths containing fewer blanks are boosted and maximized during training. As a result, our CTC model produces less peaky posteriors and is able to more accurately predict the offset of the tokens besides their onset. It outperforms the standard CTC model and a heuristics-based approach for obtaining CTC's token offset timestamps by 12-40% in phoneme and word boundary errors (PBE and WBE) measured on the Buckeye and TIMIT data. Compared with the most widely used FA toolkit Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA), our method performs similarly on PBE/WBE on Buckeye, yet falls behind MFA on TIMIT. Nevertheless, our method has a much simpler training pipeline and better runtime efficiency. Our training recipe and pretrained model are released in TorchAudio.</description>

      <title>Task Arithmetic can Mitigate Synthetic-to-Real Gap in Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic data is widely used in speech recognition due to the availability of text-to-speech models, which facilitate adapting models to previously unseen text domains. However, existing methods suffer in performance when they fine-tune an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model on synthetic data as they suffer from the distributional shift commonly referred to as the synthetic-to-real gap. In this paper, we find that task vector arithmetic is effective at mitigating this gap. Our proposed method, SYN2REAL task vector, shows an average improvement of 10.03\% improvement in word error rate over baselines on the SLURP dataset. Additionally, we show that an average of SYN2REAL task vectors, when we have real speeches from multiple different domains, can further adapt the original ASR model to perform better on the target text domain.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Neural Speech Synthesis Models Through Fingerprints in Speech Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent strides in neural speech synthesis technologies, while enjoying widespread applications, have nonetheless introduced a series of challenges, spurring interest in the defence against the threat of misuse and abuse. Notably, source attribution of synthesized speech has value in forensics and intellectual property protection, but prior work in this area has certain limitations in scope. To address the gaps, we present our findings concerning the identification of the sources of synthesized speech in this paper. We investigate the existence of speech synthesis model fingerprints in the generated speech waveforms, with a focus on the acoustic model and the vocoder, and study the influence of each component on the fingerprint in the overall speech waveforms. Our research, conducted using the multi-speaker LibriTTS dataset, demonstrates two key insights: (1) vocoders and acoustic models impart distinct, model-specific fingerprints on the waveforms they generate, and (2) vocoder fingerprints are the more dominant of the two, and may mask the fingerprints from the acoustic model. These findings strongly suggest the existence of model-specific fingerprints for both the acoustic model and the vocoder, highlighting their potential utility in source identification applications.</description>

      <title>Multi-stage Large Language Model Correction for Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the usage of large language models (LLMs) to improve the performance of competitive speech recognition systems. Different from previous LLM-based ASR error correction methods, we propose a novel multi-stage approach that utilizes uncertainty estimation of ASR outputs and reasoning capability of LLMs. Specifically, the proposed approach has two stages: the first stage is about ASR uncertainty estimation and exploits N-best list hypotheses to identify less reliable transcriptions; The second stage works on these identified transcriptions and performs LLM-based corrections. This correction task is formulated as a multi-step rule-based LLM reasoning process, which uses explicitly written rules in prompts to decompose the task into concrete reasoning steps. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by showing 10% ~ 20% relative improvement in WER over competitive ASR systems -- across multiple test domains and in zero-shot settings.</description>

      <title>How Much Context Does My Attention-Based ASR System Need?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the task of speech recognition, the use of more than 30 seconds of acoustic context during training is uncommon and under-investigated in literature. In this work, we conduct an empirical study on the effect of scaling the sequence length used to train/evaluate (dense-attention-based) acoustic models on speech recognition performance. For these experiments, a dataset of roughly 100,000 pseudo-labelled Spotify podcasts is used, with context lengths of 5 seconds to 1 hour being explored. Zero-shot evaluations are presented on the long-format datasets: Earnings-22, Tedlium and Rev16. Results demonstrate a benefit from training with up to 21.8 minutes of acoustic context, showing up to a 14.5\% relative improvement from a baseline trained with 10 seconds of context. We find that the model's width/depth, positional encoding scheme and number of attention heads impact its ability to use longer contexts.</description>

      <title>Speech language models lack important brain-relevant semantics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite known differences between reading and listening in the brain, recent work has shown that text-based language models predict both text-evoked and speech-evoked brain activity to an impressive degree. This poses the question of what types of information language models truly predict in the brain. We investigate this question via a direct approach, in which we systematically remove specific low-level stimulus features (textual, speech, and visual) from language model representations to assess their impact on alignment with fMRI brain recordings during reading and listening. Comparing these findings with speech-based language models reveals starkly different effects of low-level features on brain alignment. While text-based models show reduced alignment in early sensory regions post-removal, they retain significant predictive power in late language regions. In contrast, speech-based models maintain strong alignment in early auditory regions even after feature removal but lose all predictive power in late language regions. These results suggest that speech-based models provide insights into additional information processed by early auditory regions, but caution is needed when using them to model processing in late language regions. We make our code publicly available. [https://github.com/subbareddy248/speech-llm-brain]</description>

      <title>OWSM v3.1: Better and Faster Open Whisper-Style Speech Models based on E-Branchformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the importance of fully open foundation models. The Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) is an initial step towards reproducing OpenAI Whisper using public data and open-source toolkits. However, previous versions of OWSM (v1 to v3) are still based on standard Transformer, which might lead to inferior performance compared to state-of-the-art speech encoder architectures. This work aims to improve the performance and efficiency of OWSM without additional data. We present a series of E-Branchformer-based models named OWSM v3.1, ranging from 100M to 1B parameters. OWSM v3.1 outperforms its predecessor, OWSM v3, in most evaluation benchmarks, while showing an improved inference speed of up to 25%. We further reveal the emergent ability of OWSM v3.1 in zero-shot contextual biasing speech recognition. We also provide a model trained on a subset of data with low license restrictions. We will publicly release the code, pre-trained models, and training logs.</description>

      <title>OWSM-CTC: An Open Encoder-Only Speech Foundation Model for Speech Recognition, Translation, and Language Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been an increasing interest in large speech models that can perform multiple tasks in a single model. Such models usually adopt an encoder-decoder or decoder-only architecture due to their popularity and good performance in many domains. However, autoregressive models can be slower during inference compared to non-autoregressive models and also have potential risks of hallucination. Though prior studies observed promising results of non-autoregressive models for certain tasks at small scales, it remains unclear if they can be scaled to speech-to-text generation in diverse languages and tasks. Inspired by the Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) project, we propose OWSM-CTC, a novel encoder-only speech foundation model based on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). It is trained on 180k hours of public audio data for multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST), and language identification (LID). Compared to encoder-decoder OWSM, our OWSM-CTC achieves competitive results on ASR and up to 24% relative improvement on ST, while it is more robust and 3 to 4 times faster for inference. OWSM-CTC also improves the long-form ASR result with 20x speed-up. We will publicly release our code, pre-trained model, and training logs to promote open science in speech foundation models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as a powerful tool in avian bioacoustics to assess environmental health. To maximize the potential of cost-effective and minimal-invasive passive acoustic monitoring (PAM), DL models must analyze bird vocalizations across a wide range of species and environmental conditions. However, data fragmentation challenges a comprehensive evaluation of generalization performance. Therefore, we introduce the BirdSet dataset, comprising approximately 520,000 global bird recordings for training and over 400 hours of PAM recordings for testing. Our benchmark offers baselines for several DL models to enhance comparability and consolidate research across studies, along with code implementations that include comprehensive training and evaluation protocols.</description>

      <title>Unimodal Multi-Task Fusion for Emotional Mimicry Intensity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11879v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this research, we introduce a novel methodology for assessing Emotional Mimicry Intensity (EMI) as part of the 6th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild. Our methodology utilises the Wav2Vec 2.0 architecture, which has been pre-trained on an extensive podcast dataset, to capture a wide array of audio features that include both linguistic and paralinguistic components. We refine our feature extraction process by employing a fusion technique that combines individual features with a global mean vector, thereby embedding a broader contextual understanding into our analysis. A key aspect of our approach is the multi-task fusion strategy that not only leverages these features but also incorporates a pre-trained Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) model. This integration is designed to refine emotion intensity prediction by concurrently processing multiple emotional dimensions, thereby embedding a richer contextual understanding into our framework. For the temporal analysis of audio data, our feature fusion process utilises a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. This approach, which relies solely on the provided audio data, shows marked advancements over the existing baseline, offering a more comprehensive understanding of emotional mimicry in naturalistic settings, achieving the second place in the EMI challenge.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Example Selection Improves In-Context Learning for Speech, Text, and Visual Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL) based on a few examples presented in dialogue history without any model parameter update. Despite such convenience, the performance of ICL heavily depends on the quality of the in-context examples presented, which makes the in-context example selection approach a critical choice. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian in-Context example Selection method (ByCS) for ICL. Extending the inference probability conditioned on in-context examples based on Bayes' theorem, ByCS focuses on the inverse inference conditioned on test input. Following the assumption that accurate inverse inference probability (likelihood) will result in accurate inference probability (posterior), in-context examples are selected based on their inverse inference results. Diverse and extensive cross-tasking and cross-modality experiments are performed with speech, text, and image examples. Experimental results show the efficacy and robustness of our ByCS method on various models, tasks and modalities.</description>

      <title>GMP-TL: Gender-augmented Multi-scale Pseudo-label Enhanced Transfer Learning for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous evolution of pre-trained speech models has greatly advanced Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). However, current research typically relies on utterance-level emotion labels, inadequately capturing the complexity of emotions within a single utterance. In this paper, we introduce GMP-TL, a novel SER framework that employs gender-augmented multi-scale pseudo-label (GMP) based transfer learning to mitigate this gap. Specifically, GMP-TL initially uses the pre-trained HuBERT, implementing multi-task learning and multi-scale k-means clustering to acquire frame-level GMPs. Subsequently, to fully leverage frame-level GMPs and utterance-level emotion labels, a two-stage model fine-tuning approach is presented to further optimize GMP-TL. Experiments on IEMOCAP show that our GMP-TL attains a WAR of 80.0% and an UAR of 82.0%, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unimodal SER methods while also yielding comparable results to multimodal SER approaches.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Classification of Heart Sounds Using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients: A Comparative Study of Single and Ensemble Classifier Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the efficacy of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) in detecting abnormal heart sounds using two classification strategies: a single classifier and an ensemble classifier approach. Heart sounds were first pre-processed to remove noise and then segmented into S1, systole, S2, and diastole intervals, with thirteen MFCCs estimated from each segment, yielding 52 MFCCs per beat. Finally, MFCCs were used for heart sound classification. For that purpose, in the single classifier strategy, the MFCCs from nine consecutive beats were averaged to classify heart sounds by a single classifier (either a support vector machine (SVM), the k nearest neighbors (kNN), or a decision tree (DT)). Conversely, the ensemble classifier strategy employed nine classifiers (either nine SVMs, nine kNN classifiers, or nine DTs) to individually assess beats as normal or abnormal, with the overall classification based on the majority vote. Both methods were tested on a publicly available phonocardiogram database. The heart sound classification accuracy was 91.95% for the SVM, 91.9% for the kNN, and 87.33% for the DT in the single classifier strategy. Also, the accuracy was 93.59% for the SVM, 91.84% for the kNN, and 92.22% for the DT in the ensemble classifier strategy. Overall, the results demonstrated that the ensemble classifier strategy improved the accuracies of the DT and the SVM by 4.89% and 1.64%, establishing MFCCs as more effective than other features, including time, time-frequency, and statistical features, evaluated in similar studies.</description>

      <title>VALL-E 2: Neural Codec Language Models are Human Parity Zero-Shot Text to Speech Synthesizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces VALL-E 2, the latest advancement in neural codec language models that marks a milestone in zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), achieving human parity for the first time. Based on its predecessor, VALL-E, the new iteration introduces two significant enhancements: Repetition Aware Sampling refines the original nucleus sampling process by accounting for token repetition in the decoding history. It not only stabilizes the decoding but also circumvents the infinite loop issue. Grouped Code Modeling organizes codec codes into groups to effectively shorten the sequence length, which not only boosts inference speed but also addresses the challenges of long sequence modeling. Our experiments on the LibriSpeech and VCTK datasets show that VALL-E 2 surpasses previous systems in speech robustness, naturalness, and speaker similarity. It is the first of its kind to reach human parity on these benchmarks. Moreover, VALL-E 2 consistently synthesizes high-quality speech, even for sentences that are traditionally challenging due to their complexity or repetitive phrases. The advantages of this work could contribute to valuable endeavors, such as generating speech for individuals with aphasia or people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. See https://aka.ms/valle2 for demos of VALL-E 2.</description>

Abstract: Audio-text retrieval is a challenging task, requiring the search for an audio clip or a text caption within a database. The predominant focus of existing research on English descriptions poses a limitation on the applicability of such models, given the abundance of non-English content in real-world data. To address these linguistic disparities, we propose a language enhancement (LE), using a multilingual text encoder (SONAR) to encode the text data with language-specific information. Additionally, we optimize the audio encoder through the application of consistent ensemble distillation (CED), enhancing support for variable-length audio-text retrieval. Our methodology excels in English audio-text retrieval, demonstrating state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on commonly used datasets such as AudioCaps and Clotho. Simultaneously, the approach exhibits proficiency in retrieving content in seven other languages with only 10% of additional language-enhanced training data, yielding promising results.

      <title>MFF-EINV2: Multi-scale Feature Fusion across Spectral-Spatial-Temporal Domains for Sound Event Localization and Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08771</link>

Abstract: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) involves detecting and localizing sound events using multichannel sound recordings. Previously proposed Event-Independent Network V2 (EINV2) has achieved outstanding performance on SELD. However, it still faces challenges in effectively extracting features across spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. This paper proposes a three-stage network structure named Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module to fully extract multi-scale features across spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. The MFF module utilizes parallel subnetworks architecture to generate multi-scale spectral and spatial features. The TF-Convolution Module is employed to provide multi-scale temporal features. We incorporated MFF into EINV2 and term the proposed method as MFF-EINV2. Experimental results in 2022 and 2023 DCASE challenge task3 datasets show the effectiveness of our MFF-EINV2, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to published methods.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Temporal Class Activation Representation for Audio Spoofing Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08825</link>

Abstract: Explaining the decisions made by audio spoofing detection models is crucial for fostering trust in detection outcomes. However, current research on the interpretability of detection models is limited to applying XAI tools to post-trained models. In this paper, we utilize the wav2vec 2.0 model and attentive utterance-level features to integrate interpretability directly into the model's architecture, thereby enhancing transparency of the decision-making process. Specifically, we propose a class activation representation to localize the discriminative frames contributing to detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that multi-label training based on spoofing types, rather than binary labels as bonafide and spoofed, enables the model to learn distinct characteristics of different attacks, significantly improving detection performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with an EER of 0.51% and a min t-DCF of 0.0165 on the ASVspoof2019-LA set.</description>
