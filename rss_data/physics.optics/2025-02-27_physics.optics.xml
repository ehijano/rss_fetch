      <title>Detection of Orbital Angular Momentum Modes via Spiral Phase Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode division multiplexing (MDM) systems leveraging spatial modes carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) present a promising approach to enhance communication capacity in free-space and fiber-optic networks. Efficient detection of OAM modes is critical for their practical implementation. Spiral phase plates (SPPs) are low-cost optical elements with simple structures, capable of generating OAM waves with high conversion efficiency and precision. This makes the inverse-SPP a promising candidate for the detection of OAM modes. In this study, the performance of SPPs as OAM detectors is thoroughly analyzed. Key parameters, including efficiency, crosstalk, and signal-to-interference ratio, are examined through analytical and numerical methods. Results demonstrate that an inverse-SPP, combined with an optimized propagation length and aperture size, enables effective and precise OAM detection operation.</description>

      <title>From Stars to Molecules: AI Guided Device-Agnostic Super-Resolution Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-resolution imaging has revolutionized the study of systems ranging from molecular structures to distant galaxies. However, existing deep-learning-based methods require extensive calibration and retraining for each imaging setup, limiting their practical deployment. We introduce a device-agnostic deep-learning framework for super-resolution imaging of point-like emitters that eliminates the need for calibration data or explicit knowledge of optical system parameters. Our model is trained on a diverse, numerically simulated dataset encompassing a broad range of imaging conditions, enabling robust generalization across different optical setups. Once trained, it reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single resolution-limited camera frame with superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to conventional methods. We experimentally validate our approach using a custom-built microscopy setup with ground truth emitter positions and demonstrate its versatility on astronomical and single-molecule localization microscopy datasets, achieving unprecedented resolution without prior information. Our findings establish a pathway toward universal, calibration-free super-resolution imaging, expanding its applicability across scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Singleshot Multispectral Imaging via a Chromatic Metalens Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real time, singleshot multispectral imaging systems are crucial for environment monitoring and biomedical imaging. Most singleshot multispectral imagers rely on complex computational backends, which precludes real time operations. In this work, we leverage the spectral selectivity afforded by engineered photonic materials to perform bulk of the multispectral data extraction in the optical domain, thereby circumventing the need for heavy backend computation. We use our imager to extract multispectral data for two real world objects at 8 predefined spectral channels in the 400 to 900 nm wavelength range. For both objects, an RGB image constructed using extracted multispectral data shows good agreement with an image taken using a phone camera, thereby validating our imaging approach. We believe that the proposed system can provide new avenues for the development of highly compact and low latency multispectral imaging technologies.</description>

      <title>A Higher-Order Poincar\'e Ellipsoid representation for elliptical vector beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higher-Order Poincar\'e Sphere (HOPS) provides a powerful geometrical tool for representing vector beams as points on the surface of a unitary sphere. Since a particular position on the surface represents any spatial mode regardless of its shape, this representation cannot be used to discern between the spatial modes geometries of vector modes. For instance, Laguerre- and Ince-Gauss vector beams are ambiguously represented using the same unitary sphere, even though their spatial profiles are circular and elliptical, respectively. As such, in this manuscript, we propose a generalisation of the HOPS that we call the Higher-Order Poincar\'e Ellipsoid (HOPE). Our approach allows an unambiguous representation of helical Ince-Gauss vector modes of ellipticity $\varepsilon$ onto the surface of an ellipsoid of eccentricity $\bf e$, providing a unique way to visualise elliptically-shaped vector modes. We provide a transformation that links the ellipticity $\varepsilon$ of helical Ince-Gauss vector modes to the eccentricity $\bf e$ of an ellipsoid, such that the HOPS is recovered for $\varepsilon=0$. Since this representation preserves the Stokes parameters formalism, the transition from the HOPS to the HOPE is straightforward, thus making its implementation appealing for the structured light community. We anticipate the concepts outlined here will pave the path toward the representation of structured light beams' properties using other geometrical objects.</description>

      <title>Parallel spatial photonic Ising machine using spatial multiplexing for accelerating combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spatial photonic Ising machine (SPIM) handles large-scale combinatorial optimization problems owing to optical processing with spatial parallelism. However, iterative feedback in the search for optimal solutions limits processing speed even though the Ising Hamiltonian is computed optically. We propose a parallel spatial photonic Ising machine (pSPIM) utilizing spatial multiplexing to search for an optimal solution efficiently. By employing grating patterns and encoding multiple sets of Ising spins in a phase distribution, several Ising Hamiltonians are computed simultaneously. We demonstrated that Max-Cut problems requiring 100 Ising spins are solved faster as the number of processing units increases. In addition, combining the multicomponent model with parallel processing allows for efficient searching for optimal solutions to problems represented by using interaction matrixes with a rank greater than one. The pSPIM achieves high-speed searching of optimal solutions of large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Resolving Rydberg-Electron Recapture Dynamics via Laser-driven Frustrated Tunneling Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing two-color counter-rotating circularly polarized laser fields, we investigate the dynamics of electron recapture into Rydberg states under strong, ultrashort laser pulses, probed via coherent extreme-ultraviolet free-induction decay (XFID). Our study reveals significant distinctions between XFID and above-threshold high-order harmonic generation in terms of their ellipticity dependence on the driving-laser waveforms, yield variations with the laser-intensity ratios, and sensitivity to the driving-laser ellipticity. All these differences arise from the fundamentally distinct electron trajectories underlying the two processes. More importantly, our findings provide compelling evidence that Rydberg-electron recapture predominantly occurs at the end of the driving laser field, offering the first direct experimental confirmation of this long-proposed mechanism.</description>

      <title>A General Expression for Homogeneous Metasurface Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general approach in metasurface design is to find the unit-cell properties required to achieve a given functionality. This is usually done by modeling the metasurface as a combination of surface electric and magnetic polarization densities, whose parameters are determined by solving the generalized sheet transition conditions. This is a time consuming task, as the so-called boundary conditions needs to be solved per-case basis, depending on the source polarization, angle of incidence, and intended functionality. Evermore, the task complexity increases as factors such as different media around the metasurface and more than one illumination scenario are taken into account. In this work, we provide a general solution for a uniform metasurface homogenized in terms of susceptibilities. With this model, it is possible to obtain analytical expressions for the specular scattering produced by a metasurface illuminated with arbitrary illumination and angle of incidence. It is expected that the proposed model can ease the analysis and design of metasurfaces, by providing straight-forward expressions which can be simplified by exploiting the unit-cell symmetries.</description>

      <title>Light-Emitting Microfibers from Lotus Root for Eco-friendly Optical Waveguides and Biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical biosensors based on micro-/nano-fibers are highly valuable for probing and monitoring liquid environments and bioactivity. Most of current optical biosensors, however, are still based on glass, semiconductors, or metallic materials, which might be not fully suited for biologically-relevant environments. Here, we introduce biocompatible and flexible microfibers from Lotus silk as micro-environmental monitors that exhibit waveguiding of intrinsic fluorescence as well as of coupled light. These features make single-filament monitors excellent building blocks for a variety of sensing functions, including pH-probing and detection of bacterial activity. These results pave the way for the development of new and entirely eco-friendly, potentially multiplexed biosensing platforms.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform programmable photonic waveguide meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable integrated photonics has emerged as a powerful platform for implementing diverse optical functions on a single chip through software-driven reconfiguration. At the core of these processors, photonic waveguide meshes enable flexible light routing and manipulation. However, recirculating waveguide meshes are fundamentally limited by the fixed dimensions of their unit cells, constraining their spectral and temporal resolution. These limitations hinder broadband signal processing and high-precision delay-line applications. Here, we introduce the concept of non-uniform programmable waveguide meshes by incorporating defect cells into an otherwise uniform hexagonal architecture. These defect cells preserve an external hexagonal perimeter for seamless integration while embedding smaller internal subcells that modify the spectral response via the Vernier effect. By coupling cells with different optical path lengths, we achieve a free spectral range multiplication of up to tenfold, reaching 133 GHz-surpassing the capabilities of conventional silicon ring resonators. Additionally, we demonstrate a dramatic reduction in sampling times from 75 ps to 7.5 ps, enabling ultra-fast optical signal processing and high-precision delay tuning. This approach unlocks new degrees of freedom in programmable photonic circuits, offering enhanced spectral and temporal tunability. Beyond broadband signal processing, it paves the way for advanced applications in topological photonics, quantum information processing, and high-speed optical computing.</description>

      <title>Spatial mapping of intrinsic and readout nonlinearities in a strongly-driven micromechanical membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it was shown that strongly driven micromechanical resonators show mode shapes that strongly differ from the eigenmodes. This raises the question of the origin of this nonlinear behavior. We measure the spatial dependence of the nonlinearities of high-stress micromechanical membranes. The mechanical nonlinearity is determined from the frequency response and is found to be independent of the probing location. It is the phase of the response that is instrumental in extracting that intrinsic nonlinearity. Our interferometric readout results in high-harmonics generation. These harmonics have a clear spatial profile that shows ring-like patterns resembling previous reports. These patterns are reproduced by a model of the displacement-dependent reflection signal in combination with motion amplitudes of the same order as the probing wavelength.</description>

      <title>Universal neighborhood topology and geometry of exceptional points in physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) occurring in non-Hermitian systems at certain physical parameters are intensively studied in many areas of physics, including diffraction optics, lasers, atomic and polaritonic condensates, often in the context of sensing. Recent discoveries of EPs in nonlinear systems open the door for an even larger parameter space, raising the question of whether the geometric structure of EPs is universal and independent of the physical model. We show that this is the case for nonlinear perturbations of an isolated 2nd-order linear EP which becomes the organizing point of a universal elementary catastrophe (elliptic umbilic). This clarifies not only the neighborhood's topology but also its geometric shape (cone with quasi-deltoid cross section). Thus, the position and characteristics of EPs can be predicted in nonlinear non-Hermitian parameter space; e.g., at a 2nd-order linear EP four nonlinear eigenvectors coalesce. These fundamental insights on universal topological structures and phase boundaries accompanying EPs in nonlinear physical systems will pave the way for the purposeful design of such systems with novel functionalities and control possibilities.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Imaging Meets Adaptive Neural Dropout: An Advancing Method for Transparent Object Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label-free tomographic microscopy offers a compelling means to visualize three-dimensional (3D) refractive index (RI) distributions from two-dimensional (2D) intensity measurements. However, limited forward-model accuracy and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem hamper artifact-free reconstructions. Meanwhile, artificial neural networks excel at modeling nonlinearities. Here, we employ a Differentiable Imaging framework that represents the 3D sample as a multi-layer neural network embedding physical constraints of light propagation. Building on this formulation, we propose a physics-guided Adaptive Dropout Neural Network (ADNN) for optical diffraction tomography (ODT), focusing on network topology and voxel-wise RI fidelity rather than solely on input-output mappings. By exploiting prior knowledge of the sample's RI, the ADNN adaptively drops and reactivates neurons, enhancing reconstruction accuracy and stability. We validate this method with extensive simulations and experiments on weakly and multiple-scattering samples under different imaging setups. The ADNN significantly improves quantitative 3D RI reconstructions, providing superior optical-sectioning and effectively suppressing artifacts. Experimental results show that the ADNN reduces the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by a factor of 3 to 5 and increases the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM) by about 4 to 30 times compared to the state-of-the-art approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a computational inverse design method for optimizing broadband-absorbing metasurfaces made of arbitrary dispersive media. Our figure of merit is the time-averaged instantaneous power dissipation in a single unit cell within a periodic array. Its time-domain formulation allows capturing the response of arbitrary dispersive media over any desired spectral range. Employing the time-domain adjoint method within a topology optimization framework enables the design of complex metasurface structures exhibiting unprecedented broadband absorption. We applied the method to a thin-film Silicon-on-insulator configuration and explored the impact of structural and (time-domain inherent) excitation parameters on performance over the visible-ultraviolet. Since our incorporated material model can represent any linear material, the method can also be applied to other all-dielectric, plasmonic, or hybrid configurations.</description>

      <title>Measurements of extreme first passage times in photon transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon transport through turbid media has typically been modeled through diffusion or telegraph equations. These models describe behavior of the average, or typical, photon with remarkable accuracy, however, we show here that they fail to capture the Extreme First Passage Times (EFPTs) of photon transport. By sending ultra-fast bursts of photons through a scattering medium and timing the arrival of the first passage photon, we measure the distribution of these EFPTs of photons in a random environment. Our measured EFPTs differ from those predicted by both the diffusion approximation and telegraph equation. Instead, we observe the EFPT as the time expected for light to travel through an index-averaged medium. These results reveal flaws in both models and invite a re-examining of their underlying assumptions.</description>

      <title>Nontrapping Tunable Topological Photonic Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel topological photonic memory that encodes information through dynamically controllable Chern numbers in a two-band topological photonic system. Utilizing a honeycomb lattice photonic crystal, the memory leverages topologically protected edge states that remain robust against fabrication imperfections and environmental perturbations. By applying a synthetic time-dependent magnetic field, we achieve real-time tunability of the Chern number, enabling rapid and efficient memory switching without the need for light-trapping mechanisms. Our computational study evaluates critical performance metrics, including write speed, read stabilization time, energy gap stability, and nonadiabatic transition probabilities. The results demonstrate that the system supports GHz-range write speeds (approximately 1-10 GHz), with stable data retention due to the large energy gap between bands. The system enables scalable multi-bit memory encoding based on quantized Chern numbers and exhibits superior speed, fault tolerance, and robustness compared to conventional photonic memory architectures.

      <title>Programmable interferometer: an application in quantum channels</title>

Abstract: Quantum optics plays a crucial role in developing quantum computers on different platforms. In photonics, precise control over light's degrees of freedom, including discrete variables (polarization, photon number, orbital angular momentum) and continuous variables (phase, amplitude quadratures, frequency), is fundamental. Our model manipulates photonic systems to encode and process quantum information via the photon's spatial degree of freedom, employing polarization as an auxiliary qubit. We propose a programmable photonic circuit that simulates quantum channels, including phase-damping, amplitude-damping, and bit-flip channels, through adjustable interferometric parameters. Furthermore, the interferometer extends to complex channels, such as the squeezed generalized amplitude damping. This work contributes to advancing quantum simulation techniques and serves as a foundation for exploring quantum computing applications, while highlighting pathways for their practical implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From biology and astronomy to quantum optics, there is a critical need for high frame rate, high quantum efficiency imaging. In practice, most cameras only satisfy one of these requirements. Here we introduce interlaced fast kinetics imaging, a technique that allows burst video acquisition at frame rates up to 3.33 Mfps using a commercial EMCCD camera with single-photon sensitivity. This approach leverages EMCCD's intrinsic fast row transfer dynamics by introducing a tilted lens array into the imaging path, creating a spatially distributed grid of exposed pixels, each aligned to its own column of the sensor. The remaining unexposed pixels serve as in-situ storage registers, allowing subsequent frames to be captured after just one row shift operation. Our interlaced fast kinetics camera maintains 50% contrast for square wave intensity modulation frequencies up to 1.61 MHz. We provide benchmarks of the video performance by capturing two dimensional videos of spatially evolving patterns that repeat every 2$\mu$s, with spatial resolution of 11$\times$15 pixels. Our approach is compatible with commercial EMCCDs and opens a new route to ultra-fast imaging at single-photon sensitivity with applications from fast fluorescence imaging to photon correlation measurement.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive positions of exceptional points in open chiral systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points are remarkable features of open quantum systems, such as photo-ionizing or photo-dissociating molecules, amplified or dissipated light states in photonic structures, and many others. These points mark spectral degeneracies in a system's parameter space where the eigenstates become non-orthogonal, enabling precise control over decay rates, topological transitions in parity-time (PT)-symmetric systems, or boosting the system's sensitivity to external stimuli. Here we show that exceptional points can be enantiosenstive, enabling a new type of control over topological and chiral properties of non-Hermitian open chiral systems. We apply the concept of enantio-sensitive exceptional points to demonstrate a broad range of phenomena, from enantiosensitive topological population transfer, to lifetime branching in resonant photo-decay of chiral molecules, to enhanced chiral sensing in optical fibers. Our results combine high enantiosensitivity with topological robustness in chiral discrimination and separation, paving the way for new approaches in the control of non-Hermitian and chiral phenomena.</description>

      <title>Microwave sink using plasma based localized surface plasmons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overcoming the diffraction limit, meaning focusing waves on a sub-wavelength scale, has received considerable attention for applications involving light and acoustics. Indeed, the intense focusing achieved enhances the interactions between waves and matter, and the improved spatial resolution opens up possibilities in fields such as imaging, detection and communication. In optics, a passive sink may be obtained if the incident light couples to localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonances, resulting in Coherent Perfect Absorption condition. The presence of optical surface plasmons at metal interfaces is due to the angular frequency of metals, which lies in the optical regime due to their high density of free electrons. Plasmas, which consists of ionized gazes with a lower electron density, can support surface plasmons in the microwave regime. Hence, we demonstrate in this paper that sub-wavelength plasmas behave as a passive microwave sink by exciting LSP resonance inside the plasma.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel application of the Flexible Foil Mesh Generation (FFMG) method to model the $3D$ Focal Body generated by a spherical mirror collecting light from an infinitely distant source on its optical axis. The study addresses the challenge of accurately representing highly concave structures formed by the focusing effect. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the FFMG method in capturing the intricate geometry of the Focal Body, with implications for computational geometry, $3D$ reconstruction, and optical system modeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) model with Kerr-type on-site nonlinearity, where the nearest-neighbor coupling constants take two different values ordered in a three-periodic sequence. The existence of localized edge states in the linear limit (Su-Schrieffer-Heeger trimer, SSH3) is known to depend on the precise location of the edge. Here, we show that for a termination that does not support linear edge states, an arbitrarily weak on-site nonlinearity will induce an edge mode with asymptotic exponential localization, bifurcating from a linear band edge. Close to the gap edge, the shape of the mode can be analytically described in a continuum approximation as one half of a standard gap soliton. The linear stability properties of nonlinear edge modes are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Power-law fluctuations near critical point in semiconductor lasers with delayed feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.05667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the analogy between laser oscillation and second-order phase transition was indicated in the 1970s, dynamical fluctuations on lasing threshold inherent in critical phenomena have gained significant interest. Here, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate that a semiconductor laser subject to delayed optical feedback can exhibit unusual large intensity fluctuations characterized by power-law distributions. Such an intensity fluctuation consists of distinct intermittent bursts of light intensity, whose peak values attain tens of times the intensity of the maximum gain mode. This burst behavior emerges when a laser with a long time delay (over 100 ns) and an optimal feedback strength operates around the lasing threshold. The intensity and waiting time statistics follow power-law-like distributions. This implies the emergence of nonequilibrium critical phenomena, namely self-organized criticality. In addition to numerical results, we report experimental results that suggest the power-law intensity dynamics in a semiconductor laser with delayed feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperative optical effects are enabled and controlled by interactions between molecular dipoles, meaning that their mutual orientation is of paramount importance to, for example, superabsorbing light-harvesting antennas. Here we show how to move beyond the possibilities of simple geometric tailoring, demonstrating how a metallic sphere placed within a ring of parallel dipoles engineers an effective Hamiltonian that generates "guide-sliding" states within the ring system. This allows steady-state superabsorption in noisy room temperature environments, outperforming previous designs while being significantly simpler to implement.
  As exemplified by this showcase, our approach represents a powerful design paradigm for tailoring cooperative light-matter effects in molecular structures that extends beyond superabsorbing systems, to a huge array of quantum energy transport systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the change in transverse orbital angular momentum (tOAM) per photon, delta L_y, applied to an optical pulse by a pure amplitude perturbation. The results are in excellent agreement with calculations and simulations of the spatiotemporal torque based on our tOAM theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)]. The crucial factor in determining delta L_y is the spatiotemporal distribution of tOAM density in the pulse. We show that even Gaussian pulses with zero total tOAM can have net tOAM induced by an amplitude perturbation stationary in the lab frame. As a prelude to the paper, we review and clarify several recent theoretical approaches to tOAM and reemphasize several fundamental principles needed for the correct analysis of experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>Compact 780 nm Rb Optical Clock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrated a compact 780 nm rubidium optical clock, which includes an optical frequency standard and an optical frequency comb, with an optical volume of 11.6 liters. Unlike the 778 nm rubidium atomic clocks based on two-photon transition, here, the laser frequency is stabilized to the Rb D2 transition, using modulation transfer spectroscopy. This approach effectively eliminates Doppler background and provides a high signal to noise ratio and high sensitivity. A nearly 300 MHz microwave signal, whose phase exactly tracks that of the optical frequency standard, is generated via the optical frequency comb, yielding a frequency instability of 1.91 E-13 @1 s and 5.29 E-14 @1000 s in the electronic domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most precise frequency stabilization result for the first-excited-state transition of alkali metal atoms to date and represents the first optical clock based on this transition. These results offer a promising approach for the development of portable optical clocks.</description>

      <title>SMILE: a universal tool for modulated-enhanced localization microscopy to achieve minimal three-dimensional resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modulation-enhanced localization microscopy (MELM) has demonstrated significant improvements in both lateral and axial localization precision compared to conventional single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). However, lateral modulated illumination based MELM (MELMxy) remains fundamentally limited to two-dimensional imaging. Here we present three-dimensional Single-Molecule Modulated Illumination Localization Estimator (SMILE) that synergistically integrates lateral illumination modulation with point spread function engineering. By simultaneously exploiting lateral modulation patterns and an accurate point spread function (PSF) model for 3D localization, SMILE achieves near-theoretical-minimum localization uncertainty, demonstrating an average 4-fold enhancement in lateral precision compared to conventional 3D-SMLM. Crucially, SMILE exhibits exceptional compatibility with diverse PSFs and different illumination patterns with various structures including 4Pi configurations, making it a versatile tool that can be easily adapted for different experimental setups. When integrated with 4Pi microscopy, 4Pi-SMILE shows particular promise for achieving sub-10 nm axial resolution and approaching isotropic resolution. From the simulations and proof-of-concept experiments, we verified the superiority of SMILE over 3D-SMLM and ordinary MELM. We highlight SMILE as a novel methodology and robust framework that holds great potential to significantly promote the development of MELM.</description>

Abstract: Time-domain interferometry is an important principle in Fourier transform (FT) and nonlinear femto- to attosecond spectroscopy. To optimize the resolution and sensitivity of this approach, various interferometer stabilization schemes have been developed. Among them, acousto-optical phase modulation (AOPM) of the interferometer arms combined with phase-synchronous lock-in detection has proven as a particular sensitive technique. However, the acousto-optical modulators (AOMs), required for this technique, introduce several disadvantages. Here, we demonstrate an alternative phase modulation scheme which omits AOMs, termed PM scheme here. As a benchmark, we directly compare the performance between the PM and the AOPM scheme in a linear FT spectroscopy experiment and find comparable sensitivity in both approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) is a widely used technique for enhancing the resolution of fluorescence imaging beyond the diffraction limit. Most existing SR-SIM methods rely on Moir\'e effect-based physical imaging models, which require the estimation of structured illumination parameters during image reconstruction. However, parameter estimation is prone to errors, often leading to artifacts in the reconstructed images. To address these limitations, we propose super-resolution confocal structured illumination microscopy (SR-CSIM). The physical model of SR-CSIM is based on confocal imaging principles, eliminating the need for structured illumination parameter estimation. We construct the SR-CSIM imaging theory. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that SR-CSIM achieves a resolution comparable to that of SR-SIM while reducing artifacts. This advancement has the potential to broaden the applicability of SIM, providing researchers with a more robust and versatile imaging tool.</description>

Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. We introduce a transformation method that allows us to obtain an analytical expression of the leading-order correction drive for engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space. We also provide a numerically efficient procedure to calculate high-order correction drives and apply it to engineer the target Hamiltonian with degenerate eigenstates of multi-component cat states that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary photonic environments using FDTD: beyond the semi-classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm that integrates quantum two-level systems (TLSs) into the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework for simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary 3D photonic environments. Conventional methods struggle with these systems due to their semi-classical nature and spurious self-interactions that arise when a TLS is driven by its own radiation field. We address these issues by determining the correct electric field for driving the TLS, as well as the current source used in FDTD for modeling photon emission. Our method, focusing on single-excitation states, employs a total field-incident field (TF-IF) technique to eliminate self-interactions, enabling precise simulations of photon emission and scattering. The algorithm also successfully models complex phenomena such as resonant energy transfer, superradiance, and vacuum Rabi splitting. This powerful computational tool is expected to substantially advance research in nanophotonics, quantum physics, and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Common techniques for measuring refractive indices, such as ellipsometry and goniometry, are ineffective for van der Waals crystal flakes because of their high anisotropy and small, micron-scale, lateral size. To address this, we employ near-field optical microscopy to analyze the guided optical modes within these crystals. By probing these modes in MoS$_2$ flakes with subwavelength spatial resolution at a wavelength of $1570\,\mathrm{nm}$, we determine both the in-plane and out-of-plane permittivity components of MoS$_2$ as $16.11$ and $6.25$, respectively, with a relative uncertainty below $1\%$, while overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Strong-Field-Assisted X-ray Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate x-ray second harmonic generation (SHG) with strong-field-driven high harmonic generation (HHG) from core electrons in gas-phase atoms, highlighting its potential as a powerful spectroscopic tool for studying atomic and molecular systems. Our simulations confirm the generation of HHG with x-ray SHG (HHG-XSHG) from atomic core electrons through the rescattering of electrons from x-ray two-photon excitation and subsequent tunneling ionization in an optical laser field. The resulting HHG-XSHG spectrum features a broadband multi-peak structure and a distinct spectral cutoff in the x-ray regime. These findings indicate that HHG-XSHG is a valuable technique for probing core-electron dynamics, generating attosecond x-ray pulses, and exploring nonlinear interactions, effectively merging laser-driven attosecond technology with nonlinear x-ray methodologies provided by x-ray free-electron lasers.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of Fluorescence Lifetime Measurements using Time-Frequency Correlated Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The investigation of fluorescence lifetime became an important tool in biology and medical science. So far, established methods of fluorescence lifetime measurements require the illumination of the investigated probes with pulsed or amplitude-modulated light. In this paper, we examine the limitations of an innovative method of fluorescence lifetime using the strong time-frequency correlation of entangled photons generated by a continuous-wave source. For this purpose, we investigate the lifetime of IR-140 to demonstrate the functional principle and its dependencies on different experimental parameters. We also compare this technique with state-of-the-art FLIM and observed an improved figure-of-merit. Finally, we discuss the potential of a quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical electro-optic and piezo-electric nonlinearities</title>

Abstract: Electro-optics, the tuning of optical properties of materials with electric fields, is key to a multitude of quantum and classical photonics applications. However, a major obstacle preventing many emerging use cases is inefficient modulation in cryogenic environments, as traditional tuning mechanisms degrade at low temperatures. Guided by the connection between phase transitions and nonlinearity, we identify the quantum paraelectric perovskite SrTiO$_3$ (STO) as the strongest cryogenic electro-optic photonic material. As a result of the unique quantum paraelectric phase of STO, we demonstrate a dynamically tunable linear Pockels coefficient ($r_{33}$) exceeding 500 pm/V at $T=5$ K, and study its full temperature and bias dependence. We also measure an enhanced piezo-electric coefficient ($d_{33}$) above 90 pC/N. Both of these coefficients exceed all previously reported values for cryogenic materials, including lithium niobate ($r_{33}\approx24$ pm/V) and barium titanate ($r_{42}\approx170$ pm/V). Furthermore, by tuning STO towards \textit{quantum criticality} with oxygen isotope substitution we more than double the optical and piezo-electric nonlinearities, demonstrating a linear Pockels coefficient above 1100 pm/V. Our results probe the link between quantum phase transitions, dielectric susceptibility, and optical nonlinearities, unlocking opportunities in cryogenic optical and mechanical systems, and provide a framework for discovering new nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confirm the existence of the spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) polariton and the value of its tOAM, verifying our theory of transverse orbital angular momentum in a simple dispersive medium [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 193901 (2021)]. We also develop a physical picture of the polariton as a structure driven by torques induced by the ponderomotive force of the light in the presence of material dispersion. This is a new type of spatiotemporal torque unanticipated in our recent work [S. W. Hancock et al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 011031 (2024)]. These results are accomplished by high resolution particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of STOV pulse reflection from and transmission through a fully ionized hydrogen plasma slab. The linear theory matches the PIC simulations up to near-critical plasma densities and near-relativistic field strengths. For higher intensities, optical tOAM becomes invested in collective modes of the plasma.</description>

      <title>Resonant Energy Transfer and Collectively Driven Emitters in Waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) has opened a new frontier in quantum optics, which enables the radiative coupling of distantly located emitters via the spatially extended waveguide mode. This coupling leads to modified emission dynamics and previous work has reported the observation of increased intensity correlations (an antidip) when probing the resonance response of multiple emitters. However, the interference between independent emitters has been shown to lead to a similar response. Here, we directly observe resonant energy transfer between two distant quantum emitters by recording an antidip in the intensity correlations, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, while driving only one of the emitters. Under the condition that only a single emitter is driven, the antidip in photon coincidences is a distinctive signature of emitter-emitter coupling, which enables the transfer of energy from the driven to the undriven emitter. Interestingly, the observed mechanism is a long-range and waveguide-engineered version of resonant F\"orster transfer, which is responsible for the transport of energy between chlorophylls in the photosynthesis. Building on the established coupling, we demonstrate collective driving of the coupled emitter pair. Specifically, we control the relative driving phase and amplitude of the emitters and apply this collective excitation scheme to selectively populate the long-lived subradiant state. This results in suppressed emission, i.e. the peculiar situation where driving two emitters as opposed to one effectively reduces the probability of photon emission. Our work presents novel emission regimes and excitation schemes for a multi-emitter waveguide QED system. These can be exploited to deterministically generate emitter-emitter entanglement and advanced photonic states providing robustness against losses for photonic quantum computation and quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Distributed acoustic sensing for ocean applications</title>

Abstract: Extensive monitoring of acoustic activities is important for many fields, including biology, security, oceanography, and Earth science. Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is an evolving technique for continuous, wide-coverage measurements of mechanical vibrations, which is suited to ocean applications. DAS illuminates an optical fiber with laser pulses and measures the backscattered wave due to small random variations in the refractive index of the material. Specifically, DAS uses coherent optical interferometry to measure the phase difference of the backscattered wave from adjacent locations along the fiber. External stimuli, such as mechanical strain due to acoustic wavefields impinging on the fiber-optic cable, modulate the backscattered wave. Hence, the differential phase measurements of the optical backscatter are proportional to the underlying physical quantities of the surrounding wavefield. Continuous measurement of the backscattered electromagnetic signal provides a distributed sensing modality that extends spatially along the fiber. We provide an overview of DAS technology and detail the underlying physics, from electromagnetic to mechanical and eventually acoustic quantities. We explain the effect of DAS acquisition parameters in signal processing and show the potential of DAS for sound source detection on data collected from the Ocean Observatories Initiative Regional Cabled Array https://doi.org/10.58046/5J60-FJ89.</description>
