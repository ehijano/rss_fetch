      <title>Comment on "Case of thermodynamic failure in the Ginzburg-Landau approach to fluctuation superconductivity"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jorge Berger shows theoretically in the paper Phys. Rev. B 109, 024501 (2024) that according to the Ginzburg-Landau theory the persistent current can create the persistent voltage, i.e. a dc voltage at thermodynamic equilibrium, on segments of nonuniform superconducting loop. A similar result was published early and was collaborated experimentally. The persistent power estimated by Berger is compared with the experimentally observed power. The attention of experimenters is drawn to the possibility to observe the persistent voltage thanks to its increase with the number of identical rings connected in series.</description>

      <title>Diffusion across a concentration step: Strongly nonmonotonic evolution into thermodynamic equilibrium</title>

Abstract: Dynamical and statistical behavior of the ionic particles in dissolved salts have long been known, but their hydration shells still raise unsettled questions. We engineered a ``diffusion tunnel diode" that is structurally analogous to the well-known Esaki diode, but now concentration gradients serve as generalized voltages and the current means particle flow. In an equipartition sense, the hydrated ions enter a cavity as individual particles and later, upon increase of their concentration therein, they lose water molecules that henceforth are particles of their own. These temporarily attached water molecules thus are the tunnel current analogue. Unlike the original tunnel diode, our negative differential resistance has implications for the second law of thermodynamics, due to thermal effects of changes in the hydration shells.</description>

      <title>(Pseudo-)Synthetic BRST quantisation of the bosonic string and the higher quantum origin of dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article I am arguing in favour of the hypothesis that the origin of gauge and string dualities in general can be found in a higher-categorical interpretation of basic quantum mechanics. It is interesting to observe that the Galilei group has a non-trivial cohomology, while the Lorentz/Poincare group has trivial cohomology. When we constructed quantum mechanics, we noticed the non-trivial cohomology structure of the Galilei group and hence, we required for a proper quantisation procedure that would be compatible with the symmetry group of our theory, to go to a central extension of the Galilei group universal covering by co-cycle. This would be the Bargmann group. However, Nature didn't choose this path. Instead in nature, the Galilei group is not realised, while the Lorentz group is. The fact that the Galilei group has topological obstructions leads to a central charge, the mass, and a superselection rule, required to implement the Galilei symmetry, that forbids transitions between states of different mass. The topological structure of the Lorentz group however lacks such an obstruction, and hence allows for transitions between states of different mass. The connectivity structure of the Lorentz group as opposed to that of the Galilei group can be interpreted in the sense of an ER=EPR duality for the topological space associated to group cohomology. In string theory we started with the Witt algebra, and due to similar quantisation issues, we employed the central extension by co-cycle to obtain the Virasoro algebra. This is a unique extension for orientation preserving diffeomorphisms on a circle, but there is no reason to believe that, at the high energy domain in physics where this would apply, we do not have a totally different structure altogether and the degrees of freedom present there would require something vastly more general and global.</description>
