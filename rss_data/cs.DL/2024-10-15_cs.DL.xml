Abstract: Purpose - As national legislation, federated national services, institutional policies and institutional research service arrangements may differ, data stewardship programs may be organized differently in higher education institutions across the world. This work seeks to elaborate the picture of different data stewardship programs running in different institutional and national research environments. Design/methodology/approach - Utilizing a case study design, this study described three distinct data stewardship programs from Purdue University (United States), Delft Technical University (Netherlands) and Aalto University (Finland). In addition, this work investigated the institutional and national research environments of the programs. The focus was on initiatives led by academic libraries or similar services.Findings - This work demonstrates that data stewardship programs may be organized differently within varying national and institutional contexts. The data stewardship programs varied in terms of roles, organization and funding structures. Furthermore, policies and legislation, organizational structures, and national infrastructures differed. Originality - This work broadens the current literature on data stewardship by not only providing detailed descriptions of three distinct data stewardship programs, but also highlighting how research environments may affect their organization. We present a summary of key factors in the organization of data stewardship programs. Research limitations/implications - The data stewardship programs and their contexts develop, and the descriptions presented in this work should be considered as snapshots.</description>
