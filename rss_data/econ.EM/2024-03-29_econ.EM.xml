      <title>Dynamic Correlation of Market Connectivity, Risk Spillover and Abnormal Volatility in Stock Price</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connectivity of stock markets reflects the information efficiency of capital markets and contributes to interior risk contagion and spillover effects. We compare Shanghai Stock Exchange A-shares (SSE A-shares) during tranquil periods, with high leverage periods associated with the 2015 subprime mortgage crisis. We use Pearson correlations of returns, the maximum strongly connected subgraph, and $3\sigma$ principle to iteratively determine the threshold value for building a dynamic correlation network of SSE A-shares. Analyses are carried out based on the networking structure, intra-sector connectivity, and node status, identifying several contributions. First, compared with tranquil periods, the SSE A-shares network experiences a more significant small-world and connective effect during the subprime mortgage crisis and the high leverage period in 2015. Second, the finance, energy and utilities sectors have a stronger intra-industry connectivity than other sectors. Third, HUB nodes drive the growth of the SSE A-shares market during bull periods, while stocks have a think-tail degree distribution in bear periods and show distinct characteristics in terms of market value and finance. Granger linear and non-linear causality networks are also considered for the comparison purpose. Studies on the evolution of inter-cycle connectivity in the SSE A-share market may help investors improve portfolios and develop more robust risk management policies.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Analyses of Contagion Risk and Module Evolution on the SSE A-Shares Market Based on Minimum Information Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactive effect is significant in the Chinese stock market, exacerbating the abnormal market volatilities and risk contagion. Based on daily stock returns in the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) A-shares, this paper divides the period between 2005 and 2018 into eight bull and bear market stages to investigate interactive patterns in the Chinese financial market. We employ the LASSO method to construct the stock network and further use the Map Equation method to analyze the evolution of modules in the SSE A-shares market. Empirical results show: (1) The connected effect is more significant in bear markets than bull markets; (2) A system module can be found in the network during the first four stages, and the industry aggregation effect leads to module differentiation in the last four stages; (3) Some stocks have leading effects on others throughout eight periods, and medium- and small-cap stocks with poor financial conditions are more likely to become risk sources, especially in bear markets. Our conclusions are beneficial to improving investment strategies and making regulatory policies.</description>

      <title>Correcting Attrition Bias using Changes-in-Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12740v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attrition is a common and potentially important threat to internal validity in treatment effect studies. We extend the changes-in-changes approach to identify the average treatment effect for respondents and the entire study population in the presence of attrition. Our method, which exploits baseline outcome data, can be applied to randomized experiments as well as quasi-experimental difference-in-difference designs. A formal comparison highlights that while widely used corrections typically impose restrictions on whether or how response depends on treatment, our proposed attrition correction exploits restrictions on the outcome model. We further show that the conditions required for our correction can accommodate a broad class of response models that depend on treatment in an arbitrary way. We illustrate the implementation of the proposed corrections in an application to a large-scale randomized experiment.</description>
