      <title>Quantitative bordism over acyclic groups and Cheeger-Gromov $\rho$-invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a bordism version of Gromov's linearity conjecture over a large family of acyclic groups. Since all groups embed into these acyclic groups, it follows that the linear bordism conjecture is true if one allows to enlarge a given group. Our result holds in both PL and smooth categories, and for both oriented and unoriented cases. The method of the proof hinges on quantitative algebraic and geometric techniques over infinite complexes with unbounded local (combinatorial) geometry, which seem interesting on their own. As an application, we prove that there is a universal linear bound for the Cheeger-Gromov $L^2$ $\rho$-invariants of PL $(4k-1)$-manifolds associated with arbitrary regular covers.</description>

Abstract: We construct efficient topological cobordisms between torus links and large connected sums of trefoil knots. As an application, we show that the signature invariant $\sigma_\omega$ at $\omega=\zeta_6$ takes essentially minimal values on torus links among all concordance homomorphisms with the same normalisation on the trefoil knot.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K_n$ be a complete graph with $n$ vertices. An embedding of $K_n$ in $S^3$ is called a spatial $K_n$-graph. Knots in a spatial $K_n$-graph corresponding to simple cycles of $K_n$ are said to be constituent knots. We consider the case $n=4$. The boundary of an oriented band surface with zero Seifert form, constructed for a spatial $K_4$, is a four-component associated link. There are obtained relations between normalized Yamada and Jaeger polynomials of spatial graphs and Jones polynomials of constituent knots and the associated link.</description>

      <title>Lifting maps between graphs to embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study conditions for the existence of an embedding $\widetilde{f} \colon P \to Q \times \mathbb{R}$ such that $f = \mathrm{pr}_Q \circ \widetilde{f}$, where $f \colon P \to Q$ is a piecewise linear map between polyhedra. Our focus is on non-degenerate maps between graphs, where non-degeneracy means that the preimages of points are finite sets.
  We introduce combinatorial techniques and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the general case. Using these results, we demonstrate that the problem of the existence of a lifting reduces to testing the satisfiability of a 3-CNF formula. Additionally, we construct a counterexample to a result by V. Po\'{e}naru on lifting of smooth immersions to embeddings.
  Furthermore, by establishing connections between the stated problem and the approximability by embeddings, we deduce that, in the case of generic maps from a tree to a segment, a weaker condition becomes sufficient for the existence of a lifting.</description>

      <title>From the second BNSR invariant to Dehn functions of coabelian subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finitely presented group $G$ and a surjective homomorphism $G\to \mathbb{Z}^n$ with finitely presented kernel $K$, we give an upper bound on the Dehn function of $K$ in terms of an area-radius pair for $G$. As a consequence we obtain that finitely presented coabelian subgroups of hyperbolic groups have polynomially bounded Dehn function. This generalises results of Gersten and Short and our proof can be viewed as a quantified version of results from Renz' thesis on the second BNSR invariant.</description>

      <title>Brieskorn spheres, cyclic group actions and the Milnor conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we further develop the theory of equivariant Seiberg-Witten-Floer cohomology of the two authors, with an emphasis on Brieskorn homology spheres. We obtain the following applications. First, we show that the knot concordance invariants $\theta^{(c)}$ defined by the first author satisfy $\theta^{(c)}(T_{a,b}) = (a-1)(b-1)/2$ for torus knots, whenever $c$ is a prime not dividing $ab$. Since $\theta^{(c)}$ is a lower bound for the slice genus, this gives a new proof of the Milnor conjecture of a similar flavour to the proofs using the Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o $\tau$-invariant or Rasmussen $s$-invariant. Second, we prove that a free cyclic group action on a Brieskorn homology $3$-sphere $Y = \Sigma(a_1 , \dots , a_r)$ does not extend smoothly to any contractible smooth $4$-manifold bounding $Y$. This generalises to arbitrary $r$ the result of Anvari-Hambleton in the case $r=3$. Third, given a finite subgroup of the Seifert circle action on $Y = \Sigma(a_1 , \dots , a_r)$ of prime order $p$ acting non-freely on $Y$, we prove that if the rank of $HF_{red}^+(Y)$ is greater than $p$ times the rank of $HF_{red}^+(Y/\mathbb{Z}_p)$, then the $\mathbb{Z}_p$-action on $Y$ does not extend smoothly to any contractible smooth $4$-manifold bounding $Y$. We also prove a similar non-extension result for equivariant connected sums of Brieskorn homology spheres.</description>

      <title>A structure theorem for homology 4-manifolds with $g_2\leq 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous structural findings of homology manifolds have been derived in various ways in relation to $g_2$-values. The homology $4$-manifolds with $g_2\leq 5$ are characterized combinatorially in this article. It is well-known that all homology $4$-manifolds for $g_2\leq 2$ are polytopal spheres. We demonstrate that homology $4$-manifolds with $g_2\leq 5$ are triangulated spheres and are derived from triangulated 4-spheres with $g_2\leq 2$ by a series of connected sum, bistellar 1- and 2-moves, edge contraction, edge expansion, and edge flipping operations. We establish that the above inequality is optimally attainable, i.e., it cannot be extended to $g_2 = 6$.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic representations of 3-periodic entanglements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diagrams enable the use of various algebraic and geometric tools for analysing and classifying knots. In this paper we introduce a new diagrammatic representation of triply-periodic entangled structures (TP tangles), which are embeddings of simple curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that are invariant under translations along three non-coplanar axes. As such, these entanglements can be seen as lifts of links in the 3-torus $\mathbb{T}^3 = \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$, where two non-isotopic links in $\mathbb{T}^3$ may lift to the same TP tangle. We consider the equivalence of TP tangles in $\mathbb{R}^3$ through the use of diagrams representing links in $\mathbb{T}^3$. These diagrams require additional moves beyond the classical Reidemeister moves, which we define and show that they preserve ambient isotopies of links in $\mathbb{T}^3$. The final definition of a tridiagram of a link in $\mathbb{T}^3$ allows us to then consider additional notions of equivalence that encode global isotopies of a TP tangle, such as a change of basis or lattice in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Closed 4-braids and the Jones unknot conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Jones problem is a question whether there is a non-trivial knot with the trivial Jones polynomial in one variable $q$. The answer to this fundamental question is still unknown despite numerous attempts to explore it. In braid presentation the case of 4-strand braids is already open. S. Bigelow showed in 2000 that if the Burau representation for four-strand braids is unfaithful, then there is an infinite number of non-trivial knots with the trivial two-variable HOMFLY-PT polynomial and hence, with the trivial Jones polynomial, since it is obtained from the HOMFLY-PT polynomial by the specialisation of one of the variables $A=q^2$.
  In this paper, we study four-strand braids and ask whether there are non-trivial knots with the trivial Jones polynomial but a non-trivial HOMFLY-PT polynomial. We have discovered that there is a whole 1-parameter family, parameterised by the writhe number, of 2-variable polynomials that can be HOMFLY-PT polynomials of some knots. We explore various properties of the obtained hypothetical HOMFLY-PT polynomials and suggest several checks to test these formulas. A generalisation is also proposed for the case of a large number of strands.</description>

      <title>Higher incoherence of the automorphism groups of a free group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F_n$ be the free group on $n \geq 2$ generators. We show that for all $1 \leq m \leq 2n-3$ (respectively for all $1 \leq m \leq 2n-4$) there exists a subgroup of $\operatorname{Aut}(F_n)$ (respectively $\operatorname{Out}(F_n)$) which has finiteness of type $F_{m}$ but not of type $FP_{m+1}(\mathbb{Q})$, hence it is not $m$-coherent. In both cases, the new result is the upper bound $m= 2n-3$ (respectively $m = 2n-4$), as it cannot be obtained by embedding direct products of free noncyclic groups, and certifies higher incoherence up to the virtual cohomological dimension and is therefore sharp. As a tool of the proof, we discuss the existence and nature of multiple inequivalent extensions of suitable finite-index subgroups of $\operatorname{Aut}(F_2)$.</description>
