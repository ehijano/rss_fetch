      <title>On the computability of cofinal Fra\"iss\'e limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any collection of finite structures closed under isomorphism (i.e., an age) which has the Hereditary Property (HP), the Joint Embedding Property (JEP), and the Cofinal Amalgamation Property (CAP), there is a unique (up to isomorphism) countable structure which is cofinally ultrahomogeneous with the given age. Such a structure is called the cofinal Fra\"iss\'e limit of the age.
  In this paper, we consider the computational strength needed to construct the cofinal Fra\"iss\'e limit of a computable age. We show that this construction can always be done using the oracle 0''', and that there are ages that require 0''.
  In contrast, we show that if one assumes the strengthening of (CAP) known as the Amalgamation Property (AP), then the resulting limit, called the Fra\"iss\'e limit, can be constructed from the age using 0'. Our results therefore show that the more general case of cofinal Fra\"iss\'e limits requires greater computational strength than Fra\"iss\'e limits.</description>

      <title>Maximal Prikry Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the covering machinery of the Mitchell-Steel core model $K$, under the hypothesis that there is no inner model with a Woodin cardinal. In an earlier work, Mitchell and the first author showed that if $\nu&gt;\omega_2$ is a regular cardinal in $K$ but a singular ordinal in $V$, then $\nu$ is a measurable cardinal in $K$. In this article, we further show that under certain circumstances, there exists a maximal Prikry sequence $C$ for a measure on $\nu$ in $K$. The first author shows that the anti-large cardinal hypothesis is necessary. In a more restrictive setting, we prove that every subset of $\nu$ with size $&lt;|\nu|$ can be covered by a set in $K[C]$ with size $&lt;|\nu|$. Benhemou and the first author show that the result is optimal.</description>

      <title>Some notes on plump ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this exposition, we attempt to formalise a treatment of Paul Taylor's notion of plump ordinals in weak intuitionistic axiomatic set theories such as IKP. We will explore basic properties of plump ordinals, especially in relation to G\"odel's constructible universe $L$ and incomparable codings. As a quick application, we explain at the end how plump ordinals can be used to build a Heyting-valued model $V^\mathbb{H}$ from a classical $V \vDash \mathrm{ZFC}$ such that for some arbitrary, fixed $x \in V$ we have $V^\mathbb{H} \vDash \mathcal{P}{\left(\check{x}\right)} \in L$.</description>

      <title>Class choice and the surprising weakness of Kelley-Morse set theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kelley-Morse set theory KM is weaker than generally supposed and fails to prove several principles that may be desirable in a foundational second-order set theory. Even though KM includes the global choice principle, for example, (i) KM does not prove the class choice scheme, asserting that whenever every set $x$ admits a class $X$ with $\varphi(x,X)$, then there is a class $Z\subseteq V\times V$ for which $\varphi(x,Z_x)$ on every section. This scheme can fail with KM even in low-complexity first-order instances $\varphi$ and even when only a set of indices $x$ are relevant. For closely related reasons, (ii) the theory KM does not prove the {\L}o\'s theorem scheme for internal second-order ultrapowers, even for large cardinal ultrapowers, such as the ultrapower by a normal measure on a measurable cardinal. Indeed, the theory KM itself is not generally preserved by internal ultrapowers. Finally, (iii) KM does not prove that the $\Sigma^1_n$ logical complexity is invariant under first-order quantifiers, even bounded first-order quantifiers. For example, $\forall \alpha{&lt;}\delta\ \psi(\alpha,X)$ is not always provably equivalent to a $\Sigma^1_1$ assertion when $\psi$ is. Nevertheless, these various weaknesses in KM are addressed by augmenting it with the class choice scheme, thereby forming the theory KM+, which we propose as a robust KM alternative for the foundations of second-order set theory.</description>

      <title>Proof Complexity of Linear Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proving proof-size lower bounds for $\mathbf{LK}$, the sequent calculus for classical propositional logic, remains a major open problem in proof complexity. We shed new light on this challenge by isolating the power of structural rules, showing that their combination is extremely stronger than any single rule alone. We establish exponential (resp. sub-exponential) proof-size lower bounds for $\mathbf{LK}$ without contraction (resp. weakening) for formulas with short $\mathbf{LK}$-proofs. Concretely, we work with the Full Lambek calculus with exchange, $\mathbf{FL_e}$, and its contraction-extended variant, $\mathbf{FL_{ec}}$, substructural systems underlying linear logic. We construct families of $\mathbf{FL_e}$-provable (resp. $\mathbf{FL_{ec}}$-provable) formulas that require exponential-size (resp. sub-exponential-size) proofs in affine linear logic $\mathbf{ALL}$ (resp. relevant linear logic $\mathbf{RLL}$), but admit polynomial-size proofs once contraction (resp. weakening) is restored. This yields exponential lower bounds on proof-size of $\mathbf{FL_e}$-provable formulas in $\mathbf{ALL}$ and hence for $\mathbf{MALL}$, $\mathbf{AMALL}$, and full classical linear logic $\mathbf{CLL}$. Finally, we exhibit formulas with polynomial-size $\mathbf{FL_e}$-proofs that nevertheless require exponential-size proofs in cut-free $\mathbf{LK}$, establishing exponential speed-ups between various linear calculi and their cut-free counterparts.</description>

      <title>On classification of continuous first order theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give several new characterizations of $IP$ (the independence property) and $SOP$ (the strict order property) for continuous first order logic and study their relations to the function theory and the Banach space theory. We suggest new dividing lines of unstable theories by the study of subclasses of Baire-1 functions and argue why one should not expect a perfect analog of Shelah's theorem, namely a theory is unstable iff it has $IP$ or $SOP$, for real-valued logics, especially for continuous logic.</description>

      <title>Imaginaries, products and the adele ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the imaginary sorts of infinite products in terms of imaginary sorts of the factors. We extend the result to certain reduced powers and then to infinite products $\prod_{i\in I} M_i$ enriched with a predicate for the ideal of finite subsets of $I$. As a special case, using the Hils-Rideau-Kikuchi uniform $p$-adic elimination of imaginaries, we find the imaginary sorts of the ring of rational adeles. Our methods include the use of the Harrington-Kechris-Louveau Glimm-Efros dichotomy both for transitioning from monadic second order imaginaries to first-order reducts, and for proving a certain ``one-way'' model-theoretic orthogonality within the adelic imaginaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main motivation for this article is to explore the connections between the existence of certain combinatorial patterns (as in van der Corputs's theorem on arithmetic progressions of length $3$) with well-known tools and theorems for definable groups in simple theories. In the last sections of this article, we apply our model-theoretic results to bound the number of initial points starting few arithmetic progression of length $3$ in the structure of the additive group of integers with a predicate for the prime integers, assuming Dickson's conjecture, or with a predicate for the square-free integers, as well as for asymptotic limits of finite fields. Our techniques yield similar results for the elements appearing as distances in skew-corners and for S\'ark\"ozy's theorem on the distance of distinct elements being perfect squares.</description>

      <title>Carryless Pairing: Additive Pairing in the Fibonacci Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10382v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a pairing map $\pi : \mathbb{N}^2\to\mathbb{N}$ that encodes $x$ and $y$ into disjoint index bands inside the Zeckendorf support of a single integer. Evaluation and inversion use only addition, comparison, and bounded scans of supports; no multiplication, factorization, or digit interleaving is used. The device is carryless by construction: supports remain non-adjacent, so the output is already in Zeckendorf-normal form. The map is injective but not surjective; membership in its image is decidable by the same support machinery used for decoding. The core claims are mechanized in Rocq.</description>

      <title>Positively closed $Sh(B)$-valued models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study positively closed and strongly positively closed topos-valued models of coherent theories. Positively closed is a global notion (it is defined in terms of all possible outgoing homomorphisms), while strongly positively closed is a local notion (it only concerns the definable sets inside the model). For $\mathbf{Set}$-valued models of coherent theories they coincide.
  We prove that if $\mathcal{E}=Sh(B,\tau _{coh})$ for a complete Boolean algebra, then positively closed but not strongly positively closed $\mathcal{E}$-valued models of coherent theories exist, yet, there is an alternative local property which characterizes positively closed $\mathcal{E}$-valued models.
  A large part of our discussion is given in the context of infinite quantifier geometric logic, dealing with the fragment $L^g_{\kappa \kappa }$ where $\kappa $ is weakly compact.</description>

      <title>Zarankiewicz bounds from distal regularity lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since K\H{o}v\'ari, S\'os, and Tur\'an proved upper bounds for the Zarankiewicz problem in 1954, much work has been undertaken to improve these bounds, and some have done so by restricting to particular classes of graphs. In 2017, Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl proved better bounds for semialgebraic binary relations, and this work was extended by Do in the following year to arbitrary semialgebraic relations. In this paper, we show that Zarankiewicz bounds in the shape of Do's are enjoyed by all relations satisfying the distal regularity lemma, an improved version of the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma satisfied by relations definable in distal structures (a vast generalisation of o-minimal structures).</description>
