      <title>Demonstrating Data-to-Knowledge Pipelines for Connecting Production Sites in the World Wide Lab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digital transformation of production requires new methods of data integration and storage, as well as decision making and support systems that work vertically and horizontally throughout the development, production, and use cycle. In this paper, we propose Data-to-Knowledge (and Knowledge-to-Data) pipelines for production as a universal concept building on a network of Digital Shadows (a concept augmenting Digital Twins). We show a proof of concept that builds on and bridges existing infrastructure to 1) capture and semantically annotates trajectory data from multiple similar but independent robots in different organisations and use cases in a data lakehouse and 2) an independent process that dynamically queries matching data for training an inverse dynamic foundation model for robotic control. The article discusses the challenges and benefits of this approach and how Data-to-Knowledge pipelines contribute efficiency gains and industrial scalability in a World Wide Lab as a research outlook.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Action Sampling for Reinforcement Learning and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for continuous control tasks require accurate sampling-based action selection. Many tasks, such as robotic manipulation, contain inherent problem symmetries. However, correctly incorporating symmetry into sampling-based approaches remains a challenge. This work addresses the challenge of preserving symmetry in sampling-based planning and control, a key component for enhancing decision-making efficiency in RL. We introduce an action sampling approach that enforces the desired symmetry. We apply our proposed method to a coordinate regression problem and show that the symmetry aware sampling method drastically outperforms the naive sampling approach. We furthermore develop a general framework for sampling-based model-based planning with Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI). We compare our MPPI approach with standard sampling methods on several continuous control tasks. Empirical demonstrations across multiple continuous control environments validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing the importance of symmetry preservation in sampling-based action selection.</description>

      <title>Expanded Comprehensive Robotic Cholecystectomy Dataset (CRCD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the application of machine learning to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has attracted considerable interest. Datasets are critical to the use of such techniques. This paper presents a unique dataset recorded during ex vivo pseudo-cholecystectomy procedures on pig livers using the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). Unlike existing datasets, it addresses a critical gap by providing comprehensive kinematic data, recordings of all pedal inputs, and offers a time-stamped record of the endoscope's movements. This expanded version also includes segmentation and keypoint annotations of images, enhancing its utility for computer vision applications.
  Contributed by seven surgeons with varied backgrounds and experience levels that are provided as a part of this expanded version, the dataset is an important new resource for surgical robotics research. It enables the development of advanced methods for evaluating surgeon skills, tools for providing better context awareness, and automation of surgical tasks. Our work overcomes the limitations of incomplete recordings and imprecise kinematic data found in other datasets. To demonstrate the potential of the dataset for advancing automation in surgical robotics, we introduce two models that predict clutch usage and camera activation, a 3D scene reconstruction example, and the results from our keypoint and segmentation models.</description>

      <title>A Feasible Workflow for Retinal Vein Cannulation in Ex Vivo Porcine Eyes with Robotic Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A potential Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) treatment involves Retinal Vein Cannulation (RVC), which requires the surgeon to insert a microneedle into the affected retinal vein and administer a clot-dissolving drug. This procedure presents significant challenges due to human physiological limitations, such as hand tremors, prolonged tool-holding periods, and constraints in depth perception using a microscope. This study proposes a robot-assisted workflow for RVC to overcome these limitations. The test robot is operated through a keyboard. An intraoperative Optical Coherence Tomography (iOCT) system is used to verify successful venous puncture before infusion. The workflow is validated using 12 ex vivo porcine eyes. These early results demonstrate a successful rate of 10 out of 12 cannulations (83.33%), affirming the feasibility of the proposed workflow.</description>

      <title>Global SLAM in Visual-Inertial Systems with 5G Time-of-Arrival Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to improve global localization and mapping in indoor drone navigation by integrating 5G Time of Arrival (ToA) measurements into ORB-SLAM3, a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system. By incorporating ToA data from 5G base stations, we align the SLAM's local reference frame with a global coordinate system, enabling accurate and consistent global localization. We extend ORB-SLAM3's optimization pipeline to integrate ToA measurements alongside bias estimation, transforming the inherently local estimation into a globally consistent one. This integration effectively resolves scale ambiguity in monocular SLAM systems and enhances robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios where standard SLAM may fail. Our method is evaluated using five real-world indoor datasets collected with RGB-D cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs), augmented with simulated 5G ToA measurements at 28 GHz and 78 GHz frequencies using MATLAB and QuaDRiGa. We tested four SLAM configurations: RGB-D, RGB-D-Inertial, Monocular, and Monocular-Inertial. The results demonstrate that while local estimation accuracy remains comparable due to the high precision of RGB-D-based ORB-SLAM3 compared to ToA measurements, the inclusion of ToA measurements facilitates robust global positioning. In scenarios where standard mono-inertial ORB-SLAM3 loses tracking, our approach maintains accurate localization throughout the trajectory.</description>

      <title>Ultra-wideband Time Difference of Arrival Indoor Localization: From Sensor Placement to System Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless indoor localization has attracted significant research interest due to its high accuracy, low cost, lightweight design, and low power consumption. Specifically, ultra-wideband (UWB) time difference of arrival (TDOA)-based localization has emerged as a scalable positioning solution for mobile robots, consumer electronics, and wearable devices, featuring good accuracy and reliability. While UWB TDOA-based localization systems rely on the deployment of UWB radio sensors as positioning landmarks, existing works often assume these placements are predetermined or study the sensor placement problem alone without evaluating it in practical scenarios. In this article, we bridge this gap by approaching the UWB TDOA localization from a system-level perspective, integrating sensor placement as a key component and conducting practical evaluation in real-world scenarios. Through extensive real-world experiments, we demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our localization system, comparing its performance to the theoretical lower bounds. Using a challenging multi-room environment as a case study, we illustrate the full system construction process, from sensor placement optimization to real-world deployment. Our evaluation, comprising a cumulative total of 39 minutes of real-world experiments involving up to five agents and covering 2608 meters across four distinct scenarios, provides valuable insights and guidelines for constructing UWB TDOA localization systems.</description>

      <title>Swarm Intelligence in Collision-free Formation Control for Multi-UAV Systems with 3D Obstacle Avoidance Maneuvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems manipulation have demonstrated a rising demand for the implementation of multi-UAV systems in urban areas which are always subjected to the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. The focus of the presented research is on the introduction of a nature-inspired collision-free control for a multi-UAV system considering obstacle avoidance maneuvers. Inspired by the collective behavior of tilapia fish and pigeon, the presented framework in this study uses a centralized controller for the optimal formation control/recovery, which is defined by probabilistic Lloyd's algorithm, while it uses a distributed controller for the intervehicle collision and obstacle avoidance. Further, the presented framework has been extended to the 3D space with 3D maneuvers. Finally, the presented framework has been applied to a multi-UAV system in 2D and 3D scenarios, and obtained results demonstrated the validity of the presented method in the presence of buildings and different types of obstacles.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning for Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness in quadrotor control, enabling specialized policies to develop even human-champion-level performance in single-task scenarios. However, these specialized policies often struggle with novel tasks, requiring a complete retraining of the policy from scratch. To address this limitation, this paper presents a novel multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) framework tailored for quadrotor control, leveraging the shared physical dynamics of the platform to enhance sample efficiency and task performance. By employing a multi-critic architecture and shared task encoders, our framework facilitates knowledge transfer across tasks, enabling a single policy to execute diverse maneuvers, including high-speed stabilization, velocity tracking, and autonomous racing. Our experimental results, validated both in simulation and real-world scenarios, demonstrate that our framework outperforms baseline approaches in terms of sample efficiency and overall task performance.</description>

      <title>Task-Parameter Nexus: Task-Specific Parameter Learning for Model-Based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Task-Parameter Nexus (TPN), a learning-based approach for online determination of the (near-)optimal control parameters of model-based controllers (MBCs) for tracking tasks. In TPN, a deep neural network is introduced to predict the control parameters for any given tracking task at runtime, especially when optimal parameters for new tasks are not immediately available. To train this network, we constructed a trajectory bank with various speeds and curvatures that represent different motion characteristics. Then, for each trajectory in the bank, we auto-tune the optimal control parameters offline and use them as the corresponding ground truth. With this dataset, the TPN is trained by supervised learning. We evaluated the TPN on the quadrotor platform. In simulation experiments, it is shown that the TPN can predict near-optimal control parameters for a spectrum of tracking tasks, demonstrating its robust generalization capabilities to unseen tasks.</description>

      <title>Bots against Bias: Critical Next Steps for Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We humans are biased - and our robotic creations are biased, too. Bias is a natural phenomenon that drives our perceptions and behavior, including when it comes to socially expressive robots that have humanlike features. Recognizing that we embed bias, knowingly or not, within the design of such robots is crucial to studying its implications for people in modern societies. In this chapter, I consider the multifaceted question of bias in the context of humanoid, AI-enabled, and expressive social robots: Where does bias arise, what does it look like, and what can (or should) we do about it. I offer observations on human-robot interaction (HRI) along two parallel tracks: (1) robots designed in bias-conscious ways and (2) robots that may help us tackle bias in the human world. I outline a curated selection of cases for each track drawn from the latest HRI research and positioned against social, legal, and ethical factors. I also propose a set of critical next steps to tackle the challenges and opportunities on bias within HRI research and practice.</description>

      <title>Don't Yell at Your Robot: Physical Correction as the Collaborative Interface for Language Model Powered Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for enhancing human-robot collaboration using physical interactions for real-time error correction of large language model (LLM) powered robots. Unlike other methods that rely on verbal or text commands, the robot leverages an LLM to proactively executes 6 DoF linear Dynamical System (DS) commands using a description of the scene in natural language. During motion, a human can provide physical corrections, used to re-estimate the desired intention, also parameterized by linear DS. This corrected DS can be converted to natural language and used as part of the prompt to improve future LLM interactions. We provide proof-of-concept result in a hybrid real+sim experiment, showcasing physical interaction as a new possibility for LLM powered human-robot interface.</description>

      <title>Neural-Network-Driven Reward Prediction as a Heuristic: Advancing Q-Learning for Mobile Robot Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning technique for solving path planning problems. It primarily involves the interaction between an agent and its environment, enabling the agent to learn an optimal strategy that maximizes cumulative rewards. Although many studies have reported the effectiveness of Q-learning, it still faces slow convergence issues in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose the NDR-QL method, which utilizes neural network outputs as heuristic information to accelerate the convergence process of Q-learning. Specifically, we improved the dual-output neural network model by introducing a start-end channel separation mechanism and enhancing the feature fusion process. After training, the proposed NDR model can output a narrowly focused optimal probability distribution, referred to as the guideline, and a broadly distributed suboptimal distribution, referred to as the region. Subsequently, based on the guideline prediction, we calculate the continuous reward function for the Q-learning method, and based on the region prediction, we initialize the Q-table with a bias. We conducted training, validation, and path planning simulation experiments on public datasets. The results indicate that the NDR model outperforms previous methods by up to 5\% in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed NDR-QL method improves the convergence speed of the baseline Q-learning method by 90\% and also surpasses the previously improved Q-learning methods in path quality metrics.</description>

      <title>Audio Array-Based 3D UAV Trajectory Estimation with LiDAR Pseudo-Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on public safety and privacy, highlighting the need for advanced tracking and trajectory estimation solutions. In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</description>

Abstract: Autonomous exploration is a crucial aspect of robotics, enabling robots to explore unknown environments and generate maps without prior knowledge. This paper proposes a method to enhance exploration efficiency by integrating neural network-based occupancy grid map prediction with uncertainty-aware Bayesian neural network. Uncertainty from neural network-based occupancy grid map prediction is probabilistically integrated into mutual information for exploration. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted comparative simulations within a frontier exploration framework in a realistic simulator environment against various information metrics. The proposed method showed superior performance in terms of exploration efficiency.</description>

      <title>Design of Restricted Normalizing Flow towards Arbitrary Stochastic Policy with Computational Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new design method for a stochastic control policy using a normalizing flow (NF). In reinforcement learning (RL), the policy is usually modeled as a distribution model with trainable parameters. When this parameterization has less expressiveness, it would fail to acquiring the optimal policy. A mixture model has capability of a universal approximation, but it with too much redundancy increases the computational cost, which can become a bottleneck when considering the use of real-time robot control. As another approach, NF, which is with additional parameters for invertible transformation from a simple stochastic model as a base, is expected to exert high expressiveness and lower computational cost. However, NF cannot compute its mean analytically due to complexity of the invertible transformation, and it lacks reliability because it retains stochastic behaviors after deployment for robot controller. This paper therefore designs a restricted NF (RNF) that achieves an analytic mean by appropriately restricting the invertible transformation. In addition, the expressiveness impaired by this restriction is regained using bimodal student-t distribution as its base, so-called Bit-RNF. In RL benchmarks, Bit-RNF policy outperformed the previous models. Finally, a real robot experiment demonstrated the applicability of Bit-RNF policy to real world.

      <title>Singularity-Free Guiding Vector Field over B\'ezier's Curves Applied to Rovers Path Planning and Path Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a guidance algorithm for solving the problem of following parametric paths, as well as a curvature-varying speed setpoint for land-based car-type wheeled mobile robots (WMRs). The guidance algorithm relies on Singularity-Free Guiding Vector Fields SF-GVF. This novel GVF approach expands the desired robot path and the Guiding vector field to a higher dimensional space, in which an angular control function can be found to ensure global asymptotic convergence to the desired parametric path while avoiding field singularities. In SF-GVF, paths should follow a parametric definition. This feature makes using Bezier's curves attractive to define the robot's desired patch. The curvature-varying speed setpoint, combined with the guidance algorithm, eases the convergence to the path when physical restrictions exist, such as minimal turning radius or maximal lateral acceleration. We provide theoretical results, simulations, and outdoor experiments using a WMR platform assembled with off-the-shelf components.</description>

      <title>Learning Visuotactile Estimation and Control for Non-prehensile Manipulation under Occlusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulation without grasping, known as non-prehensile manipulation, is essential for dexterous robots in contact-rich environments, but presents many challenges relating with underactuation, hybrid-dynamics, and frictional uncertainty. Additionally, object occlusions in a scenario of contact uncertainty and where the motion of the object evolves independently from the robot becomes a critical problem, which previous literature fails to address. We present a method for learning visuotactile state estimators and uncertainty-aware control policies for non-prehensile manipulation under occlusions, by leveraging diverse interaction data from privileged policies trained in simulation. We formulate the estimator within a Bayesian deep learning framework, to model its uncertainty, and then train uncertainty-aware control policies by incorporating the pre-learned estimator into the reinforcement learning (RL) loop, both of which lead to significantly improved estimator and policy performance. Therefore, unlike prior non-prehensile research that relies on complex external perception set-ups, our method successfully handles occlusions after sim-to-real transfer to robotic hardware with a simple onboard camera.

      <title>ExBody2: Advanced Expressive Humanoid Whole-Body Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper enables real-world humanoid robots to maintain stability while performing expressive motions like humans do. We propose ExBody2, a generalized whole-body tracking framework that can take any reference motion inputs and control the humanoid to mimic the motion. The model is trained in simulation with Reinforcement Learning and then transferred to the real world. It decouples keypoint tracking with velocity control, and effectively leverages a privileged teacher policy to distill precise mimic skills into the target student policy, which enables high-fidelity replication of dynamic movements such as running, crouching, dancing, and other challenging motions. We present a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative analysis of crucial design factors in the paper. We conduct our experiments on two humanoid platforms and demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-arts, providing practical guidelines to pursue the extreme of whole-body control for humanoid robots.</description>

      <title>Meta-Controller: Few-Shot Imitation of Unseen Embodiments and Tasks in Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing across robot embodiments and tasks is crucial for adaptive robotic systems. Modular policy learning approaches adapt to new embodiments but are limited to specific tasks, while few-shot imitation learning (IL) approaches often focus on a single embodiment. In this paper, we introduce a few-shot behavior cloning framework to simultaneously generalize to unseen embodiments and tasks using a few (\emph{e.g.,} five) reward-free demonstrations. Our framework leverages a joint-level input-output representation to unify the state and action spaces of heterogeneous embodiments and employs a novel structure-motion state encoder that is parameterized to capture both shared knowledge across all embodiments and embodiment-specific knowledge. A matching-based policy network then predicts actions from a few demonstrations, producing an adaptive policy that is robust to over-fitting. Evaluated in the DeepMind Control suite, our framework termed \modelname{} demonstrates superior few-shot generalization to unseen embodiments and tasks over modular policy learning and few-shot IL approaches.

      <title>iMoT: Inertial Motion Transformer for Inertial Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose iMoT, an innovative Transformer-based inertial odometry method that retrieves cross-modal information from motion and rotation modalities for accurate positional estimation. Unlike prior work, during the encoding of the motion context, we introduce Progressive Series Decoupler at the beginning of each encoder layer to stand out critical motion events inherent in acceleration and angular velocity signals. To better aggregate cross-modal interactions, we present Adaptive Positional Encoding, which dynamically modifies positional embeddings for temporal discrepancies between different modalities. During decoding, we introduce a small set of learnable query motion particles as priors to model motion uncertainties within velocity segments. Each query motion particle is intended to draw cross-modal features dedicated to a specific motion mode, all taken together allowing the model to refine its understanding of motion dynamics effectively. Lastly, we design a dynamic scoring mechanism to stabilize iMoT's optimization by considering all aligned motion particles at the final decoding step, ensuring robust and accurate velocity segment estimation. Extensive evaluations on various inertial datasets demonstrate that iMoT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in delivering superior robustness and accuracy in trajectory reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Anti-bullying Adaptive Cruise Control: A proactive right-of-way protection approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems are vulnerable to "road bully" such as cut-ins. This paper proposed an Anti-bullying Adaptive Cruise Control (AACC) approach with proactive right-of-way protection ability. It bears the following features: i) with the enhanced capability of preventing bullying from cut-ins; ii) optimal but not unsafe; iii) adaptive to various driving styles of cut-in vehicles; iv) with real-time field implementation capability. The proposed approach can identify other road users' driving styles online and conduct game-based motion planning for right-of-way protection. A detailed investigation of the simulation results shows that the proposed approach can prevent bullying from cut-ins and be adaptive to different cut-in vehicles' driving styles. The proposed approach is capable of enhancing travel efficiency by up to 29.55% under different cut-in gaps and can strengthen driving safety compared with the current ACC controller. The proposed approach is flexible and robust against traffic congestion levels. It can improve mobility by up to 11.93% and robustness by 8.74% in traffic flow. Furthermore, the proposed approach can support real-time field implementation by ensuring less than 50 milliseconds computation time.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a real-time monocular dense SLAM system designed bottom-up from MASt3R, a two-view 3D reconstruction and matching prior. Equipped with this strong prior, our system is robust on in-the-wild video sequences despite making no assumption on a fixed or parametric camera model beyond a unique camera centre. We introduce efficient methods for pointmap matching, camera tracking and local fusion, graph construction and loop closure, and second-order global optimisation. With known calibration, a simple modification to the system achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks. Altogether, we propose a plug-and-play monocular SLAM system capable of producing globally-consistent poses and dense geometry while operating at 15 FPS.</description>

Abstract: Compact UAV systems, while advancing delivery and surveillance, pose significant security challenges due to their small size, which hinders detection by traditional methods. This paper presents a cost-effective, unsupervised UAV detection method using spatial-temporal sequence processing to fuse multiple LiDAR scans for accurate UAV tracking in real-world scenarios. Our approach segments point clouds into foreground and background, analyzes spatial-temporal data, and employs a scoring mechanism to enhance detection accuracy. Tested on a public dataset, our solution placed 4th in the CVPR 2024 UG2+ Challenge, demonstrating its practical effectiveness. We plan to open-source all designs, code, and sample data for the research community github.com/lianghanfang/UnLiDAR-UAV-Est.</description>

      <title>Open-World Panoptic Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perception is a key building block of autonomously acting vision systems such as autonomous vehicles. It is crucial that these systems are able to understand their surroundings in order to operate safely and robustly. Additionally, autonomous systems deployed in unconstrained real-world scenarios must be able of dealing with novel situations and object that have never been seen before. In this article, we tackle the problem of open-world panoptic segmentation, i.e., the task of discovering new semantic categories and new object instances at test time, while enforcing consistency among the categories that we incrementally discover. We propose Con2MAV, an approach for open-world panoptic segmentation that extends our previous work, ContMAV, which was developed for open-world semantic segmentation. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, we show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on open-world segmentation tasks, while still performing competitively on the known categories. We will open-source our implementation upon acceptance. Additionally, we propose PANIC (Panoptic ANomalies In Context), a benchmark for evaluating open-world panoptic segmentation in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset, recorded with a multi-modal sensor suite mounted on a car, provides high-quality, pixel-wise annotations of anomalous objects at both semantic and instance level. Our dataset contains 800 images, with more than 50 unknown classes, i.e., classes that do not appear in the training set, and 4000 object instances, making it an extremely challenging dataset for open-world segmentation tasks in the autonomous driving scenario. We provide competitions for multiple open-world tasks on a hidden test set. Our dataset and competitions are available at https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/data/panic.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data Generation for Anomaly Detection on Table Grapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early detection of illnesses and pest infestations in fruit cultivation is critical for maintaining yield quality and plant health. Computer vision and robotics are increasingly employed for the automatic detection of such issues, particularly using data-driven solutions. However, the rarity of these problems makes acquiring and processing the necessary data to train such algorithms a significant obstacle. One solution to this scarcity is the generation of synthetic high-quality anomalous samples. While numerous methods exist for this task, most require highly trained individuals for setup.
  This work addresses the challenge of generating synthetic anomalies in an automatic fashion that requires only an initial collection of normal and anomalous samples from the user - a task that is straightforward for farmers. We demonstrate the approach in the context of table grape cultivation. Specifically, based on the observation that normal berries present relatively smooth surfaces, while defects result in more complex textures, we introduce a Dual-Canny Edge Detection (DCED) filter. This filter emphasizes the additional texture indicative of diseases, pest infestations, or other defects. Using segmentation masks provided by the Segment Anything Model, we then select and seamlessly blend anomalous berries onto normal ones. We show that the proposed dataset augmentation technique improves the accuracy of an anomaly classifier for table grapes and that the approach can be generalized to other fruit types.</description>

      <title>Efficient Diffusion Transformer Policies with Mixture of Expert Denoisers for Multitask Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Policies have become widely used in Imitation Learning, offering several appealing properties, such as generating multimodal and discontinuous behavior. As models are becoming larger to capture more complex capabilities, their computational demands increase, as shown by recent scaling laws. Therefore, continuing with the current architectures will present a computational roadblock. To address this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Denoising Experts (MoDE) as a novel policy for Imitation Learning. MoDE surpasses current state-of-the-art Transformer-based Diffusion Policies while enabling parameter-efficient scaling through sparse experts and noise-conditioned routing, reducing both active parameters by 40% and inference costs by 90% via expert caching. Our architecture combines this efficient scaling with noise-conditioned self-attention mechanism, enabling more effective denoising across different noise levels. MoDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on 134 tasks in four established imitation learning benchmarks (CALVIN and LIBERO). Notably, by pretraining MoDE on diverse robotics data, we achieve 4.01 on CALVIN ABC and 0.95 on LIBERO-90. It surpasses both CNN-based and Transformer Diffusion Policies by an average of 57% across 4 benchmarks, while using 90% fewer FLOPs and fewer active parameters compared to default Diffusion Transformer architectures. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablations on MoDE's components, providing insights for designing efficient and scalable Transformer architectures for Diffusion Policies. Code and demonstrations are available at https://mbreuss.github.io/MoDE_Diffusion_Policy/.</description>

      <title>Future Aspects in Human Action Recognition: Exploring Emerging Techniques and Ethical Influences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual-based human action recognition can be found in various application fields, e.g., surveillance systems, sports analytics, medical assistive technologies, or human-robot interaction frameworks, and it concerns the identification and classification of individuals' activities within a video. Since actions typically occur over a sequence of consecutive images, it is particularly challenging due to the inclusion of temporal analysis, which introduces an extra layer of complexity. However, although multiple approaches try to handle temporal analysis, there are still difficulties because of their computational cost and lack of adaptability. Therefore, different types of vision data, containing transition information between consecutive images, provided by next-generation hardware sensors will guide the robotics community in tackling the problem of human action recognition. On the other hand, while there is a plethora of still-image datasets, that researchers can adopt to train new artificial intelligence models, videos representing human activities are of limited capabilities, e.g., small and unbalanced datasets or selected without control from multiple sources. To this end, generating new and realistic synthetic videos is possible since labeling is performed throughout the data creation process, while reinforcement learning techniques can permit the avoidance of considerable dataset dependence. At the same time, human factors' involvement raises ethical issues for the research community, as doubts and concerns about new technologies already exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present flight patterns for a collision-free passage of swarms of drones through one or more openings. The narrow openings provide drones with access to an infrastructure component such as charging stations to charge their depleted batteries and hangars for storage. The flight patterns are a staging area (queues) that match the rate at which an infrastructure component and its openings process drones. They prevent collisions and may implement different policies that control the order in which drones pass through an opening. We illustrate the flight patterns with a 3D display that uses drones configured with light sources to illuminate shapes.</description>

      <title>Previous Knowledge Utilization In Online Anytime Belief Space Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online planning under uncertainty remains a critical challenge in robotics and autonomous systems. While tree search techniques are commonly employed to construct partial future trajectories within computational constraints, most existing methods discard information from previous planning sessions considering continuous spaces. This study presents a novel, computationally efficient approach that leverages historical planning data in current decision-making processes. We provide theoretical foundations for our information reuse strategy and introduce an algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that implements this approach. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces computation time while maintaining high performance levels. Our findings suggest that integrating historical planning information can substantially improve the efficiency of online decision-making in uncertain environments, paving the way for more responsive and adaptive autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>SafeAgentBench: A Benchmark for Safe Task Planning of Embodied LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the integration of large language models (LLMs), embodied agents have strong capabilities to execute complicated instructions in natural language, paving a way for the potential deployment of embodied robots. However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in real world. To study this issue, we present SafeAgentBench -- a new benchmark for safety-aware task planning of embodied LLM agents. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) a new dataset with 750 tasks, covering 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent execution with 17 high-level actions for 8 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3) reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives. Experimental results show that the best-performing baseline gets 69% success rate for safe tasks, but only 5% rejection rate for hazardous tasks, indicating significant safety risks. More details and codes are available at https://github.com/shengyin1224/SafeAgentBench.</description>

Abstract: This study delved into the viability of Robot-supported flipped classes in English for Medical Purposes reading comprehension. In a 16-session course, the reading comprehension and then workspace performance of 444 students, with Commercially-Off-The-Shelf and Self-Generated robot flipped classes were compared. The results indicated that the flipped classes brought about a good instructional-learning ambience in postsecondary education for English for Medical Purposes (EMP) reading comprehension and adopting proactive approach for workspace performance. In tandem, the Mixed Effect Model revealed that student participation in the self-generated robot-supported flipped classes yielded a larger effect size (+17.6%) than Commercially-Off-The-Shelf robot-supported flipped classes. Analyses produced five contributing moderators of EMP reading comprehension and workspace performance: reading proficiency, attitude, manner of practicing, as well as student and teacher role.</description>

      <title>Multi-Object Graph Affordance Network: Goal-Oriented Planning through Learned Compound Object Affordances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10426v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning object affordances is an effective tool in the field of robot learning. While the data-driven models investigate affordances of single or paired objects, there is a gap in the exploration of affordances of compound objects composed of an arbitrary number of objects. We propose the Multi-Object Graph Affordance Network which models complex compound object affordances by learning the outcomes of robot actions that facilitate interactions between an object and a compound. Given the depth images of the objects, the object features are extracted via convolution operations and encoded in the nodes of graph neural networks. Graph convolution operations are used to encode the state of the compounds, which are used as input to decoders to predict the outcome of the object-compound interactions. After learning the compound object affordances, given different tasks, the learned outcome predictors are used to plan sequences of stack actions that involve stacking objects on top of each other, inserting smaller objects into larger containers and passing through ring-like objects through poles. We showed that our system successfully modeled the affordances of compound objects that include concave and convex objects, in both simulated and real-world environments. We benchmarked our system with a baseline model to highlight its advantages.</description>

      <title>FootstepNet: an Efficient Actor-Critic Method for Fast On-line Bipedal Footstep Planning and Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing a humanoid locomotion controller is challenging and classically split up in sub-problems. Footstep planning is one of those, where the sequence of footsteps is defined. Even in simpler environments, finding a minimal sequence, or even a feasible sequence, yields a complex optimization problem. In the literature, this problem is usually addressed by search-based algorithms (e.g. variants of A*). However, such approaches are either computationally expensive or rely on hand-crafted tuning of several parameters. In this work, at first, we propose an efficient footstep planning method to navigate in local environments with obstacles, based on state-of-the art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques, with very low computational requirements for on-line inference. Our approach is heuristic-free and relies on a continuous set of actions to generate feasible footsteps. In contrast, other methods necessitate the selection of a relevant discrete set of actions. Second, we propose a forecasting method, allowing to quickly estimate the number of footsteps required to reach different candidates of local targets. This approach relies on inherent computations made by the actor-critic DRL architecture. We demonstrate the validity of our approach with simulation results, and by a deployment on a kid-size humanoid robot during the RoboCup 2023 competition.</description>

      <title>KITchen: A Real-World Benchmark and Dataset for 6D Object Pose Estimation in Kitchen Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the recent progress on 6D object pose estimation methods for robotic grasping, a substantial performance gap persists between the capabilities of these methods on existing datasets and their efficacy in real-world grasping and mobile manipulation tasks, particularly when robots rely solely on their monocular egocentric field of view (FOV). Existing real-world datasets primarily focus on table-top grasping scenarios, where a robot arm is placed in a fixed position and the objects are centralized within the FOV of fixed external camera(s). Assessing performance on such datasets may not accurately reflect the challenges encountered in everyday grasping and mobile manipulation tasks within kitchen environments such as retrieving objects from higher shelves, sinks, dishwashers, ovens, refrigerators, or microwaves. To address this gap, we present KITchen, a novel benchmark designed specifically for estimating the 6D poses of objects located in diverse positions within kitchen settings. For this purpose, we recorded a comprehensive dataset comprising around 205k real-world RGBD images for 111 kitchen objects captured in two distinct kitchens, utilizing a humanoid robot with its egocentric perspectives. Subsequently, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline, to streamline the labeling process of such datasets, resulting in the generation of 2D object labels, 2D object segmentation masks, and 6D object poses with minimal human effort. The benchmark, the dataset, and the annotation pipeline will be publicly available at https://kitchen-dataset.github.io/KITchen.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Target Tracking with Sensing and Communication Danger Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-robot target tracking finds extensive applications in different scenarios, such as environmental surveillance and wildfire management, which require the robustness of the practical deployment of multi-robot systems in uncertain and dangerous environments. Traditional approaches often focus on the performance of tracking accuracy with no modeling and assumption of the environments, neglecting potential environmental hazards which result in system failures in real-world deployments. To address this challenge, we investigate multi-robot target tracking in the adversarial environment considering sensing and communication attacks with uncertainty. We design specific strategies to avoid different danger zones and proposed a multi-agent tracking framework under the perilous environment. We approximate the probabilistic constraints and formulate practical optimization strategies to address computational challenges efficiently. We evaluate the performance of our proposed methods in simulations to demonstrate the ability of robots to adjust their risk-aware behaviors under different levels of environmental uncertainty and risk confidence. The proposed method is further validated via real-world robot experiments where a team of drones successfully track dynamic ground robots while being risk-aware of the sensing and/or communication danger zones.</description>

Abstract: Performing trajectory design for humanoid robots with high degrees of freedom is computationally challenging. The trajectory design process also often involves carefully selecting various hyperparameters and requires a good initial guess which can further complicate the development process. This work introduces a generalized gait optimization framework that directly generates smooth and physically feasible trajectories. The proposed method demonstrates faster and more robust convergence than existing techniques and explicitly incorporates closed-loop kinematic constraints that appear in many modern humanoids. The method is implemented as an open-source C++ codebase which can be found at https://roahmlab.github.io/RAPTOR/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major challenge in autonomous flights is unknown disturbances, which can jeopardize safety and lead to collisions, especially in obstacle-rich environments. This paper presents a disturbance-aware motion planning and control framework designed for autonomous aerial flights. The framework is composed of two key components: a disturbance-aware motion planner and a tracking controller. The disturbance-aware motion planner consists of a predictive control scheme and a learned model of disturbances that is adapted online. The tracking controller is designed using contraction control methods to provide safety bounds on the quadrotor behaviour in the vicinity of the obstacles with respect to the disturbance-aware motion plan. Finally, the algorithm is tested in simulation scenarios with a quadrotor facing strong crosswind and ground-induced disturbances.</description>

Abstract: Manipulating garments and fabrics has long been a critical endeavor in the development of home-assistant robots. However, due to complex dynamics and topological structures, garment manipulations pose significant challenges. Recent successes in reinforcement learning and vision-based methods offer promising avenues for learning garment manipulation. Nevertheless, these approaches are severely constrained by current benchmarks, which offer limited diversity of tasks and unrealistic simulation behavior. Therefore, we present GarmentLab, a content-rich benchmark and realistic simulation designed for deformable object and garment manipulation. Our benchmark encompasses a diverse range of garment types, robotic systems and manipulators. The abundant tasks in the benchmark further explores of the interactions between garments, deformable objects, rigid bodies, fluids, and human body. Moreover, by incorporating multiple simulation methods such as FEM and PBD, along with our proposed sim-to-real algorithms and real-world benchmark, we aim to significantly narrow the sim-to-real gap. We evaluate state-of-the-art vision methods, reinforcement learning, and imitation learning approaches on these tasks, highlighting the challenges faced by current algorithms, notably their limited generalization capabilities. Our proposed open-source environments and comprehensive analysis show promising boost to future research in garment manipulation by unlocking the full potential of these methods. We guarantee that we will open-source our code as soon as possible. You can watch the videos in supplementary files to learn more about the details of our work.

      <title>SplatR : Experience Goal Visual Rearrangement with 3D Gaussian Splatting and Dense Feature Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experience Goal Visual Rearrangement task stands as a foundational challenge within Embodied AI, requiring an agent to construct a robust world model that accurately captures the goal state. The agent uses this world model to restore a shuffled scene to its original configuration, making an accurate representation of the world essential for successfully completing the task. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages on 3D Gaussian Splatting as a 3D scene representation for experience goal visual rearrangement task. Recent advances in volumetric scene representation like 3D Gaussian Splatting, offer fast rendering of high quality and photo-realistic novel views. Our approach enables the agent to have consistent views of the current and the goal setting of the rearrangement task, which enables the agent to directly compare the goal state and the shuffled state of the world in image space. To compare these views, we propose to use a dense feature matching method with visual features extracted from a foundation model, leveraging its advantages of a more universal feature representation, which facilitates robustness, and generalization. We validate our approach on the AI2-THOR rearrangement challenge benchmark and demonstrate improvements over the current state of the art methods</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) techniques can be used to navigate the visually impaired, but the development of robust SLAM solutions for crowded spaces is limited by the lack of realistic datasets. To address this, we introduce InCrowd-VI, a novel visual-inertial dataset specifically designed for human navigation in indoor pedestrian-rich environments. Recorded using Meta Aria Project glasses, it captures realistic scenarios without environmental control. InCrowd-VI features 58 sequences totaling a 5 km trajectory length and 1.5 hours of recording time, including RGB, stereo images, and IMU measurements. The dataset captures important challenges such as pedestrian occlusions, varying crowd densities, complex layouts, and lighting changes. Ground-truth trajectories, accurate to approximately 2 cm, are provided in the dataset, originating from the Meta Aria project machine perception SLAM service. In addition, a semi-dense 3D point cloud of scenes is provided for each sequence. The evaluation of state-of-the-art visual odometry (VO) and SLAM algorithms on InCrowd-VI revealed severe performance limitations in these realistic scenarios. Under challenging conditions, systems exceeded the required localization accuracy of 0.5 meters and the 1\% drift threshold, with classical methods showing drift up to 5-10\%. While deep learning-based approaches maintained high pose estimation coverage (&gt;90\%), they failed to achieve real-time processing speeds necessary for walking pace navigation. These results demonstrate the need and value of a new dataset to advance SLAM research for visually impaired navigation in complex indoor environments. The dataset and associated tools are publicly available at https://incrowd-vi.cloudlab.zhaw.ch/.</description>

      <title>What Matters in Learning A Zero-Shot Sim-to-Real RL Policy for Quadrotor Control? A Comprehensive Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Executing precise and agile flight maneuvers is critical for quadrotors in various applications. Traditional quadrotor control approaches are limited by their reliance on flat trajectories or time-consuming optimization, which restricts their flexibility. Recently, RL-based policy has emerged as a promising alternative due to its ability to directly map observations to actions, reducing the need for detailed system knowledge and actuation constraints. However, a significant challenge remains in bridging the sim-to-real gap, where RL-based policies often experience instability when deployed in real world. In this paper, we investigate key factors for learning robust RL-based control policies that are capable of zero-shot deployment in real-world quadrotors. We identify five critical factors and we develop a PPO-based training framework named SimpleFlight, which integrates these five techniques. We validate the efficacy of SimpleFlight on Crazyflie quadrotor, demonstrating that it achieves more than a 50% reduction in trajectory tracking error compared to state-of-the-art RL baselines, and achieves 70% improvement over the traditional MPC. The policy derived by SimpleFlight consistently excels across both smooth polynominal trajectories and challenging infeasible zigzag trajectories on small thrust-to-weight quadrotors. In contrast, baseline methods struggle with high-speed or infeasible trajectories. To support further research and reproducibility, we integrate SimpleFlight into a GPU-based simulator Omnidrones and provide open-source access to the code and model checkpoints. We hope SimpleFlight will offer valuable insights for advancing RL-based quadrotor control. For more details, visit our project website at https://sites.google.com/view/simpleflight/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning-based robotic control methods are often task-specific and fail to generalize across diverse environments or unseen objects and instructions. Visual Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong scene understanding and planning capabilities but lack the ability to generate actionable policies tailored to specific robotic embodiments. To address this, Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged, yet they face challenges in long-horizon spatial reasoning and grounded task planning. In this work, we propose the Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning, Emma-X. Emma-X leverages our constructed hierarchical embodiment dataset based on BridgeV2, containing 60,000 robot manipulation trajectories auto-annotated with grounded task reasoning and spatial guidance. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory segmentation strategy based on gripper states and motion trajectories, which can help mitigate hallucination in grounding subtask reasoning generation. Experimental results demonstrate that Emma-X achieves superior performance over competitive baselines, particularly in real-world robotic tasks requiring spatial reasoning.</description>

Abstract: The accurate prediction of smooth steering inputs is crucial for automotive applications because control actions with jitter might cause the vehicle system to become unstable. To address this problem in automobile lane-keeping control without the use of additional smoothing algorithms, we developed a novel soft-constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (soft-CILQR) algorithm by integrating CILQR algorithm and a model predictive control (MPC) constraint relaxation method. We incorporated slack variables into the state and control barrier functions of the soft-CILQR solver to soften the constraints in the optimization process such that control input stabilization can be achieved in a computationally simple manner. Two types of automotive lane-keeping experiments (numerical simulations and experiments involving challenging vision-based maneuvers) were conducted with a linear system dynamics model to test the performance of the proposed soft-CILQR algorithm, and its performance was compared with that of the CILQR algorithm. In the numerical simulations, the soft-CILQR and CILQR solvers managed to drive the system toward the reference state asymptotically; however, the soft-CILQR solver obtained smooth steering input trajectories more easily than did the CILQR solver under conditions involving additive disturbances. The results of the vision-based experiments in which an ego vehicle drove in perturbed TORCS environments with various road friction settings were consistent with those of the numerical tests. The proposed soft-CILQR algorithm achieved an average runtime of 2.55 ms and is thus applicable for real-time autonomous driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>Decictor: Towards Evaluating the Robustness of Decision-Making in Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving System (ADS) testing is crucial in ADS development, with the current primary focus being on safety. However, the evaluation of non-safety-critical performance, particularly the ADS's ability to make optimal decisions and produce optimal paths for autonomous vehicles (AVs), is also vital to ensure the intelligence and reduce risks of AVs. Currently, there is little work dedicated to assessing the robustness of ADSs' path-planning decisions (PPDs), i.e., whether an ADS can maintain the optimal PPD after an insignificant change in the environment. The key challenges include the lack of clear oracles for assessing PPD optimality and the difficulty in searching for scenarios that lead to non-optimal PPDs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we focus on evaluating the robustness of ADSs' PPDs and propose the first method, Decictor, for generating non-optimal decision scenarios (NoDSs), where the ADS does not plan optimal paths for AVs. Decictor comprises three main components: Non-invasive Mutation, Consistency Check, and Feedback. To overcome the oracle challenge, Non-invasive Mutation is devised to implement conservative modifications, ensuring the preservation of the original optimal path in the mutated scenarios. Subsequently, the Consistency Check is applied to determine the presence of non-optimal PPDs by comparing the driving paths in the original and mutated scenarios. To deal with the challenge of large environment space, we design Feedback metrics that integrate spatial and temporal dimensions of the AV's movement. These metrics are crucial for effectively steering the generation of NoDSs. We evaluate Decictor on Baidu Apollo, an open-source and production-grade ADS. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of Decictor in detecting non-optimal PPDs of ADSs.</description>

      <title>GPS-IDS: An Anomaly-based GPS Spoofing Attack Detection Framework for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) heavily rely on sensors and communication networks like Global Positioning System (GPS) to navigate autonomously. Prior research has indicated that networks like GPS are vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as spoofing and jamming, thus posing serious risks like navigation errors and system failures. These threats are expected to intensify with the widespread deployment of AVs, making it crucial to detect and mitigate such attacks. This paper proposes GPS Intrusion Detection System, or GPS-IDS, an Anomaly-based intrusion detection framework to detect GPS spoofing attacks on AVs. The framework uses a novel physics-based vehicle behavior model where a GPS navigation model is integrated into the conventional dynamic bicycle model for accurate AV behavior representation. Temporal features derived from this behavior model are analyzed using machine learning to detect normal and abnormal navigation behaviors. The performance of the GPS-IDS framework is evaluated on the AV-GPS-Dataset -- a GPS security dataset for AVs comprising real-world data collected using an AV testbed, and simulated data representing urban traffic environments. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first of its kind and has been publicly released for the global research community to address such security challenges.</description>

      <title>Query3D: LLM-Powered Open-Vocabulary Scene Segmentation with Language Embedded 3D Gaussian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for open-vocabulary 3D scene querying in autonomous driving by combining Language Embedded 3D Gaussians with Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose utilizing LLMs to generate both contextually canonical phrases and helping positive words for enhanced segmentation and scene interpretation. Our method leverages GPT-3.5 Turbo as an expert model to create a high-quality text dataset, which we then use to fine-tune smaller, more efficient LLMs for on-device deployment. Our comprehensive evaluation on the WayveScenes101 dataset demonstrates that LLM-guided segmentation significantly outperforms traditional approaches based on predefined canonical phrases. Notably, our fine-tuned smaller models achieve performance comparable to larger expert models while maintaining faster inference times. Through ablation studies, we discover that the effectiveness of helping positive words correlates with model scale, with larger models better equipped to leverage additional semantic information. This work represents a significant advancement towards more efficient, context-aware autonomous driving systems, effectively bridging 3D scene representation with high-level semantic querying while maintaining practical deployment considerations.</description>

      <title>DiFSD: Ego-Centric Fully Sparse Paradigm with Uncertainty Denoising and Iterative Refinement for Efficient End-to-End Self-Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09777v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current end-to-end autonomous driving methods resort to unifying modular designs for various tasks (e.g. perception, prediction and planning). Although optimized in a planning-oriented spirit with a fully differentiable framework, existing end-to-end driving systems without ego-centric designs still suffer from unsatisfactory performance and inferior efficiency, owing to the rasterized scene representation learning and redundant information transmission. In this paper, we revisit the human driving behavior and propose an ego-centric fully sparse paradigm, named DiFSD, for end-to-end self-driving. Specifically, DiFSD mainly consists of sparse perception, hierarchical interaction and iterative motion planner. The sparse perception module performs detection, tracking and online mapping based on sparse representation of the driving scene. The hierarchical interaction module aims to select the Closest In-Path Vehicle / Stationary (CIPV / CIPS) from coarse to fine, benefiting from an additional geometric prior. As for the iterative motion planner, both selected interactive agents and ego-vehicle are considered for joint motion prediction, where the output multi-modal ego-trajectories are optimized in an iterative fashion. Besides, both position-level motion diffusion and trajectory-level planning denoising are introduced for uncertainty modeling, thus facilitating the training stability and convergence of the whole framework. Extensive experiments conducted on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets demonstrate the superior planning performance and great efficiency of DiFSD.</description>

      <title>On Foundation Models for Dynamical Systems from Purely Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable generalization, data efficiency, and robustness properties across various domains. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of foundation models for applications in the control domain. The success of these models is enabled by large-scale pretaining on Internet-scale datasets. These are available in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, but do not exist for dynamical systems. We address this challenge by pretraining a transformer-based foundation model exclusively on synthetic data and propose to sample dynamics functions from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our pretrained model generalizes for prediction tasks across different dynamical systems, which we validate in simulation and hardware experiments, including cart-pole and Furuta pendulum setups. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned effectively to new systems to increase performance even further. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of foundation models for dynamical systems that outperform specialist models in terms of generalization, data efficiency, and robustness.</description>

      <title>GenEx: Generating an Explorable World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding, navigating, and exploring the 3D physical real world has long been a central challenge in the development of artificial intelligence. In this work, we take a step toward this goal by introducing GenEx, a system capable of planning complex embodied world exploration, guided by its generative imagination that forms priors (expectations) about the surrounding environments. GenEx generates an entire 3D-consistent imaginative environment from as little as a single RGB image, bringing it to life through panoramic video streams. Leveraging scalable 3D world data curated from Unreal Engine, our generative model is rounded in the physical world. It captures a continuous 360-degree environment with little effort, offering a boundless landscape for AI agents to explore and interact with. GenEx achieves high-quality world generation, robust loop consistency over long trajectories, and demonstrates strong 3D capabilities such as consistency and active 3D mapping. Powered by generative imagination of the world, GPT-assisted agents are equipped to perform complex embodied tasks, including both goal-agnostic exploration and goal-driven navigation. These agents utilize predictive expectation regarding unseen parts of the physical world to refine their beliefs, simulate different outcomes based on potential decisions, and make more informed choices. In summary, we demonstrate that GenEx provides a transformative platform for advancing embodied AI in imaginative spaces and brings potential for extending these capabilities to real-world exploration.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Graph Coverage with Proximity and Movement Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-Robot Coverage problems have been extensively studied in robotics, planning and multi-agent systems. In this work, we consider the coverage problem when there are constraints on the proximity (e.g., maximum distance between the agents, or a blue agent must be adjacent to a red agent) and the movement (e.g., terrain traversability and material load capacity) of the robots. Such constraints naturally arise in many real-world applications, e.g. in search-and-rescue and maintenance operations. Given such a setting, the goal is to compute a covering tour of the graph with a minimum number of steps, and that adheres to the proximity and movement constraints. For this problem, our contributions are four: (i) a formal formulation of the problem, (ii) an exact algorithm that is FPT in F, d and tw, the set of robot formations that encode the proximity constraints, the maximum nodes degree, and the tree-width of the graph, respectively, (iii) for the case that the graph is a tree: a PTAS approximation scheme, that given an approximation parameter epsilon, produces a tour that is within a epsilon times error(||F||, d) of the optimal one, and the computation runs in time poly(n) times h(1/epsilon,||F||). (iv) for the case that the graph is a tree, with $k=3$ robots, and the constraint is that all agents are connected: a PTAS scheme with multiplicative approximation error of 1+O(epsilon), independent of the maximal degree d.</description>
