      <title>The Liv\v{s}ic equation on differential forms over Anosov flows and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to explore the relationship between the
  geometric properties of an Anosov flow on a closed manifold $M$ and
  the analytic properties of its infinitesimal generator $X$ as a
  linear operator on the space of smooth differential forms of all
  degrees. In particular, we study the solvability of the Liv\v{s}ic
  equation $L_X \xi = \eta$ on the space of differential forms and
  show, for instance, that if the Anosov flow is \emph{asymmetric},
  then the equation has a unique solution in the continuous category
  in degrees $2 \leq k \leq n-2$, where $n = \dim M$. Intuitively, an
  Anosov flow is asymmetric if in negative time it shrinks the volume
  of any $(n-2)$-dimensional parallelepiped exponentially fast when at
  least one side of it is in the strong unstable direction. As an
  application, we show that for volume-preserving asymmetric Anosov
  flows, the following result holds: the $L^2$-closure of the image of
  $L_X$ restricted to differential forms of degree $(n-1)$ contains
  the space of $L^2$-exact $(n-1)$-forms if and only if the sum of the
  strong bundles of the flow is uniquely integrable, in which case the
  flow is therefore topologically conjugate to a suspension of an
  Anosov diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Rotation Numbers and Geometric Invariants in Bicycle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study planar bicycle dynamics via the rotation number function \(\rho_\Gamma(R)\) associated with a closed front track \(\Gamma\) and bicycle length \(R\). We prove that mode-locking \emph{plateaus} occur only at \emph{integer} rotation numbers and that \(\rho_\Gamma\) is real-analytic in \(R\) off resonance. From \(\rho_\Gamma\) we introduce two new geometric invariants: the \emph{critical B-length} \(\underline{R}(\Gamma)\) (right end of the first plateau) and the \emph{turning B-length} \(\overline{R}(\Gamma)\) (left end of the maximal monotone interval). For strictly convex \(\Gamma\), these invariants coincide, yielding a sharp transition of the bicycle monodromy: hyperbolic for \(R&lt;\mcr(\Gamma)\) and elliptic for \(R&gt;\underline{R}(\Gamma)\). The proofs combine projectivized \(SU(1,1)\) dynamics with Riccati equations and rotation-number theory.</description>

      <title>A Bilayer Cathode Design Procedure for Li ion Batteries Using the Multilayer Doyle-Fuller-Newman Model (M-DFN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneities in lithium ion batteries can be significant factors in electrode under utilisation and degradation while charging. Bilayer electrodes have been proposed as a convenient and scalable way to homogenise the electrode response. In this paper, the design of a bilayer cathode for Li-ion batteries composed of separate layers of lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC622) and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) is optimised using the multilayer Doyle-Fuller-Newman (M-DFN) model. Changes to the carbon binder domain, electrolyte volume fraction, and tortuosity provided the greatest control for improving Li-ion charge mobility. The optimised bilayer design was able to charge at 3C between 0-90% SOC in 18.6 minutes, achieving 4.4 mAh/cm2. Comparing the optimal bilayer to the LFP-only electrode, the bilayer achieved 41% higher capacity. Through mechanistic physics-based modelling, it was shown that the 3C charging improvement of the optimised bilayer was achieved by enabling a more homogeneous current density distribution through the thickness of the electrode and electrolyte depletion prevention. The findings were confirmed on a high-fidelity X-ray computed tomography (CT) based microstructural model. The results illustrate how modelling can be used to rapidly search novel electrode designs</description>

      <title>Poncelet property of planar elliptic integrable Kepler billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the integrable dynamics of a Kepler billiard in the plane bounded by a branch of a conic section focused at the Kepler center. We show that in this case, for non-zero-energy orbits, the lines of consecutive second orbital foci along a billiard trajectory are all tangent to a fixed circle. Based on this observation we analyse in details the integrable dynamics of a planar Kepler billiard inside or outside an elliptic reflection wall, with the Kepler center occupying one of its foci. We identify the associated elliptic curve on which the dynamics is linearized, and the shift defined thereon. We also discuss explicit conditions on $n$-periodicity using Cayley's criteria.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Thermodynamic Formalism: Mean-field Phase Transitions, Large Deviations and Bogoliubov's Variational Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega =\{1,2,\ldots ,d\}^{\mathbb{N}}$, $T$ be the shift acting on $\Omega $, $\mathcal{P}(T)$ the set of $T$-invariant probabilities. Given a H\"{o}lder potential $A$ and a continuous function $F$, we investigate the probabilities $\rho _{F,A}$ that are maximizers of the nonlinear pressure
  $\mathfrak{P}_{F,A}:=\sup_{\rho \in \mathcal{P}(T)}\{ F(\int A(x)\rho (\mathrm{d}x))+h(\rho )\} .$
  $\rho _{F,A}$} is called a nonlinear equilibrium; a nonlinear phase transition occurs when there is more than one. In the case $F$\ is convex or concave, we combine Varadhan's lemma and Bogoliubov's variational principle to characterize them via the linear pressure problem and self-consistency conditions. Let $\mu \in \mathcal{P}(T)$ be the maximal entropy measure, $\varphi _{n}(x)=n^{-1}(\varphi (x)+\varphi (T(x))+\cdots +\varphi (T^{n-1}(x)))$ and $\beta &gt;0$.}\newline
  (I) We also consider the limit measure $\mathfrak{m}$ on $ \Omega $, so that $\forall \psi \in C(\Omega )$,
  $\int \psi (x)\,\mathfrak{m}\,( \mathrm{d}x)\,\,=\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\,\int \,\psi (x)\,\,\,e^{ \frac{\beta n}{2}\,\,A_{n}((x)^{2}}\,\,\mu \,(\mathrm{d}x)\,}{\int e^{\frac{ \beta n}{2}\,\,A_{n}((x)^{2}}\mu \,(\mathrm{d}x)\,\,}.$
  We call $\mathfrak{m}$ a \textit{quadratic mean-field Gibbs probability
  (II) Via subsequences $n_{k}$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$, we study the limit measure $\mathfrak{M}$ on $\Omega $, so that $\forall \psi \in C(\Omega )$,
  $\int \psi (x)\mathfrak{M}(\mathrm{d} x)=\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\,\int \psi _{n_{k}}(x)e^{\frac{\beta n_{k}}{2}A_{n_{k}}(x)^{2}}\mu (\mathrm{d}x)}{\int e^{\frac{\beta n_{k}}{2} A_{n_{k}}(x)^{2}}\mu (\mathrm{d}x)}.$
  We call $\mathfrak{M}$ a quadratic mean-field equilibrium probability; it is shift-invariant.
  Explicit examples are given.</description>

      <title>A multifractal analysis for escaping trajectories on free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a free group extension of a subshift of finite type $\sigma:\Sigma\rightarrow\Sigma$, and consider three sets of points in $\Sigma$ to which the corresponding trajectories on the free group escape to a given point in the Gromov boundary of the free group in three different senses. Under very mild conditions, we provide a common positive lower bound for the $u$-dimensions of these three sets. We also show that the lower bound is equal to the $u$-dimensions of these three sets when the extension and $u$ have certain symmetries. Moreover, we apply our results to geodesic flows on free group covers of Schottky surfaces, and show that there exists a dimension gap between the three sets we considered and the entire escaping set.</description>

      <title>Shaping the Koopman dictionary by learning on the Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a powerful tool to construct linear predictors of nonlinear dynamical systems by approximating the action of the Koopman operator on a subspace spanned by finitely many observable functions. However, its accuracy heavily depends on the choice of the observables, which remains a challenge. We propose a systematic framework to identify and shape observable dictionaries, reduce projection errors, and achieve approximately invariant subspaces. To this end, we leverage optimisation on the Grassmann manifold and exploit inherent geometric properties for computational efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate improved prediction accuracy and efficiency. In conclusion, we propose a novel approach to efficiently shape the Koopman dictionary using differential-geometric concepts for optimisation on manifolds resulting in enhanced data-driven Koopman surrogates for nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation with Spatio-Temporal Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2438</link>
      <description>arXiv:0907.2438v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We investigate the dynamics of solitons of the cubic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE) with the following perturbations: non-parametric spatio-temporal driving of the form $f(x,t) = a \exp[i K(t) x]$, damping, and a linear term which serves to stabilize the driven soliton. Using the time evolution of norm, momentum and energy, or, alternatively, a Lagrangian approach, we develop a Collective-Coordinate-Theory which yields a set of ODEs for our four collective coordinates. These ODEs are solved analytically and numerically for the case of a constant, spatially periodic force $f(x)$. The soliton position exhibits oscillations around a mean trajectory with constant velocity. This means that the soliton performs, on the average, a unidirectional motion although the spatial average of the force vanishes. The amplitude of the oscillations is much smaller than the period of $f(x)$. In order to find out for which regions the above solutions are stable, we calculate the time evolution of the soliton momentum $P(t)$ and soliton velocity $V(t)$: This is a parameter representation of a curve $P(V)$ which is visited by the soliton while time evolves. Our conjecture is that the soliton becomes unstable, if this curve has a branch with negative slope. This conjecture is fully confirmed by our simulations for the perturbed NLSE. Moreover, this curve also yields a good estimate for the soliton lifetime: the soliton lives longer, the shorter the branch with negative slope is.</description>

      <title>A refined empirical stability criterion for nonlinear Schroedinger solitons under spatiotemporal forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5609</link>
      <description>arXiv:1106.5609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of travelling oscillating solitons of the cubic NLS equation under an external spatiotemporal forcing of the form $f(x,t) = a \exp[iK(t)x]$. For the case of time-independent forcing a stability criterion for these solitons, which is based on a collective coordinate theory, was recently conjectured. We show that the proposed criterion has a limited applicability and present a refined criterion which is generally applicable, as confirmed by direct simulations. This includes more general situations where $K(t)$ is harmonic or biharmonic, with or without a damping term in the NLS equation. The refined criterion states that the soliton will be unstable if the "stability curve" $p(\v)$, where $p(t)$ and $\v(t)$ are the normalized momentum and the velocity of the soliton, has a section with a negative slope. Moreover, for the case of constant $K$ and zero damping we use the collective coordinate solutions to compute a "phase portrait" of the soliton where its dynamics is represented by two-dimensional projections of its trajectories in the four-dimensional space of collective coordinates. We conjecture, and confirm by simulations, that the soliton is unstable if a section of the resulting closed curve on the portrait has a negative sense of rotation.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lagrange-Dirac systems with boundary energy flow II: Field theories with bundle-valued forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Part I of this paper introduced the infinite dimensional Lagrange-Dirac theory for physical systems on the space of differential forms over a smooth manifold with boundary. This approach is particularly well-suited for systems involving energy exchange through the boundary, as it is built upon a restricted dual space -- a vector subspace of the topological dual of the configuration space -- that captures information about both the interior dynamics and boundary interactions. Consequently, the resulting dynamical equations naturally incorporate boundary energy flow. In this second part, the theory is extended to encompass vector-bundle-valued differential forms and non-Abelian gauge theories. To account for two commonly used forms of energy flux and boundary power densities, we introduce two distinct but equivalent formulations of the restricted dual. The results are derived from both geometric and variational viewpoints and are illustrated through applications to matter and gauge field theories. The interaction between gauge and matter fields is also addressed, along with the associated boundary conditions, applied to the case of the Yang-Mills-Higgs equations.</description>

      <title>Plankton-Oxygen Dynamics in the Context of Climate Change: A Fractional Model with A Probability Density Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze how climate change affects marine oxygen production by modeling plankton--oxygen dynamics with a fractional-order nonlinear system and establishing rigorous conditions for the model's well-posedness. We formulate a three-dimensional system $d^\alpha x(t)/dt^\alpha = A x(t) + f(x(t))$, where $A$ is a diagonal $3\times 3$ matrix and $f$ is nonlinear. We (i) rigorously state the model, (ii) derive a Lipschitz constant for $f$ under suitable assumptions, and (iii) prove existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data using a fractional formula with a probability density kernel and a generalized Gr"onwall inequality. Under the stated conditions, $f$ satisfies a computable Lipschitz bound that yields existence and uniqueness of solutions for the fractional system, and the solutions depend continuously on initial conditions, establishing the well-posedness of the plankton--oxygen model. We introduce a fractional, PDF-kernel--based framework for plankton--oxygen dynamics and provide general proofs of well-posedness via a generalized Gr"onwall approach, capturing memory effects that classical integer-order models miss. These results justify numerical simulations and sensitivity analyses of fractional marine-ecosystem models, providing a sound basis for testing mitigation and management strategies affecting oxygen dynamics and supporting evidence-based policies for protecting marine ecosystems under global warming.</description>

      <title>Koopman Operator for Stability Analysis: Theory with a Linear--Radial Product Reproducing Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koopman operator, as a fully linear representation of nonlinear dynamical systems, if well-defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), can be efficiently learned from data. For stability analysis and control-related problems, it is desired that the defining RKHS of the Koopman operator should account for both the stability of an equilibrium point (as a local property) and the regularity of the dynamics on the state space (as a global property). To this end, we show that by using the product kernel formed by the linear kernel and a Wendland radial kernel, the resulting RKHS is invariant under the action of Koopman operator (under certain smoothness conditions). Furthermore, when the equilibrium is asymptotically stable, the spectrum of Koopman operator is provably confined inside the unit circle, and escapes therefrom upon bifurcation. Thus, the learned Koopman operator with provable probabilistic error bound provides a stability certificate. In addition to numerical verification, we further discuss how such a fundamental spectrum--stability relation would be useful for Koopman-based control.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of topological entropy along the Ricci flow near a hyperbolic metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2004, Manning showed that the topological entropy of the geodesic flow of a closed surface of non-constant negative curvature is strictly decreasing along the normalized Ricci flow, and he asked if an analogous result holds in higher dimensions for metrics in a neighborhood of a hyperbolic metric. In this paper, we affirmatively answer this question. Namely, we show that the topological entropy of the geodesic flow of a closed Riemannian manifold that carries a hyperbolic metric is indeed strictly decreasing along the normalized Ricci flow starting from a metric of variable negative sectional curvature sufficiently close to the hyperbolic metric.</description>

      <title>Transitivities of maps of generalized topological spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present several new findings regarding the concepts of orbit-transitivity, strict orbit-transitivity, $\omega$-transitivity, and $\mu$-open-set transitivity for self-maps on generalized topological spaces.
  Let $(X,\mu)$ denote a generalized topological space. A point $x \in X$ is said to be \textit{quasi-$\mu$-isolated} if there exists a $\mu$-open set $U$ such that $x \in U$ and $i_\mu(U \setminus c_\mu(\{x\})) = \emptyset$. We prove that $x$ is a quasi-$\mu$-isolated point of $X$ precisely when there exists a $\mu$-dense subset $D$ of $X$ for which $x$ is a $\mu_D$-isolated point of $D$. Moreover, in the case where $X$ has no quasi-$\mu$-isolated points, we establish that a map $f: X \to X$ is orbit-transitive (or strictly orbit-transitive) if and only if it is $\omega$-transitive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of operators connected with the geodesic flow on the modular surface. We show certain spectral information is retained after expanding their domain to the space of $\alpha$-H\"older continuous functions on the unit interval. For example, the point spectra associated with the Maass cusp forms and non-trivial zeroes of the Riemann zeta function to the right of the critical line remain unchanged when the H\"older constant is $(1/2+\varepsilon)$ and $3/4$ respectively. We briefly consider a three-term functional equation introduced by Lewis in the H\"older setting and provide a partial classification of solutions in this setting.</description>

      <title>Koopman global linearization of contact dynamics for robot locomotion and manipulation enables elaborate control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling robots that dynamically engage in contact with their environment is a pressing challenge. Whether a legged robot making-and-breaking contact with a floor, or a manipulator grasping objects, contact is everywhere. Unfortunately, the switching of dynamics at contact boundaries makes control difficult. Predictive controllers face non-convex optimization problems when contact is involved. Here, we overcome this difficulty by applying Koopman operators to subsume the segmented dynamics due to contact changes into a unified, globally-linear model in an embedding space. We show that viscoelastic contact at robot-environment interactions underpins the use of Koopman operators without approximation to control inputs. This methodology enables the convex Model Predictive Control of a legged robot, and the real-time control of a manipulator engaged in dynamic pushing. In this work, we show that our method allows robots to discover elaborate control strategies in real-time over time horizons with multiple contact changes, and the method is applicable to broad fields beyond robotics.</description>

      <title>Surjunctivity does not characterize cosoficity of invariant random subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A group is surjunctive if every injective cellular automaton on it is also surjective. Gottschalk famously conjectured that all groups are surjunctive. This remains a central open problem in symbolic dynamics and descriptive set theory. Gromov and Weiss termed the notion of sofic groups, and proved that all such groups are surjunctive, providing the largest class of groups which satisfy Gottschalk's conjecture. It is still open to decide whether all groups are sofic. This became a major open problem in group theory, and is related to other well known problems such as the Aldous--Lyons conjecture in probability theory and to Connes' embedding problem in the theory of operator algebras.
  A complementary natural question to ask is: Does the reverse implication to Gromov and Weiss' result holds? Namely, are all surjunctive groups sofic? As currently there are no known non-sofic groups, answering this problem in the negative in the category of groups is still out of reach. This paper resolves this problem in the generalized setup of invariant random subgroups of free groups (IRSs), where non (co)sofic objects were recently shown to exist by Lubotzky, Vidick and the two authors. Specifically, we prove that there exists a surjunctive non (co)sofic IRS, resolving the aforementioned problem in the negative. Our proof uses a complexity theoretic approach, and in particular a recent development due to Manzoor, as well as the theory of Rokhlin entropy developed by Seward and others. As a byproduct of our proof technique, the non (co)sofic IRS we provide satisfies a condition stronger than surjunctivity; it satisfies a version of Seward's maximal Rokhlin entropy of Bernoulli Shifts (RBS) criterion.</description>

      <title>A Weak Penalty Neural ODE for Learning Chaotic Dynamics from Noisy Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems from observational data is essential for several applications across science and engineering. A key challenge, however, is that real-world measurements are often corrupted by noise, which severely degrades the performance of data-driven models. Particularly, in chaotic dynamical systems, where small errors amplify rapidly, it is challenging to identify a data-driven model from noisy data that achieves short-term accuracy while preserving long-term invariant properties. In this paper, we propose the use of the weak formulation as a complementary approach to the classical strong formulation of data-driven time-series forecasting models. Specifically, we focus on the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) architecture. Unlike the standard strong formulation, which relies on the discretization of the NODE followed by optimization, the weak formulation constrains the model using a set of integrated residuals over temporal subdomains. While such a formulation yields an effective NODE model, we discover that the performance of a NODE can be further enhanced by employing this weak formulation as a penalty alongside the classical strong formulation-based learning. Through numerical demonstrations, we illustrate that our proposed training strategy, which we coined as the Weak-Penalty NODE (WP-NODE), achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy and exceptional robustness across benchmark chaotic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A kernel method for the learning of Wasserstein geometric flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wasserstein gradient and Hamiltonian flows have emerged as essential tools for modeling complex dynamics in the natural sciences, with applications ranging from partial differential equations (PDEs) and optimal transport to quantum mechanics and information geometry. Despite their significance, the inverse identification of potential functions and interaction kernels underlying these flows remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we tackle this challenge by addressing the inverse problem of simultaneously recovering the potential function and interaction kernel from discretized observations of the density flow. We formulate the problem as an optimization task that minimizes a loss function specifically designed to enforce the underlying variational structure of Wasserstein flows, ensuring consistency with the geometric properties of the density manifold. Our framework employs a kernel-based operator approach using the associated Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which provides a closed-form representation of the unknown components. Furthermore, a comprehensive error analysis is conducted, providing convergence rates under adaptive regularization parameters as the temporal and spatial discretization mesh sizes tend to zero. Finally, a stability analysis is presented to bridge the gap between discrete trajectory data and continuous-time flow dynamics for the Wasserstein Hamiltonian flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of vision-based system identification techniques in quadrotor modeling and control. Through experiments and analysis, we address the complexities and limitations of quadrotor modeling, particularly in relation to thrust and drag coefficients. Grey-box modeling is employed to mitigate uncertainties, and the effectiveness of an onboard vision system is evaluated. An LQR controller is designed based on a system identification model using data from the onboard vision system. The results demonstrate consistent performance between the models, validating the efficacy of vision based system identification. This study highlights the potential of vision-based techniques in enhancing quadrotor modeling and control, contributing to improved performance and operational capabilities. Our findings provide insights into the usability and consistency of these techniques, paving the way for future research in quadrotor performance enhancement, fault detection, and decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Aerial Image Stitching Using IMU Data from a UAV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for aerial photography and remote sensing applications. One of the main challenges is to stitch together multiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area. Featurebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from errors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this, several approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment techniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for stitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as estimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images, correcting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We then use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images together. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study subgradient sequences of locally Lipschitz functions definable in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure. We show that the diameter of any subgradient sequence is related to the variation in function values, with error terms dominated by a double summation of step sizes. Consequently, we prove that bounded subgradient sequences converge if the step sizes are of order $1/k$. The proof uses Lipschitz $L$-regular stratifications in o-minimal structures to analyze subgradient sequences via their projections onto different strata.</description>

Abstract: Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\vec{\alpha}=(\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n)\in (0,\infty)^n$, $\vec{\beta}=(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_n)\in (\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\})^n$, $\vec{f}:=(f_1,\ldots, f_n)\in \mathcal{S}^n(\mathbb{R})$ and set $$H_{n,\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}}(\vec{f})(x):=p.v. \int_{\mathbb{R}} f_1(x+\beta_1 t^{\alpha_1})\ldots f_n(x+\beta_n t^{\alpha_n}) \frac{dt}{t}, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}\,,$$ with $\mathcal{M}_{n,\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}}$ being its maximal operator counterpart. Assume that $1&lt;p_j&lt;\infty$ and $\frac{1}{2}&lt;r&lt;\infty$ satisfy $\sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{p_j}=\frac{1}{r}$.
  Under the \emph{non-resonant} assumption that $\{\alpha_j\}_{j=1}^n$ are pairwise distinct we show that $$\|H_{3,\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}}(\vec{f})\|_{L^r}\lesssim_{\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}} \prod_{j=1}^3\|f_j\|_{L^{p_j}}\qquad \textrm{and} \qquad \|\mathcal{M}_{n,\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}}\|_{L^r}\lesssim_{n,\vec{\alpha},\vec{\beta}} \prod_{j=1}^n\|f_j\|_{L^{p_j}} \qquad \forall\:n\geq 2\,.$$ (For the maximal operator the boundedness range can be extended to include the endpoint $\infty$ for both $p_j$ and $r$.)</description>

Abstract: We first explain how to endow the space of subequivalence relations of any non-singular countable equivalence relation with a Polish topology, extending the framework of Kechris' recent monograph on subequivalence relations of probability measure-preserving (p.m.p.) countable equivalence relations. We then restrict to p.m.p. equivalence relations and discuss dense orbits therein for the natural action of the full group and of the automorphism group of the relation. Our main result is a characterization of the subequivalence relations having a dense orbit in the space of subequivalence relations of the ergodic hyperfinite p.m.p. equivalence relation. We also show that in this setup, all full groups orbits are meager. We finally provide a few Borel complexity calculations of natural subsets in spaces of subequivalence relations using a natural metric we call the uniform metric. This answers some questions from an earlier version of Kechris' monograph.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of quasipotentials via a combined data-driven method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasipotential function allows for comprehension and prediction of the escape mechanisms from metastable states in nonlinear dynamical systems. This function acts as a natural extension of the potential function for non-gradient systems and it unveils important properties such as the maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates and expected exit times of the system. Here, we demonstrate how to discover parsimonious equations for the quasipotential directly from data. Leveraging machine learning, we combine two existing data-driven techniques, namely a neural network and a sparse regression algorithm, specifically designed to symbolically describe multistable energy landscapes. First, we employ a vanilla neural network enhanced with a renormalization and rescaling procedure to achieve an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field. Next, we apply symbolic regression to extract the downhill and circulatory components of the decomposition, ensuring consistency with the underlying dynamics. This symbolic reconstruction involves a simultaneous regression that imposes constraints on both the orthogonality condition and the vector field. We implement and benchmark our approach using an archetypal model with a known exact quasipotential, as well as a nanomechanical resonator system. We further demonstrate its applicability to noisy data and to a four-dimensional system. Our model-unbiased analytical forms of the quasipotential is of interest to a wide range of applications aimed at assessing metastability and energy landscapes, serving to parametrically capture the distinctive fingerprint of the fluctuating dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cellular automata can really solve the parity problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining properties of an arbitrary binary sequence is a challenging task if only local processing is allowed. Among these properties, the determination of the parity of 1s by distributed consensus has been a recurring endeavour in the context of automata networks. In its most standard formulation, a one-dimensional cellular automaton rule should process any odd-sized cyclic configuration and lead the lattice to converge to the homogeneous fixed point of 0s if the parity of 1s is even and to the homogeneous fixed point of 1s, otherwise. The only known solution to this problem with a single rule was given by Betel, de Oliveira and Flocchini (coined BFO rule after the authors' initials). However, three years later the authors of the BFO rule realised that the rule would fail for some specific configuration and proposed a computationally sound fix, but a proof could not be worked out. Here we provide another fix to the BFO rule along with a full proof, therefore reassuring that a single-rule solution to the problem really does exist.</description>

Abstract: If $\Omega$ is an open subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and $p&gt;0$ then the elements of $W^{1,p}(\Omega)$ can be seen as the pairs $(f,F)\in L^p(\Omega)\times (L^p(\Omega))^d$ such that there exists a sequence $(f_n)_n$ of $C^1$ functions converging to $f$ in $L^p(\Omega)$ such that $(\nabla f_n)_n$ converges to $F$ in $(L^p(\Omega))^d$. If $p\geq 1$ the pair $(f,F)$ is defined by $f$ as $F$ must be the distributional gradient of $f$.
  If $0&lt;p&lt;1$, there is, in general, a disconnection between $f$ and $F$. For instance, Peetre (see \cite{peetre}) proved that, if $d=1$, this disconnection is complete, as any pair $(f,F)\in L^p(\Omega)\times L^p(\Omega)$ is an element of $W^{1,p}(\Omega)$. So $F$ is not defined by $f$ in any sense, as it can be any element of $L^p(\Omega)$.
  In this paper we obtain results of this type, concerning $C^1$ homeomorphisms of $\Omega$ that are volume preserving if $d\geq 2$.
  We will show, in particular, that if $H:\Omega\rightarrow SO(d)$ is a Riemann integrable function, then there exists a sequence $(f_n)_n$ of orientation and volume preserving $C^\infty$ homeomorphisms of $\Omega$ uniformly converging to the identity of $\Omega$ and such that $\left(Df_n\right)_n$ converges to $H$ in $L^p(\Omega)^{d^2}$.
  If $d=1$ and $I$ is a bounded interval, we will prove that a pair $(f,F)\in C^1(I)\times L^p(I)$, such that $f'\neq 0$, $f', (f^{-1})'\in L^r(I)$ for some $r&gt;1$, admits a sequence $(f_n)_n$ of $C^1$ homeomorphisms uniformly converging to $f$ and such that $(f_n')_n$ converges in $L^p(I)$ to $F$, if and only if $0\leq \frac{F}{f'}\leq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a link between billiards in convex plane domains and Hofer's geometry, an area of symplectic topology. For smooth strictly convex billiard tables, we prove that the Hofer distance between the corresponding billiard ball maps admits an upper bound in terms of a simple geometric distance between the tables. We use this result to show that the billiard ball map of a convex polygon lies in the completion, with respect to Hofer's metric, of the group of smooth area-preserving maps of the annulus. Finally, we discuss related connections to dynamics and pose several open problems.</description>

      <title>Geometric, topological and dynamical properties of conformally symplectic systems, normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds, and scattering maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformally symplectic diffeomorphisms $f:M \rightarrow M$ transform a symplectic form $\omega$ on a manifold M into a multiple of itself, $f^* \omega = \eta \omega$. We assume $\omega$ is bounded, as some of the results may fail otherwise. We show that there are deep interactions between the topological properties of the manifold, the dynamical properties of the map, and the geometry of invariant manifolds. We show that, when the symplectic form is not exact, the possible conformal factors $\eta$ are related to topological properties of the manifold. For some manifolds the conformal factors are restricted to be algebraic numbers. We also find relations between dynamical properties (relations between growth rate of vectors and $\eta$) and symplectic properties. Normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIM) and their (un)stable manifolds are important landmarks that organize long-term dynamical behaviour. We prove that a NHIM is symplectic if and only if the rates satisfy certain pairing rules and if and only if the rates and the conformal factor satisfy certain (natural) inequalities. Homoclinic excursions to NHIMs are quantitatively described by scattering maps. These maps give the trajectory asymptotic in the future as a function of the trajectory asymptotic in the past. We prove that the scattering maps are symplectic even if the dynamics is dissipative. We also show that if the symplectic form is exact, then the scattering maps are exact, even if the dynamics is not exact. We give a variational interpretation of scattering maps in the conformally symplectic setting. We also show that similar properties of NHIMs and scattering maps hold in the case when $\omega$ is presymplectic. In dynamical systems with many rates (e.g., quasi-integrable systems near multiple resonances), pre-symplectic geometries appear naturally.</description>

      <title>On dynamical invariants of coadjoint orbits of 3D volume-preserving diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The helicity, or asymptotic linking number, is a functional of exact volume-preserving vector fields on 3-manifolds, invariant under volume-preserving transformations. It is known to exhibit remarkable uniqueness properties: many invariant functionals reduce to functions of helicity. We examine how severely this uniqueness can fail. On integral homology spheres with the $C^{1}$-topology, the failure is extreme: for every $C^{1}$-open set of nonvanishing exact fields of fixed helicity, some other global dynamical invariant is continuous and non-constant in that set; the Ruelle invariant if some field is non-Anosov, and topological entropy otherwise. In particular, on the three-sphere, the Ruelle invariant is everywhere independent of helicity. This implies, in a very strong sense, a negative answer to a question of Arnold and Khesin on the somewhere density of coadjoint orbits of 3D volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, when considered for the $C^1$-topology. On arbitrary three-manifolds, we also answer the question in the negative using local rather than global invariants.</description>

      <title>Practicalities of State-Dependent and Threshold Delay Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Delays are ubiquitous in applied problems, but often do not arise as the simple constant discrete delays that analysts and numerical analysts like to treat. In this chapter we show how state-dependent delays arise naturally when modeling and the consequences that follow. We treat discrete state-dependent delays, and delays implicitly defined by threshold conditions. We will consider modeling, formulation as dynamical systems, linearization, and numerical techniques. For discrete state-dependent delays we show how breaking points can be tracked efficiently to preserve the order of numerical methods for simulating solutions. For threshold conditions we will discuss how a velocity ratio term arises in models, and present a heuristic linearization method that avoids Banach spaces and sun-star calculus, making the method accessible to a wider audience. We will also discuss numerical implementations of threshold and distributed delay problems which allows them to be treated numerically with standard software.</description>

Abstract: We construct geometrically infinite hyperbolic surfaces supporting horocycles with tailored recurrence properties. In particular, we obtain the first examples of non-trivial minimal horocyclic orbit closures and of infinite locally-finite conservative horocyclic invariant measures which are singular with respect to the geodesic flow. Other examples include surfaces supporting horocyclic orbit closures of arbitrary Hausdorff dimension in $(1,2)$.</description>

Abstract: We quantitatively study the mixing rate of randomly shifted alternating shears on the torus. This flow was introduced by Pierrehumbert '94, and was recently shown to be exponentially mixing. In this work, we quantify the dependence of the exponential mixing rate on the flow amplitude. Our approach is based on constructing an explicit Lyapunov function and a coupling trajectory for the associated two-point Markov chain, together with an application of the quantitative Harris theorem.</description>

Abstract: Following the approach of Bj$\ddot{\text{o}}$rklund and Gorodnik, we have considered the discrepancy function for lattice point counting on domains that can be nicely tessellated by the action of a diagonal semigroup. We have shown that suitably normalized discrepancy functions for lattice point counting on certain tessellated domains satisfy a non-degenerate central limit theorem. Furthermore, we have also addressed the same problem for affine and congruence lattice point counting, proving analogous non-degenerate central limit theorems for them. The main ingredients of the proofs are the method of cumulants and quantitative multiple mixing estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the long-term behavior of positive solutions for the following parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis competition system with weak singular sensitivity and logistic source
  \begin{equation}
  \label{abstract-eq} \begin{cases} u_t=\Delta u-\chi \nabla\cdot (\frac{u}{v^{\lambda}} \nabla v) +ru- \mu u^2, \quad &amp;x\in \Omega,\cr 0=\Delta v- \alpha v +\beta u,\quad &amp;x\in \Omega, \cr \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial \nu}=0,\quad &amp;x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases}\, \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N (N \ge 2)$ is a smooth bounded domain, the parameters $\chi,\, r, \, \mu, \, \alpha,\,\beta$ are positive constants and $\lambda \in (0,1).$
  In this article, for all suitably smooth initial data $u_0\in C^0(\bar\Omega)$ with $u_0 \not \equiv 0,$ it has been proven that:
  First, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_1^*(p,\lambda,\chi,\beta)$ such that any globally defined positive solution is $L^p(\Omega)$-bounded with $p \ge 2.$ Next, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_2^*(N,\lambda,\chi,\beta)$ such that any globally defined classical solutions is globally bounded. Third, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_3^*(N,\lambda,\chi,\beta)$ such that any globally defined positive solution is uniformly bounded above and below eventually by some positive constants that are independent of its initial function $u_0.$ Last, there exists $\mu &gt; \mu_4^*(N,\lambda,\chi,\alpha,\beta,r,\Omega)$ such that any globally bounded classical solution to system (0.1) exponentially converges to the constant steady state $(\frac{r}{\mu},\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\frac{r}{\mu}).$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the systolic $S^1$-index of a convex body as the Fadell-Rabinowitz index of the space of generalized systoles associated with its boundary. We show that this index is a symplectic invariant. Using the systolic $S^1$-index, we introduce the notion of generalized Zoll convex bodies and prove that this definition coincides with the classical one when the convex body satisfies the uniqueness of systoles property, that is, when through every point passes at most one systole. Moreover, we show that generalized Zoll convex bodies can be characterized in terms of their Gutt-Hutchings capacities, and we prove that the space of generalized Zoll convex bodies is closed in the space of all convex bodies. As a corollary, we establish that if the interior of a convex body is symplectomorphic to the interior of a ball, then the convex body is generalized Zoll, and in particular Zoll if it satisfies the uniqueness of systoles property. Finally, we discuss several examples.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lagrange-Dirac systems with boundary energy flow I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new geometric approach to systems with boundary energy flow is developed using infinite-dimensional Dirac structures within the Lagrangian formalism. This framework satisfies a list of consistency criteria with the geometric setting of finite-dimensional mechanics. In particular, the infinite-dimensional Dirac structure can be constructed from the canonical symplectic form on the system's phase space; the system's evolution equations can be derived equivalently from either a variational perspective or a Dirac structure perspective; the variational principle employed is a direct extension of Hamilton's principle in classical mechanics; and the approach allows for a process of system interconnection within its formulation. This is achieved by developing an appropriate infinite dimensional version of the previously developed Lagrange-Dirac dynamical systems. A key step in this construction is the careful choice of a suitable dual space to the configuration space, specifically, a subspace of the topological dual that captures the system's behavior in both the interior and the boundary, while allowing for a natural extension of the canonical geometric structures of mechanics. This paper focuses on systems where the configuration space consists of differential forms on a smooth manifold with a boundary. To illustrate our theory, several examples, including nonlinear wave equations, the telegraph equation, and the Maxwell equations are presented.</description>

      <title>Flat Convergence of Pushforwards of Rectifiable Currents Under $C^0-$Diffeomorphism Limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the action on currents and differential forms on compact Riemannian manifolds under $C^0$-limits of diffeomorphisms. Using tools from geometric analysis, measure theory, and homotopy theory, we establish several convergence theorems. We give conditions under which pullbacks of differential forms by a sequence of smooth diffeomorphisms converge uniformly (in the $C^0$ norm), and pushforwards of currents by smooth diffeomorphisms exhibit weak-* convergence. We prove that pushforwards of rectifiable currents are convergent in the flat norm, a property of particular interest in the study of singular geometric objects. These stability findings offer tools for the study of geometric structures, including applications to the stability of groups of symplectomorphisms, cosymplectomorphisms, volume-preserving transformations, and contact transformations under $C^0$ perturbations. We highlight applicability in measure theory and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian neural ODEs: Measuring the existence of a Lagrangian with Helmholtz metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural ODEs are a widely used, powerful machine learning technique in particular for physics. However, not every solution is physical in that it is an Euler-Lagrange equation. We present Helmholtz metrics to quantify this resemblance for a given ODE and demonstrate their capabilities on several fundamental systems with noise. We combine them with a second order neural ODE to form a Lagrangian neural ODE, which allows to learn Euler-Lagrange equations in a direct fashion and with zero additional inference cost. We demonstrate that, using only positional data, they can distinguish Lagrangian and non-Lagrangian systems and improve the neural ODE solutions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically large free semigroups in Zariski dense discrete subgroups of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected algebraic semisimple real Lie group with finite center and no compact factors, and let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of $G$. We show that $\Gamma$ contains free, finitely generated subsemigroups whose critical exponents are arbitrarily close to that of $\Gamma$. Furthermore, these subsemigroups are Zariski dense in $G$ and $P$-Anosov in the sense of Kassel--Potrie. This shows that no gap phenomenon holds for critical exponents of discrete subsemigroups of Lie groups, which is in contrast with Leuzinger's critical exponent gap theorem for infinite covolume discrete subgroups of Lie groups with Kazhdan's property (T), proven in 2003.
  As an application, we prove that the critical exponent is lower semicontinuous in the Chabauty topology, in the following sense: if a sequence of Zariski dense discrete subgroups $\{\Gamma_{n}\}$ of $G$ converges in the Chabauty topology to a Zariski dense discrete subgroup $\Gamma$, then $\liminf_{n \to \infty} \delta(\Gamma_{n}) \geq \delta(\Gamma)$.</description>

      <title>A survey and a result on inhomogeneous quadratic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey recent work done on the values at integer points of irrational inhomogeneous quadratic forms, namely, inhomogeneous analogues of the famous Oppenheim conjecture. We also prove that the set of such forms in two variables whose set of values at integer points avoids a given countable set not containing zero, has full Hausdorff dimension. Moreover, we consider the more refined variant of this problem, where the shift is fixed and the form is allowed to vary. The strategy is to translate the problems to homogeneous dynamics and deduce the theorems from their dynamical counterparts. While our approach is inspired by the work of Kleinbock and Weiss, the dynamical results can be deduced from more general results of An, Guan, and Kleinbock.</description>
