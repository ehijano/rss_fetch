      <title>Comparative Analysis of Thermal Models for Test Masses in Next-Generation Gravitational Wave Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate thermal modeling of Terminal Test Masses (TTMs) is crucial for optimizing the sensitivity of gravitational wave interferometers like Virgo. In fact, in such gravitational wave detectors even minimal laser power absorption can induce performance-limiting thermal effects. This paper presents a detailed investigation into the steady-state thermal behavior of TTMs. In particular, future scenarios of increased intracavity laser beam power and optical coating absorption are considered. We develop and compare two numerical models: a comprehensive model incorporating volumetric heat absorption in both the multilayer coating and the bulk substrate, and a simplified reduced model where the coating's thermal impact is represented as an effective surface boundary condition on the substrate. Our simulations were focused on a ternary coating design, which is a candidate for use in next-generation detectors. Results reveal that higher coating absorption localizes peak temperatures near the coating--vacuum interface. Importantly, the comparative analysis demonstrates that temperature predictions from the reduced model differ from the detailed model by only milli-Kelvins, a discrepancy often within the experimental uncertainties of the system's thermo-physical parameters. This finding suggests that computationally efficient reduced models can provide sufficiently accurate results for thermal management and first-order distortion analyses. Moreover, the critical role of accurately characterizing the total power absorbed by the coating is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Deep Learning for Surface Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reproducible deep learning framework is presented for surface metrology to predict surface texture parameters together with their reported standard uncertainties. Using a multi-instrument dataset spanning tactile and optical systems, measurement system type classification is addressed alongside coordinated regression of Ra, Rz, RONt and their uncertainty targets (Ra_uncert, Rz_uncert, RONt_uncert). Uncertainty is modelled via quantile and heteroscedastic heads with post-hoc conformal calibration to yield calibrated intervals. On a held-out set, high fidelity was achieved by single-target regressors (R2: Ra 0.9824, Rz 0.9847, RONt 0.9918), with two uncertainty targets also well modelled (Ra_uncert 0.9899, Rz_uncert 0.9955); RONt_uncert remained difficult (R2 0.4934). The classifier reached 92.85% accuracy and probability calibration was essentially unchanged after temperature scaling (ECE 0.00504 -&gt; 0.00503 on the test split). Negative transfer was observed for naive multi-output trunks, with single-target models performing better. These results provide calibrated predictions suitable to inform instrument selection and acceptance decisions in metrological workflows.</description>

      <title>Basic considerations in the design of an electrostatic electron monochromator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monochromators are an essential component in electron microscopy and spectroscopy for enhancing the spatial and energy resolution. However, its adoption in scanning electron microscopes remains limited because of its high cost and operational complexity. Through a thin-deflector analysis of an electrostatic homogeneous-field deflector, the extreme sensitivity of current monochromators to power supply drift and mechanical imperfections is demonstrated. These stringent alignment requirements for achieving optimal energy resolution often necessitate the use of additional correcting elements, adding to both cost and complexity. We demonstrate that the fringe-field deflector is instead less sensitive to these issues. Hence, a cost effective and simple monochromator design approach based on pure fringe fields is proposed. This monochromator does not need extra correcting elements and its optimal energy resolution is achieved by including momentary deceleration lenses surrounding the main deflector. This fully electrostatic design could be realized using MEMS technology, offering a simpler and more accessible approach for filtering beam energies.</description>

      <title>Real-time dynamics of VCMA-assisted switching of magnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voltage control of magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) induced by charge accumulation is typically considered as an ultrafast process, enabling energy-efficient and high-speed magnetization switching in spintronic devices. In this work, we investigate the real-time dynamics of VCMA-assisted switching of magnetic tunnel junctions via relaxation in a magnetic field. We show that device-dependent charging effects and magnetic granularity in the free layer limit the switching speed at applied voltages close to the critical switching threshold. Increasing the voltage or the applied magnetic field reduces the incubation delay and total switching time to below a few ns. Micromagnetic simulations incorporating the finite charging times of the tunnel junction and the granularity of the magnetic film reproduce the experimental results, providing critical insights into optimizing VCMA-driven magnetization control for memory and logic applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic tunnel junction as a real-time entropy source: Field-Programmable Gate Array based random bit generation without post-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method to generate application-ready truly random bits from a magnetic tunnel junction driven by a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We implement a real-time feedback loop that stabilizes the switching probability near 50\% and apply an XOR operation, both on the FPGA, to suppress short-term correlations, together mitigating long-term drift and bias in the bitstream. This combined approach enables NIST-compliant random bit generation at 5~Mb/s without post-processing, providing a practical hardware solution for fast and reliable true random number generation. Beyond cryptographic applications, these capabilities open opportunities for stochastic hardware accelerators, probabilistic computing, and large-scale modeling where real-time access to unbiased randomness is essential.</description>

      <title>Circuit-based cavity magnonics in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study nonperturbative strong-coupling phenomena in cavity magnonics systems in which the uniform magnetization dynamics (magnons) in a ferromagnet is coupled to the microwave magnetic field (photons) of a single LC resonator. Starting from an effective circuit model that accounts for the magnetization dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show that a nontrivial frequency shift emerges in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes, whose microscopic origin remains elusive within a purely classical framework. The circuit model is further quantized to derive a minimal quantum mechanical model for generic cavity magnonics, which corresponds to a two-mode version of the Hopfield Hamiltonian and explains the mechanism of the frequency shifts found in the {\it classical} circuit model. We also formulate the relation between the frequency shift and quantum quantities, such as the ground-state particle number, quantum fluctuations associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and entanglement entropy, providing a nondestructive means to experimentally access to these quantum resources. By utilizing soft magnons in an anisotropic ferromagnet, we further demonstrate that these quantum quantities diverge at the zeros of the magnon band edges as a function of the external magnetic field. This work paves the way for cavity magnonics beyond the conventional strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Elliptical-rod geometries enhance photonic band gaps in disordered stealthy hyperuniform photonic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional photonic crystals composed of elliptical dielectric rods arranged according to stealthy hyperuniform point patterns. These patterns are characterized by the structure factor, which vanishes for 0 &lt; |k| &lt;= K, where k is the wave number and K denotes the cutoff wave number specifying the stealthiness of the pattern. The optical properties of the photonic crystals are analyzed by applying the plane-wave expansion method to Maxwell's equations. We demonstrate that photonic crystals composed of elliptical dielectric rods can exhibit larger photonic band gaps than those with cylindrical rods when both the rod orientation and aspect ratio are properly optimized. This behavior contrasts with that of periodic lattices such as triangular or square arrays. These findings shed light on the crucial role of structural anisotropy and aperiodic structure in enhancing photonic band-gap formation.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature electron dephasing rates indicate magnetic disorder in superconducting TiN films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate electron transport and phase-breaking processes in thin titanium nitride (TiN) films of epitaxial quality. Previous studies show that a minute surface magnetic disorder significantly reduces the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) and broadens the superconducting transition as the film thickness and device size decrease. We measure electron dephasing rates via magnetoresistance from $T_\mathrm{c}$ to $\sim 4T_\mathrm{c}$ in various-thickness TiN films. Electron dephasing occurs on the picosecond timescale and is nearly independent of temperature, differing from the expected inelastic scattering due to the electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions near $T_\mathrm{c}$, which occur over a nanosecond timescale. We propose spin-flip scattering as a possible additional phase-breaking mechanism. The significant increase in the dephasing rate for the thinnest film indicates that magnetic disorder resides near the surface of naturally oxidized films. Our research suggests that magnetic disorder may be a significant contributor to RF dissipation in superconducting devices based on TiN.</description>

      <title>Multipolar Decomposition of Magnetic Circular Dichroism in Arbitrarily Shaped Magneto-Dielectric Scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipole expansion methods have been primarily used for analyzing the electromagnetic scattering from non-magnetic isotropic dielectric scatterers, and studies about the scattering from magnetic objects seem to be lacking. In this work, we used the multipolar expansion framework for decomposing the electromagnetic scattering by dielectric particles with magnetic properties. Magnetization current contributions were explicitly accounted for by using the vector spherical harmonics to compute the electric and magnetic multipole contributions of arbitrary order. The exact analytical expressions for the corresponding spherical multipole coefficients were employed, with the scattering efficiencies being used to distinguish the dielectric and magnetic contributions of each multipole. This enables the analysis of scattering from arbitrarily shaped, anisotropic, and inhomogeneous magnetic scatterers. It also provides a tool for studying non-reciprocal devices that exploit magnetic resonances in magnetic-dielectric materials. Calculations were made for an experimentally feasible system, namely for ferrite-based scatterers operating in the microwave regime. These materials are of interest in radio frequency (RF) applications due to their magnetic activity. We demonstrated analytically that the magnetic circular dichroism in a magnetic-dielectric scatterer in the Faraday geometry can be decomposed into individual multipole contributions. The analytical results indicate that multipole resonances associated with magnetization currents can be even stronger than multipole contributions from conventional dielectric currents. It is worth noting that these analytical results were verified through comparison with numerical results from finite element method (FEM) simulations in COMSOL Multiphysics.</description>

      <title>A Wideband Tunable, Nonreciprocal Bandpass Filter Using Magnetostatic Surface Waves with Zero Static Power Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern wireless systems demand compact, power-efficient RF front-end components that support wideband tunability and nonreciprocity. We present a new class of miniature bandpass filter that achieves both continuously tunable frequency operation (4-17.7 GHz) and high nonreciprocity (&gt;25 dB), all within a compact size of 1.07 cm3. The filter employs a microfabricated 18 micrometer thick Yttrium Iron Garnet waveguide with meander-line aluminum transducers, enabling low-loss unidirectional propagation via magnetostatic surface waves. Leveraging a benzocyclobutene planarization fabrication process, this study enables a dispersion profile unique to thick YIG films, resulting in enhanced filter skirt performance with minimal spurious modes. Frequency tuning is enabled by a zero-static-power magnetic bias circuit using transient current pulses, eliminating continuous power consumption. The filter demonstrates low insertion loss (3-5 dB), high out-of-band rejection (&gt;30 dB), narrow bandwidth (100-200 MHz), robust power handling (&gt;10.4 dBm), and high linearity (IIP3 &gt; 26 dBm).</description>

Abstract: Recently, chaotic phenomena in laser dynamics have attracted much attention to its applied aspects, and a synchronization phenomenon, leader-laggard relationship, in time-delay coupled lasers has been used in reinforcement learning. In the present paper, we discuss the possibility of capturing the essential stochasticity of the leader-laggard relationship; in nonlinear science, it is known that coarse-graining allows one to derive stochastic models from deterministic systems. We derive stochastic models with the aid of the Koopman operator approach, and we clarify that the low-pass filtered data is enough to recover the essential features of the original deterministic chaos, such as peak shifts in the distribution of being the leader and a power-law behavior in the distribution of switching-time intervals. We also confirm that the derived stochastic model works well in reinforcement learning tasks, i.e., multi-armed bandit problems, as with the original laser chaos system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a novel magnetic levitation phenomenon involving two magnetically equivalent neodymium permanent magnets has been reported. In this work, we propose that this system functions as a scaled-up analog of the Levitron. The key distinction is that the ratio $m_/\mu_f$ becomes a function of the lateral displacement $\delta_R$, and magnetic trapping no longer depends on the rotational speed of the levitating body as in a conventional Levitron. Furthermore, we demonstrate that stable trapping occurs when a specific constraint on the $\delta_R$ parameter is satisfied, ensuring that the potential energy reaches a minimum at the equilibrium point.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Low Frequency Noise in CryoCMOS devices through Statistical Single Defect Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices is a critical parameter to keep under control in the design of complex circuits for low temperatures applications. Current models predict the 1/f noise to scale linearly with temperature, and gate oxide defects are expected to freeze out at cryogenic temperatures. Nevertheless, it has been repeatedly observed that 1/f noise deviates from the predicted behaviour and that gate oxide defects are still active around 4.2 K, producing random telegraph noise. In this paper, we probe single gate oxide defects in 2500 nMOS devices down to 5 K in order to investigate the origin of 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices. From our results, it is clear that the number of defects active at cryogenic temperatures resulting in random telegraph noise is larger than at 300 K. Threshold voltage shifts due to charged defects are shown to be exponentially distributed, with different modalities across temperatures and biases: from monomodal at 300 K to trimodal below 100 K. The third mode is interpreted in the framework of percolation theory. By fitting these distributions, it is shown that more than 80% of the detected defects belongs to the oxide bulk. Afterwards, starting from the raw data in time domain, we reconstruct the low frequency noise spectra, highlighting the contributions of defects belonging to different branches and, therefore, to different oxide layers. This analysis shows that, although interface traps and large defects associated with the third mode are the main sources of 1/f noise at 5 K, bulk oxide defects still contribute significantly to low-frequency noise at cryogenic temperatures. Finally, we show that defect time constants and step heights are uncorrelated, proving that elastic tunnelling model for charge trapping is not accurate.</description>

Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits remarkable electronic properties under external magnetic fields, notably the emergence of flat Landau levels. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles, i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.</description>

Abstract: This work studies the correlation between mean retardance and thickness of diamond substrates grown homoepitaxially via microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance and thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to the growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the square root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to the growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an approximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not from differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer correlation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation coefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond crystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a two-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the diamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples. By optimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match experimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth direction, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients. Furthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that retardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base retardances in both orientations. These findings establish a quantitative framework for interpreting birefringence in diamond substrates, with implications for material selection and development in thermal management, quantum sensing, high-power electronics, and optical applications.</description>
