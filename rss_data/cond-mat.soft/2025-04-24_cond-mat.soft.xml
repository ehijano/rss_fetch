      <title>Hyperuniform Mixing of Binary Active Spinners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinner mixtures consisting of both clockwise and counterclockwise self-spinning particles are often expected to phase separate. However, we demonstrate that such a demixing is absent for dimer (or rod-like) spinners. These particles always mix, even in a globally-hyperuniform way, with the total structure factor $S(q\to 0)\sim q^{\alpha}\,(\alpha&gt;0)$. This global hyperuniformity can be enhanced or weakened by changes in the driving torques or the particle density in various ways. The corresponding microscopic mechanism is attributed to the competition between a dynamical heterocoordination effect and effective like-particle attractions. Critical scaling for the absorbing state transition of the system is also found to persist, with a significant shift in its critical point observed. The system can be further thermalized, by the driving torques or through thermostating, into an ideal solution with identical partial radial distribution functions, which denys the possibility of being multi-hyperuniform. A simply-extented coupled density-oscillator theory explains why the system can not be multi-hyperuniform, but can have a global hyperuniformity with the scaling exponent $\alpha$ approaching $2$. Such a hyperuniform mixing provides a way to regulate the topological boundary flows of this chiral system, and this mixing regulation is found to barely affect the bulk density fluctuations and even preserve the localization of the flows and the bulk hyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>Polydisperse polymer networks with irregular topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of polymer networks, defined by chain lengths and connectivity patterns, fundamentally influences their bulk properties. Despite decades of research, many open questions remain regarding structure-property relationships, particularly in heterogeneous networks. While existing polymer network models connect chain properties to emergent network behavior, they are often limited to monodisperse networks with regular connectivities, making the extension to heterogeneous systems an active area of research. In this work, we introduce a novel modeling framework that shifts the focus from individual polymer chains to cross-links and their connected chains as the fundamental unit of analysis. This perspective enables direct incorporation of structural heterogeneity by averaging over cross-links with different chain lengths and coordination numbers. We establish important connections between polymerization theory and statistical descriptors of network structure, providing key components of a theoretical foundation for predicting properties from the synthesis parameters. Our results demonstrate that increased variance in monomer numbers generally leads to network softening, while in bimodal networks, the onset of strain stiffening is controlled by shorter chains and the stiffening response is modulated by the ratio of short to long chains. By deriving closed-form approximations valid in both the limits of (1) small deformation and (2) finite deformation but with small polydispersity, we offer an efficient computational approach to modeling complex networks. This framework represents an advance toward the rational modeling and design of heterogeneous polymer networks with structures tailored for specific properties.</description>

      <title>New self-organized benzo[b]thiophene-based materials for GHz applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research delves into the synthesis and characterization of novel liquid crystal compounds derived from benzo[b]Ithiophene cores, focusing on their potential applications in microwave technology. Two synthetic strategies were developed to construct rigid cores, resulting in the successful synthesis of ten compounds with varied terminal groups and lateral substituents. Correlations between molecular structure and mesomorphic properties were elucidated through extensive comparative analysis. Birefringence measurements and quantum chemical calculations further provided insights into the optical properties and polarizability anisotropy of the synthesized compounds. The results highlight the influence of structural diversity on the compounds' suitability for microwave applications. Specifically, compounds featuring carbon-carbon triple bonds and polar terminal groups demonstrated enhanced birefringence and polarizability values, indicating their potential in microwave device fabrication. This study underscores the importance of molecular design in optimizing liquid crystal materials for advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Flexoelectric polarization in chiral liquid crystals: electrostatic self-interactions of topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of topological defects in apolar chiral liquid crystals cause orientational distortions, leading to non-uniform strain. This non-uniform strain generates an electric polarization response due to the flexoelectric effect, which induces an internal electric field. Associated to this electric field is an electrostatic self-energy, which has a back-reaction on the director field. Calculation of this internal electric field and its resulting back-reaction on the director field is complicated. We propose a method to do such, adapting a method recently developed to study the magnetostatic self-interaction effect on skyrmions in chiral ferromagnets. Bloch skyrmions in chiral magnets are solenoidal and are unaffected by the magnetostatic self-interaction. However, Bloch skyrmions in liquid crystals yield non-solenoidal flexoelectric polarization and, thus, are affected by the electrostatic self-interaction. Additionally, as the flexoelectric coefficients are increased in strength, a transition from a hopfion to a skyrmion is observed in three-dimensional confined systems.</description>

      <title>Some Peculiarities of Dielectric Spectroscopy in Ferroelectric Nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric spectroscopy is known as one of the most powerful techniques for studying ferroelectric and other polar materials. Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in Liquid Crystals, it has been successfully employed for the characterization of ferro-, antiferro- and ferri-electric liquid crystalline phases. However, recently the Boulder group raised the question of the applicability of dielectric spectroscopy for characterizing ferroelectric nematics due to parasitic effects from the insulating alignment layers. This affects the apparent/measured values of the dielectric permittivity. In this paper, we study this effect in greater detail. The following issues will receive special attention: Are the real values of dielectric permittivity lower or higher than the measured ones? Can the real values of dielectric permittivity be recovered in the cell with alignment layers? We also provide an example of the effect of insulating alignment layers in a non-ferroelectric nematic phase.</description>

      <title>Probing molecular concentration in cell nuclei with Brillouin microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell volume is controlled by osmotic regulation of the fluid content, via water efflux through the cell membrane. The rate of this process is controlled by the ability of the liquid to move through the meshwork of solid elements within the cell. While such dynamics have been interpreted in the frame of the poroelastic theory in the cytoplasm, the behavior of the nucleus remains unknown due to a lack of technique to probe it. Brillouin light scattering (BLS) allows to interrogate the sound velocity and attenuation of a sample in a non-contact manner, thus revealing the dynamic response of the material. In cells, such data were initially interpreted as the viscoelastic response of the actin meshwork, but later studies pointed out the importance of water content. To resolve this lack of consensus in the interpretation of the hypersonic data obtained from BLS spectra, and investigate the possible poroelastic nature of the nucleus, we vary the relative volume fraction of intracellular water and solid network by applying osmotic compressions to single cells. In the nucleus, we observe a non-linear increase in the sound velocity and attenuation with increasing osmotic pressure that we fit to a poroelastic model, providing an estimate of the friction coefficient between the water phase and the network. By comparing BLS data to volume measurements, our approach demonstrates clearly that Brillouin microscopy actually provides a measure of molecular concentration in living cells</description>

      <title>Dynamical gauge invariance of statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate gauge invariance against phase space shifting in nonequilibrium systems, as represented by time-dependent many-body Hamiltonians that drive an initial ensemble out of thermal equilibrium. The theory gives rise to gauge correlation functions that characterize spatial and temporal inhomogeneity with microscopic resolution on the one-body level. Analyzing the dynamical gauge invariance allows one to identify a specific localized shift gauge current as a fundamental nonequilibrium observable that characterizes particle-based dynamics. When averaged over the nonequilibrium ensemble, the shift current vanishes identically, which constitutes an exact nonequilibrium conservation law that generalizes the Yvon-Born-Green equilibrium balance of the vanishing sum of ideal, interparticle, and external forces. Any given observable is associated with a corresponding dynamical hyperforce density and hypercurrent correlation function. An exact nonequilibrium sum rule interrelates these one-body functions, in generalization of the recent hyperforce balance for equilibrium systems. We demonstrate the physical consequences of the dynamical gauge invariance using both harmonically confined ideal gas setups, for which we present analytical solutions, and molecular dynamics simulations of interacting systems, for which we demonstrate the shift current and hypercurrent correlation functions to be accessible both via finite-difference methods and via trajectory-based automatic differentiation. We show that the theory constitutes a starting point for developing nonequilibrium reduced-variance sampling algorithms and for investigating thermally-activated barrier crossing.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Tension Chains and Active Force Patterning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viewed under a fluorescence microscope, the actomyosin cytoskeleton presents vivid streaks of lines together with persistent oscillatory waves. Using an active hydrodynamic approach, we show how a uniform distribution of single or mixture of contractile stresslets spontaneously segregate, followed by the formation of singular structures of high contractility (tension chains) in finite time. Simultaneously, the collection of stresslets exhibit travelling waves and swapping as a consequence of nonreciprocity. In the finite geometry of the cell, the collection of active tension chains can form an active web held together by specific anchoring at the cell boundary. On the other hand, preferential wetting at the cell boundary can reinforce active segregation in a mixture of stresslets leading to stratification.</description>

      <title>Dielectric properties of aqueous electrolytes at the nanoscale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of aqueous electrolytes, the effect of salt on water organization remains controversial. We introduce a nonlocal and nonlinear field theory for the nanoscale polarization of ions and water and derive the electrolyte dielectric response as a function of salt concentration to first order in a loop expansion. By comparison with molecular dynamics simulations, we show that rising salt concentration induces a dielectric permittivity decrement and Debye screening in the longitudinal susceptibility but leaves the water structure remarkably unchanged.</description>

      <title>Segregation, Finite Time Elastic Singularities and Coarsening in Renewable Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Material renewability in active living systems, such as in cells and tissues, can drive the large-scale patterning of forces, with distinctive phenotypic consequences. This is especially significant in the cell cytoskeleton, where multiple species of myosin bound to actin, apply differential contractile stresses and undergo differential turnover, giving rise to patterned force channeling. Here we study the dynamical patterning of stresses that emerge in a hydrodynamic description of a renewable active actomyosin elastomer comprising two myosin species. Our analytical framework also holds for an actomyosin elastomer with a single myosin species. We find that a uniform active contractile elastomer spontaneously segregates into spinodal stress patterns, followed by a finite-time collapse into tension carrying singular structures that display self-similar scaling and caustics. Our numerical analysis carried out in 1D, shows that these singular structures move and merge, and gradually result in a slow coarsening dynamics. We discuss the implications of our findings to the emergence of stress fibers and the spatial patterning of actomyosin. Our study suggests, that with state-dependent turnover of crosslinkers and myosin, the in vivo cytoskeleton can navigate through the space of material parameters to achieve a variety of functional phenotypes.</description>

      <title>A strategy for the enhancement of barocaloric performance in plastic crystal solid solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The drive for solid-state heating and cooling technologies is fuelled by their potential for enhanced sustainability and environmental impact compared to traditional vapour compression devices. The recent discovery of colossal barocaloric (BC) effects in the plastic crystal (PC) neopentyl glycol (NPG) has highlighted PCs as promising candidates for future solid-state thermal management. However, achieving optimal operational temperatures, low-pressure requirements, and substantial entropy changes in a single material remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy to address these constraints by forming a ternary solid solution of neopentyl PCs: NPG, pentaglycerine (PG) and pentaerythritol (PE). Notably, by including only a small quantity (2%) of the third component, we observe a seven-fold increase in reversible isothermal entropy change (|$\Delta S_{it,rev}$| = 13.4 J kg-1 K-1) and twenty-fold increase in operational temperature span ($\Delta T_{span }$ = 18 K) at pressures of 1 kbar, compared to pure NPG. The origin of these enhancements is revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering and synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction. We find a reduction in the activation energies of the rotational modes associated with the main entropic component of the BC effect, linked to a weakening of the intermolecular hydrogen bond network. This is proposed to improve the phase transition reversibility and operational temperature span by facilitating a broadened first-order phase transition, characterised by a significant phase co-existence region. These findings suggest an effective strategy for practicable molecular BCs, which is to design solid solutions that exploit the large compositional phase space of multi-component molecular systems.</description>
