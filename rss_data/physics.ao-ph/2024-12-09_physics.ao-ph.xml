      <title>Advancing Marine Heatwave Forecasts: An Integrated Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Marine heatwaves (MHWs), an extreme climate phenomenon, pose significant challenges to marine ecosystems and industries, with their frequency and intensity increasing due to climate change. This study introduces an integrated deep learning approach to forecast short-to-long-term MHWs on a global scale. The approach combines graph representation for modeling spatial properties in climate data, imbalanced regression to handle skewed data distributions, and temporal diffusion to enhance forecast accuracy across various lead times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that synthesizes three spatiotemporal anomaly methodologies to predict MHWs. Additionally, we introduce a method for constructing graphs that avoids isolated nodes and provide a new publicly available sea surface temperature anomaly graph dataset. We examine the trade-offs in the selection of loss functions and evaluation metrics for MHWs. We analyze spatial patterns in global MHW predictability by focusing on historical hotspots, and our approach demonstrates better performance compared to traditional numerical models in regions such as the middle south Pacific, equatorial Atlantic near Africa, south Atlantic, and high-latitude Indian Ocean. We highlight the potential of temporal diffusion to replace the conventional sliding window approach for long-term forecasts, achieving improved prediction up to six months in advance. These insights not only establish benchmarks for machine learning applications in MHW forecasting but also enhance understanding of general climate forecasting methodologies.</description>

      <title>Five-years Altitude Statistics of Noctilucent Clouds Based on Multi-Site Wide-Field Camera Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of simultaneous measurements of noctilucent clouds (NLC) position in a number of ground-based locations are presented. Observational data of 14 bright NLC events over 5 years is used for building the altitude maps of cloud fields using triangulation technique updated for multi-location case. Statistical distribution of NLC altitude and its change during the summer season is considered. Mean NLC altitudes are compared with colorimetric technique based on the same data and simple radiation transfer model. This can be used to check the model and estimate the accuracy of single-camera technique of NLC altitude measurements. Results and methods are suggested for net ground-based survey of noctilucent clouds.</description>

      <title>Project Severe Weather Archive of the Philippines (SWAP). Part 1: Establishing a Baseline Climatology for Severe Weather across the Philippine Archipelago</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03211v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of the rudimentary reporting methods and general lack of documentation, the creation of a severe weather database within the Philippines has been difficult yet relevant target for climatology purposes and historical interest. Previous online severe weather documentation i.e. of tornadoes, waterspouts, and hail events, has also often been few, inconsistent, inactive, or is now completely decommissioned. Several countries or continents support severe weather information through either government-sponsored or independent organizations. For this work, Project SWAP stands as a collaborative exercise, with clear data attribution and open avenues for augmentation, and the creation of a common data model to store the phenomenon's information will assist in maintaining and updating the aforementioned online archive in the Philippines. This paper presents the methods necessary for creating the SWAP database, provide broader climatological analysis of spatio-temporal patterns in severe weather occurrence within the Philippine context, and outline potential use cases for the data. We also highlight the project's current limitations as is to any other existing and far larger database, and emphasize the need for understanding these events' and their mesoscale environments, inline to the current severe weather climatologies across the globe.</description>
