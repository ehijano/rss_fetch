      <title>Founder Backgrounds and Startup Funding: Evidence from Y Combinator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While founder backgrounds account for less than 4% of funding variation among Y Combinator startups, this suggests that other factors, such as industry trends and product innovation, may play a more significant role in funding outcomes. Using data on 4,323 YC companies from 2005-2024 merged with S&amp;P Global funding data, I estimate OLS regressions with batch year fixed effects on a regression sample of 2,113 companies. The coefficient on prior FAANG work experience is -0.251, indicating approximately 22% less funding. However, this result is not robust, as it changes direction in further analyses, suggesting that FAANG experience may not be a reliable predictor of funding. The most robust finding is that startups within Y Combinator that consist of larger founding teams tend to raise more funding, with each additional co-founder associated with approximately 21% more capital raised. While observable credentials such as prior FAANG work experience and top-tier education explain minimal variation in funding, the size of the founding team emerges as a more consistent predictor, highlighting the importance of team dynamics in securing capital. Unobserved factors like industry and product quality likely dominate funding decisions within this elite accelerator cohort.</description>

      <title>Innovation, Institutions and Three Dimensions of Financial Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the response of stock markets relative to the banking sector to innovation by using a panel of 75 countries from 1982 to 2021. We find that innovation increases the activity, efficiency and size of stock markets relative to the banking sector, moderated by proximity to technological frontier and institutional quality. The moderating effect of institutional quality is positive for activity and efficiency but negative for size. Moreover, the moderating effect can be nonlinear depending on specific indicators. The marginal effect of innovation on the activity is persistent over many years, but the moderating effect of institutional quality gradually fades away.</description>

      <title>Location-Robust Cost-Preserving Blended Pricing for Multi-Campus AI Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale AI data center portfolios procure identical SKUs across geographically heterogeneous campuses, yet finance and operations require a single system-level 'world price' per SKU for budgeting and planning. A common practice is deployment-weighted blending of campus prices, which preserves total cost but can trigger Simpson-type aggregation failures: heterogeneous location mixes can reverse SKU rankings and distort decision signals.
  I formalize cost-preserving blended pricing under location heterogeneity and propose two practical operators that reconcile accounting identity with ranking robustness and production implementability. A two-way fixed-effects operator separates global SKU effects from campus effects and restores exact cost preservation via scalar normalization, providing interpretable decomposition and smoothing under mild missingness. A convex common-weight operator computes a single set of campus weights under accounting constraints to enforce a location-robust benchmark and prevent dominance reversals; I also provide feasibility diagnostics and a slack-based fallback for extreme mix conditions. Simulations and an AI data center OPEX illustration show substantial reductions in ranking violations relative to naive blending while maintaining cost accuracy, with scalable distributed implementation.</description>

      <title>The Role of Employment Flexibility in Enhancing the Competitiveness of Temporary Staffing Service Providers in Poland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the role of employment flexibility in enhancing the competitiveness of firms using temporary staffing services, with empirical evidence from Poland. The study focuses on how flexible employment arrangements influence operational efficiency, cost reduction, workforce scalability, market responsiveness, and client satisfaction. A quantitative survey was conducted among managers and owners of Polish enterprises that cooperate with temporary staffing agencies, using purposeful sampling to capture informed managerial perspectives. The findings show that employment flexibility significantly reduces downtime, accelerates onboarding processes, and lowers personnel and recruitment costs. Flexible staffing enables rapid workforce scaling during demand fluctuations and facilitates access to specialized skills without long-term commitments. The results also indicate that employment flexibility enhances organizational responsiveness, improves profitability in short-term projects, and strengthens resilience to seasonal and market volatility. Additionally, flexibility is identified as a key determinant of client satisfaction and loyalty toward staffing service providers. The study demonstrates that employment flexibility is not merely a cost-control mechanism but a strategic human resource capability that supports competitiveness, operational adaptability, and sustainable performance in dynamic labor markets.</description>

      <title>Pattern Recognition of Aluminium Arbitrage in Global Trade Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the global economy transitions toward decarbonization, the aluminium sector has become a focal point for strategic resource management. While policies such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) aim to reduce emissions, they have inadvertently widened the price arbitrage between primary metal, scrap, and semi-finished goods, creating new incentives for market optimization. This study presents a unified, unsupervised machine learning framework to detect and classify emerging trade anomalies within UN Comtrade data (2020 to 2024). Moving beyond traditional rule-based monitoring, we apply a four-layer analytical pipeline utilizing Forensic Statistics, Isolation Forests, Network Science, and Deep Autoencoders. Contrary to the hypothesis that Sustainability Arbitrage would be the primary driver, empirical results reveal a contradictory and more severe phenomenon of Hardware Masking. Illicit actors exploit bi-directional tariff incentives by misclassifying scrap as high-count heterogeneous goods to justify extreme unit-price outliers of &gt;$160/kg, a 1,900% markup indicative of Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) rather than commercial arbitrage. Topologically, risk is not concentrated in major exporters but in high-centrality Shadow Hubs that function as pivotal nodes for illicit rerouting. These actors execute a strategy of Void-Shoring, systematically suppressing destination data to Unspecified Code to fracture mirror statistics and sever forensic trails. Validated by SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), the results confirm that price deviation is the dominant predictor of anomalies, necessitating a paradigm shift in customs enforcement from physical volume checks to dynamic, algorithmic valuation auditing.</description>

      <title>Job insecurity, equilibrium determinacy and E-stability in a New Keynesian model with asymmetric information. Theory and simulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Departing from the dominant approach focused on individual and meso-level determinants, this paper develops a macroeconomic formalization of job insecurity within a New Keynesian framework in which the standard IS-NKPC-Taylor rule block is augmented with labor-market frictions. The model features partially informed private agents who receive a noisy signal about economic fundamentals from a fully informed public sector. When monetary policy satisfies the Taylor principle, the equilibrium is unique and determinate. However, the release of news about current or future fundamentals can generate a "Paradox of Transparency" through general-equilibrium interactions between aggregate demand and monetary policy. When the Taylor principle is violated, belief-driven equilibria may emerge. Validation exercises based on the Simulated Method of Moments support the empirical plausibility of the model's key implications.</description>
