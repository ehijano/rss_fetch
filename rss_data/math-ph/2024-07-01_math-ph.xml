      <title>Many-body Fu-Kane-Mele index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued index for stably short-range entangled states of two-dimensional fermionic lattice systems with charge conservation and time reversal symmetry. The index takes its non-trivial value precisely if the `fluxon', the state obtained by inserting a $\pi$-flux through the system, transforms under time reversal as part of a Kramers pair. This index extends the Fu-Kane-Mele index of free fermions to interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of atomic structure in a Thomas-Fermi mean-field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Thomas-Fermi mean-field model for large neutral atoms. That is, Schr\"odinger operators $H_Z^{\text{TF}}=-\Delta-\Phi_Z^{\text{TF}}$ in three-dimensional space, where $Z$ is the nuclear charge of the atom and $\Phi_Z^{\text{TF}}$ is a mean-field potential coming from the Thomas-Fermi density functional theory for atoms. For any sequence $Z_n\to\infty$ we prove that the corresponding sequence $H_{Z_n}^{\text{TF}}$ is convergent in the strong resolvent sense if and only if $D_{\text{cl}}Z_n^{1/3}$ is convergent modulo $1$ for a universal constant $D_{\text{cl}}$. This can be interpreted in terms of periodicity of large atoms. We also characterize the possible limiting operators (infinite atoms) as a periodic one-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions of $-\Delta-C_\infty\vert\,x\,\vert^{-4}$ for an explicit number $C_\infty$.</description>

      <title>Reflection operator and hypergeometry I: $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider open $SL(2, \mathbb{R})$ spin chain, mainly the simplest case of one particle. Eigenfunctions of the model can be constructed using the so-called reflection operator. We obtain several representations of this operator and show its relation to the hypergeometric function. Besides, we prove orthogonality and completeness of one-particle eigenfunctions and connect them to the index hypergeometric transform. Finally, we briefly state the formula for the eigenfunctions in many-particle case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider noncompact open $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ spin chain and construct eigenfunctions of $B$-element of monodromy matrix for the simplest case of the chain with one site. The reflection operator appearing in this construction can be used to express eigenfunction for $n$ sites in terms of the eigenfunction for $n-1$ sites, this general result is briefly announced. We prove orthogonality and completeness of constructed eigenfunctions in the case of one site, express them in terms of the hypergeometric function of the complex field and derive the equation for the reflection operator with the general $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$-invariant $\mathbb{R}$-operator.</description>

      <title>Second order energy expansion of Bose gases with three-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a second order energy expansion for a gas of $N$ bosonic particles with three-body interactions in the Gross-Pitaevskii regime. We especially confirm a conjecture by Nam, Ricaud and Triay in [21], where they predict the subleading term in the asymptotic expansion of the ground state energy to be of the order $\sqrt{N}$. In addition, we show that the ground state satisfies Bose-Einstein condensation with a rate of the order $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$.</description>

      <title>Gauge Fixing in QFT and the Dressing Field Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the Dressing Field Method (DFM) in the context of Quantum (Gauge) Field Theories (QFT). In order to adapt this method to the functional path integral formalism of QFT, we depart from the usual differential geometry approach used so far to study the DFM which also allows to tackle the infinite dimension of the field spaces. Our main result is that gauge fixing is an instance of the application of the DFM. The Faddeev-Popov gauge fixing procedure and the so-called unitary gauge are revisited in light of this result.</description>

      <title>Mehta's eigenvectors for the finite Hartely transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for evaluating analytical eigenfunctions of the finite Hartley transform. The approach is based on the use of $N=1/2$-supersymmetric quantum mechanics as a fundamental tool, which builds on the key observation that the Hartley transform commutes with the supercharge operator. Using the intertwining operator between the Hartley transform and the finite Hartley transform, our approach provides an overcomplete basis of eigenvectors expressed in terms of supersymmetric Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>Strict Lyapunov functions and energy decay in Hamiltonian chains with degenerate damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Hamiltonian chain of rotators (in general nonlinear) in which the first rotator is damped. Being motivated by problems of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of crystals, we construct a strict Lyapunov function that allows us to find a lower bound for the total energy dissipation rate when the energy and time are large. Our construction is explicit and its analysis is rather straightforward. We rely on a method going back to Matrosov, Malisoff and Mazenc, which we review in our paper. The method is rather universal and we show that it is applicable to a chain of oscillators as well.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference and nonequilibrium identification for Markovian systems based on coarse-grained observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most experiments can only detect a set of coarse-grained clusters of a molecular system, while the internal microstates are often inaccessible. Here, based on a sufficient long coarse-grained trajectory, we obtain a set of sufficient statistics which extracts all statistic information of coarse-grained observations. Based on these sufficient statistics, we completely solve the problems of parameter inference and nonequilibrium identification for a general Markovian system with an arbitrary number of microstates and arbitrary coarse-grained partitioning. Our nonequilibrium criterion generalizes the one obtained in [J. Chem. Phys. 132:041102 (2010)] for a three-state system with two coarse-grained clusters, and is much superior to the classical criterion based on autocorrelation functions.</description>

      <title>Phase-space measurements, decoherence and classicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of classical behaviour in quantum theory is often ascribed to the interaction of a quantum system with its environment, which can be interpreted as environmental monitoring of the system. As a result, off-diagonal elements of the density matrix of the system are damped in the basis of a preferred observable, often taken to be the position, leading to the phenomenon of decoherence. This effect can be modelled dynamically in terms of a Lindblad equation driven by the position operator. Here the question of decoherence resulting from a monitoring of position and momentum, i.e. a phase-space measurement, by the environment is addressed. There is no standard quantum observable corresponding to the detection of phase-space points, which is forbidden by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. This issue is addressed by use of a coherent-state-based positive operator-valued measure (POVM) for modelling phase-space monitoring by the environment. In this scheme, decoherence in phase space implies the diagonalisation of the density matrix in both position and momentum representations. This is shown to be linked to a Lindblad dynamics where position and momentum appear as two independent Lindblad operators.</description>

      <title>Weyl formulae for some singular metrics with application to acoustic modes in gas giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by recent works on inverse problems for acoustic wave propagation in the interior of gas giant planets. In such planets, the speed of sound is isotropic and tends to zero at the surface. Geometrically, this corresponds to a Riemannian manifold with boundary whose metric blows up near the boundary. Here, the spectral analysis of the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator is presented and the Weyl law is derived. The involved exponents depend on the Hausdorff dimension which, in the supercritical case, is larger than the topological dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clifford Taubes showed that the moduli space of the variational equation of the Yang-Mills-Higgs functional on the plane is non-empty, and its elements correspond to "vortices". Inspired by this result, in this paper, we show that the moduli space of the Hitchin-type dimensional reduction of the Seiberg-Witten equations on the plane contains both exponentially decayed solutions and polynomial growth solutions. Furthermore, we show that there is correspondence from the moduli space of exponentially decayed and polynomial growth solutions to the symmetric products of complex numbers. The correspondence restricted to the latter is a surjective map.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for representations of quiver Yangian algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we aim to review algorithms for constructing crystal representations of quiver Yangians in detail. Quiver Yangians are believed to describe an action of the BPS algebra on BPS states in systems of D-branes wrapping toric Calabi-Yau three-folds. Crystal modules of these algebras originate from molten crystal models for Donaldson-Thomas invariants of respective three-folds. Despite the fact that this subject was originally at the crossroads of algebraic geometry with effective supersymmetric field theories, equivariant toric action simplifies applied calculations drastically. So the sole pre-requisite for this algorithm's implementation is linear algebra. It can be easily taught to a machine with the help of any symbolic calculation system. Moreover, these algorithms may be generalized to toroidal and elliptic algebras and exploited in various numerical experiments with those algebras. We illustrate the work of the algorithms in applications to simple cases of $\mathsf{Y}(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1})$ and $\mathsf{Y}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic origin of anomalous current fluctuations in a family of stochastic charged cellular automata. Using ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study both typical and large fluctuations of the charge current and reproduce microscopic results which are available for the deterministic single-file limit of the models. Our results indicate that in general initial fluctuations propagated by Euler equations fully characterize both scales of anomalous fluctuations. For stochastic dynamics, we find an additional contribution to typical fluctuations and conjecture the functional form of the probability typical distribution, which we confirm by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>On the large-time asymptotics of the defocusing mKdV equation with step-like initial data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.01299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is concerned with the large-time asymptotics of the Cauchy problem of the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation with step-like initial data subject to compact perturbations, that is, \begin{align*}
  q_{0}(x)-q_{0c}(x)=0, \ \text{for} \ |x|&gt;N \end{align*} with some positive $N$, where \begin{align*}
  q_{0c}(x)=\left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  &amp;c_{l}, \quad x\leqslant 0,
  &amp;c_{r}, \quad x&gt;0,
  \end{aligned}
  \right. \end{align*} and $c_l&gt;c_{r}&gt;0$. It follows from the standard direct and inverse scattering theory that an RH characterization for the step-like problem is constructed. By performing the nonlinear steepest descent analysis, we mainly derive the large-time asymptotics in the each of four asymptotic zones in the $(x,t)$-half plane.</description>

      <title>Tracer dynamics in the active random average process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of tracer particles in the random average process (RAP), a single-file system in one dimension. In addition to the position, every particle possesses an internal spin variable $\sigma (t)$ that can alternate between two values, $\pm 1$, at a constant rate $\gamma$. Physically, the value of $\sigma (t)$ dictates the direction of motion of the corresponding particle and for finite $\gamma$, every particle performs a non-Markovian active dynamics. Herein, we study the effect of this non-Markovianity in the fluctuations and correlations of the positions of tracer particles. We analytically show that the variance of the position of a tagged particle grows sub-diffusively as $\sim \zeta_{\text{q}} \sqrt{t}$ at large times for the quenched uniform initial condition. While this sub-diffusive growth is identical to that of the Markovian/non-persistent RAP, the coefficient $\zeta_{\text{q}} $ is rather different and bears the signature of the persistent motion of active particles through higher point correlations (unlike in the Markovian case). Similarly, for the annealed (steady state) initial condition, we find that the variance scales as $\sim \zeta_{\text{a}} \sqrt{t}$ at large times with coefficient $\zeta_{\text{a}} $ once again different from the non-persistent case. Although $\zeta_{\text{q}}$ and $\zeta_{\text{a}} $ both individually depart from their Markov counterparts, their ratio $\zeta_{\text{a}} / \zeta_{\text{q}}$ is still equal to $\sqrt{2}$, a condition observed for other diffusive single-file systems. This condition turns out to be true even in the strongly active regimes as corroborated by extensive simulations and calculations. Finally, we study the correlation between the positions of two tagged particles in both quenched uniform and annealed initial conditions. We verify all our analytic results by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>HBS Tilings Extended: State of the Art and Novel Observations</title>

Abstract: Penrose tilings are the most famous aperiodic tilings, and they have been studied extensively. In particular, patterns composed with hexagons (H), boats (B) and stars (S) were soon exhibited and many physicists published on what they later called HBS tilings, but no article or book combines all we know about them. This work is done here, before introducing new decorations and properties including explicit substitutions. For the latter, the star comes in three versions so we have 5 prototiles in what we call the Star tileset. Yet this set yields exactly the strict HBS tilings formed using 3 tiles decorated with either the usual decorations (arrows) or Ammann bar markings for instance. Another new tileset called Gemstones is also presented, derived from the Star tileset.</description>

      <title>Crossover in densities of confined particles with finite range of interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional classical system of $N$ particles confined within a harmonic trap. Interactions among these particles are dictated by a pairwise potential $V(x)$, where $x$ is the separation between two particles. Each particle can interact with a maximum of $d$ neighboring particles on either side (left or right), if available. By adjusting the parameter $d$, the system can be made nearest neighbour $(d=1)$ to all-to-all $(d=N-1)$ interacting. As suggested by prior studies, the equilibrium density profile of these particles is expected to undergo shape variations as $d$ is changed. In this paper, we investigate this crossover by tuning the parameter $f(=d/N)$ from $1$ to $0$ in the large $N$ limit for two distinct choices of interaction potentials, $V(x) = - |x|$ and $V(x) =- \log(|x|)$ which correspond to 1d one-component plasma and the log-gas model, respectively. For both models, the system size scaling of the density profile for fixed $f$ turns out to be the same as in their respective all-to-all cases. However, the scaling function exhibits diverse shapes as $f$ varies. We explicitly compute the average density profile for any $f \in (0,1]$ in the 1d plasma model, while for the log-gas model, we provide approximate calculations for large (close to $1$) and small (close to $0$) $f$. Additionally, we present simulation results to numerically demonstrate the crossover and compare these findings with our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Fast Fourier Transform periodic interpolation method for superposition sums in a periodic unit cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Fast Fourier Transform based Periodic Interpolation Method (FFT-PIM), a flexible and computationally efficient approach for computing the scalar potential given by a superposition sum in a unit cell of an infinitely periodic array. Under the same umbrella, FFT-PIM allows computing the potential for 1D, 2D, and 3D periodicities for dynamic and static problems, including problems with and without a periodic phase shift. The computational complexity of the FFT-PIM is of $O(N \log N)$ for $N$ spatially coinciding sources and observer points. The FFT-PIM uses rapidly converging series representations of the Green's function serving as a kernel in the superposition sum. Based on these representations, the FFT-PIM splits the potential into its near-zone component, which includes a small number of images surrounding the unit cell of interest, and far-zone component, which includes the rest of an infinite number of images. The far-zone component is evaluated by projecting the non-uniform sources onto a sparse uniform grid, performing superposition sums on this sparse grid, and interpolating the potential from the uniform grid to the non-uniform observation points. The near-zone component is evaluated using an FFT-based method, which is adapted to efficiently handle non-uniform source-observer distributions within the periodic unit cell. The FFT-PIM can be used for a broad range of applications, such as periodic problems involving integral equations in computational electromagnetic and acoustic, micromagnetic solvers, and density functional theory solvers.</description>

      <title>Several Special Solutions of Open WDVV Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde(WDVV) equations appeared in the study of two-dimensional topological field theoies in the early 1990s. An extension of the WDVV equations, called the open WDVV equations, was introduced by A.Horev and J.P.Solomon (arXiv:1210.4034). In this paper, we give some particular solutions to the open WDVV equations.</description>

      <title>Statistical signatures of quantum contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality describes situations where the statistics observed in different measurement contexts cannot be explained by a measurement independent reality of the system. The most simple case is observed in a three-dimensional Hilbert space, with five different measurement contexts related to each other by shared measurement outcomes. The quantum formalism defines the relations between these contexts in terms of well-defined relations between operators, and these relations can be used to reconstruct an unknown quantum state from a finite set of measurement results. Here, I introduce a reconstruction method based on the relations between the five measurement contexts that can violate the bounds of non-contextual statistics. A complete description of an arbitrary quantum state requires only five of the eight elements of a Kirkwood-Dirac quasi probability, but only an overcomplete set of eleven elements provides an unbiased description of all five contexts. A set of five fundamental relations between the eleven elements reveals a deterministic structure that links the five contexts. As illustrated by a number of examples, these relations provide a consistent description of contextual realities for the measurement outcomes of all five contexts.</description>

      <title>Double dimers on planar hyperbolic graphs via circle packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we study the double dimer model on hyperbolic Temperleyan graphs via circle packings. We prove that on such graphs, the weak limit of the dimer model exists if and only if the removed black vertex from the boundary of the exhaustion converges to a point on the unit circle in the circle packing representation of the graph. One of our main results is that for such measures, we prove that the double dimer model has no bi-infinite path almost surely. Along the way we prove that the height function of the dimer model has double exponential tail and faces of height larger than k do not percolate for large enough k. The proof uses the connection between winding of uniform spanning trees and dimer heights, the notion of stationary random graphs, and the boundary theory of random walk on circle packings.</description>
