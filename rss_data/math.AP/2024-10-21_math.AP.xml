      <title>Thomas-Fermi Limit for the Cubic-quintic Schr\"odinger Energy in the Whole Space and Bounded Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ or a sphere of radius $R&gt;0$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $1\leq d\leq3$. Consider the following cubic-quintic energy functional \begin{gather*} \begin{aligned} E_{N}(\varphi)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathcal{D}}|\nabla \varphi|^2\,dx-\frac{N}{4}\int_{ \mathcal{D}}|\varphi|^{4}\,dx+\frac{N^{2}}{6}\int_{\mathcal{D}}|\varphi|^6\,dx \end{aligned} \end{gather*} minimized in $\left\lbrace \varphi\in H^1_0(\mathcal{D}): \int_{\mathcal{D}}|\varphi|^2\,dx=1\right\rbrace$. Firstly, we prove the limiting behavior of the ground state $\varphi_N$ as $N\to+\infty$, which corresponds to the \emph{Thomas-Fermi limit}. The limit profile is given by the Thomas-Fermi minimizer $u^{TF}=\sqrt{{3\cdot\mathbb{1}_{\Omega}}/{4}}(x)$ with $\Omega=B(0,\sqrt[d]{4/(3\omega_d)})$. Moreover, we obtain a sharp vanishing rate for $\varphi_N$ that $\|\varphi_{N}\|_{L^\infty(\mathcal{D})}\sim N^{-{1}/{2}}$ as $N\to+\infty$. Finally, we prove that $\left\|N^{{1}/{2}}\varphi_{N}\left(N^{{1}/{d}}x\right)-u^{TF}(x)\right\|_{L^\infty\left(\Omega\right)}\lesssim N^{-1/(2d)}$ as $N\to+\infty$.</description>

      <title>A Struwe-type Decomposition Result for Weighted Critical $p$-Laplace Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish Struwe-type decompositions of Palais-Smale sequences for a class of critical $p$-Laplace equations of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge2$, containing the origin. In doing so, we highlight important differences introduced by the weights and require new rescaling laws to account for this new framework.</description>

      <title>Sharp and improved regularity estimates for weighted quasilinear elliptic equations of $p-$Laplacian type and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we obtain sharp and improved regularity estimates for weak solutions of weighted quasilinear elliptic models of Hardy-H\'{e}non-type, featuring an explicit regularity exponent depending only on universal parameters. Our approach is based on geometric tangential methods and uses a refined oscillation mechanism, compactness, and scaling techniques. In some specific scenarios, we establish higher regularity estimates and non-degeneracy properties, providing further geometric insights into such solutions. Our regularity estimates both enhance and, to some extent, extend the results arising from the $C^{p^{\prime}}$ conjecture for the $p$-Laplacian with a bounded source term. As applications of our results, we address some Liouville-type results for our class of equations. Finally, our results are noteworthy, even in the simplest model case governed by the $p$-Laplacian with regular coefficients: $$
  \mathrm{div}\left( |\nabla u|^{p-2}\mathfrak{A}(|x|) \nabla u\right) = |x|^{\alpha}u_+^m(x) \quad \text{in} \quad B_1 $$ under suitable assumptions on the data, with possibly singular weight $\mathfrak{h}(|x|) = |x|^{\alpha}$, which includes the Matukuma and Batt-Faltenbacher-Horst's equations as toy models.</description>

      <title>The Benjamin-Ono Initial-Value Problem for Rational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the initial-value problem for the Benjamin-Ono equation on $\mathbb{R}$ with $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ rational initial data with only simple poles can be solved in closed form via a determinant formula involving contour integrals. The dimension of the determinant depends on the number of simple poles of the rational initial data only and the matrix elements depend explicitly on the independent variables $(t,x)$ and the dispersion coefficient $\epsilon$. This allows for various interesting asymptotic limits to be resolved quite efficiently.</description>

      <title>Discarding Lavrentiev's Gap in Non-automonous and Non-Convex Variational Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that the Lavrentiev gap between Sobolev and Lipschitz maps does not occur for a scalar variational problem of the form: \[ \textrm{to minimize} \qquad u \mapsto \int_\Omega f(x,u,\nabla u)\dx \,, \] under a Dirichlet boundary condition. Here, \(\Omega\) is a bounded Lipschitz open set in \(\rn\), \(N\geq 1\) and the function $f$ is required to be measurable with respect to the spacial variable, continuous with respect to the second one, and continuous and comparable to convex with respect to the last variable. Moreover, we assume that $f$ satisfies a natural condition balancing the variations with respect to the first variable and the growth with respect to the last one. Remarkably, typical conditions that are usually imposed on $f$ to discard the Lavrentiev gap are dropped here: we do not require $f$ to be bounded or convex with respect to the second variable, nor impose any condition of $\Delta_2$-kind with respect to the last variable.</description>

      <title>Half-time Range description for the free space wave operator and the spherical means transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forward problem arising in several hybrid imaging modalities can be modeled by the Cauchy problem for the free space wave equation. Solution to this problems describes propagation of a pressure wave, generated by a source supported inside unit sphere $S$. The data $g$ represent the time-dependent values of the pressure on the observation surface $S$. Finding initial pressure $f$ from the known values of $g$ consitutes the inverse problem. The latter is also frequently formulated in terms of the spherical means of $f$ with centers on~$S$.
  Here we consider a problem of range description of the wave operator mapping $f$ into $g$. Such a problem was considered before, with data $g$ known on time interval at least $[0,2]$ (assuming the unit speed of sound). Range conditions were also found in terms of spherical means, with radii of integration spheres lying in the range $[0,2]$. However, such data are redundant. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for function $g$ to be in the range of the wave operator, for $g$ given on a half-time interval $[0,1]$. This also implies range conditions on spherical means measured for the radii in the range $[0,1]$.</description>

      <title>Explicit spectral gap estimates for the linearized Boltzmann operator modeling reactive gaseous mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider hard-potential cutoff multi-species Boltzmann operators modeling microscopic binary elastic collisions and bimolecular reversible chemical reactions inside a gaseous mixture. We prove that the spectral gap estimate derived for the linearized elastic collision operator can be exploited to deduce an explicit negative upper bound for the Dirichlet form of the linearized chemical Boltzmann operator. Such estimate may be used to quantify explicitly the rate of convergence of close-to-equilibrium solutions to the reactive Boltzmann equation toward the global chemical equilibrium of the mixture.</description>

      <title>Existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions for $(2,q)$-Laplacian equations with the mixed nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of normalized solutions for the following $(2, q)$-Laplacian equation \begin{equation*}\label{Eq-Equation1} \left\{\begin{array}{l} -\Delta u-\Delta_q u+\lambda u=f(u) \quad x \in \mathbb{R}^N , \\ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}u^2 d x=c^2, \\ \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} where $1&lt;q&lt;N$, $N\geq3$, $\Delta_q=\operatorname{div}\left(|\nabla u|^{q-2} \nabla u\right)$ denotes the $q$-Laplacian operator, $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplier and $c&gt;0$ is a constant. The nonlinearity $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is continuous, with mass-subcritical growth at the origin, mass-supercritical growth at infinity, and is more general than the sum of two powers. Under different assumptions, we prove the existence of a locally least-energy solution and the existence of a second solution with higher energy.</description>

      <title>Sobolev estimates for the Keller-Segel system and applications to the JKO scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove $L^{\infty}_{t}W^{1,p}_{x}$ Sobolev estimates in the Keller-Segel system by proving a functional inequality, inspired by the Brezis-Gallou\"et-Wainger inequality. These estimates are also valid at the discrete level in the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme. By coupling this result with the diffusion properties of a functional according to Bakry-Emery theory, we deduce the $L^2_t H^{2}_{x}$ convergence of the scheme, thereby extending the recent result of Santambrogio and Toshpulatov in the context of the Fokker-Planck equation to the Keller-Segel system.</description>

      <title>Strict condition for the $L^{2}$-wellposedness of fifth and sixth order dispersive equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a set of conditions that is necessary and sufficient for the $L^{2}$-wellposedness of the Cauchy problem for fifth and sixth order variable-coefficient linear dispersive equations. The necessity of these conditions had been presented by Tarama, and we scrutinized their proof to split the conditions into several parts so that an inductive argument is applicable. This inductive argument simplifies the engineering process of the appropriate pseudodifferential operator needed for the proof of $L^{2}$-wellposedness.</description>

      <title>Mountain-Pass Solutions in 2D Turbulence with Generalized Sobolev Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work extends the study of mean field equations arising in two-dimensional (2D) turbulence by introducing generalized weighted Sobolev operators. Employing variational methods, particularly the mountain pass theorem and a refined blow-up analysis, we establish the existence of nontrivial solutions under broader boundary conditions than those considered in previous studies. In contrast to the unweighted approach developed by Ricciardi (2006), the incorporation of variable weights \(\rho(x)\) enables a more accurate representation of complex geometric domains. This generalization addresses cases where the geometry of the manifold or external factors induce local fluctuations, thereby enhancing the applicability of mean field models to real-world turbulence phenomena. The weighted Sobolev framework also strengthens control over the nonlinearity in the problem, reducing the risk of blow-up and ensuring the convergence of solutions in the \(H^1(M)\) space. The analysis reveals new conditions for the existence of solutions, including situations where classical methods may fail due to a lack of compactness. The significant advancement lies in the flexibility of the model; the inclusion of weights allows for a more precise description of physical systems in varied settings, representing a key advantage over the original unweighted problem. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of geometric and physical constraints in turbulent behavior and pave new pathways for future research on nonlinear partial differential equations in complex domains.</description>

      <title>Solitary waves for the power degenerate NLS -- existence and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a semilinear Schr\"odinger equation, driven by the power degenerate second order differential operator $\nabla\cdot (|x|^{2a} \nabla), a\in (0,1)$. We construct the solitary waves, in the sharp range of parameters, as minimizers of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg's inequality. Depending on the parameter $a$ and the nonlinearity, we establish a number of properties, such as positivity, smoothness (away from the origin) and almost exponential decay. Then, and as a consequence of our variational constrcution, we completely characterize the spectral stability of the said solitons. We pose some natural conjectures, which are still open -- such as the radiality of the ground states, the non-degeneracy and most importantly uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Random acoustic boundary conditions and Weyl's law for Laplace-Beltrami operators on non-smooth boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by engineering and photonics research on resonators in random or uncertain environments, we study rigorous randomizations of boundary conditions for wave equations of the acoustic-type in Lipschitz domains $\mathcal{O}$. First, a parametrization of essentially all m-dissipative boundary condition by contraction operators in the boundary $L^2$-space is constructed with the use of m-boundary tuples (boundary value spaces). We consider randomizations of these contraction operators that lead to acoustic operators random in the resolvent sense. To this end, the use of Neumann-to-Dirichlet maps and Krein-type resolvent formulae is crucial. We give a description of random m-dissipative boundary conditions that produce acoustic operators with almost surely (a.s.) compact resolvents, and so, also with a.s. discrete spectra. For each particular applied model, one can choose a specific boundary condition from the constructed class either by means of optimization, or on the base of empirical observations. A mathematically convenient randomization is constructed in terms of eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta^{\partial \mathcal{O}}$ on the boundary $\mathcal{O}$ of the domain. We show that for this randomization the compactness of the resolvent is connected with the Weyl-type asymptotics for the eigenvalues of $\Delta^{\partial \mathcal{O}}$.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to the modeling of compressible magnetoelastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a model of the evolution of a (solid) magnetoelastic material. More specifically, the model we consider describes the evolution of a compressible magnetoelastic material with a non-convex energy and coupled to a gradient flow equation for the magnetization in the quasi-static setting. The viscous dissipation considered in this model induces an extended material derivative in the magnetic force balance. We prove existence of weak solutions based on De Giorgi's minimizing movements scheme, which allows us to deal with the non-convex energy as well as the non-convex state space for the deformation. In the application of this method we rely on the fact that the magnetic force balance in the model can be expressed in terms of the same energy and dissipation potentials as the equation of motion, allowing us to model the functional for the discrete minimization problem based on these potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random walk spaces are a general framework for the study of PDEs. They include as particular cases locally finite weighted connected graphs and nonlocal settings involving symmetric integrable kernels on $\mathbb{R}^N$. We are interested in the study of evolution problems involving two random walk structures so that the associated functionals have different growth on each structure. We also deal with the case of a functional with different growth on a partition of the random walk.</description>

      <title>Cascade equation for the discontinuities in the Stefan problem with surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stefan problem with surface tension is well known to exhibit discontinuities in the associated moving aggregate (i.e., in the domain occupied by the solid), whose structure has only been understood under translational or radial symmetry so far. In this paper, we derive an auxiliary partial differential equation of second-order hyperbolic type, referred to as the cascade equation, that captures said discontinuities in the absence of any symmetry assumptions. Specializing to the one-phase setting, we introduce a novel (global) notion of weak solution to the cascade equation, which is defined as a limit of mean-field game equilibria. For the spatial dimension two, we show the existence of such a weak solution and prove a natural perimeter estimate on the associated moving aggregate.</description>

      <title>Stabilization for a degenerate wave equation with time-varying delay in the boundary control input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A degenerate wave equation with time-varying delay in the boundary control input is considered. The well-posedness of the system is established by applying the semigroup theory. The boundary stabilization of the degenerate wave equation is concerned and the uniform exponential decay of solutions is obtained by combining the energy estimates with suitable Lyapunov functionals and an integral inequality under suitable conditions.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the dynamical sine-Gordon model up to $6\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness of the dynamical sine-Gordon model up to the third threshold, i.e., for parameters $\beta^2 &lt; 6\pi$. The key novelty in our approach is the introduction of the so-called resonant equation, whose solution is entirely deterministic and completely captures the size of the solution to the dynamical sine-Gordon model. The probabilistic fluctuations in the dynamical sine-Gordon model are then controlled using uniform estimates for modified stochastic objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove a sharp defective log-Sobolev inequality on H-type groups. Then we use such an inequality to show exponential integrability of Lipschitz functions with respect to the heat kernel measure. A defective log-Sobolev-type inequality for the Gaussian-like measure with respect to the sub-Riemannian distance is also proved on arbitrary H-type groups.</description>

      <title>Blowup for the defocusing septic complex-valued nonlinear wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^{4+1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove blowup for the defocusing septic complex-valued nonlinear wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^{4+1}$. This work builds on the earlier results of Shao, Wei, and Zhang [SWZ2024a,SWZ2024b], reducing the order of the nonlinearity from $29$ to $7$ in $\mathbb{R}^{4+1}$. As in [SWZ2024a,SWZ2024b], the proof hinges on a connection between solutions to the nonlinear wave equation and the relativistic Euler equations via a front compression blowup mechanism. More specifically, the problem is reduced to constructing smooth, radially symmetric, self-similar imploding profiles for the relativistic Euler equations.
  As with implosion for the compressible Euler equations, the relativistic analogue admits a countable family of smooth imploding profiles. The result in [SWZ2024a] represents the construction of the first profile in this family. In this paper, we construct a sequence of solutions corresponding to the higher-order profiles in the family. This allows us to saturate the inequalities necessary to show blowup for the defocusing complex-valued nonlinear wave equation with an integer order of nonlinearity and radial symmetry via this mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a free boundary problem for the heat equation with a given non-negative external heat source. On the free boundary, we impose the zero Dirichlet condition and the fixed normal derivative so that heat escapes from the boundary. In various settings, we show that there exist no solutions when the initial temperature equals the fixed temperature no matter where the initial location of the free boundary is given provided that the external heat source is bounded from above. We also note that there is a chance to have a solution when the external temperature is unbounded as time tends to zero by giving a self-similar solution.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we look at the nonlinear bending theory for thin prestrained elastic sheets with an oscillating periodic structure. We show that all limiting (in the sense of $\Gamma-$convergence) energy functionals which formally correspond to an infinite thickness-to-period ratio are equivalent. In contrast, there are several different limit models that formally correspond to a $0$ thickness-to-period ratio.</description>

Abstract: We study the mixing properties of the white-forced Navier--Stokes system in an infinite periodic pipe $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$. Assuming that the noise is sufficiently non-degenerate, we prove the uniqueness of stationary measure and polynomial mixing in the dual-Lipschitz metric. The proof combines the coupling method with a Foia\c{s}--Prodi type estimate and weighted growth estimates.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions for a class of Sobolev critical Schrodinger systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions for the coupled Schrodinger system with Sobolev critical coupling term. We present several existence and multiplicity results under some explicit conditions. Furthermore, we present a non-existence result for the defocusing case. This paper, together with the paper [T. Bartsch, H. W. Li and W. M. Zou. Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations 62 (2023) ], provides a more comprehensive understanding of normalized solutions for Sobolev critical systems. We believe our methods can also address the open problem of the multiplicity of normalized solutions for Schrodinger systems with Sobolev critical growth, with potential for future development and broader applicability.</description>

Our results extend the classical Hopf-Oleinik lemma and boundary Lipschitz regularity for domains with $C^{1,\mathrm{Dini}}$ boundaries, while also recovering the known $C^{1-\varepsilon}$ regularity for flat Lipschitz domains, unifying both theories with a single proof.</description>

      <title>On an impulsive faecal-oral model in a moving infected environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an impulsive faecal-oral model with free boundary to in order to understand how the exposure to a periodic disinfection and expansion of the infected region together influences the spread of faecal-oral diseases. We first check that this impulsive model has a unique globally nonnegative classical solution. The principal eigenvalues of the corresponding periodic eigenvalue problem at the initial position and infinity are defined as $\lambda^{\vartriangle}_{1}(h_{0})$ and $\lambda^{\vartriangle}_{1}(\infty)$, respectively. They both depend on the impulse intensity $1-G'(0)$ and expansion capacities $\mu_{1}$ and $\mu_{2}$. The possible long time dynamical behaviours of the model are next explored in terms of $\lambda^{\vartriangle}_{1}(h_{0})$ and $\lambda^{\vartriangle}_{1}(\infty)$: if $\lambda^{\vartriangle}_{1}(\infty)\geq 0$, then the diseases are vanishing; if $\lambda^{\vartriangle}_{1}(\infty)&lt;0$ and $\lambda^{\vartriangle}_{1}(h_{0})\leq 0$, then the disease are spreading; if $\lambda^{\vartriangle}_{1}(\infty)&lt;0$ and $\lambda^{\vartriangle}_{1}(h_{0})&gt; 0$, then for any given $\mu_{1}$, there exists a $\mu_{0}$ such that spreading happens as $\mu_{2}\in( \mu_{0},+\infty)$, and vanishing happens as $\mu_{2}\in(0, \mu_{0})$. Finally, numerical examples are presented to corroborate the correctness of the obtained theoretical findings and to further understand the influence of an impulsive intervention and expansion capacity on the spreading of the diseases. Our results show that both the increase of impulse intensity and the decrease of expansion capacity have a positive contribution to the prevention and control of the diseases.</description>

      <title>On the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with nonlocal dynamic boundary condition and singular potential: well-posedness, regularity and asymptotic limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equations in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ $(d\in\{2,3\})$, subject to a nonlocal kinetic rate dependent dynamic boundary condition. This diffuse interface model describes phase separation processes with possible long-range interactions both within the bulk material and on its boundary. The kinetic rate $1/L$, with $L\in[0,+\infty]$, distinguishes different types of bulk-boundary interactions. For the initial boundary value problem endowed with general singular potentials, including the physically relevant logarithmic potential, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of global weak solutions when the bulk and boundary chemical potentials are coupled through a Robin-type boundary condition, i.e., $L\in(0,+\infty)$. The proof of existence is based on a Yosida approximation of singular potentials and a suitable Faedo-Galerkin scheme. Subsequently, we investigate asymptotic limits as the kinetic rate approaches zero or infinity, which yield weak well-posedness for the limiting cases $L=+\infty$ and $L=0$, respectively. Under appropriate assumptions on the interaction kernels, we derive explicit convergence rates for the Yosida approximation as $\varepsilon\to0$ and for the asymptotic limits as $L\to0$ or $L\to+\infty$. Finally, we demonstrate that every global weak solution exhibits a propagation of regularity over time and establish the instantaneous strict separation property.</description>

Abstract: We define a dissipative measure-valued (DMV) solution to the system of equations governing the motion of a general compressible, viscous, electrically and heat conducting fluid driven by non-conservative boundary conditions. We show the stability of strong solutions to the full compressible magnetohydrodynamic system in a large class of these DMV solutions. In other words, we prove a DMV-strong uniqueness principle: a DMV solution coincides with the strong solution emanating from the same initial data as long as the latter exists.</description>

Moreover, we establish finite time blow-up for solutions with positive energy and infinite variance.</description>

      <title>Validity of Prandtl's boundary layer from the Boltzmann theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We justify Prandtl equations and higher order Prandtl expansion from the hydrodynamic limit of the Boltzmann equations. Our fluid data is of the form $\text{shear flow}$, plus $\sqrt{\kappa}$ order term in analytic spaces in $(x_1, x_2)\in\mathbb T^2$ and Sobolev in $x_3\in\mathbb{R}_+$. This work is the first to rigorously justify the Prandtl equations from the hydrodynamic limits of the Boltzmann equations. The novelty lies in obtaining estimates for the linearized Boltzmann equation with a diffusive boundary condition around a Prandtl layer shear flow in analytic spaces. The key techniques involve delicate commutator estimates and the use of local conservation law.</description>

Abstract: Given a psh function $\varphi\in\mathcal{E}(\Omega)$ and a smooth, bounded $\theta\geq 0$, it is known that one can solve the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation $\mathrm{MA}(\varphi_\theta)=\theta^n\mathrm{MA}(\varphi)$, with some form of Dirichlet boundary values, by work of Ahag--Cegrell--Czy\.{z}--Hiep. Under some natural conditions, we show that $\varphi_\theta$ is comparable to $\theta\varphi$ on much of $\Omega$; especially, it is bounded on the interior of $\{\theta = 0\}$. Our results also apply to complex Hessian equations, and can be used to produce interesting Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic geometry at infinity of quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an approach developed by Melrose to study the geometry at infinity of the Nakajima metric on the reduced Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$, we show that the Nakajima metric on a quiver variety is quasi-asymptotically conical (QAC) whenever its defining parameters satisfy an appropriate genericity assumption. As such, it is of bounded geometry and of maximal volume growth. Being QAC is one of two main ingredients allowing us to use the work of Kottke and the second author to compute its reduced $L^2$-cohomology and prove the Vafa-Witten conjecture. The other is a spectral gap for the Hodge-deRham operator associated with an exact $3$-Sasakian wedge metric that we obtain using the Weitzenb\"ock formula of Semmelmann and Weingart on quaternionic-K\"ahler manifolds. This yields in particular a generalization and a different proof of the vanishing theorem in cohomology originally obtained by Galicki and Salamon for closed $3$-Sasakian manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We establish a direct log-epiperimetric inequality for Yang--Mills fields in arbitrary dimension and we leverage on it to prove uniqueness of tangent cones with isolated singularity for energy minimizing Yang--Mills fields and $\omega$-ASD connections (where $\omega$ is not necessarily closed) satisfying some suitable regularity assumptions. En route to this we establish a Luckhaus type lemma for Yang--Mills connections to exclude curvature concentration along blow-up sequences.</description>

      <title>Global existence and mean-field limit for a stochastic interacting particle system of signed Coulomb charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system of stochastic differential equations with singular drift which describes the dynamics of signed particles in two dimensions interacting by the Coulomb potential. In contrast to the well-studied cases of identical particles that either all repel each other or all attract each other, this system contains both `positive' and `negative' particles. Equal signs repel and opposite signs attract each other; apart from the sign, the potential is the same.
  We derive results on well-posedness of the system, on the type of collisions that can occur, and on the mean-field limit as the number of particles tends to infinity. Our results demonstrate that the signed system shares features of both the fully repulsive and the fully attractive cases. Our proof method is inspired by the work of Fournier and Jourdain (The Annals of Applied Probability, 27, pp. 2807-2861, 2017) on the fully attractive case; we construct an approximate system of equations, establish uniform estimates, and use tightness to pass to limits.</description>

      <title>A Critical Drift-Diffusion Equation: Connections to the Diffusion on $\textbf{SL}(2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we connect two seemingly unrelated objects: On the one hand is a two-dimensional drift-diffusion process $X$ with divergence-free and time-independent drift $b$. The drift is given by a stationary Gaussian ensemble, and we focus on the critical case where a small-scale cut-off is necessary for well-posedness and the large-scale cancellations lead to a borderline super-diffusive behavior. On the other hand is the natural diffusion $F$ on the Lie group $\textbf{SL}(2)$ of matrices of determinant one. As a consequence of this connection, the strongly non-Gaussian character of $F$ transmits to how $X$ depends on its starting point.</description>

      <title>Orbifold singularity formation along ancient and immortal Ricci flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In stark contrast to lower dimensions, we produce a plethora of ancient and immortal Ricci flows in real dimension $4$ with Einstein orbifolds as tangent flows at infinity. For instance, for any $k\in\mathbb{N}_0$, we obtain continuous families of non-isometric ancient Ricci flows on $\#k(\mathbb{S}^2\times \mathbb{S}^2)$ depending on a number of parameters growing linearly in $k$, and a family of half-PIC ancient Ricci flows on $\mathbb{CP}^2\#\mathbb{CP}^2$.
  The ancient/immortal dichotomy is determined by a notion of linear stability of orbifold singularities with respect to the expected way for them to appear along Ricci flow: by bubbling off Ricci-flat ALE metrics. We discuss the case of Ricci solitons orbifolds and motivate a conjecture that spherical and cylindrical solitons with orbifold singularities, which are unstable in our sense, should not appear along Ricci flow by bubbling off Ricci-flat ALE metrics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the codimension-one nonlinear asymptotic stability of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family of black holes in the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-neutral scalar field model, up to and including the event horizon. More precisely, we show that there exists a teleologically defined, codimension-one "submanifold" $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ of the moduli space of spherically symmetric characteristic data for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field system lying close to the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family, such that any data in $\mathfrak M_\mathrm{stab}$ evolve into a solution with the following properties as time goes to infinity: (i) the metric decays to a member of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family uniformly up to the event horizon, (ii) the scalar field decays to zero pointwise and in an appropriate energy norm, (iii) the first translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field is approximately constant on the event horizon $\mathcal H^+$, (iv) for "generic" data, the second translation-invariant ingoing null derivative of the scalar field grows linearly along the event horizon. Due to the coupling of the scalar field to the geometry via the Einstein equations, suitable components of the Ricci tensor exhibit non-decay and growth phenomena along the event horizon. Points (i) and (ii) above reflect the "stability" of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om family and points (iii) and (iv) verify the presence of the celebrated "Aretakis instability" for the linear wave equation on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in the full nonlinear Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field model.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear PDEs with modulated dispersion II: Korteweg--de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7675</link>
      <description>arXiv:1406.7675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.)
  We study dispersive equations with a time non-homogeneous modulation acting on the linear dispersion term. As primary models, we consider the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) and related equations such as the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) and the intermediate long wave equation (ILW), imposing certain irregularity conditions on the time non-homogeneous modulation. In this work, we establish phenomena called regularization by noise in three-folds: (i) When the modulation is sufficiently irregular, we show that the modulated KdV on both the circle and the real line is locally well-posed in the regime where the (unmodulated) KdV equation is known to be ill-posed. In particular, given any $s \in \mathbb R$, we show that the modulated KdV on the circle with a sufficiently irregular modulation is locally well-posed in $H^s(\mathbb T)$. Moreover, by adapting the $I$-method to the current modulated setting, we prove global well-posedness of the modulated KdV in negative Sobolev spaces. (ii) It is known that certain (semilinear) dispersive equations such as BO and ILW exhibit quasilinear nature. We show that sufficiently irregular modulations make the modulated versions of these equations semilinear by establishing their local well-posedness by a contraction argument, providing local Lipschitz continuity of the solution map. (iii) We also prove nonlinear smoothing for these modulated equations, where we show that a gain of regularity of the nonlinear part becomes (arbitrarily) larger for more irregular modulations.
  As applications of our approach, we also include further examples.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions to Kirchhoff type equations with a critical growth nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with normalized solutions of the Kirchhoff type equation
  \begin{equation*} -M\left(\int_{\R^N}|\nabla u|^2\mathrm{d} x\right)\Delta u = \lambda u +f(u) \ \ \mathrm{in} \ \ \mathbb{R}^N \end{equation*} with $u \in S_c:=\left\{u \in H^1(\R^N): \int_{\R^N}u^2 \mathrm{d}x=c^2\right\}$. When $N=2$ and $f$ has exponential critical growth at infinity, normalized mountain pass type solutions are obtained via the variational methods. When $N \ge 4$, $M(t)=a+bt$ with $a$, $b&gt;0$ and $f$ has Sobolev critical growth at infinity, we investigate the existence of normalized ground state solutions and normalized mountain pass type solutions. Moreover, the non-existence of normalized solutions is also considered.</description>

      <title>Variational formulations of ODE-Net as a mean-field optimal control problem and existence results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical analysis of ODE-Net, a continuum model of deep neural networks (DNNs). In recent years, Machine Learning researchers have introduced ideas of replacing the deep structure of DNNs with ODEs as a continuum limit. These studies regard the "learning" of ODE-Net as the minimization of a "loss" constrained by a parametric ODE. Although the existence of a minimizer for this minimization problem needs to be assumed, only a few studies have investigated its existence analytically in detail. In the present paper, the existence of a minimizer is discussed based on a formulation of ODE-Net as a measure-theoretic mean-field optimal control problem. The existence result is proved when a neural network, which describes a vector field of ODE-Net, is linear with respect to learnable parameters. The proof employs the measure-theoretic formulation combined with the direct method of Calculus of Variations. Secondly, an idealized minimization problem is proposed to remove the above linearity assumption. Such a problem is inspired by a kinetic regularization associated with the Benamou--Brenier formula and universal approximation theorems for neural networks. The proofs of these existence results use variational methods, differential equations, and mean-field optimal control theory. They will stand for a new analytic way to investigate the learning process of deep neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on an elastic dislocation problem that is motivated by applications in the geophysical and seismological communities. In our model, the displacement satisfies the Lam\'e system in a bounded domain with a mixed homogeneous boundary condition. We also allow the occurrence of discontinuities in both the displacement and traction fields on the fault curve/surface. By the variational approach, we first prove the well-posedness of the direct dislocation problem in a rather general setting with the Lam\'e parameters being real-valued $L^\infty$ functions and satisfy the strong convexity condition. Next, by considering that the Lam\'e parameters are constant and the fault curve/surface possesses certain corner singularities, we establish a local characterization of the jump vectors at the corner points over the dislocation curve/surface. In our study, the dislocation is geometrically rather general and may be open or closed. We establish the unique results for the inverse problem of determining the dislocation curve/surface and the jump vectors for both cases.</description>

Abstract: We study an inverse problem of determining a time-dependent potential appearing in the wave equation in conformally transversally anisotropic manifolds of dimension three or higher. These are compact Riemannian manifolds with boundary that are conformally embedded in a product of the real line and a transversal manifold. Under the assumption of the attenuated geodesic ray transform being injective on the transversal manifold, we prove the unique determination of time-dependent potentials from the knowledge of a certain partial Cauchy data set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12635v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present in this paper a new way to define weighted Sobolev spaces when the weight functions are arbitrary small. This new approach can replace the old one consisting in modifying the domain by removing the set of points where at least one of the weight functions is very small. The basic idea is to replace the distributional derivative with a new notion of weak derivative. In this way, non-locally integrable functions can considered in these spaces. Indeed, assumptions under which a degenerate elliptic partial differential equation has a unique non-locally integrable solution are given. Tools like a Poincar\'e Inequality and a trace operator are developed, and density results of smooth function are established.</description>

Abstract: A central object in the analysis of the water wave problem is the Dirichlet-Neumann operator. This paper is devoted to the study of its spectrum in the context of the water wave system linearized near equilibrium in a domain with a variable bottom, assumed to be a $C^2$ periodic function. We use the analyticity of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator with respect to the bottom variation and combine it with general properties of elliptic systems and spectral theory for self-adjoint operators to develop a Bloch-Floquet theory and describe the structure of its spectrum. We find that under some conditions on the bottom variations, the spectrum is composed of bands separated by gaps, with explicit formulas for their sizes and locations.</description>

We show that if $\lim\limits_{p\rightarrow\infty}q(p)=\infty$, then $\lim\limits_{p\rightarrow\infty}\lambda_{p,q(p)}^{1/p}=\left\Vert d_{\Omega }\right\Vert _{\infty}^{-1}$, where $d_{\Omega}$ denotes the distance function to the boundary of $\Omega.$ Moreover, in the hyperdiffusive case: $\lim\limits_{p\rightarrow\infty}\frac{q(p)}{p}=\infty,$ we prove that each sequence $u_{p_{n},q(p_{n})},$ with $p_{n}\rightarrow\infty,$ admits a subsequence converging uniformly in $\overline{\Omega}$ to a viscosity solution to the problem \[ \left\{ \begin{array} [c]{lll} -\Delta_{\infty}u=0 &amp; \text{in} &amp; \Omega\setminus M\\ u=0 &amp; \text{on} &amp; \partial\Omega\\ u=1 &amp; \text{in} &amp; M, \end{array} \right. \] where $M$ is a closed subset of the set of all maximum points of $d_{\Omega}.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of Ekman boundary layer solutions near the non-flat boundaries presents a complex challenge, with limited research on this issue. In Masmoudi's pioneering work [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 53 (2000), 432--483], the Ekman boundary layer solution was investigated on the domain $\mathbb{T}^2\times [\varepsilon f(x,y), 1]$, where $\varepsilon$ is a small constant and $f(x,y)$ denotes a periodic smooth function. This study investigates the influence of the geometric structure of the boundary $B(x,y)$ within the boundary layer. Specifically, for well-prepared initial data in the domain $\mathbb{R}^2\times[B(x,y), B(x,y)+2]$, if the boundary surface $B(x,y)$ is smooth and satisfies certain geometric constraints concerning its Gaussian and mean curvatures, then we derive an approximate boundary layer solution. Additionally, according to the curvature and incompressible conditions, the limit system we constructed is a 2D primitive system with damping and rotational effects. From the model's background, it reflects the characteristics arising from rotational effects. Finally, we validate the convergence of this approximate solution. No smallness condition on the amplitude of boundary $B(x, y)$ is required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the existence of solutions for the inviscid version of the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov equations in 3D, a macro-scale model of superfluidity. This system couples the incompressible Euler equations for the normal fluid and superfluid using a nonlinear mutual friction term that acts only at points of non-zero superfluid vorticity. In the first rigorous study of the inviscid HVBK system, we construct a unique local-in-time solution that is analytic in time and space.</description>

      <title>A bilinear fractional integral operator for Euler-Riesz systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a uniform estimate for a bilinear fractional integral operator via restricted weak-type endpoint estimates and Marcinkiewicz interpolation. This estimate is crucial in the integrability analysis of a tensor-valued bilinear fractional integral operator associated with Euler-Riesz systems modeling mean-field interactions induced by a singular kernel. The tensorial operator arises from a reformulation of the Euler-Riesz system that yields a gain in integrability for finite energy solutions through compensated integrability. Additionally, for smooth periodic solutions of the reformulated system, we derive a stability result.</description>

      <title>A new framework for particle-wave interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In plasma physics, collisionless charged particles are transported following the dynamics of a meanfield Vlasov equation with a self-consistent electric field generated by the charge density. Due to the long range interaction between particles, the generating electric field oscillates and disperses like a Klein-Gordon dispersive wave, known in the physical literature as plasma oscillations or Langmuir's oscillatory waves. The oscillatory electric field then in turn drives particles. Despite its great physical importance, the question of whether such a nonlinear particle-wave interaction would remain regular globally and be damped in the large time has been an outstanding open problem. In this paper, we propose a new framework to resolve this exact nonlinear interaction. Specifically, we employ the framework to establish the large time behavior and scattering of solutions to the nonlinear Vlasov-Klein-Gordon system in the small initial data regime. The novelty of this work is to provide a detailed physical space description of particles moving in an oscillatory field and to resolve oscillations for the electric field generated by the collective interacting particles. This appears to be the first such a result analyzing oscillations in the physical phase space $\mathbb{R}^3_x\times \mathbb{R}_v^3$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-fibered boundary pseudodifferential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.16650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a pseudodifferential calculus for differential operators associated to quasi-fibered boundary metrics (QFB metrics), a class of metrics including the quasi-asymptotically conical metrics (QAC metrics) of Degeratu-Mazzeo and the quasi-asymptotically locally Euclidean metrics (QALE metrics) of Joyce. Introducing various principal symbols, we introduce the notion of fully elliptic QFB operators and show that those are Fredholm when acting on QFB Sobolev spaces. For QAC metrics, we also develop a pseudodifferential calculus for the conformally related class of Qb metrics. We use these calculi to construct a parametrix for the Hodge-deRham operator of certain QFB metrics, allowing us to show that it is Fredholm on suitable Sobolev spaces and that the space of $L^2$ harmonic forms is finite dimensional. Our parametrix is obtained by inverting certain model operators at infinity, inversions that we achieve in part through a fine understanding of the low energy limit of the resolvent of the Hodge-deRham operator. Our parametrix also implies that $L^2$ harmonic forms decay faster at infinity than an arbitrary $L^2$ form, the extra decay being quantified in terms of a small negative power of the distance function. This decay of $L^2$ harmonic forms is used in a companion paper to study the $L^2$ cohomology of some $QFB$ metrics.</description>

Abstract: We establish various forms of the following certainty principle: a set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ contains a given finite linear pattern, provided that $S$ is a support of the Fourier transform of a sufficiently singular probability measure on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. As its main corollary, we provide new dimensional estimates for PDE- and Fourier-constrained vector measures. Those results, in certain cases of restrictions given by homogeneous operators, improve known bounds related to the notion of the $k$-wave cone.</description>

      <title>The Eigenvalue Problem for the Laplacian via Conformal Mapping and the Gohberg--Sigal Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.11026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian for a planar, simply connected domain. The eigenvalues admit a characterization in terms of a layer potential of the Helmholtz equation. Using the exterior conformal mapping associated with the given domain, we reformulate the layer potential as an infinite-dimensional matrix. Based on this matrix representation, we develop a finite section approach for approximating the Laplacian eigenvalues and provide a convergence analysis by applying the Gohberg--Sigal theory for operator-valued functions. Moreover, we derive an asymptotic formula for the Laplacian eigenvalues on deformed domains that results from the changes in the conformal mapping coefficients.</description>

      <title>Non--regular McKean--Vlasov equations and calibration problem in local stochastic volatility models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to deal with the question of the existence of a calibrated local stochastic volatility model in finance, we investigate a class of McKean--Vlasov equations where a minimal continuity assumption is imposed on the coefficients. Namely, the drift coefficient and, in particular, the volatility coefficient are not necessarily continuous in the measure variable for the Wasserstein topology. In this paper, we provide an existence result and show an approximation by $N$--particle system or propagation of chaos for this type of McKean--Vlasov equations. As a direct result, we are able to deduce the existence of a calibrated local stochastic volatility model for an appropriate choice of stochastic volatility parameters. The associated propagation of chaos result is also proved.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed neural network framework for modeling obstacle-related equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has been highly successful in some applications. Nevertheless, its use for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) has only been of recent interest with current state-of-the-art machine learning libraries, e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are an attractive tool for solving partial differential equations based on sparse and noisy data. Here extend PINNs to solve obstacle-related PDEs which present a great computational challenge because they necessitate numerical methods that can yield an accurate approximation of the solution that lies above a given obstacle. The performance of the proposed PINNs is demonstrated in multiple scenarios for linear and nonlinear PDEs subject to regular and irregular obstacles.</description>

      <title>Schottky-Invariant $p$-Adic Diffusion Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parametrised diffusion operator on the regular domain $\Omega$ of a $p$-adic Schottky group is constructed. It is defined as an integral operator on the complex-valued functions on $\Omega$ which are invariant under the Schottky group $\Gamma$, where integration is against the measure defined by an invariant regular differential 1-form $\omega$. It is proven that the space of Schottky invariant $L^2$-functions on $\Omega$ outside the zeros of $\omega$ has an orthonormal basis consiting of $\Gamma$-invariant extensions of Kozyrev wavelets which are eigenfunctions of the operator. The eigenvalues are calculated, and it is shown that the heat equation for this operator provides a unique solution for its Cauchy problem with Schottky-invariant continuous initial conditions supportes outside the zero set of $\omega$, and gives rise to a strong Markov process on the corresponding orbit space for the Schottky group whose paths are c\`adl\`ag.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a detailed and systematic study of weak (singular) Hermite-Einstein structures on homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles over rational homogeneous varieties. We use standard tools from spectral geometry, Harmonic analysis, and Cartan's highest weight theory to provide a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier series and intersection numbers under which an $L^{2}$-function can be realized as mean curvature of a singular Hermitian structure on an irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundle. We prove that the condition provided is necessary and sufficient for functions that belong to certain interpolation spaces. In the particular case of line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type, we describe explicitly in terms of representation theory the solutions of the underlying geometric PDE. Also, we establish a sufficient condition in terms of Fourier coefficients and intersection numbers for solvability and convergence of the weak Hermite-Einstein flow on irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles. As an application of our methods, we describe the first explicit examples in the literature of solutions to several geometric flows, including Donaldson's heat flow, Yang-Mills heat flow, and the gradient flow of Donaldson's Lagrangian, on line bundles over irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type. Additionally, we show that every polynomial central charge function gives rise to a weak Donaldson's Lagrangian $\mathcal{M}$. In the particular case of irreducible homogeneous holomorphic vector bundles, we prove that the gradient flow of $\mathcal{M}$ converges to a Hermitian structure which is, up to a gauge transformation, a $Z$-critical Hermitian structure in the large volume limit.</description>

      <title>Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic evolution equations driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic semi-linear evolution equation driven by fractional Brownian motion \mathrm{d} X(t)= \left( AX(t) + f(t, X(t)) \right) \mathrm{d}t + g\left(t, X(t)\right)\mathrm{d}B^H_{Q}(t), where A is an exponentially stable linear operator acting on a separable Hilbert space \mathbb{H}, coefficients f and g are Poisson stable in time, and B^H_Q (t) is a Q-cylindrical fBm with Hurst index H. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution for this equation. Then, we prove that under the condition where the functions f and g are sufficiently "small", the equation admits a solution that exhibits the same character of recurrence as f and g. The discussion is further extended to the asymptotic stability of these Poisson stable solutions. Finally, we include an example to validate our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi (SHJ) equations, instability points are the space-time locations where two eternal solutions with the same asymptotic velocity differ. Another crucial structure in such equations is shocks, which are the space-time locations where the velocity field is discontinuous. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the structure and relationships between shocks, instability, and competition interfaces in the Brownian last-passage percolation model, which serves as a prototype of a semi-discrete inviscid stochastic HJ equation in one space dimension. Among our findings, we show that the shock trees of the two unstable eternal solutions differ within the instability region and align outside of it. Furthermore, we demonstrate that one can reconstruct a skeleton of the instability region from these two shock trees.</description>
