      <title>Space-time Floquet operator: Non-reciprocity and fractional topology of space-time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a space-time Floquet operator, a generalization of the conventional Floquet operator, that captures the long-time behavior of space-time crystals - systems where spatial and temporal periodicities are intrinsically intertwined. Unlike the standard Floquet operator, which describes evolution over a full time period, the space-time Floquet operator evolves the system over a fraction of the period, thereby resolving finer details of its dynamics. Its eigenmode spectrum defines a space-time band structure that unfolds conventional Floquet bands to respect the intertwined crystal symmetry in reciprocal wavevector-frequency space. We relate the topology of these space-time bands to quantized transport phenomena, such as Bloch oscillations and adiabatic charge transport, and uncover a fractional version of the latter. We also demonstrate how nonreciprocal parametric resonances are naturally anticipated by our framework. The approach applies broadly to both classical and quantum systems with space-time symmetry, including non-Hermitian crystals.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic drag in partly gated 2d electron system via highly confined screened plasmons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation of photocurrent via photon drag effect enables very fast light detection with response time limited by momentum relaxation. At the same time, photon drag in bulk uniform samples is small by the virtue of small photon momentum. We show that the edge of metal gate placed above a two-dimensional electron system (2DES) provides highly non-uniform electromagnetic field that enhances the drag effect. We study the drag photovoltage using an exact solution of diffraction problem for 2DES with semi-infinite metal gate. We show that the only non-trivial dimensionless parameters governing the drag responsivity are the 2DES conductivity scaled by the free-space impedance {\eta} and gate-2DES separation scaled by the incident wavelength d/{\lambda}0. For radiation with electric field polarized orthogonal to the gate edge, the responsivity is maximized for inductive 2d conductivity with Im{\eta} ~ 1 and Re{\eta} &lt;&lt; 1, and becomes very small for the capacitive 2d conductivity. The electromagnetic ponderomotive force pushes the charge carriers under the gate at arbitrary 2d conductivity, and the force direction is opposite to that at metal-2DES lateral contact. These patterns are explained by the dominant role of gated 2d plasmons in the formation of PDE photovoltage.</description>

      <title>Financial Interactions and Collective States Banks, Investors and Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we applied a field formalism to analyze capital allocation and accumulation within a microeconomic framework of investors and firms. The financial connections were modeled by a field of stakes, representing the links between agents. We showed that the resulting collective states were composed of interconnected groups of agents defined by their connections, their returns and disposable capital. However, within this framework, the collective states exhibited structural instability, as capital shortages in specific sectors could trigger cascades of defaults. The present model refines this framework by introducing a third type of agent, banks, a type of investor that can create money through loans. We show that money creation neither eliminates systemic instability nor prevents the emergence of defaults. In fact, the effect of banks on system stability and defaults is ambiguous: When banks favor firms over investors, money creation stabilizes the system by providing the necessary capital to prevent initial defaults, whereas when banks favor investors over firms, investors' influence is strengthened, potentially amplifying instability and defaults. Moreover, regardless of whether they favor investors or firms, banks may facilitate the propagation of defaults once they have started. Ultimately, because banks are themselves investors, the emergence of highly capitalized, high-return banks can directly generate instability in the system. Beyond these mechanisms, the analysis reveals the structural limits of macroprudential regulation. Highly capitalized, high-return investors and banks may appear more diversified and resilient, yet they constitute the primary source of endogenous instability. The model thus highlights that systemic fragility is inherent to the very structure of financial interdependence and capital flows.</description>

      <title>The advancement of Brillouin Light Scattering with the assistance of nanoplasmonic structures. Enhancement and amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin light scattering (BLS) is a key technique in studying magnonic systems, but its sensitivity is often limited. While nanoplasmonic systems can enhance BLS through near-field effects, we propose a novel approach for additional amplification. In this conceptual paper, we show how to actively supply energy to a surface collective electromagnetic resonance (SCR) supported by a sparse layer of metal nanoparticles on a magnetic film. Proposed methods are designed to significantly amplify the efficiency of surface-enhanced Brillouin light scattering without increasing the intensity of the primary excitation. In the proposed scheme, the pump extends the propagation length of the SCR, leading directly to BLS amplification. We analyze the conditions for such amplification, with numerical estimates indicating a potential gain of more than an order of magnitude in the surface-wave amplitude. This gain far surpasses the modest increase achievable through passive enhancement alone. These findings outline a practical pathway to achieving BLS amplification in integrated magnonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Engineering phase-frustration induced flat bands in an aza-triangulene covalent Kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pi-conjugated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) provide a versatile platform for the realization of designer quantum nanomaterials. Strong electron-electron correlation within these artificial lattices can give rise to exotic phases of matter. Their experimental realization however requires precise control over orbital symmetry, charge localization, and band dispersion all arising from the effective hybridization between molecular linkers and nodes. Here, we present a modular strategy for constructing diatomic Kagome lattices from aza-[3]triangulene (A[3]T) nodes, in which a D3h symmetric ground state is stabilized through resonance contributions from a cumulenenic linker. First-principles density-functional theory and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy reveal that the hybridization of a sixfold degenerate set of edge-localized Wannier functions in the unit cell gives rise to orbital-phase frustration-induced non-trivial flat bands. These results establish a general design principle for engineering orbital interactions in organic lattices and open a pathway toward programmable COF-based quantum materials with correlated electronic ground states.</description>

Abstract: We report the discovery of a ternary compound, Eu$_{0.8}$Pt$_6$Al$_{15.8}$. We determine its chemical and structural characteristics based on energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy as well as both powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction, demonstrating that it crystallizes in a hexagonal structure type EuPt$_6$Al$_{16}$ with no reported structural analog. The electronic and magnetic properties are characterized by temperature- and field-dependent magnetization, and temperature-dependent resistance measurements, revealing that the Eu$^{2+}$ magnetic moments order antiferromagnetically below 2.8 K.</description>

      <title>Coherent terahertz control of metastable magnetization in FePS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crystal lattice governs the emergent electronic, magnetic, and optical properties of quantum materials, making structural tuning through strain, pressure, or chemical substitution a key approach for discovering and controlling novel quantum phases. Beyond static modifications, driving specific lattice modes with ultrafast stimuli offers a dynamic route for tailoring material properties out of equilibrium. However, achieving dynamic coherent control of the nonequilibrium phases via resonant excitation of lattice coherences remains largely unexplored. Such manipulation enables non-volatile, on demand amplification and suppression of order parameters on femtosecond timescales, necessary for next generation optoelectronic ultrafast computation. In this study, we demonstrate coherent phononic control of a newly discovered, light-induced metastable magnetization in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. By using a sequence of terahertz (THz) pulses, we modulate the magnetization amplitude at the frequencies of phonon coherences, whose infrared-active nature and symmetries are further revealed by polarization- and field-strength-dependent measurements. Furthermore, our two-dimensional THz spectroscopy, in tandem with first-principles numerical simulations, shows that these phonons nonlinearly displace a Raman active phonon, which induces the metastable net magnetization. These findings not only clarify the microscopic mechanism underlying the metastable state in FePS3 but also establish vibrational coherences in solids as a powerful tool for ultrafast quantum phase control, enabling manipulation of material functionalities far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Eigenvector Localization and Universal Regime Transitions in Multiplex Networks: A Perturbative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the transition between layer-localized and delocalized regimes in a general contact-based contagion model on multiplex networks. Using the inverse participation ratio, we characterize how activity shifts from being confined to a single layer to spreading across the entire system. Through a first-order perturbative analysis of the leading eigenvector of the supra-contact probability matrix, we derive an analytical expression for the fictive coupling $p^*$ that marks the crossover between the two regimes. This result reproduces and explains previously observed numerical scalings and extends them to a broad class of contact-based processes beyond the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model. We also obtain an analytical expression for the IPR of the non-dominant layer in the localized regime, confirming its power-law dependence on the coupling with exponent $\alpha=4$. Finally, we study the transition between non-dominant and dominant layers as a function of the intra-layer activity parameter $\gamma$. Our analytical findings are supported by dynamical simulations that highlight distinct susceptibility patterns across regimes. Altogether, this work provides a unified spectral framework for understanding localization and dominance transitions in multiplex contagion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal interaction and quantum friction in sliding Bi$_2$Se$_3$ topological surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films exhibit unique electronic properties arising from their topologically protected surface states. In a theoretical model capturing the essential physics of Dirac electrons in Bi$_2$Se$_3$, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. By using experimental Fermi velocities of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, our results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty minimization in electronic stopping cross-section measurements using the backscattering method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of electronic stopping cross sections is critical for ion beam analysis and related applications. While transmission methods are well established, backscattering approaches remain less explored from a metrological perspective, often lacking a systematic treatment of uncertainties. In this work, we present a quantitative framework to optimize experimental geometry in backscattering-based stopping measurements, explicitly accounting for both statistical and systematic errors. Applying the method to helium ions in gold thin films, we identify angular conditions that balance precision and accuracy, achieving total uncertainties below 3\% over a wide energy range. The results, benchmarked against SRIM and ICRU-49, demonstrate that our approach improves the reliability of RBS-derived stopping data and strengthens their use for reference purposes and model validation.</description>

      <title>Terahertz radiation induced attractive-repulsive Fermi polaron conversion in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of terahertz radiation-induced transitions between attractive and repulsive Fermi polaron states in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. Going beyond the simple few-particle trion picture, we develop a many-body description that explicitly accounts for correlations with the Fermi sea of resident charge carriers. We calculate the rate of the direct optical conversion process which has a threshold where the terahertz photon energy equals to the Fermi polaron binding energy. This process features a characteristic frequency dependence near the threshold, due to final-state electron-exciton scattering related to the trion correlation with the Fermi sea hole. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intense terahertz pulses can significantly heat the electron gas via Drude absorption enabling an additional, indirect conversion mechanism through collisions between hot electrons and polarons, which exhibits a strong exponential dependence on the electron temperature. Our results reveal the important role of many-body correlations and thermal effects in the terahertz-driven dynamics of excitonic complexes in two-dimensional semiconductors.</description>
