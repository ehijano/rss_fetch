      <title>Regularity for Mixed Local and Nonlocal Degenerate Elliptic Equations in the Heisenberg Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the regularity for mixed local and nonlocal degenerate elliptic equations in the Heisenberg group. Inspired by the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory, the local boundedness of weak subsolutions and the H\"{o}lder continuity of weak solutions to mixed local and nonlocal degenerate elliptic equations are established by deriving the Caccioppoli type inequality for weak subsolutions and the logarithmic estimates for weak supersolutions. Furthermore, the Harnack inequality for weak solutions and the weak Harnack inequality for weak supersolutions are proved by using the estimates involving a Tail term and expansion of positivity.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and asymptotic behavior of large strong solutions to the 3D full compressible Navier-Stokes equations with temperature-dependent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the global well-posedness of the Navier-Stokes equations with temperature-dependent coefficients is a challenging problem, especially in multi-dimensional space. In this paper, we study the 3D Navier-Stokes equations with temperature-dependent coefficients in the whole space, and establish the first result on the global existence of large strong solution when the initial density and the initial temperature are linearly equivalent to some large constant states. Moreover, the optimal decay rates of the solution to its associated equilibrium are established when the initial data belong to $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for some $p\in[1,2]$.</description>

      <title>Fractional Borg-Levinson Problem with small non-negative potential of small growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the fractional Borg-Levinson problem, an inverse spectral problem focused on recovering potentials from boundary spectral data. We demonstrate that the potential can, in fact, be uniquely determined by this data. However, for technical reasons, we restrict the fractional exponent to the interval (0.5, 1). Additionally, we assume that at least one of the potentials is small, non-negative, and exhibits mild growth. The smallness condition is made explicit in our calculations and depends only on the domain and the spatial dimension.</description>

Abstract: By means of an $L^1-L^\infty$ duality argument, it is proved that, in a suitable planar domain $\Omega$, the solution $u$ to the IBVP associated to the Navier-Stokes equations, with initial datum $u_0\in L^2(\Omega)$, satisfies the following estimate $$ \left(\int_0^{+\infty}\|u(\tau)\|_\infty^2{\hbox {d}}\tau\right)^{1/2}\le c(1+\|u_0\|_2)\|u_0\|_2, $$ proved by R.

      <title>On the geometric Brownian motion with state-dependent variable exponent diffusion term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic model involving state-dependent variable exponent $p(\cdot)$ which allows modeling of systems where noise intensity adapts to the current state. This new flexible theoretical framework generalizes both the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the Constant-Elasticity-of-Variance (CEV) models. We prove an existence-uniqueness theorem. We obtain an upper-bound approximation for the model-to-model pathwise error between our model and the GBM model as well as test its accuracy through analytical and numerical error estimates.</description>

      <title>Scattering for the Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Klein-Gordon-Zakharov system in two spatial dimensions, an important model in plasma physics. For small, smooth, and spatially localized initial data, we establish the global existence of solutions and characterize their sharp long-time behavior, including sharp time decay and scattering properties. A particularly interesting phenomenon is that the Klein-Gordon component exhibits modified scattering for certain initial data, while for others it undergoes linear scattering-a dichotomy highlighting delicate long-range interaction effects.
  The major obstacles are lack of symmetry and weak decay of the solution in two dimensions. To overcome these, we introduce a novel nonlinear transformation of the wave component and reinterpret the nonlinear coupling as a perturbation of the mass term in the Klein-Gordon equation. The proof employs a combination of physical space and frequency space methods.</description>

      <title>Hypocoercivity for the Linear Semiconductor Boltzmann Equation with Boundaries and Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish hypocoercivity for the semiconductor Boltzmann equation with the presence of an external electrical potential under the Maxwell boundary condition. We will construct a modified entropy Lyapunov functional, which is proved to be equivalent to some weighted norm of the corresponding function space. We then show that the entropy functional dissipates along the solutions, and the exponential decay to the equilibrium state of the system follows by a Gronwall type inequality. We also generalize our arguments to situations where uncertainties in our model arise,and the hypocoercivity method we have established is adopted to analyze the regularity of the solutions along the random space.</description>

      <title>Stable Determination of Coefficients in Nonlinear Dynamical Schr\"odinger Equations by Carleman Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of recovering stationary coefficients in a class of dynamical Schr\"odinger equations with locally analytic nonlinear terms. Upon treating the well-posedness for small initial data and trivial boundary data, we proceed to establish stable and unique determination provided knowledge of the coefficients near the boundary and the measured Neumann data of the solution. We discuss both the case of measurement on a subset of the boundary large enough to satisfy a certain geometrical condition and, under stronger assumptions on the regularity and size of the coefficients, the case of measurement on arbitrary subsets of the boundary. Our argument relies on high-order linearization and Carleman estimates for the linear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of 2-D Couette flow for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations at high Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear stability of the Couette flow for the two-dimensional compressible Navier--Stokes equations at high Reynolds numbers ($Re$) regime. It was proved that if the initial data $(\rho_{in},u_{in})$ satisfies $\|(\rho_{in},u_{in})-(1, y, 0)\|_{H^4(\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R})}\leq \epsilon Re^{-1}$ for some small $\epsilon$ independent of $Re$, then the corresponding solution exists globally and remains close to the Couette flow for all time. Formal asymptotics indicate that this stability threshold is sharp within the class of Sobolev perturbations. The proof relies on the Fourier-multiplier method and exploits three essential ingredients: (i) the introduction of ``good unknowns" that decouple the perturbation system; (ii) the construction of a carefully designed Fourier multiplier that simultaneously captures the enhanced dissipation and inviscid-damping effects while taming the lift-up mechanism; and (iii) the design of distinct energy functionals for the incompressible and compressible modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of weak solutions to the singular quasilinear elliptic problem $-\Delta_p u + \vartheta |\nabla u|^q = \frac{1}{u^\gamma} + f(u)$, in a bounded domain with the Dirichlet boundary condition, where $p&gt;1$, $\gamma&gt;0$, $0&lt;q\le p$, $\vartheta\ge0$ and $f:[0,+\infty)\to\mathbb{R}$ is a locally Lipschitz continuous function. We obtain a precise estimate for directional derivatives of positive solutions in a neighborhood of the boundary. We also deduce the symmetry of positive solutions to the problem in a bounded symmetric convex domain. Our results are new even in the case $p=2$ and $\vartheta=0$.</description>

      <title>Unconditional alignment of solutions to the Fokker-Planck-Navier-Stokes system with locally averaged Brinkman force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a coupled Fokker-Planck--Navier-Stokes (FPNS) system modeling the dynamics of interacting particles suspended in a viscous incompressible fluid, where the coupling occurs through a locally averaged Brinkman drag force. Our main result is the unconditional alignment and synchronization of particle and fluid velocities for all weak solutions, in any dimension, on the periodic domain. The proof leverages a new entropy method and a hypocoercivity framework, which together yield quantitative decay estimates and prevent density concentration, a key obstacle in previous analyses. Our approach applies to a broad class of nonlocal alignment protocols, including the Cucker-Smale model. We also prove develop well-posedness theory for global weak solutions with hypoelliptic regularization in any dimension, and global strong solutions in two dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroconvection in a porous medium under a strong transversal magnetic field is described by an active scalar equation for the charge density. The equation has global weak solutions with $L^{\infty}$ data. We show that for strong enough magnetic fields, $L^{\infty}$-small solutions are smooth globally in time and they obey surface quasigeostrophic equations in the limit of infinite magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation in Large Eddy Simulation: Addressing Model-Observation Mismatch from Navier-Stokes Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In atmospheric and turbulent flow modeling, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is often used to reduce computational cost, while observational data typically originates from the underlying physical system. Motivated by this setting, we study a continuous data assimilation (CDA) algorithm applied to a Smagorinsky/Ladyzhenskaya-type LES model, in which the observational data is generated from the full Navier--Stokes equations (NSE). In the two-dimensional setting, we establish global well-posedness of the assimilated system and prove exponential convergence to the true solution, up to an error of order $\bar{\nu}^{1/2}$, where $\bar{\nu}$ is the turbulence viscosity parameter. In addition to rigorous analysis in 2D, we provide numerical simulations in both 2D domains with physical boundary conditions and 3D periodic domains, demonstrating effective synchronization in these cases, and corroborating our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Global weak solutions to a doubly degenerate nutrient taxis system on the whole real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the one-dimensional Cauchy problem for the doubly degenerate nutrient taxis model \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  \displaystyle \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(u v u_x) - \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(u^2 v v_x) + u v, &amp; x\in \mathbb{R}, ~t&gt;0, \\
  \displaystyle \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} - u v, &amp; x\in \mathbb{R}, ~t&gt;0, \\
  u(x,0) = u_0(x) \geq 0, \quad v(x,0) = v_0(x)&gt;0, ~ &amp; x\in \mathbb{R},
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} which models pattern formation in bacterial populations. The global existence of weak solutions is established for initial data satisfying appropriate regularity and integrability conditions. To account for the degeneracy caused by $u_0$ not being strictly positive and the difficulties arising from the unboundedness of the domain, we consider a family of regularized problems posed on bounded intervals $(-\frac{1}{\varepsilon}, \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$, for $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$. Through adequate estimates uniform in $\varepsilon$, we construct global solutions to the system by passing to the limit using the Aubin-Lions lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show the short-time existence of solutions of the evolution equations that represent the solid state dewetting of thin films through evaporation-condensation as a two dimensional sharp interface variational model. The evolution law is established as the $L^2$ gradient flow of surface energies in the presence of epitaxial strain. The main novelty is the presence of moving contact lines when the film formation is governed by the evaporation-condensation method.</description>

      <title>Stability and bifurcation of Navier-Stokes equations in an annular domain with mixed boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and stability of non-trivial steady-state solutions to the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in an annular domain $\Omega = B(0,b) \setminus \overline{B(0,a)}$ with radii $b&gt;a&gt;0$.The outer boundary $\partial B(0, b)$ is subject to the free condition, while the inner boundary $\partial B(0, a)$ obeys a Navier-slip condition with effective slip length $\alpha &gt; 0$. Our main results are fourfold. First, we establish global-in-time strong solutions and derive a sharp energy estimate that underpins the subsequent nonlinear instability analysis. Second, for $\alpha &gt; 0$, we compute an explicit critical viscosity $\mu_c:=\mu_c(\alpha, a,b,\mu)$ that separates qualitatively different dynamical behaviours. Third, we precisely characterize the stability properties of the trivial solution in three distinct regimes. The zero solution is globally asymptotically stable in $H^2$ if $\mu &gt; \mu_c$. If $\mu = \mu_c$, we prove an alternative theorem that completely describes the local dynamics near the trivial state. If $\mu &lt; \mu_c$, the trivial solution is nonlinearly unstable in every $L^p (p \geq 1)$.Finally, we demonstrate that for $\mu &lt; \mu_c$, the system undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation that generates an infinite family of non-trivial steady states. For generic choices of $(\alpha,b)$, this bifurcation is supercritical; a measurable subset of parameter space yields subcritical transitions. Notably, all bifurcating solutions share the same topological pattern-a single row of counter-rotating vortices-despite their mathematical non-uniqueness.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we deal with positive solutions for singular quasilinear problems whose model is $$ \begin{cases} -\Delta u + \frac{|\nabla u|^2}{(1-u)^\gamma}=g &amp; \mbox{in $\Omega$,}\newline \hfill u=0 \hfill &amp; \mbox{on $\partial\Omega$,} \end{cases} $$ where $\Omega $ is a bounded open set of $\mathbb{R}^N$, $g\geq 0 $ is a function in some Lebesgue space, and $\gamma&gt;0$. We prove both existence and nonexistence of solutions depending on the value of $\gamma$ and on the size of $g$.</description>

      <title>Global-in-time convergence in infinity-ion-mass limit for bipolar Euler-Poisson equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the Cauchy problem for the multi-dimensional (M-D) bipolar Euler-Poisson equations with far field vacuum is considered. Based on physical observations and some elaborate analysis of this system's intrinsic symmetric hyperbolic-elliptic coupled structures, for a class of smooth initial data that are of small scaled density but possibly large mean velocity, we give one rigorous global-in-time convergence proof for regular solutions from M-D bipolar Euler-Poisson equations to M-D unipolar Euler-Poisson equations through the infinity-ion mass limit. Here the initial scaled density is required to decay to zero in the far field, and the spectrum of the Jacobi matrix of the initial mean velocity are all positive. In order to deal with such kind of singular limits, the global-in-time uniform tame estimates of regular solutions to M-D bipolar Euler-Poisson equations with respect to the ratio of electron mass over ion mass are established, based on which the corresponding error estimates in smooth function spaces between the two systems considered are also given. To achieve these, our main strategy is to regard the original problem for M-D bipolar Euler-Poisson equations as the limit of a series of carefully designed approximate problems which have truncated convection operators and compactly supported initial data. For such artificial problems, we can derive careful a-priori estimates that are independent of the mass ratio, the size of the initial data' supports and the truncation parameters. Then the global uniform existence of regular solutions of the original problem are attained via careful compactness.</description>

      <title>Nondegeneracy of positive solutions for critical Hartree equation on Heisenberg group and it's applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the uniqueness and nondegeneracy of positive bubble solutions for the generalized energy-critical Hartree equation on the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, \begin{equation}\label{0.1}
  -\Delta_{\mathbb{H}}u=\left(\int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}}\frac{|u(\eta)|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}}}{|\eta^{-1}\xi|^{\mu}}\mathrm{d}\eta\right)|u|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}-2}u,~~~\xi,\eta\in\mathbb{H}^{n}, \end{equation} where $\Delta_{\mathbb{H}}$ represents the Kohn Laplacian, $u(\eta)$ is a real-valued function, $Q=2n+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $\mu\in (0,Q)$ is a real parameter and $Q^{\ast}_{\mu}$ is the upper critical exponent following the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on the Heisenberg group. By applying the Cayley transform, the spherical harmonic decomposition and the Funk-Hecke formula of the spherical harmonic function, we prove the nondegeneracy of positive bubble solutions for (\ref{0.1}). As an applications, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the solutions for the Brezis-Nirenberg type problem as $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$ \begin{equation}\label{0.2}
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  &amp;-\Delta_{\mathbb{H}}u=\varepsilon u+\left(\int_{\Omega}\frac{|u(\eta)|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}}}{|\eta^{-1}\xi|^{\mu}}\mathrm{d}\eta \right)|u|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}-2}u,~~&amp;&amp;\mathrm{in}~\Omega\subset \mathbb{H}^{n},
  &amp;u=0,~~&amp;&amp;\mathrm{on}~\partial\Omega.

      <title>Blow-up construction and instability for mass-critical half-wave equation with slightly superthreshold mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the blow-up dynamics for the $L^2$-critical focusing half-wave equation on the real line, a nonlocal dispersive PDE arising in various physical models. As in other mass-critical models, the ground state solution becomes a threshold between the global well-posedness and the existence of a blow-up. The first blow-up construction is due to Krieger, Lenzmann and Rapha\"el, in which they constructed the minimal mass blow-up solution at the threshold mass. In this paper, we construct finite-time blow-up solutions with mass slightly exceeding the threshold. This is inspired by similar results in the mass-critical NLS by Bourgain and Wang, and their instability by Merle, Rapha\"el and Szeftel. We exhibit a blow-up profile driven by the rescaled ground state, with a decoupled dispersive radiation component. We rigorously describe the asymptotic behavior of such solutions near the blow-up time, including sharp modulation dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the instability of these solutions by constructing non-blow-up solutions that are arbitrarily close to the blow-up solutions. The main contribution of this work is to overcome the nonlocal setting of half-wave and to extend insights from the mass-critical NLS to a setting lacking pseudo-conformal symmetry.</description>

      <title>A new critical exponent for semi-linear damped wave equations with the initial data from Sobolev spaces of negative order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we would like to study critical exponent for semi-linear damped wave equations with power nonlinearity and initial data belonging to Sobolev spaces of negative order $\dot{H}_m^{-\gamma}$. Precisely, we obtain a new critical exponent $p_c(m,\gamma) := 1 + \frac{2m}{n+m\gamma}$ for $m \in (1, 2], \,\gamma \in \left[0, \frac{n(m-1)}{m} \right)$ by proving global (in time) existence of small data Sobolev solutions when $p \geq p_c(m,\gamma)$ and blow-up of weak solutions in finite time even for small data if $1 &lt; p &lt; p_c(m,\gamma)$. Additionally, the new point of this paper is the critical value $p= p_c(m,\gamma)$ belongs to the global existence range. Furthermore, we are going to provide lifespan estimates for solutions when the blow-up phenomenon occurs.</description>

      <title>Nadirashvili' Conjecture for Elliptic PDEs and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the conjecture posed by Nadirashvili in \cite{nadirashvilli1997geometry}. It states that if a harmonic function has bounded nodal volume in the unit ball, then the supermum over the half-ball can be bounded by a finite sum of derivatives at the center. The main tool in this paper is the lower bound of nodal sets, which is first proved in \cite{MR3739232}. Also we combine the propagation of smallness property and elliptic estimates to give a positive answer to this conjecture. In fact, we can extend this conjecture to general elliptic PDEs with smooth coefficients and also obtain a weak verison for less regular coefficients. Finally, we give several applications of this conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Becker-D{\"o}ring model with injection and irreversible fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyse a variant of the Becker-D{\"o}ring equations that models the growth of clusters through the gain or loss of monomers. Motivated by enzymatic reactions in biology, this model incorporates irreversible fragmentation and monomers injection. We establish the well-posedness of the equations under suitable conditions on the kinetic rates. Then, as in the Becker-D{\"o}ring equations, we distinguish two cases for the long time behaviour of our solution, however the distinction is made from the constant rate injection of monomers. While under strong fragmentation rate the system may exhibit infinite steady-states, we prove for low injection rate and moderate fragmentation the solution converges locally exponentially fast to the equilibrium. Finally, we present a well-balanced and coarse-grained numerical scheme.</description>

      <title>A Hamilton-Jacobi approach for the evolutionary dynamics of a model with gene transfer: characterizing monomorphic dynamics for non-concave fitness functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of an integro-dierential equation describing the evolutionary adaptation of a population structured by a phenotypic trait. The model takes into account mutation, selection, horizontal gene transfer and competition. Previous works, based on the numerical studies or theoretical study of the corresponding stationary problem, have shown that the dynamics of the solutions are rich and we may expect several qualitative outcomes. In this article, we characterize the dynamics of the solution in two regimes: 1) a situation where the solution concentrates around a dominant trait, evolving gradually to a trait determined by a balance between selection and horizontal gene transfer; 2) a situation where the solution concentrates around a dominant trait which evolves gradually to a maladapted trait such that the population becomes extinct (a situation known as the evolutionary suicide). Our analysis is based on an approach involving Hamilton-Jacobi equations with constraint. Previously, the solutions to such equations were characterized for globally concave growth rates. Here, we extend this approach to situations where the growth rate is not globally concave.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and monotonicity of singular solutions for the Hartree equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with positive singular solutions of the following nonlocal Hartree equation $$-\Delta u\!=\Big( \int_{\mathbb{R}^N\setminus \Gamma}\frac{F(u(y))}{|x-y|^\mu}dy \Big)f (u(x)), \quad x\in \mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Gamma,$$ where $F$ is the primitive of $f$ and $\Gamma$ is the singular set. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that $u$ is symmetric and monotone with respect to the singular set by using moving plane methods. Furthermore, we complement this study by showing the existence, for a model problem, of a singular solution with the desired properties.</description>

      <title>Formation of singularities for the relativistic membrane equation with radial symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relativistic membrane equation can be rewritten as a first order hyperbolic system. Making use of the characteristic decomposition method, a new blow-up theorem is established. As an application, it demonstrates the formation of singularities for the relativistic membrane equation. Indeed, the singularity occurs when the hypersurface turns from being timelike to being null. This generalizes the result of Kong, Sun and Zhou's work for one-dimensional case [J Math Phys 47(1): 013503, 2006].</description>

      <title>Propagation of weak log-concavity along generalised heat flows via Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known consequence of the Pr{\'e}kopa-Leindler inequality is the preservation of logconcavity by the heat semigroup. Unfortunately, this property does not hold for more general semigroups. In this paper, we exhibit a slightly weaker notion of log-concavity that can be propagated along generalised heat semigroups. As a consequence, we obtain logsemiconcavity properties for the ground state of Schr{\"o}dinger operators for non-convex potentials, as well as propagation of functional inequalities along generalised heat flows. We then investigate the preservation of weak log-concavity by conditioning and marginalisation, following the seminal works of Brascamp and Lieb. To our knowledge, our results are the first of this type in non log-concave settings. We eventually study generation of log-concavity by parabolic regularisation and prove novel two-sided log-Hessian estimates for the fundamental solution of parabolic equations with unbounded coefficients, which can be made uniform in time. These properties are obtained as a consequence of new propagation of weak convexity results for quadratic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. The proofs rely on a stochastic control interpretation combined with a second order analysis of reflection coupling along HJB characteristics.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness for a fourth-order nonisothermal tumor growth model of Caginalp type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a nonisothermal phase-field system of Caginalp type that describes tumor growth under hyperthermia. The model couples a possibly viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation, governing the evolution of the healthy and tumor phases, with an equation for the heat balance, and a reaction-diffusion equation for the nutrient concentration. The resulting nonlinear system incorporates chemotaxis and active transport effects, and is supplemented with no-flux boundary conditions. The analysis is carried out through a two-step approximation procedure, involving a regularization of the potential and a Faedo-Galerkin discretization scheme. Under stronger regularity assumptions, we further establish the existence of strong solutions and their uniqueness via a continuous dependence result.</description>

Abstract: We establish the boundary pointwise Lipschitz regularity on exterior $C^{1,\mathrm{Dini}}$ domains and the Hopf lemma on interior $C^{1,\mathrm{Dini}}$ domains for fully nonlinear parabolic equations by a unified perturbation method. In fact, above two regularity hold for more general solution sets, i.e., the Pucci's class $S^*(\lambda, \Lambda, f)$. Furthermore, based on the boundary pointwise Lipschitz regularity, we obtain the global ${W}^{2,\delta}$ regularity on exterior $C^{1,\mathrm{Dini}}$ domains for any $0&lt;\delta&lt;1$, which is new even for the harmonic functions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic stability of composite waves of shock profile and rarefaction for the Navier-Stokes-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of composite waves consisting of a shock profile and a rarefaction wave for the one-dimensional isothermal Navier--Stokes--Poisson (NSP) system, which describes the ion dynamics in a collision-dominated plasma. More precisely, we prove that if the initial data are sufficiently close in the $H^2$ norm to the Riemann data for which the associated quasi-neutral Euler system admits a Riemann solution consisting of a shock and a rarefaction wave, then the solution to the Cauchy problem for the NSP system converges, up to a dynamical shift, to a superposition of the corresponding shock profile and the rarefaction wave as time tends to infinity. The proof is based on the method of $a$-contraction with shifts, which has recently been applied to establish the asymptotic stability of composite waves for the Navier--Stokes equations. To adapt this method to our problem, we employ a modulated relative functional introduced in our previous work on the stability of single shock profiles for the NSP system.</description>

This framework covers several well-studied cases, including the scale-invariant wave equation. In this setting, we refine existing blow-up results for radial initial data with suitable decay, and identify conditions on the zero-order terms that govern the interplay between derivative perturbations, initial data size, and nonlinearity exponent.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions and incompressible limit of a quasi-incompressible Navier--Stokes/Cahn--Hilliard model for viscous two-phase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quasi-incompressible Navier--Stokes/Cahn--Hilliard coupled system which describes the motion of two macroscopically immiscible incompressible viscous fluids with partial mixing in a small interfacial region and long-range interactions. The case of unmatched densities with mass-averaged velocity is considered so that the velocity field is no longer divergence-free, and the pressure enters the equation of the chemical potential. We first prove the existence of global weak solutions to the model in a three-dimensional periodic domain, for which the implicit time discretization together with a fixed-point argument to the approximate system is employed. In particular, we obtain a new regularity estimate of the order parameter by exploiting the partial damping effect of the capillary force. Then utilizing the relative entropy method, we establish the incompressible limit -- the quasi-incompressible two-phase model converges to model H as the density difference tends to zero. Crucial to the passage of the incompressible limit, due to the lack of regularity of the pressure, are some non-standard uniform-in-density difference controls of the pressure, which are derived from the structure of the momentum equations and the improved regularity of the order parameter.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed opinion dynamics with leader-follower interactions: consensus, stability, and mean-field limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a time-delayed variant of the Hegselmann-Krause opinion formation model featuring a small group of leaders and a large group of non-leaders. In this model, leaders influence all agents but only interact among themselves. At the same time, non-leaders update their opinions via interactions with their peers and the leaders, with time delays accounting for communication and decision-making lags. We prove the exponential convergence to consensus of the particle system, without imposing smallness assumptions on the delay parameters. Furthermore, we analyze the mean-field limit in two regimes: (i) with a fixed number of leaders and an infinite number of non-leaders, and (ii) with both populations tending to infinity, obtaining existence, uniqueness, and exponential decay estimates for the corresponding macroscopic models.</description>

      <title>On the attainability of singular Wiener bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the lower and upper attainability of the Wiener bound (also known as Voigt-Reuss bound) for singularly distributed conductive material mixtures. For the lower attainability we consider mixtures in which high-conductance materials support on sets having finite one-dimensional Hausdorff measures. We show that, under a mild coercivity condition, the kernel of the effective tensor of the mixture is equal to the orthogonal complement of the homotopy classes of closed paths in the supporting set. This shows that a periodic planar network has positive definite effective tensor, i.e., it is resilient to fluctuations, if and only if the network is reticulate. We provide a geometric characterization of the upper attainability by applying a transformation from varifolds to matrix-valued measures. We show that this transformation leads to an equivalence between two distinct notions from material science and geometric measure theory respectively: conductance maximality and area criticality. Based on this relation we show a pointwise dimension bound for mixtures that attain the upper Wiener bound by applying a fractional version of the monotonicity formula for stationary varifolds. This dimension bound illustrates how the maximality condition constrains the local anisotropy and the local distribution of conductance magnitudes. Both the lower and upper attainability results have potential novel applications in modeling leaf venation patterns.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of one-dimensional metric currents: SBV-representations, connectedness and the flat chain conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of one-dimensional metric currents and their relationship to the geometry of metric spaces is presented. We resolve the one-dimensional flat chain conjecture in this general setting, by proving that its validity is equivalent to a simple geometric connectedness property. More precisely, we prove that metric currents can be approximated in the mass norm by normal currents if and only if every $1$-rectifiable set can be covered by countably many Lipschitz curves up to an $\mathscr{H}^1$-negligible set. Building on this, we demonstrate that any $1$-current in a Banach space can be completed into a cycle by a rectifiable current, with the added mass controlled by the Kantorovich--Rubinstein norm of its boundary. We further refine our approximation result by showing that these currents can be approximated by polyhedral currents modulo a cycle. Finally, in arbitrary complete metric spaces, we establish a Smirnov-type decomposition for one-dimensional currents. This decomposition expresses such currents as a superposition, without mass cancellation, of currents associated with curves of bounded variation that have a vanishing Cantor part.</description>

      <title>Conditional non-linear stability of Kerr-de Sitter spacetimes in the full subextremal range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the stability of Kerr-de Sitter black holes, in the full subextremal range, as solutions of the vacuum Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant under the assumption that mode stability holds for these spacetimes. The method is similar to the (unconditional) proof in the slowly rotating case by Hintz and Vasy. The key novelties are the implementation of constraint damping in the full subextremal range as well as the verification of a subprincipal symbol condition at the trapped set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the linear stability of a gauge-modified version of the Bach flow on any complete manifold (M, h) of constant curvature. This involves some intricate calculations to obtain spectral bounds, and in particular introduces a higher order generalization of the well-known Koiso identity. We also prove nonlinear stability for the Bach flow if (M, h) is hyperbolic space, and more generally any Poincar\'e-Einstein space sufficiently close to h. In the forthcoming Part II of this project, we study the nonlinear stability question if M is either compact or else noncompact and flat, since those cases require different considerations involving a center manifold.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Solow-Swan model with nonlocal fractional derivative operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solow-Swan equation is a foundational model in the evolution of modern economic growth theory. It offers key insights into the long-term behaviour of capital accumulation and output. Since its inception, the model has served as a cornerstone for understanding macroeconomic dynamics and has inspired a vast body of subsequent research. However, traditional formulations of the Solow-Swan model rely on integer-order derivatives, which may not fully capture the memory and hereditary properties often observed in real-world economic systems. In this paper, we extend the classical Solow-Swan framework by incorporating memory effects through the use of fractional calculus. The fractional model accounts for the influence of past states on the present rate of capital change, a feature not accommodated in the standard model. We present a comparative analysis of the capital dynamics under both the classical and fractional-order formulations of the Solow-Swan equation.</description>

      <title>Robust, fast, and adaptive splitting schemes for nonlinear doubly-degenerate diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider linear iterative schemes for the time-discrete equations stemming from a class of nonlinear, doubly-degenerate parabolic equations. More precisely, the diffusion is nonlinear and may vanish or become multivalued for certain values of the unknown, so the parabolic equation becomes hyperbolic or elliptic, respectively. After performing an Euler implicit time-stepping, a splitting strategy is applied to the time-discrete equations. This leads to a formulation that is more suitable for dealing with the degeneracies. Based on this splitting, different iterative linearization strategies are considered, namely the Newton scheme, the L-scheme, and the modified L-scheme. We prove the convergence of the latter two schemes even for the double-degenerate case. In the non-degenerate case, we prove that the scheme is contractive, and the contraction rate is proportional to a non-negative exponent of the time-step size. Moreover, an a posteriori estimator-based adaptive algorithm is developed to select the optimal parameters for the M-scheme, which accelerates its convergence. Numerical results are presented, showing that the M- and the M-adaptive schemes are more stable than the Newton scheme, as they converge irrespective of the mesh. Moreover, the adaptive M-scheme consistently out-competes not only the M/L-schemes, but also the Newton scheme showing quadratic convergence behavior.</description>

Abstract: We study the approximation complexity of high-dimensional second-order elliptic PDEs with homogeneous boundary conditions on the unit hypercube, within the framework of Barron spaces. Under the assumption that the coefficients belong to suitably defined Barron spaces, we prove that the solution can be efficiently approximated by two-layer neural networks, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Our results demonstrate the expressive power of shallow networks in capturing high-dimensional PDE solutions under appropriate structural assumptions.</description>

      <title>Interior instability of naked singularities of a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the $k$-self-similar naked singularity solutions of the spherically symmetric Einstein--Scalar field system are unstable to black hole formation under perturbations that are totally supported in the interior region, in all regularities strictly below the threshold. The instability below the threshold is also established for exterior perturbations. We also show that general naked singularity solutions are unstable under interior BV perturbations, which provides a new insight into understanding the weak cosmic censorship conjecture for this model. In contrast to all previous results on the exterior instability of naked singularities (and even trapped surface formation), where only a single incoming null cone is considered, the novel approach to proving the interior instability is analyzing a family of incoming null cones becoming more and more singular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a control/shape optimization problem of a nonlinear acoustics-structure interaction model of PDEs, whereby acoustic wave propagation in a chamber is governed by the Westervelt equation, and the motion of the elastic part of the boundary is governed by a 4th order Kirchoff equation. We consider a quadratic objective functional capturing the tracking of prescribed desired states, with three types of controls: 1) An excitation control represented by prescribed Neumann data for the pressure on the excitation part of the boundary 2) A mechanical control represented by a forcing function in the Kirchoff equations and 3) Shape of the excitation part of the boundary represented by a graph function. Our main result is the existence of solutions to the minimization problem, and the characterization of the optimal states through an adjoint system of PDEs derived from the first-order optimality conditions.</description>

Abstract: We consider the infinite volume $\Phi^4_3$ dynamic and show that it is globally well-posed in a suitable weighted Besov space of distributions. At high temperatures / small coupling, we furthermore show that the difference between any two solutions driven by the same realisation of the noise converges to zero exponentially fast. This allows us to characterise the infinite-volume $\Phi^4_3$ measure at high temperature as the unique invariant measure of the dynamic, and to prove that it satisfies all Osterwalder--Schrader axioms, including invariance under translations, rotations, and reflections, as well as exponential decay of correlations.</description>

      <title>Structure of Metric $1$-currents: approximation by normal currents and representation results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the $1$-dimensional flat chain conjecture in any complete and quasiconvex metric space, namely that metric $1$-currents can be approximated in mass by normal $1$-currents. The proof relies on a new Banach space isomorphism theorem, relating metric $1$-currents and their boundaries to the Arens-Eells space. As a by-product, any metric $1$-current in a complete and separable metric space can be represented as the integral superposition of oriented $1$-rectifiable sets, thus dropping a finite dimensionality condition from previous results of Schioppa [Schioppa Adv. Math. 2016, Schioppa J. Funct. Anal. 2016]. The connection between the flat chain conjecture and the representation result is provided by a structure theorem for metric $1$-currents in Banach spaces, showing that any such current can be realised as the restriction to a Borel set of a boundaryless normal $1$-current. This generalizes, to any Banach space, the $1$-dimensional case of a recent result of Alberti-Marchese in Euclidean spaces [Alberti-Marchese 2023]. The argument of Alberti-Marchese requires the strict polyhedral approximation theorem of Federer for normal $1$-currents, which we obtain in Banach spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.09376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic convective Brinkman-Forchheimer (SCBF) equations in an open connected set $\mathcal{O}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\in \{2,3,4\}$) or torus are considered in this work. We show the existence of a pathwise unique strong solution (in the probabilistic sense) satisfying the energy equality (It\^o formula) to SCBF equations perturbed by multiplicative Gaussian noise. We exploited a monotonicity property of the linear and nonlinear operators as well as a stochastic generalization of the Minty-Browder technique in the proofs. The energy equality is obtained by approximating the solution using approximate functions constituting the elements of eigenspaces of a compact operator in such a way that the approximations are bounded and converge in both Sobolev and Lebesgue spaces simultaneously. We further discuss the global in time regularity results of such strong solutions on the torus. The exponential stability results (in mean square and pathwise sense) for the stationary solutions is also established in this work for large effective viscosity. Moreover, a stabilization result of the stochastic convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations by using a multiplicative noise is obtained. Finally, when $\mathcal{O}$ is a bounded domain, we establish the existence of a unique invariant measure for the SCBF equations with multiplicative Gaussian noise, which is both ergodic and strongly mixing, using the exponential stability of strong solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.09860v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence rate in the vanishing viscosity process of the solutions to the subquadratic state-constraint Hamilton-Jacobi equations. We give two different proofs of the fact that, for nonnegative Lipschitz data that vanish on the boundary, the rate of convergence is $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ in the interior. Moreover, the one-sided rate can be improved to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ for nonnegative compactly supported data and $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{1/(p-\frac{1}{2})})$ (where $1&lt;p\leq 2$ is the exponent of the gradient term) for nonnegative data $f\in \mathrm{C}^2(\overline{\Omega})$ such that $f = 0$ and $Df = 0$ on the boundary. Our approach relies on deep understanding of the blow-up behavior near the boundary and semiconcavity of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Blowups for a class of second order nonlinear hyperbolic equations: A reduced model of nonlinear Jeans instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the formation of nonlinear structures in the universe and stellar systems is crucial. The nonlinear Jeans instability plays a key role in these formation processes. It has been a long-standing open problem in astrophysics for more than a century. In this article, we focus on a reduced model of the nonlinear Jeans instability in an expanding Newtonian universe, which is described by a class of second-order nonlinear hyperbolic equations.
  \begin{equation*}
  \Box \varrho(x^\mu) +\frac{\mathcal{a} }{t} \partial_{t}\varrho(x^\mu) -
  \frac{\mathcal{b}}{t^2} \varrho(x^\mu) (1+ \varrho(x^\mu) ) -\frac{\mathcal{c}-\mathcal{k} }{1+\varrho(x^\mu)} (\partial_{t}\varrho(x^\mu))^2= \mathcal{k} F(t).
  \end{equation*} We establish a family of nonlinear self-increasing blowup solutions (where the solution itself becomes infinite in a stable ODE-type blowup) for this equation. Furthermore, we provide estimates on the growth rate of $\varrho$, which may help explain why the nonlinear structures in the universe grow much faster in astrophysical observations than predicted by the classical Jeans instability.</description>

      <title>On Lattice Points, Short-Time Estimates, and Global Well-posedness of the Quintic NLS on $\mathbb{T}$</title>

Abstract: We prove and utilize an improvement to the short time estimates of Burq, G\'erard, &amp; Tzvetkov on $\mathbb{T}$ via connecting this estimate to the number of lattice points in thin annuli. As a consequence, we enhance the well-posedness level of the periodic quintic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation to $s &gt; \frac{131}{624}\sim 0.21$, which is an improvement on the results of De Silva, Pavlovi\'c, Staffilani, &amp; Tzirakis, Li, Wu, &amp; Xu, and Schippa. We also present conditional results, dependent on improvements on the count of lattice points in thin annuli.</description>

      <title>On local well-posedness of 3D ideal Hall-MHD system with an azimuthal magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the local well-posedness of classical solutions to the ideal Hall-MHD equations whose magnetic field is supposed to be azimuthal in the $L^2$-based Sobolev spaces. By introducing a good unknown coupling with the original unknowns, we overcome difficulties arising from the lack of magnetic resistance, and establish a self-closed $H^m$ with $(3\leq m\in\mathbb{N})$ local energy estimate of the system. Here, a key cancellation related to $\theta$ derivatives is discovered. In order to apply this cancellation, part of the high-order energy estimates is performed in the cylindrical coordinate system, even though our solution is not assumed to be axially symmetric.
  During the proof, high-order derivative tensors of unknowns in the cylindrical coordinates system are carefully calculated, which would be useful in further researches on related topics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the motion of closed smooth curves that evolve in space $\mathbb{R}^3$. The governing evolutionary equation for the evolution of the curve is accompanied by a parabolic equation for the scalar quantity evaluated over the evolving curve. We apply the direct Lagrangian approach to describe the flow of 3D curves, resulting in a system of degenerate parabolic equations. We prove the local existence and uniqueness of classical H\"older smooth solutions to the governing system of nonlinear parabolic equations. A numerical discretization scheme is constructed using the method of flowing finite volumes. We present several numerical examples of the evolution of curves in 3D with a scalar quantity. We consider the flow of curves with zero torsion evolving in rotating and parallel planes. Next, we present examples of the evolution of curves with initially knotted and unknotted curves.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fluids via matrix hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2-D) incompressible, inviscid fluids produce fascinating patterns of swirling motion. How and why the patterns emerge are long-standing questions, first addressed in the 19th century by Helmholtz, Kirchhoff, and Kelvin. Countless researchers have since contributed to innovative techniques and results. Yet, the overarching problem of swirling 2-D motion and its long-time behavior remains largely open. Here we shed light on this problem via a link to isospectral matrix flows. The link is established through V. Zeitlin's beautiful model for the numerical discretization of Euler's equations in 2-D. When considered on the sphere, Zeitlin's model offers deep connections between 2-D hydrodynamics and unitary representations of the rotation group. Consequently, it provides a dictionary that maps hydrodynamical concepts to matrix Lie theory, which in turn gives connections to matrix factorizations, random matrices, and integrability theory, for example. Results about finite-dimensional matrices can then be transferred to infinite-dimensional fluids via quantization theory, which is here used as an analysis tool (albeit traditionally describing the limit between quantum and classical physics). We demonstrate how the dictionary is constructed and how it unveils techniques for 2-D hydrodynamics. We also give accompanying convergence results for Zeitlin's model on the sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motivation of this study is to find the Riemann solutions of the Aw-Rascle model with a more realistic version of extended Chaplygin gas. Firstly, we establish the Riemann solutions with two different structures, viz., a shock wave followed by the contact discontinuity and a rarefaction wave followed by the contact discontinuity. Further, by analyzing the limiting behavior, it is found that one of the Riemann solutions converges to a $ \delta $-shock solution as the pressure approaches the generalized Chaplygin gas pressure. Moreover, numerical simulations have been performed to validate the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantitative pointwise estimates of the cooling process for inelastic Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15077v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the homogeneous inelastic Boltzmann equation for hard spheres. We first prove that the solution $f(t,v)$ is bounded pointwise from above by $C_{f_0}\langle t \rangle^3$ and establish that the cooling time is infinite $T_c = +\infty$ under the condition $f_0 \in L^1_2 \cap L^{\infty}_{s}$ for $s &gt; 2$. Away from zero velocity, we further prove that $f(t,v)\leq C_{f_0, |v|} \langle t \rangle$ for $v \neq 0$ at any time $t &gt; 0$. This time-dependent pointwise upper bound is natural in the cooling process, as we expect the density near $v = 0$ to grow rapidly. We also establish an upper bound that depends on the coefficient of normal restitution constant, $\alpha \in (0,1]$. This upper bound becomes constant when $\alpha = 1$, restoring the known upper bound for elastic collisions [8]. Consequently, through these results, we obtain Maxwellian upper bounds on the solutions at each time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17237v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze a nonlinear elasticity model introduced by the authors for comparing two images, regarded as bounded open subsets of $\R^n$ together with associated vector-valued intensity maps. Optimal transformations between the images are sought as minimisers of an integral functional among orientation-preserving homeomorphisms. The existence of minimisers is proved under natural coercivity and polyconvexity conditions, assuming only that the intensity functions are bounded measurable. Variants of the existence theorem are also proved, first under the constraint that finite sets of landmark points in the two images are mapped one to the other, and second when one image is to be compared to an unknown part of another.
  The question is studied as to whether for images related by an affine mapping the unique minimiser is given by that affine mapping. For a natural class of functional integrands an example is given guaranteeing that this property holds for pairs of images in which the second is a scaling of the first by a constant factor. However for the property to hold for arbitrary pairs of affinely related images it is shown that the integrand has to depend on the gradient of the transformation as a convex function of its determinant alone. This suggests a new model in which the integrand depends also on second derivatives of the transformation, and an example is given for which both existence of minimisers is assured and the above property holds for all pairs of affinely related images.</description>

Abstract: For the nonlocal quasilinear fractional $p$-Laplace operator $(-\Delta)^s_p$ with $s\in (0,1)$ and $p\in(1,\infty)$, we investigate the nonexistence and existence of nontrivial nonnegative solutions $u$ in the local fractional Sobolev space $W_{\rm loc}^{s,p}(\mathbb R^n)$ that satisfies the inequality $(-\Delta)^s_p u\ge u^q$ weakly in $\mathbb R^n$, where $q\in(0,\infty)$. The approach taken in this paper is mainly based on some delicate analysis of the fundamental solutions to the fractional $p$-Laplace operator $(-\Delta)^s_p$.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Optimal Transport (OTIKIN) -- Part 1: Second-Order Discrepancies Between Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first part of a general description in terms of mass transport for time-evolving interacting particles systems, at a mesoscopic level. Beyond kinetic theory, our framework naturally applies in biology, computer vision, and engineering.
  The central object of our study is a new discrepancy $\mathsf d$ between two probability distributions in position and velocity states, which is reminiscent of the $2$-Wasserstein distance, but of second-order nature. We construct $\mathsf d$ in two steps. First, we optimise over transport plans. The cost function is given by the minimal acceleration between two coupled states on a fixed time horizon $T$. Second, we further optimise over the time horizon $T&gt;0$.
  We prove the existence of optimal transport plans and maps, and study two time-continuous characterisations of $\mathsf d$. One is given in terms of dynamical transport plans. The other one -- in the spirit of the Benamou--Brenier formula -- is formulated as the minimisation of an action of the acceleration field, constrained by Vlasov's equations. Equivalence of static and dynamical formulations of $\mathsf d$ holds true. While part of this result can be derived from recent, parallel developments in optimal control between measures, we give an original proof relying on two new ingredients: Galilean regularisation of Vlasov's equations and a kinetic Monge--Mather shortening principle.
  Finally, we establish a first-order differential calculus in the geometry induced by $\mathsf d$, and identify solutions to Vlasov's equations with curves of measures satisfying a certain $\mathsf d$-absolute continuity condition. One consequence is an explicit formula for the $\mathsf d$-derivative of such curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to describe the metastable dynamics of the solutions to the reaction-diffusion equation with nonlinear phase-dependent diffusion $u_t=\varepsilon^2(D(u)u_x)_x-f(u)$, where $D$ is a strictly positive function and $f$ is a bistable reaction term. We derive a system of ordinary differential equations describing the slow evolution of the metastable states, whose existence has been proved by Folino et al. (Z. Angew. Math. Phys., 2020). Such a system generalizes the one derived in the pioneering work of Carr and Pego (Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 1989) to describe the metastable dynamics for the classical Allen-Cahn equation, which corresponds to the particular case $D\equiv1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generator $\mathbf{L}$ of the linearized evolution equation of adiabatic oscillations of a gaseous star, ELASO, is a second order integro-differential operator and is realized as a self-adjoint operator in the Hilbert space of square integrable unknown functions with weight, which is the density distribution of the compactly supported background. Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the operator $\mathbf{L}$ have been investigated in practical point of view of eigenmode expansion of oscillations. But it should be examined whether continuous spectra are absent in the spectrum of $\mathbf{L}$ or not. In order to discuss this question, the existence of essential spectra in a closely related evolution problem is established.</description>

      <title>Global Bifurcation In Four-Component Bose-Einstein Condensates In Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a system of coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in the domain of a unitary ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The coupling is due to atom-to-atom interactions that occur between different gas components. The multi-component Bose-Einstein condensate is described by a system of Gross-Pitaevskii equations, which has an explicit trivial branch of constant solutions bifurcating from the zero-solution. Our main theorem establishes that this trivial branch undergoes multiple global bifurcations at any critical values with kernels of dimensions at least $3(2k+1)$, for $k \in \mathbb{N}^+$. Handling these high dimension kernels poses a challenge from the perspective of bifurcation theory. Our methodology, which relies on the $G$-equivariant gradient degree, effectively manages these complexities and establishes the existence of at least two global branch in the particular case of $k = 0$ and at least six branches in the case of $k = 1$.</description>

Abstract: We use the $\mathbb T^2$-equivariant degree to establish the existence of unbounded branches of rotating spiral wave solutions with any number of arms for the complex Ginzburg Landau equation GLe on the planar unit disc, leveraging the spatial symmetries inherent to the problem and avoiding limiting constraints encountered in previous studies (Dai 2021) that utilized the classical Leray-Schauder degree. Our results provide rigorous mathematical justification for the formation and persistence of these fundamental patterns, which are ubiquitous in physical, chemical, and biological systems but have, until now, eluded formal proof under general conditions.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence in superquadratic Hamilton--Jacobi equations with state constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence rate in the vanishing viscosity limit for solutions to superquadratic Hamilton--Jacobi equations with state constraints. For every $p&gt;2$, we establish the rate of convergence for nonnegative Lipschitz data vanishing on the boundary to be of order $ \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{1/2}) $ and obtain an improved upper rate of order $ \mathcal{O}\big(\varepsilon^{\frac{p}{2(p-1)}}\big)$ for semiconcave data.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Riemann Problem for a $2 \times 2$ System of Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Conservation Laws Using Shadow Waves and Dafermos Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a system of two conservation laws and provide a detailed description of both classical and non-classical self-similar Riemann solutions. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of overcompressive delta shocks as singular limits of the Dafermos regularization of the system. The system is chosen for its minimal yet representative structure, which captures the essential features of transport dynamics under density constraints. Our analysis is carried out using blow-up techniques within the framework of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT), allowing us to resolve the internal structure of these singular solutions. Despite its simplicity, the system serves as a versatile prototype for crowding-limited transport across a range of applications, including biological aggregation, ecological dispersal, granular compaction, and traffic congestion. Our findings are supported by numerical simulations using the Local Lax-Friedrichs scheme.</description>

      <title>Generic alignment conjecture for systems of Cucker-Smale type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generic alignment conjecture states that for almost every initial data on the torus solutions to the Cucker-Smale system with a strictly local communication align to the common mean velocity. In this note we present a partial resolution of this conjecture using a statistical mechanics approach. First, the conjecture holds in full for the sticky particle model representing, formally, infinitely strong local communication. In the classical case the conjecture is proved when $N$, the number of agents, is equal to $2$. It follows from a more general result stating that for a system of any size for almost every data at least two agents align.
  The analysis is extended to the open space $\R^n$ in the presence of confinement and potential interaction forces. In particular, it is shown that almost every non-oscillatory pair of solutions aligns and aggregates in the potential well.</description>

      <title>Approximating Analytic Spectra of Hyperbolic Systems with Summation-by-Parts Finite Difference Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the fidelity of numerical approximations to the analytic spectra of hyperbolic partial differential equation systems with variable coefficients. We are particularly interested in the ability of discrete methods to accurately discover sources of physical instabilities. By considering the perturbed equations that arise in linearized problems, we study systems in which a lower-order term can act as a source of internal energy within the system. We apply high-order accurate summation-by-parts finite difference operators, with weak enforcement of boundary conditions through the simultaneous-approximation-term technique, which leads to a provably stable numerical discretization with formal order of accuracy given by $p = 2, 3, 4$ and $5$. We derive analytic solutions using Laplace transform methods, which provide important ground truth to ensure numerical convergence at the correct theoretical rate. We derive the analytic spectrum and find that it is better captured with mesh refinement, although dissipative strict stability (where the growth rate of the discrete problem is bounded above by the analytic) is not obtained. We also find that sole reliance on mesh refinement can be a problematic means for determining physical growth rates as some eigenvalues emerge (and persist with mesh refinement) based on spatial order of accuracy but are non-physical. We suggest that numerical methods be used to approximate the spectra when numerical stability is guaranteed and convergence of the numerical spectra is evident with both mesh refinement and increasing order of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Exactness, Cohomology, and Uniqueness in First-Order Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between the solvability of first-order differential equations and the topology of the underlying domain through the lens of de\,Rham cohomology. We analyze the conditions under which a closed 1-form associated with a first-order ODE admits a global potential, thereby reducing the problem to the exactness of differential forms. While it is well known that exactness is guaranteed on simply connected domains, we show that triviality of the first de\,Rham cohomology group is the more fundamental requirement for global integrability and uniqueness of solutions. In particular, we demonstrate that certain non-simply connected manifolds, such as the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, still support global solutions due to the vanishing of $H^1_{\text{dR}}$. By explicitly constructing examples on $\mathbb{RP}^2$ and comparing them with domains like $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \{0\}$, we illustrate how topological obstructions manifest analytically as non-uniqueness or multi-valued behavior. We further discuss the correspondence between integrating factors and the trivialization of cohomology classes, drawing connections to classical symmetry methods and potential theory. This synthesis of geometric, topological, and analytic perspectives provides a unifying framework for understanding the global behavior of first-order ODEs beyond local existence theorems.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The developments over the last five decades concerning numerical discretisations of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations have lead to reliable tools for their approximation: those include stable methods to properly address the incompressibility constraint, stable discretisations to account for convection dominated problems, efficient time (splitting) methods, and methods to tackle their nonlinear character. While these tools may successfully be applied to reliably simulate even more complex fluid flow PDE models, their understanding requires a fundamental revision in the case of stochastic fluid models, which are gaining increased importance nowadays.
  This work motivates and surveys optimally convergent numerical methods for the stochastic Stokes and Navier--Stokes equations that were obtained in the last decades. Furtheremore, we computationally illustrate the failure of some of those methods from the deterministic setting, if they are straight-forwardly applied to the stochastic case. In fact, we explain why some of these deterministic methods perform sub-optimally by highlighting crucial analytical differences between the deterministic and stochastic equations -- and how modifications of the deterministic methods restore their optimal performance if they properly address the probabilistic nature of the stochastic problem.
  Next to the numerical analysis of schemes, we propose a general benchmark of prototypic fluid flow problems driven by different types of noise to also compare new algorithms by simulations in terms of complexities, efficiencies, and possible limitations. The driving motivation is to reach a better comparison of simulations for new schemes in terms of accuracy and complexities, and to also complement theoretical performance studies for restricted settings of data by more realistic ones.</description>
