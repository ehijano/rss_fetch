      <title>Protein Autoregressive Modeling via Multiscale Structure Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present protein autoregressive modeling (PAR), the first multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation via coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction. Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning. On the unconditional generation benchmark, PAR effectively learns protein distributions and produces backbones of high design quality, and exhibits favorable scaling behavior. Together, these properties establish PAR as a promising framework for protein structure generation.</description>

      <title>Flexible MOF Generation with Torsion-Aware Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17914v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with novel chemistries is a longstanding challenge due to their large combinatorial space and complex 3D arrangements of the building blocks. While recent deep generative models have enabled scalable MOF generation, they assume (1) a fixed set of building blocks and (2) known local 3D coordinates of building blocks. However, this limits their ability to (1) design novel MOFs and (2) generate the structure using novel building blocks. We propose a two-stage MOF generation framework that overcomes these limitations by modeling both chemical and geometric degrees of freedom. First, we train an SMILES-based autoregressive model to generate metal and organic building blocks, paired with a cheminformatics toolkit for 3D structure initialization. Second, we introduce a flow matching model that predicts translations, rotations, and torsional angles to assemble the blocks into valid 3D frameworks. Our experiments demonstrate improved reconstruction accuracy, the generation of valid, novel, and unique MOFs, and the ability to create novel building blocks. Our code is available at https://github.com/nayoung10/MOFFlow-2.</description>

      <title>Unlocking hidden biomolecular conformational landscapes in diffusion models at inference time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The function of biomolecules such as proteins depends on their ability to interconvert between a wide range of structures or "conformations." Researchers have endeavored for decades to develop computational methods to predict the distribution of conformations, which is far harder to determine experimentally than a static folded structure. We present ConforMix, an inference-time algorithm that enhances sampling of conformational distributions using a combination of classifier guidance, filtering, and free energy estimation. Our approach upgrades diffusion models -- whether trained for static structure prediction or conformational generation -- to enable more efficient discovery of conformational variability without requiring prior knowledge of major degrees of freedom. ConforMix is orthogonal to improvements in model pretraining and would benefit even a hypothetical model that perfectly reproduced the Boltzmann distribution. Remarkably, when applied to a diffusion model trained for static structure prediction, ConforMix captures structural changes including domain motion, cryptic pocket flexibility, and transporter cycling, while avoiding unphysical states. Case studies of biologically critical proteins demonstrate the scalability, accuracy, and utility of this method.</description>

      <title>ProDCARL: Reinforcement Learning-Aligned Diffusion Models for De Novo Antimicrobial Peptide Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance threatens healthcare sustainability and motivates low-cost computational discovery of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). De novo peptide generation must optimize antimicrobial activity and safety through low predicted toxicity, but likelihood-trained generators do not enforce these goals explicitly. We introduce ProDCARL, a reinforcement-learning alignment framework that couples a diffusion-based protein generator (EvoDiff OA-DM 38M) with sequence property predictors for AMP activity and peptide toxicity. We fine-tune the diffusion prior on AMP sequences to obtain a domain-aware generator. Top-k policy-gradient updates use classifier-derived rewards plus entropy regularization and early stopping to preserve diversity and reduce reward hacking. In silico experiments show ProDCARL increases the mean predicted AMP score from 0.081 after fine-tuning to 0.178. The joint high-quality hit rate reaches 6.3\% with pAMP $&gt;$0.7 and pTox $&lt;$0.3. ProDCARL maintains high diversity, with $1-$mean pairwise identity equal to 0.929. Qualitative analyses with AlphaFold3 and ProtBERT embeddings suggest candidates show plausible AMP-like structural and semantic characteristics. ProDCARL serves as a candidate generator that narrows experimental search space, and experimental validation remains future work.</description>
