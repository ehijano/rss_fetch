      <title>Constraining the Stellar Masses and Origin of the Protostellar VLA 1623 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA Band 7 molecular line observations of the protostars within the VLA 1623 system. We map C$^{17}$O (3 - 2) in the circumbinary disk around VLA 1623A and the outflow cavity walls of the collimated outflow. We further detect red-shifted and blue-shifted velocity gradients in the circumstellar disks around VLA 1623B and VLA 1623W that are consistent with Keplerian rotation. We use the radiative transfer modeling code, pdspy, and simple flared disk models to measure stellar masses of $0.27 \pm 0.03$ M$_\odot$, $1.9^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ M$_\odot$, and $0.64 \pm 0.06$ M$_\odot$ for the VLA 1623A binary, VLA 1623B, and VLA 1623W, respectively. These results represent the strongest constraints on stellar mass for both VLA 1623B and VLA 1623W, and the first measurement of mass for all stellar components using the same tracer and methodology. We use these masses to discuss the relationship between the young stellar objects (YSOs) in the VLA 1623 system. We find that VLA 1623W is unlikely to be an ejected YSO, as has been previously proposed. While we cannot rule out that VLA 1623W is a unrelated YSO, we propose that it is a true companion star to the VLA 1623A/B system and that the these stars formed in situ through turbulent fragmentation and have had only some dynamical interactions since their inception.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Spot Variability of T Tauri Stars Using Near-IR Atomic Fe and Molecular OH Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the Young Exoplanets Spectroscopic Survey (YESS), this study explores the spot variability of 13 T Tauri Stars (TTSs) in the near-infrared $H$ band, using spectra from the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS). By analyzing effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$) sensitive lines of atomic FeI at ~1.56259 um and ~1.56362 um, and molecular OH at ~1.56310 um and ~1.56317 um, we develop an empirical equivalent width ratio (EWR) relationship for $T_{\rm eff}$ in the range of 3400-5000 K. This relationship allows for precise relative $T_{\rm eff}$ estimates to within tens of Kelvin and demonstrates compatibility with solar metallicity target models. However, discrepancies between observational data and model predictions limit the extension of the $T_{\rm eff}$-EWR relationship to a broader parameter space. Our study reveals that both classical and weak-line TTSs can exhibit $T_{\rm eff}$ variations exceeding 150 K over a span of two years. The detection of a quarter-phase delay between the EWR and radial velocity phase curves in TTSs indicates spot-driven signals. A phase delay of 0.06 $\pm$ 0.13 for CI Tau, however, suggests additional dynamics, potentially caused by planetary interaction, inferred from a posited 1:1 commensurability between the rotation period and orbital period. Moreover, a positive correlation between $T_{\rm eff}$ variation amplitude and stellar inclination angle support the existence of high-latitude spots on TTSs, further enriching our understanding of stellar surface activity in young stars.</description>

      <title>Distorted Magnetic Flux Ropes within Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic flux ropes within interplanetary coronal mass ejections are often characterized as simplistic cylindrical or toroidal tubes with field lines that twist around the cylinder or torus axis. Recent multi-point observations suggest that the overall geometry of these large-scale structures may be significantly more complex, so that the contemporary modeling approaches would be, in some cases, insufficient to properly understand the global structure of any interplanetary coronal mass ejection. In an attempt to partially rectify this issue, we have developed a novel magnetic flux rope model that allows for the description of arbitrary distortions of the cross-section or deformation of the magnetic axis. The distorted magnetic flux rope model is a fully analytic flux rope model, that can be used to describe significantly more complex geometries and is numerically efficient enough to be used for large ensemble simulations. To demonstrate the usefulness of our model, we focus on a specific implementation of our model and apply it to an ICME event that was observed \textit{in situ} on 2023 April 23 at the L1 point by the Wind spacecraft and also by the STEREO-A spacecraft that was $10.2^\circ$ further east and $0.9^\circ$ south in heliographic coordinates. We demonstrate that our model can accurately reconstruct each observation individual and also gives a fair reconstruction of both events simultaneously using a multi-point reconstruction approach, which results in a geometry that is not fully constistent with a cylindrical or toroidal approximation.</description>

      <title>A Lack of Mass-Gap Compact Object Binaries in APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depending principally on mass, the compact object remnant left behind after a star's life may be a white dwarf (WD), neutron star (NS), or black hole (BH). While we have large samples of each of these remnants, we lack knowledge of the exact conditions separating these outcomes. The boundary between low-mass BHs and massive NSs is particularly poorly understood, as few objects between 2-5 $M_\odot$ are known. To probe this regime, we search the APOGEE DR17 dataset of 657,000 unique stars for binary systems with one stellar component that exhibit large radial velocity shifts over multiple observations. We identify 4751 likely binary systems, and estimate a minimum mass for each system's "invisible companion" under the assumption of tidal synchronization. Two systems have companion masses $\gtrsim$ 2 $M_\odot$, although we conclude that neither are good candidates for possessing a mass-gap NS or BH companions.</description>

      <title>Why are (almost) all the protostellar outflows aligned in Serpens Main?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep 1.4-4.8 um JWST-NIRCam imaging of the Serpens Main star-forming region and identify 20 candidate protostellar outflows, most with bipolar structure and identified driving sources. The outflow position angles (PAs) are strongly correlated, and aligned within +/- 24 degrees of the major axis of the Serpens filament. These orientations are further aligned with the angular momentum vectors of the two disk shadows in this region. We estimate that the probability of this number of young stars being co-aligned if sampled from a uniform PA distribution is 10^-4. This in turn suggests that the aligned protostars, which seem to be at similar evolutionary stages based on their outflow dynamics, formed at similar times with a similar spin inherited from a local cloud filament. Further, there is tentative evidence for a systematic change in average position angle between the north-western and south-eastern cluster, as well as increased scatter in the PAs of the south-eastern protostars. SOFIA-HAWC+ archival dust polarization observations of Serpens Main at 154 and 214 um are perpendicular to the dominant jet orientation in NW region in particular. We measure and locate shock knots and edges for all of the outflows and provide an identifying catalog. We suggest that Serpens main is a cluster that formed from an isolated filament, and due to its youth retains its primordial outflow alignment.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the 2012-July-12 CME Event With the Fluxrope-G3DMHD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and their driven shocks are a major source of large geomagnetic storms due to their large and long-lasting, southward component of magnetic field in the sheath and the flux rope (e.g., magnetic cloud). Predicting the strength and arrival time of southward fields accurately thus plays a key role in space weather predictions. To address this problem, we have developed a new model, which combines the global three-dimensional, time-dependent, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD), data-driven model (G3DMHD) and a self-contained magnetic flux-rope model [1]. As a demonstration and validation, here we simulate the evolution of a Sun-Earth-directed CME that erupted on 2012-July-12. The computational domain spans from 2.5 solar radii (Rs) from the surface of the Sun, where the flux rope is injected, to 245 Rs. We compare the time profiles of the simulated MHD parameters (Density, velocity, temperature, and magnetic field) with in situ solar wind observations acquired at ~1 AU by the Wind spacecraft and the result is encouraging. The model successfully reproduces the shock, sheath, and flux rope similar to those observed by Wind.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Solar Hemispheric Helicity Rules: Rise of 3D Magnetic Flux Concentrations through a Background Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspots and active regions observed on the solar surface are widely believed to be manifestations of compact predominantly-toroidal magnetic field structures (``flux tubes") that emerge by magnetic buoyancy from the deeper interior of the Sun. Much work has examined the evolution of such magnetic structures, typically considering them as idealized isolated magnetic entities and not as more realistic magnetic concentrations in a volume-filling background magnetic field. Here, we report results that explore the buoyant rise dynamics of magnetic concentrations in a volume-filling field in the full three dimensions. Earlier 2.5D work in this series (arXiv:1805.08806, arXiv:2101.03472, arXiv:2204.13078) established the remarkable fact that the twist orientation of a flux concentration relative to the background field affected it's likelihood to rise and emerge, regardless of whether the buoyant rise took place in the absence or presence of convection. The contrasting dynamics between structures with differing orientations leads to a selection mechanism that reproduces characteristics of the ``solar hemispheric helicity rule(s)" (SHHR) observations strikingly well. Here, we show that this two-dimensional selection mechanism persists in the face of the added complexity of three-dimensional dynamics. Arching of the magnetic structure in the third dimension, as might be expected in the solar application, is introduced. The role of tension force leading to this selection mechanism is elucidated and subtle differences that arise due to the three-dimensional geometry are discussed.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Mass Loss In Binary Stars. IV. Low and Intermediate Mass Helium Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unstable mass transfer situation in binary systems will asymptotically cause the adiabatic expansion of the donor star and finally lead to the common envelope phase. This process could happen in helium binary systems once the helium donor star fills its Roche-lobe. We have calculated the adiabatic mass loss model of naked helium stars with a mass range of 0.35\,$M_{\odot}$ to 10\,$M_{\odot}$, and every mass sequence evolved from the He-ZAMS to the cooling track of white dwarf or carbon ignition. In consideration of the influence of stellar wind, massive helium stars are not considered in this paper. Comparing stellar radius with the evolution of the Roche-lobe under the assumption of conservative mass transfer, we give the critical mass ratio $q_{\textrm{crit}}=M_{\textrm{He}}/M_{\textrm{accretor}}$ as the binary stability criteria of low and intermediate-mass helium binary stars. On He-MS, the result shows $1.0&lt;q_{\textrm{crit}}&lt;2.6$, which is more unstable than the classical result of polytropic model $q_{\textrm{crit}}=3$. After early He-HG, the $q_{\textrm{crit}}$ quickly increases even larger than 10 (more stable compared with widely used result $q_{\textrm{crit}}=4$), which is dominated by the expansion of radiative envelope. Our result could be useful for these quick mass transfer binary systems such as AM CVns, UCXBs, and helium novae, and it could guide the binary population synthesis for the formation of special objects such as SNe Ia and GW sources.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of three hot subdwarf stars: EC 11481-2303, Feige 110, and PG 0909+276: A critical oscillator-strength evaluation for iron-group elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the precise spectral analysis of hot stars, advanced stellar-atmosphere models that consider deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium are mandatory. This requires accurate atomic data to calculate all transition rates and occupation numbers for atomic levels in the considered model atoms, not only for a few prominent lines exhibited in an observation. The critical evaluation of atomic data is a challenge because it requires precise laboratory measurements. Ultraviolet spectroscopy of hot stars with high resolving power provide such "laboratory" spectra.
  We compare observed, isolated lines of the iron group (here calcium to nickel) with our synthetic line profiles to judge the accuracy of the respective oscillator strengths. This will verify them or yield individual correction values to improve the spectral analysis, i.e., the determination of, e.g., effective temperature and abundances.
  To minimize the error propagation from uncertainties in effective temperature, surface gravity (g), and abundance determination, we start with a precise reanalysis of three hot subdwarf stars, namely EC 11481-2303, Feige 110, and PG 0909+276. Then, we measure the abundances of the iron-group elements individually. Based on identified, isolated lines of these elements, we compare observation and models to measure their deviation in strength (equivalent width).
  For EC 11481-2303 and Feige 110, we confirmed the previously determined effective temperatures and log g values within their error limits. For all three stars, we fine-tuned all metal abundances to achieve the best reproduction of the observation. For more than 450 isolated absorption lines of the iron group, we compared modeled and observed line strengths.
  We selected strong, reliable isolated absorption lines, which we recommend to use as reference lines for abundance determinations in related objects.</description>

      <title>Temperature and differential emission measure evolution of a limb flare on 13 January 2015</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially unresolved observations show that the cooling phase in solar flares can be much longer than theoretical models predict. It has not yet been determined whether this is also the case for different subregions within the flare structure. We aim to investigate whether or not the cooling times, which are observed separately in coronal loops and the supra-arcade fan (SAF), are in accordance with the existing cooling models, and whether the temperature and emission measure of supra-arcade downflows (SADs) are different from their surroundings. We analysed the M5.6 limb flare on 13 January 2015 using SDO/AIA observations. We applied a differential emission measure (DEM) reconstruction code to derive spatially resolved temperature and emission measure maps, and used the output to investigate the thermal evolution of coronal loops, the SAF, and the SADs. In the event of 13 January 2015,the observed cooling times of the loop arcade and the SAF are significantly longer than predicted by the Cargill model, even with suppressed plasma heat conduction. The observed SADs show different temperature characteristics, and in all cases a lower density than their surroundings. In the limb flare event studied here, continuous heating likely occurs in both loops and SAF during the gradual flare phase and leads to an extended cooling phase.</description>

      <title>Metal oxide abundances as a function of the C/O ratio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diatomic metal monoxides whose optical spectra define the classification of AGB stars along the sequence M-MS-S-SC to carbon stars, that is, TiO, ZrO, LaO and YO, have the unusual property that their ionization energy is below their dissociation limit. The cations of these metal monoxides can be efficiently produced via associative ionization of their constituent ground state atoms and are long-lived. We present a simple model that can explain the observed relative abundance of these metal oxides as a function of the C/O ratio.</description>

      <title>12C+12C Reaction Rates and the Evolution of a Massive Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon fusion is important to understand the late stages in the evolution of a massive star. Astronomically interesting energy ranges for the 12C+12C reactions have been, however, poorly constrained by experiments. Theoretical studies on stellar evolution have relied on reaction rates that are extrapolated from those measured in higher energies. In this work, we update the carbon fusion reaction rates by fitting the astrophysical S-factor data obtained from direct measurements based on the Fowler, Caughlan, &amp; Zimmerman (1975) formula. We examine the evolution of a 20 M_sun star with the updated 12C+12C reaction rates performing simulations with the MESA (Modules for Experiments for Stellar Astrophysics) code. Between 0.5 and 1 GK, the updated reaction rates are 0.35 to 0.5 times less than the rates suggested by Caughlan and Fowler (1988). The updated rates result in the increase of core temperature by about 7% and of the neutrino cooling by about a factor of three. Moreover, the carbon-burning lifetime is reduced by a factor of 2.7. The updated carbon fusion reaction rates lead to some changes in the details of the stellar evolution model, their impact seems relatively minor compared to other uncertain physical factors like convection, overshooting, rotation, and mass-loss history. The astrophysical S-factor measurements in lower energies have large errors below the Coulomb barrier. More precise measurements in lower energies for the carbon burning would be useful to improve our study and to understand the evolution of a massive star.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields of M Dwarfs from the Pleiades Open Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Average magnetic field measurements are presented for 62 M-dwarf members of the Pleiades open cluster, derived from Zeeman-enhanced Fe I lines in the H-band. An MCMC methodology was employed to model magnetic filling factors using SDSS-IV APOGEE high-resolution spectra, along with the radiative transfer code SYNMAST, MARCS stellar atmosphere models, and the APOGEE DR17 spectral line list. There is a positive correlation between mean magnetic fields and stellar rotation, with slow-rotator stars (Rossby number, Ro$&gt;$0.13) exhibiting a steeper slope than rapid-rotators (Ro$&lt;$0.13). However, the latter sample still shows a positive trend between Ro and magnetic fields, which is given by $&lt;$B$&gt;$ = 1604 $\times$ Ro$^{-0.20}$. The derived stellar radii, when compared with physical isochrones, show that on average, our sample shows radius inflation, with median enhanced radii ranging from +3.0$\%$ to +7.0$\%$, depending on the model. There is a positive correlation between magnetic field strength and radius inflation, as well as with stellar spot coverage, correlations that together indicate that stellar spot-filling factors generated by strong magnetic fields might be the mechanism that drives radius inflation in these stars. We also compare our derived magnetic fields with chromospheric emission lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Ca II K), as well as with X-ray and H$\alpha$ to bolometric luminosity ratios, and find that stars with higher chromospheric and coronal activity tend to be more magnetic.</description>

      <title>Novae: An Important Source of Lithium in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The source of the Galactic Lithium (Li) has long been a puzzle. With the discovery of Li in novae, extensive research has been conducted. However, there still exists a significant disparity between the observed abundance of lithium in novae and the existing theoretical predictions. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we simulate the evolution of nova with element diffusion and appropriately increased the amount of 3^He in the mixtures. Element diffusion enhances the transport efficiency between the nuclear reaction zone and the convective region on the surface of the white dwarf during nova eruptions, which results in more 7^Be to be transmitted to the white dwarf surface and ultimately ejected. Compared to the previous predictions, the abundance of 7^Be in novae simulated in our model significantly increases. And the result is able to explain almost all observed novae. Using the method of population synthesis, we calculate Li yield in the Galaxy. We find that the Galactic occurrence rate of nova is about 130 yr^{-1}, and about 110M Li produced by nova eruption is ejected into the interstellar medium (ISM). About 73\% of Li in the Galactic ISM originates from novae, and approximately 15\%-20\% of the entire Galaxy. It means that novae are the important source of Li in the Galactic.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron Radio Emission as a Proxy to Identify Long Period Massive Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiplicity of massive stars is known to be significantly high. Even though the majority of massive stars are located in binary systems, the census of binaries is biased toward shorter periods as longer period systems are more difficult to identify. Alternatively, the search for binary systems with longer periods may proceed differently. As massive binary systems are typically colliding-wind systems, hints for processes occurring in the colliding-wind region could be used as a valuable proxy to identify likely binary systems, and then organize dedicated spectroscopic or interferometric campaigns on a short list of pre-selected targets. In this context, any hint for synchrotron radio emission is seen as a promising indicator of long period binaries, as short period systems undergo severe free-free absorption of the synchrotron emission by the stellar wind material. Usual techniques to identify synchrotron radio emitters constitute thus valid tools to explore that poorly investigated part of the massive binary parameter space. In addition, the identification of a synchrotron emission component in a short period binary can be used as an indicator of the presence of a third companion on a still unrevealed wider orbit in a triple system.</description>

      <title>High-resolution observations of two pores with the integral field unit (IFU) of the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal is to compare the intricate details of the magnetic and flow fields around two solar pores, where one is part of an active region and the other is an isolated pore, with a secondary goal of demonstrating the scientific capabilities of the GRIS IFU. Two pores were observed with the HiFI and the GRIS IFU at the GREGOR solar telescope on 29 May and 6 June 2019. The GRIS IFU mosaics provide spectropolarimetric data for inversions of the Ca I 1083.9 nm and Si I 1082.7 nm spectral lines, covering the deep and upper photosphere. The t-SNE machine learning algorithm is employed to identify different classes of Si I Stokes-V profiles. The LCT technique derives horizontal proper motions around the pores. Both pores contain a thin light bridge, are stable during the observations, and never develop a penumbra. The isolated pore is three times smaller and significantly darker than the active-region pore, which is not predicted by simulations. The LCT maps show inflows around both pores, with lower velocities for the isolated pore. Both pores are embedded in the photospheric LOS velocity pattern of the granulation but filamentary structures are only visible in the chromospheric LOS maps of the active-region pore. The t-SNE identifies five clusters of Si I Stokes-V profiles, revealing an `onion-peel' magnetic field structure, despite the small size of the pores. The core with strong vertical magnetic fields is surrounded by concentric layers with lower and more inclined magnetic fields. The active-region pore shows some signatures of increased interaction between plasma motions and magnetic fields, which can be considered as early signs of penumbra formation. However, similar physical properties prevail for smaller pores. A statistically meaningful sample of different pore sizes and morphologies is required to distinguish between active-region and isolated pore formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Differences between ICME catalogues and Construction of a Unified Catalogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple magnetic and kinetic solar wind plasma parameters are used to detect coronal mass ejections (CMEs) as they travel through the heliosphere. There are various interplanetary CME (ICME) catalogues, but due to differences between their ICME identification criteria they can significantly vary. In this paper we analyze Richardson and Cane and CCMC CME Scoreboard ICME catalogues and the SRI RAS solar wind types catalogue, and propose an algorithm of merging them. A unified catalogue is constructed for 2010 to 2022. The resulting catalogue is completed with data from the OMNI database. Analysis of the unified catalogue demonstrated high accuracy when merging events present in multiple catalogues and a tendency of events defined in all three initial catalogues to demonstrate greater duration, speed and geoeffectiveness. The catalog is presented on the SINP MSU Space Weather Exchange website: https://swx.sinp.msu.ru/tools/icme_list.php</description>

      <title>A disc wind origin for the optical spectra of dwarf novae in outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many high-state cataclysmic variables (CVs) exhibit blue-shifted absorption features in their ultraviolet (UV) spectra -- a smoking-gun signature of outflows. However, the impact of these outflows on {\em optical} spectra remains much more uncertain. During its recent outburst, the eclipsing dwarf nova V455 And displayed strong optical emission lines whose cores were narrower than expected from a Keplerian disc. Here, we explore whether disc + wind models developed for matching UV observations of CVs can also account for these optical spectra. Importantly, V455~And was extremely bright at outburst maximum: the accretion rate implied by fitting the optical continuum with a standard disc model is $\dot{M}_{\rm acc} \simeq 10^{-7}~{\rm M}_\odot~{\rm yr^{-1}}$. Allowing for continuum reprocessing in the outflow helps to relax this constraint. A disk wind can also broadly reproduce the optical emission lines, but only if the wind is (i) highly mass-loaded, with a mass-loss rate reaching $\dot{M}_{\rm wind} \simeq 0.4 \dot{M}_{\rm acc}$, and/or (ii) clumpy, with a volume filling factor $f_V \simeq 0.1$. The same models can describe the spectral evolution across the outburst, simply by lowering $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ and $\dot{M}_{\rm wind}$. Extending these models to lower inclinations and into the UV produces spectra consistent with those observed in face-on high-state CVs. We also find, for the first time in simulations of this type, P-Cygni-like absorption features in the Balmer series, as have been observed in both CVs and X-ray binaries. Overall, dense disc winds provide a promising framework for explaining multiple observational signatures seen in high-state CVs, but theoretical challenges persist.</description>

      <title>Merger seismology: distinguishing massive merger products from genuine single stars using asteroseismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Products of stellar mergers are predicted to be common in stellar populations and can potentially explain stars with peculiar properties. When the merger occurs after the initially more massive star has evolved into the Hertzsprung gap (HG), the merger product may remain in the blue part of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD) for millions of years. Such objects could, therefore, explain the overabundance of observed blue stars, such as blue supergiants. However, it is currently not straightforward to distinguish merger products from genuine single stars. We make detailed asteroseismic comparisons between models of massive post-main-sequence merger products and genuine single stars to identify which asteroseismic diagnostics can be used to distinguish them. In doing so, we develop tools for the relatively young field of merger seismology. Genuine single stars in the HG are fully radiative, while merger products have a convective He-burning core and convective H-burning shell while occupying similar locations in the HRD. These structural differences are reflected in lower asymptotic period spacing values for merger products and the appearance of deep dips in their period spacing patterns. Our genuine single-star models with masses above roughly 11.4 solar masses develop short-lived intermediate convective zones during their HG evolution. This also leads to deep dips in their period spacing patterns. Because of the lack of a convective core, merger products and genuine single stars can be distinguished based on their asymptotic period spacing value in this mass range. We perform the comparisons with and without the effects of slow rotation included in the pulsation equations and conclude that the two types of stars are seismically distinguishable in both cases. The observability of the distinguishing asteroseismic features of merger products can now be assessed and exploited in practice.</description>

      <title>Hidden Population III Descendants in Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elusive properties of the first (Pop III) stars can be indirectly unveiled by uncovering their true descendants. To this aim, we exploit our data-calibrated model for the best-studied ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy, Bo\"otes I, which tracks the chemical evolution (from carbon to zinc) of individual stars from their formation to the present day. We explore the chemical imprint of Pop III supernovae (SNe), with different explosion energies and masses, showing that they leave distinct chemical signatures in their descendants. We find that UFDs are strongly affected by SNe-driven feedback resulting in a very low fraction of metals retained by their gravitational potential well (&lt; 2.5 %). Furthermore, the higher the Pop III SN explosion energy, the lower the fraction of metals retained. Thus, the probability to find descendants of energetic Pair Instability SNe is extremely low in these systems. Conversely, UFDs are ideal cosmic laboratories to identify the fingerprints of less massive and energetic Pop III SNe through their [X/Fe] abundance ratios. Digging into the literature data of Bo\"otes I, we uncover three hidden Pop III descendants: one mono-enriched and two multi-enriched. These stars show the chemical signature of Pop III SNe in the mass range $[20-60]\rm M_{\odot}$, spanning a wide range in explosion energies $[0.3-5] 10^{51}$ erg. In conclusion, Pop III descendants are hidden in ancient UFDs but those mono-enriched by a single Pop III SN are extremely rare. Thus, self-consistent models such as the one presented here are required to uncover these precious fossils and probe the properties of the first Pop III supernovae.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulation of Cygnus OB2: the absence of a cluster wind termination shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a large-scale hydrodynamic simulation of a massive star cluster whose stellar population mimics that of the Cygnus OB2 association. The main-sequence stars are first simulated during 1.6 Myr, until a quasi-stationary state is reached. At this time the three Wolf-Rayet stars observed in Cygnus OB2 are added to the simulation, which continues to 2 Myr. Using a high-resolution grid in the centre of the domain, we can resolve the most massive stars individually, which allows us to probe the kinetic structures at small (parsec) scales. We find that, although the cluster excavates a spherical "superbubble" cavity, the stellar population is too loosely distributed to blow a large-scale cluster wind termination shock, and that collective effects from wind-wind interactions are much less efficient than usually assumed. This challenges our understanding of the ultra-high energy emission observed from the region.</description>

      <title>Formation of a Magnetic Cloud from the Merging of Two Successive Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On 2022 March 28 two successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were observed by multiple spacecraft and resulted in a magnetic cloud (MC) at 1 AU. We investigate the propagation and interaction properties of the two CMEs correlated with the MC using coordinated multi-point remote sensing and in situ observations from Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, SOHO, and Wind. The first CME was triggered by a filament eruption with a high inclination angle. Roughly 9 hr later, the second CME originating from the same active region erupted with a smaller tilt angle and faster speed compared to the first one. The second CME overtook the preceding CME and formed a merged front at approximately 75 \rsun{}, which developed into a complex ejecta at 1 AU. The descending speed and low proton temperature inside the complex ejecta suggest that the two CMEs have fully merged before reaching 1 AU, leading them to begin expanding rather than compressing against each other. The complex ejecta appears to have the magnetic field and plasma signatures of an MC, although there is a discontinuity in the magnetic field implying previous interactions. The cross section of the complex ejecta, reconstructed from in situ data using a Grad-Shafranov technique, exhibits a right--handed flux rope structure. These results highlight that an MC--like complex ejecta lacking interaction features could arise from the complete merging of two CMEs.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Production of $^{44}$Ti and Nickel Isotopes in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report nucleosynthetic results for both $^{44}$Ti and nickel isotopes for eighteen three-dimensional (3D) core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations extended to $\sim$20 seconds after bounce. We find that many of our long-term models are able to achieve $^{44}$Ti/$^{56}$Ni ratios similar to that observed in Cassiopeia A, and modern supernova models can synthesize up to $2\times10^{-4}M_\odot$ of $^{44}$Ti. Neutrino-driven winds and the fact that there can be simultaneous accretion and explosion in 3D models of core-collapse supernovae play central roles in its production. We conclude that the $^{44}$Ti underproduction problem in previous CCSN models is no longer an issue. In addition, we discuss the production of both $^{57}$Ni and stable nickel/iron ratios and compare our results to observations of SN1987A and the Crab.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear modulation of dispersive fast magnetosonic waves in an inhomogeneous rotating solar low-$\beta$ magnetoplasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the modulation of fast magnetosonic waves (MSWs) in rotating inhomogeneous low-$\beta$ magnetoplasmas with the effects of gravitation and the Coriolis force. By employing the standard multiple-scale reductive perturbation technique (RPT), we derive a nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation that governs the evolution of slowly varying MSW envelopes. The fast MSW becomes dispersive by the effects of the Coriolis force in the fluid motion, and the magnetic field and density inhomogeneity effects favor the Jeans instability in self-gravitating plasmas in a larger domain of the wave number ($k$, below the Jeans critical wave number, $k_J$) than homogeneous plasmas. The relative influence of the Jeans frequency ($\omega_J$, associated with the gravitational force) and the angular frequency ($\Omega_0$, relating to the Coriolis force) on the Jeans carrier MSW mode and the modulational instability (MI) of the MSW envelope is studied. We show that the MSW envelope (corresponding to the unstable carrier Jeans mode with $\omega_J&gt;2\Omega_0$ and $k&lt;k_J$) is always unstable against the plane wave perturbation with no cut-offs for growth rates. In contrast, the stable Jeans mode with $\omega_J&gt;2\Omega_0$ but $k&gt;k_J$ manifests either modulational stability or MI having a finite growth rate before being cut off. We find an enhancement of the MI growth rate by the influence of magnetic field or density inhomogeneity. The case with constant gravity force (other than the self-gravity) perpendicular to the magnetic field is also briefly discussed to show that the fast magnetosonic carrier mode is always unstable, giving MI of slowly varying envelopes with no cut-offs for the growth rates. Possible applications of MI in solar plasmas, such as those in the X-ray corona, are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength observations of the Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient AT2023fhn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are a class of extragalactic transients notable for their rapid rise and fade times, blue colour and accompanying luminous X-ray and radio emission. Only a handful have been studied in detail since the prototypical example AT2018cow. Their origins are currently unknown, but ongoing observations of previous and new events are placing ever stronger constraints on their progenitors. We aim to put further constraints on the LFBOT AT2023fhn, and LFBOTs as a class, using information from the multi-wavelength transient light-curve, its host galaxy and local environment. Our primary results are obtained by fitting galaxy models to the spectral energy distribution of AT2023fhn's host and local environment, and by modelling the radio light-curve of AT2023fhn as due to synchrotron self-absorbed emission from an expanding blast-wave in the circumstellar medium. We find that the neither the host galaxy nor circumstellar environment of AT2023fhn are unusual compared with previous LFBOTs, but that AT2023fhn has a much lower X-ray to ultraviolet luminosity ratio than previous events. We argue that the variety in ultraviolet-optical to X-ray luminosity ratios among LFBOTs is likely due to viewing angle differences, and that the diffuse, yet young local environment of AT2023fhn - combined with a similar circumstellar medium to previous events - favours a progenitor system containing a massive star with strong winds. Plausible progenitor models in this interpretation therefore include black hole/Wolf-Rayet mergers or failed supernovae.</description>

      <title>Potential Flow Formulation of Parker's Unsteady Solar Wind Model and Nonlinear Stability Aspects Near the Parker Sonic Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present the first ever systematic theoretical formulation to address the long-standing issue of regularization of the singularity associated with the Parker sonic critical point in the linear perturbation problem for Parker's unsteady solar wind model. This is predicated on the necessity to go outside the framework of the linear perturbation problem and incorporate the dominant nonlinearities in this dynamical system. For this purpose, a whole new theoretical formulation of Parker's unsteady solar wind model based on the potential flow theory in ideal gas dynamics is given, which provides an appropriate optimal theoretical framework to accomplish this task. The stability of Parker's steady solar wind solution is shown to extend also to the neighborhood of the Parker sonic critical point by going to the concomitant nonlinear problem.</description>

      <title>Revealing asymmetry on midplane of proto-planetary disc through modelling of axisymmetric emission: methodology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework for deriving the surface brightness profile and geometry of a geometrically-thin axisymmetric disc from interferometric observation of continuum emission. Such precise modelling facilitates the exploration of faint non-axisymmetric structures, such as spirals and circumplanetary discs. As a demonstration, we simulate interferometric observations of geometrically-thin axisymmetric discs. The proposed method can reasonably recover the injected axisymmetric structures, whereas Gaussian fitting of the same data yielded larger errors in disc orientation estimation. To further test the applicability of the method, it was applied to the mock data for $m=1,2$ spirals and a point source, which are embedded in a bright axisymmetric structure. The injected non-axisymmetric structures were reasonably recovered except for the innermost parts, and the disc geometric parameter estimations were better than Gasussian fitting. The method was then applied to the real data of Elias 20 and AS 209, and it adequately subtracted the axisymmetric component, notably in Elias 20, where substantial residuals remained without our method. We also applied our method to continuum data of PDS 70 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. We successfully recovered emission from PDS 70 c consistently with previous studies, and also tentatively discovered new substructures. The current formulation can be applied to any data for disc continuum emission, and aids in the search of spirals and circumplanetary discs, whose detection is still limited.</description>

      <title>Evidence for bipolar explosions in Type IIP supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) suggest aspherical explosions. Globally aspherical structures in SN explosions are regarded as the key for understanding their explosion mechanism. However, the exact explosion geometries from the inner cores to the outer envelopes are poorly understood. Here, we present photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric observations of the Type IIP SN 2021yja and discuss its explosion geometry, in comparison to those of other Type IIP SNe that show large-scale aspherical structures in their hydrogen envelopes (SNe 2012aw, 2013ej and 2017gmr). During the plateau phase, SNe 2012aw and 2021yja exhibit high continuum polarization characterized by two components with perpendicular polarization angles. This behavior can be interpreted to be due to a bipolar explosion, composed of a polar (energetic) and an equatorial (bulk) components of the SN ejecta. In such a bipolar explosion, an aspherical axis created by the polar ejecta would be dominating at early phases, while the perpendicular axis along the equatorial ejecta would emerge at late phases after the receding of the photosphere in the polar ejecta. The interpretation of the bipolar explosions in SNe 2012aw and 2021yja is also supported by other observational properties, including the time evolution of the line velocities and the line shapes in the nebular spectra. The polarization of other Type IIP SNe that show large-scale aspherical structures in the hydrogen envelope (SNe 2013ej and 2017gmr) is also consistent with the bipolar-explosion scenario, although this is not conclusive.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Role of Pre-supernova Massive Stars in the Acceleration of Galactic Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) constitute a significant part of the energy budget of our Galaxy, and the study of their accelerators is of high importance in modern astrophysics. Their main sources are likely supernova remnants (SNRs). These objects are capable to convert a part of their mechanical energy into accelerated charged particles. However, even though the mechanical energy reservoir of SNRs is promising, a conversion rate into particle energy of 10 to 20% is necessary to feed the population of GCRs. Such an efficiency is however not guaranteed. Complementary sources deserve thus to be investigated. This communication aims to address the question of the contribution to the acceleration of GCRs by pre-supernova massive stars in binary or higher multiplicity systems</description>

      <title>Abundant hydrocarbons in the disk around a very-low-mass star</title>

Abstract: Very low-mass stars (those &lt;0.3 solar masses) host orbiting terrestrial planets more frequently than other types of stars, but the compositions of those planets are largely unknown. We use mid-infrared spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope to investigate the chemical composition of the planet-forming disk around ISO-ChaI 147, a 0.11 solar-mass star. The inner disk has a carbon-rich chemistry: we identify emission from 13 carbon-bearing molecules including ethane and benzene. We derive large column densities of hydrocarbons indicating that we probe deep into the disk. The high carbon to oxygen ratio we infer indicates radial transport of material within the disk, which we predict would affect the bulk composition of any planets forming in the disk.</description>

      <title>OH mid-infrared emission as a diagnostic of H$_2$O UV photodissociation. III. Application to planet-forming disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST gives a unique access to the physical and chemical structure of inner disks ($&lt;10$~au), where the majority of the planets are forming. However, the interpretation of mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectra requires detailed thermo-chemical models able to provide synthetic spectra readily comparable to spectroscopic observations. Our goal is to explore the potential of mid-IR emission of OH to probe H$_2$O photodissociation. We include in the DALI disk model prompt emission of OH following photodissociation of H$_2$O in its $\tilde{B}$ electronic state ($\lambda &lt; 144$~nm). This model allows to compute in a self-consistent manner the thermo-chemical structure of the disk and the resulting mid-IR line intensities of OH and H$_2$O. The OH line intensities in the $9-13~\mu$m range are proportional to the total amount of water photodissociated. As such, these lines are a tracer of the amount of water exposed to the FUV field, which depends on the temperature, density, and strength of the FUV field reaching the upper molecular layers. In particular, the OH line fluxes primarily scale with the FUV field emitted by the star in contrast with H$_2$O lines in the 10-20$~\mu$m range which scale with the bolometric luminosity. OH is therefore a key diagnostic to probe the effect of Ly$\alpha$ and constrain the dust FUV opacity in the upper molecular layers. A strong asymmetry between the A' and A'' components of each rotational quadruplet is also predicted. OH mid-IR emission is a powerful tool to probe H$_2$O photodissociation and infer the physical conditions in disk atmospheres. As such, the inclusion of OH mid-IR lines in the analysis of JWST-MIRI spectra will be key for robustly inferring the composition of planet-forming disks. The interpretation of less excited OH lines requires additional quantum calculations of the formation pumping of OH levels by O+H$_2$ and the collisional rate coefficients.</description>

      <title>Magnetic braking below the cataclysmic variable period gap and the observed dearth of period bouncers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Period bouncers are cataclysmic variables (CVs) that have evolved past their orbital period minimum. The strong disagreement between theory and observations of the relative fraction of period bouncers is a severe shortcoming in the understanding of CV evolution. We test the implications of the hypothesis that magnetic braking (MB), which is suggested to be an additional angular momentum loss (AML) mechanism for CVs below the period gap ($P_\mathrm{orb}\lesssim 120$ min), weakens around their period minimum. We compute the evolution of CV donors below the period gap using the MESA code, assuming that the evolution of the system is driven by AML by gravitational wave radiation (GWR) and MB. We parametrize the MB strength as $\mathrm{AML_{MB}}=\kappa\mathrm{AML_{GWR}}$. We compute two qualitatively different sets of models, one where $\kappa$ is a constant and the other where $\kappa$ depends on stellar parameters. We find that two crucial effects drive the latter set of models. (1) A decrease in $\kappa$ as CVs approach the period minimum stalls their evolution so that they spend a long time in the observed period minimum spike ($80\lesssim P_\mathrm{orb}/\,\mathrm{min}\lesssim 86$). Here, they become difficult to distinguish from pre-bounce systems in the spike. (2) A strong decrease in the mass-transfer rate makes them virtually undetectable as they evolve further. So, the CV stalls around the period minimum and then `disappears'. This reduces the number of detectable bouncers. Physical processes, such as dynamo action, white dwarf magnetism, and dead zones, may cause such a weakening of MB at short orbital periods. The weakening magnetic braking formalism provides a possible solution to the problem of the lack of period bouncers in CV observational surveys.</description>

      <title>Stellar Evolution in Real Time II: R Hydrae and an Open-Source Grid of &gt;3000 Seismic TP-AGB Models Computed with MESA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive characterization of the evolved thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) star R Hydrae, building on the techniques applied in Stellar Evolution in Real Time I (Moln\'ar et al. 2019) to T Ursae Minoris. We compute over 3000 theoretical TP-AGB pulse spectra using MESA and GYRE and combine these with classical observational constraints and nearly 400 years of measurements of R Hya's period evolution to fit R Hya's evolutionary and asteroseismic features. Two hypotheses for the mode driving R Hya's period are considered. Solutions that identify this as the fundamental mode (FM) as well as the first overtone (O1) are consistent with observations. Using a variety of statistical tests, we find that R Hya is most likely driven by the FM and currently occupies the ``power down'' phase of an intermediate pulse (TP ~ 9-16). We predict that its pulsation period will continue to shorten for millennia. Using supplementary calculations from the Monash stellar evolution code, we also find that R Hya is likely to have undergone third dredge-up in its most recent pulse. The MESA+GYRE model grid used in this analysis includes exact solutions to the adiabatic equations of stellar oscillation for the first 10 radial-order pressure modes for every time step in every evolutionary track. The grid is fully open-source and packaged with a data visualization application. This is the first publicly available grid of TP-AGB models with seismology produced with MESA.</description>

      <title>Semantic Segmentation of Solar Radio Spikes at Low Frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar radio spikes are short lived, narrow bandwidth features in low frequency solar radio observations. The timing of their occurrence and the number of spikes in a given observation is often unpredictable. The high temporal and frequency of resolution of modern radio telescopes such as NenuFAR mean that manually identifying radio spikes is an arduous task. Machine learning approaches to data exploration in solar radio data is on the rise. Here we describe a convolutional neural network to identify the per pixel location of radio spikes as well as determine some simple characteristics of duration, spectral width and drift rate. The model, which we call SpikeNet, was trained using an Nvidia Tesla T4 16GB GPU with ~100000 sample spikes in a total time of 2.2 hours. The segmentation performs well with an intersection over union in the test set of ~0.85. The root mean squared error for predicted spike properties is of the order of 23%. Applying the algorithm to unlabelled data successfully generates segmentation masks although the accuracy of the predicted properties is less reliable, particularly when more than one spike is present in the same 64 X 64 pixel time-frequency range. We have successfully demonstrated that our convolutional neural network can locate and characterise solar radio spikes in a number of seconds compared to the weeks it would take for manual identification.</description>

      <title>Effect of Systematic Uncertainties on Density and Temperature Estimates in Coronae of Capella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the coronal density of Capella using the O VII and Fe XVII line systems in the soft X-ray regime that have been observed over the course of the Chandra mission. Our analysis combines measures of error due to uncertainty in the underlying atomic data with statistical errors in the Chandra data to derive meaningful overall uncertainties on the plasma density of the coronae of Capella. We consider two Bayesian frameworks. First, the so-called pragmatic-Bayesian approach considers the atomic data and their uncertainties as fully specified and uncorrectable. The fully-Bayesian approach, on the other hand, allows the observed spectral data to update the atomic data and their uncertainties, thereby reducing the overall errors on the inferred parameters. To incorporate atomic data uncertainties, we obtain a set of atomic data replicates, the distribution of which captures their uncertainty. A principal component analysis of these replicates allows us to represent the atomic uncertainty with a lower-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution. A $t$-distribution approximation of the uncertainties of a subset of plasma parameters including a priori temperature information, obtained from the temperature-sensitive-only Fe XVII spectral line analysis, is carried forward into the density- and temperature-sensitive O VII spectral line analysis. Markov Chain Monte Carlo based model fitting is implemented including Multi-step Monte Carlo Gibbs Sampler and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Our analysis recovers an isothermally approximated coronal plasma temperature of $\approx$5 MK and a coronal plasma density of $\approx$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, with uncertainties of 0.1 and 0.2 dex respectively.</description>

      <title>Photometry of Saturated Stars with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a multilevel perceptron (MLP) neural network to obtain photometry of saturated stars in the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). The MLP can obtain fairly unbiased photometry for stars from g~4 to 14~mag, particularly compared to the dispersion (15%-85% 1sigma range around the median) of 0.12 mag for saturated (g&lt;11.5 mag) stars. More importantly, the light curve of a non-variable saturated star has a median dispersion of only 0.037 mag. The MLP light curves are, in many cases, spectacularly better than those provided by the standard ASAS-SN pipelines. While the network was trained on g band data from only one of ASAS-SN's 20 cameras, initial experiments suggest that it can be used for any camera and the older ASAS-SN V band data as well. The dominant problems seem to be associated with correctable issues in the ASAS-SN data reduction pipeline for saturated stars more than the MLP itself. The method is publicly available as a light curve option on ASAS-SN Sky Patrol v1.0.</description>

      <title>Rotation and Abundances of the Benchmark Brown Dwarf HD 33632 Ab from Keck/KPIC High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the projected rotational velocity and molecular abundances for HD 33632 Ab obtained via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer high-resolution spectroscopy. HD 33632 Ab is a nearby benchmark brown dwarf companion at a separation of $\sim$20 au that straddles the L/T transition. Using a forward-modeling framework with on-axis host star spectra, self-consistent substellar atmospheric and retrieval models for HD 33632 Ab, we derive a projected rotational velocity of 53 $\pm$ 3 km/s and carbon/water mass fractions of log CO = $-$2.3 $\pm$ 0.3 and log H$_2$O = $-$2.7 $\pm$ 0.2. The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.58 $\pm$ 0.14), molecular abundances, and metallicity ([C/H] = 0.0 $\pm$ 0.2 dex) of HD 33632 Ab are consistent with its host star. Although detectable methane opacities are expected in L/T transition objects, we did not recover methane in our KPIC spectra, partly due to the high $v\sin{i}$ and to disequilibrium chemistry at the pressures we are sensitive to. We parameterize the spin as the ratio of rotation over break-up velocity, and compare HD 33632 Ab to a compilation of &gt;200 very low-mass objects (M$\lesssim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$) that have spin measurements in the literature. There appears to be no clear trend for the isolated field low-mass objects versus mass, but a tentative trend is identified for low-mass companions and directly imaged exoplanets, similar to previous findings. A larger sample of close-in gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs will critically examine our understanding of their formation and evolution through rotation and chemical abundance measurements.</description>

      <title>A Contact Binary Mis-Classified as an Ellipsoidal Variable: Complications for Detached Black Hole Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying sources exhibiting ellipsoidal variability in large photometric surveys is becoming a promising method to search for candidate detached black holes in binaries. This technique aims to exploit the orbital-phase dependent modulation in optical photometry caused by the black hole distorting the shape of the luminous star to constrain the mass ratio of the binary. Without understanding if, or how much, contamination is present in the candidate black hole samples produced by this new technique it is hard to leverage them for black hole discovery. Here, we follow up one of the best candidates identified from Gaia Data Release 3, Gaia DR3 4042390512917208960, with a radial velocity campaign. Combined photometric and radial velocity modelling, along with spectral disentangling, suggests that the true mass ratio (mass of the unseen object divided by the mass of the luminous star) is an order of magnitude smaller than that inferred assuming the modulations arise from ellipsoidal variability. We therefore infer that this system is likely a contact binary, or on the boundary of both stars nearly filling their Roche lobes, however, further observations are required to confidently detect the secondary. We find that the well-known problem of discriminating between ellipsoidal and contact binary light curves results in a larger contamination from contact binaries than previously suggested. Until ellipsoidal variables can be reliably distinguished from contact binaries, samples of black hole candidates selected based on ellipsoidal variability are likely to be highly contaminated by contact binaries or similar systems.</description>

      <title>Association between a Failed Prominence Eruption and the Drainage of Mass from Another Prominence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sympathetic eruptions of solar prominences have been studied for decades, however, it is usually difficult to identify their causal links. Here we present two failed prominence eruptions on 26 October 2022 and explore their connections. Using stereoscopic observations, the south prominence (PRO-S) erupts with untwisting motions, flare ribbons occur underneath, and new connections are formed during the eruption. The north prominence (PRO-N) rises up along with PRO-S, and its upper part disappears due to catastrophic mass draining along an elongated structure after PRO-S failed eruption. We suggest that the eruption of PRO-S initiates due to a kink instability, further rises up, and fails to erupt due to reconnection with surrounding fields. The elongated structure connecting PRO-N overlies PRO-S, which causes the rising up of PRO-N along with PRO-S and mass drainage after PRO-S eruption. This study suggests that a prominence may end its life through mass drainage forced by an eruption underneath.</description>

      <title>Doppler Dimming and Brightening Effects in Solar Prominences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explored the impact that Doppler dimming and brightening effects from bulk motions of solar prominences have on the formation of Lya, Ha, and MgII h line profiles. We compared two schemes in which these effects manifest; when the prominence is moving radially away from the solar surface (radial case), and when the prominence is moving parallel to the solar surface (horizontal case). To do this, we analysed 13,332 model profiles generated through the use of the 1D NLTE (i.e. departures from Local Thermodynamic equilibrium) radiative transfer (RT) code Promweaver, built on the Lightweaver NLTE RT framework to mimic the behaviour and output of the 1D NLTE RT code PROM. We found that horizontal velocities are just as, or more important than radial velocities. This demonstrates that horizontal velocities need to be accounted for when attempting to do any sort of forward modelling.</description>

      <title>Relative alignment between gas structures and magnetic field in Orion A at different scales using different molecular gas tracers</title>

Abstract: Context: Magnetic fields can play crucial roles in high-mass star formation. Nonetheless, the significance of magnetic fields at various scales and their relationship with gas structures is largely overlooked. Aims: Our goal is to examine the relationship between the magnetic field and molecular gas structures within the Orion A giant molecular cloud at different scales and density regimes. Methods: We assess the gas intensity structures and column densities in Orion A by utilizing $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O from Nobeyama observations. Through comparing Nobeyama observations with {\it{Planck}} polarization observations on large scales ($\sim0.6$ pc) and JCMT polarization observations on small scales ($\sim0.04$ pc), we investigate how the role of magnetic fields change with scale and density. Results: We find a similar trend from parallel to perpendicular alignment with increasing column densities in Orion A at both large and small spatial scales. Besides, when changing from low-density to high-density tracers, the relative orientation preference changes from random to perpendicular. The self-similar results at different scales indicate that magnetic fields are dynamically important in both cloud formation and filament formation. However, magnetic fields properties at small scales are relative complicated, and the interplay between magnetic field and star-forming activities needs to be discussed case-by-case.</description>

      <title>Repeating partial disruptions and two-body relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-body relaxation may drive stars onto near-radial orbits around a massive black hole, resulting in a tidal disruption event (TDE). In some circumstances, stars are unlikely to undergo a single terminal disruption, but rather to have a sequence of many grazing encounters with the black hole. It has long been unclear what is the physical outcome of this sequence: each of these encounters can only liberate a small amount of stellar mass, but may significantly alter the orbit of the star. We study the phenomenon of repeating partial tidal disruptions (pTDEs) by building a semi-analytical model that accounts for mass loss and tidal excitation. In the empty loss cone regime, where two-body relaxation is weak, we estimate the number of consecutive partial disruptions that a star can undergo, on average, before being significantly affected by two-body encounters. We find that in this empty loss cone regime, a star will be destroyed in a sequence of weak pTDEs, possibly explaining the tension between the low observed TDE rate and its higher theoretical estimates.</description>

      <title>The Aligned Orbit of a Hot Jupiter around the M Dwarf TOI-4201</title>

Abstract: Measuring the obliquities of stars hosting giant planets may shed light on the dynamical history of planetary systems. Significant efforts have been made to measure the obliquities of FGK stars with hot Jupiters, mainly based on observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. In contrast, M dwarfs with hot Jupiters have hardly been explored, because such systems are rare and often not favorable for such precise observations. Here, we report the first detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for an M dwarf with a hot Jupiter, TOI-4201, using the Gemini-North/MAROON-X spectrograph. We find TOI-4201 to be well-aligned with its giant planet, with a sky-projected obliquity of $\lambda=-3.0_{-3.2}^{+3.7}\ ^{\circ}$ and a true obliquity of $\psi=21.3_{-12.8}^{+12.5}\ ^{\circ}$ with an upper limit of $40^{\circ}$ at a 95% confidence level. The result agrees with dynamically quiet formation or tidal obliquity damping that realigned the system. As the first hot Jupiter around an M dwarf with its obliquity measured, TOI-4201b joins the group of aligned giant planets around cool stars ($T_{\rm eff}&lt;6250\ K$), as well as the small but growing sample of planets with relatively high planet-to-star mass ratio ($M_p/M_\ast\gtrsim 3\times 10^{-3}$) that also appear to be mostly aligned.</description>
