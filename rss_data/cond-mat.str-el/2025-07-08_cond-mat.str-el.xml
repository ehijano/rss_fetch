      <title>Quasiconservation Laws and Suppressed Transport in Weakly Interacting Localized Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</description>

      <title>Mapping phase diagrams of quantum spin systems through semidefinite-programming relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying quantum phase transitions poses a significant challenge in condensed matter physics, as this requires methods that both provide accurate results and scale well with system size. In this work, we demonstrate how relaxation methods can be used to generate the phase diagram for one- and two-dimensional quantum systems. To do so, we formulate a relaxed version of the ground-state problem as a semidefinite program, which we can solve efficiently. Then, by taking the resulting vector of operator monomials for different model parameters, we identify all first- and second-order transitions based on their cosine similarity. Furthermore, we show how spontaneous symmetry breaking is naturally captured by bounding the corresponding observable. Using these methods, we reproduce the phase transitions for the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model and the two-dimensional frustrated bilayer Heisenberg model. We also illustrate how the phase diagram of the latter changes when a next-nearest-neighbor interaction is introduced. Overall, our work demonstrates how relaxation methods provide a novel framework for studying and understanding quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Seebeck effect in Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$|Pt at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Seebeck effect, nonlinear conversion of a temperature gradient into an electric current, was observed at room temperature. Based on a second-harmonic lock-in method combined with an a.c. temperature gradient, $\nabla T$, we measured a nonlinear Seebeck voltage in NiFe|Pt bilayers at 300 K, the amplitude of which increases in proportion to $(\nabla T)^2$. We also observed that the nonlinear Seebeck voltage increases as the sample length along the $\nabla T$ direction decreases, showing a characteristic scaling law distinct from the conventional linear Seebeck effect. We developed a phenomenological model for the nonlinear Seebeck effect incorporating the spin-current induced modulation of the Seebeck coefficient, which well reproduces the experimental results.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Charge Density Wave and Fermi Surface Reconstruction in Pressurized BaFe2Al9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intermetallic compound BaFe2Al9 exhibits unusual physical properties associated with a charge density wave (CDW) transition. Unlike conventional CDW materials, which typically display subtle structural distortions or lattice modulations, BaFe2Al9 undergoes a first-order phase transition in which lattice strain plays a crucial role in the formation of the CDW state. To further explore this unique behavior, we conducted high-pressure studies, examining the electrical transport, magnetic, and structural properties to gain deeper insight into the underlying CDW mechanism. At ambient pressure, electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements confirm the presence of a CDW transition. Upon applying pressure, the CDW transition temperature (TCDW) shifts to higher values, reaching approximately 300 K near 3.2 GPa, and the electrical resistivity increases, suggesting that pressure modulates the charge carrier concentration. Furthermore, the initially sharp first-order transition becomes more gradual, and analysis of the temperature derivative of resistivity indicates a crossover from first-order to second-order like behavior under pressure. High-pressure magnetization measurements are consistent with the electrical transport data, showing an enhancement of TCDW with increasing pressure. The residual resistivity increases with pressure, while the Fermi liquid coefficient A decreases above 2 GPa, pointing to a possible Fermi surface reconstruction. High-pressure synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements at room temperature reveal a lattice anomaly near 3.8 GPa, marked by a distinct trend change in macrostrain, further supporting the existence of a pressure induced structural response. These findings provide valuable insight into the nature of CDW formation in BaFe2Al9 and highlight the critical role of lattice strain and external pressure in tuning its electronic ground state.</description>

      <title>From localized 4f electrons to anisotropic exchange interactions in ferromagnetic CeRh6Ge4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeRh6Ge4 is a Ce-based ferromagnetic material exhibiting a quantum critical behavior under pressure. We derive effective exchange interactions, using the framework of density functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal that the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic interaction along the c-axis is isotropic in spin space, leading to a formation of spin chains. On the other hand, the inter-chain coupling is highly anisotropic: The in-plane moment weakly interacts ferromagnetically in the a--b plane to stabilize the ferromagnetic state, whereas the z-component couples antiferromagnetically, contributing to its destabilization. The magnetic anisotropy of the interchain interactions as well as of the local 4f wavefunctions characterizes the magnetic properties underlying the ferromagnetic transition and the quantum critical behavior in CeRh6Ge4.</description>

      <title>Magnetocalorics of singlet ground state induced moment magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In f-electron materials like Pr or U compounds with non-Kramers states of the f-shell the ground state may be a nonmagnetic singlet due to the action of the crystalline electric field. Nevertheless these compounds can order magnetically. They develop a ground state moment and long range order due to the spontaneous admixture of the excited state into the ground state caused by inter-site exchange. This mechanism can establish magnetic order if a control parameter exceeds a critical value defining the quantum critical point between disordered and magnetic phase. Here we investigate the magnetocaloric properties of such quantum magnets where the entropy release at low temperature is due to a competition between thermal depopulation and spontaneous order effects. We determine field and temperature dependence of specific heat for ferro- and antiferromagnetic order and also calculate the adiabatic magneto- and barocaloric cooling rates. As a model application we discuss the magnetic specific heat of the new induced ferromagnet PrI3. Furthermore we analyze the excitation spectrum of the singlet induced moment magnets in an external field with particular emphasis on field and temperature dependence of the critical soft mode. We find that the latter is fragile and exists only at specific points in the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of the nemato-elastic coupling and dynamics of hybridized collective nematic-phonon excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronically-driven nematic order breaks the rotational symmetry of a system, e.g., through a Pomeranchuk instability of the Fermi surface, with a concomitant distortion of the lattice. As a result, in a metal, the nematic collective mode interacts with two different sets of gapless excitations: the particle-hole excitations of the metal and the lattice fluctuations that become soft at the induced structural transition, namely, the transverse acoustic phonons. However, the \textit{dynamics} of these hybridized collective modes formed by the transverse acoustic phonons and the metallic electronic-nematic fluctuations has remained largely unexplored. Here we address this problem by developing a formalism in which the nemato-elastic coupling is obtained microscopically from the direct coupling between electrons and transverse acoustic phonons enabled by impurities present in the crystal. We then demonstrate the emergence of hybrid nemato-elastic modes that mix the characteristics of the transverse phonons and of the nematic fluctuations. Near the nematic quantum critical point in a metal, two massless modes emerge with intertwined dynamic behaviors, implying that neither mode dominates the response of the system. We systematically study the non-trivial dependence of these collective modes on the longitudinal and transverse momenta, revealing a rich landscape of underdamped and overdamped modes as the proximity to the quantum critical point and the strength of the electron-phonon coupling are changed. Since dynamics play an important role for determining superconducting instabilities, our results have implications for the study of pairing mediated by electronic nematic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal spin-wave excitations in Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the nonreciprocity of spin-wave excitations in the Rashba-Hubbard ferromagnet within the random-phase approximation. We find that the non-reciprocal behavior arises only when the magnetic moments are aligned in-plane and not out-of-plane. Furthermore, the spin-wave excitations exhibit non-reciprocal behavior in a direction in the momentum space reciprocal to an in-plane direction perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic moments. In that case, the first dominating term in the low-energy dispersion is linear. However, if the magnetic moments are out-of-plane, then the first dominant term is quadratic instead. The low-energy non-quadratic behavior is examined in the intermediate-to-strong coupling regime for various strengths of Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Specific heat and density anomalies in the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding thermal properties of materials is fundamental to technological applications and to discover new phenomena. In particular, advances of experimental techniques such as cold-atoms measurements allow the simulation of paradigmatic Hamiltonians with great control over model parameters, such as the Fermi-Hubbard model. One aspect of this model which is not much explored is the behavior of the specific heat as function of density. In this work, we perform Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model to analyze the specific heat as the filling, interaction and temperature of the system is changed. We found that, with strong correlations, the specific heat presents a three-maxima structure as a function of filling, with local minima between them. This effect can be explained by a decomposition of kinetic and potential contributions to the specific heat. Moreover, by analyzing the kinetic contribution in momentum space we show that, connected to this specific heat behavior, there is a density anomaly detected through the thermal expansion coefficient. These momentum-space quantities are accessible using cold-atoms experiments. Finally, we map the location of these phenomena and connect the thermal expansion anomaly with the well-known Seebeck coefficient change of sign. Our results provide a new perspective to analyze this change of sign. Moreover, our specific heat results demonstrate interesting phenomena away from the commonly studied half-filling regime.</description>

      <title>Characterization of fractional Chern insulator quasiparticles in moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed study of Abelian quasiparticles of valley polarized fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) residing in the top valence band of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) at hole filling $\nu_h=2/3$. We construct a tight-binding model of delocalized quasiparticles to capture the energy dispersion of a single quasiparticle. We then localize quasiparticles by short-range delta impurity potentials. Unlike the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) counterpart in the lowest Landau level (LLL), the density profile around the localized FCI quasiparticle in tMoTe$_2$ depends on the location of the impurity potential and loses the continuous rotation invariance. The FCI quasiparticle localized at moir\'e lattice center closely follows the anyon Wannier state of the tight-binding model of the mobile quasiparticle. Despite of the difference in density profiles, we find that the excess charge around the impurity potential for the $\nu_h=2/3$ FCIs in tMoTe$_2$ is still similar to that of the $\nu=2/3$ FQH state in the LLL if an effective magnetic length on the moir\'e lattice is chosen as the length unit, which allows a rough estimation of the spatial extent of the FCI quasiparticle. Far away from the impurity potential, this excess charge has the tendency to reach $e/3$, as expected for the Laughlin quasiparticle. The braiding phase of two FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$ also agrees with the theoretical prediction of fractional statistics. Based on the nearly ideal quantum geometry of the top valence band of tMoTe$_2$, we propose a trial wave function for localized FCI quasiparticles, which reproduces the key feature of the density profile around a quasiparticle. We also discuss the effect of band mixing on FCI quasiparticles in tMoTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal magnon transport properties in the easy-axis XXZ Heisenberg ferromagnet on the face-centered cubic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in the $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-axis exchange anisotropy ($\Delta&gt;1$) on a face-centered cubic lattice consisting of four sublattices. We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.</description>

      <title>Modeling of a twisted-Kagome HoAgGe spin ice using Reduced-Configuration-Space Search and Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kagome lattice is a 2D network of corner sharing triangles found in several rare earth materials resulting in a complicated and often frustrated magnetic system. In the last decades, modifications of the motif, such as breathing Kagome, asymmetric Kagome, and twisted Kagome were brought into the limelight. In particular, the latter has lower symmetry than the original Kagome and thus allows implementations of an "Ising-local" Hamiltonian, leading to a 2D spin ice. One such material implementation, HoAgGe, was recently reported to have an exceptionally rich phase diagram and is a strongly frustrated 2D spin-ice material with a twisted-Kagome geometry. In the presence of an external magnetic field the compound exhibits step-like magnetization plateaus at simple fractions of the saturation magnetization. It is believed that this phenomenon results from strong single-site anisotropy, which in HoAgGe was found to be in-plane and along a high-symmetry direction. Previous Monte Carlo simulations with empirical exchange parameters explain some, but not all experimental observations. In this work we present (a) first-principle calculations of the crucial model parameters and (b) direct energy minimization via a Reduced-Configuration-Space search, as well as Monte-Carlo simulations of the field-dependent phase diagram. We find that for HoAgGe the calculated exchange parameters are very different from the earlier suggested empirical ones, and describe the phase diagram much more accurately. This is likely because the first-principles parameters are, in addition to geometrically, also parametrically frustrated.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Quantum Matter Revisited: Flat-Band Topological States on a Zero-Flux Dipole Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strongly correlated fractional topological phases on a two-sphere threaded by a magnetic dipole field with globally vanishing flux. Solving the Dirac equation in this background produces spheroidal wavefunctions forming a highly degenerate manifold of normalizable zero modes, with degeneracy proportional to the total absolute flux. We introduce a non-Abelian spin gauge field near the equator to hybridize the north and south domain-confined modes, forming a global flat band. Projecting interactions into this band yields Laughlin-type correlated states. The entanglement spectrum shows a chiral tower consistent with a virtual edge, demonstrating bulk-edge correspondence in a closed geometry. This generalizes the zero-flux flat-band construction of \cite{Parhizkar:2024som} to curved backgrounds, with potential applications to synthetic and astrophysical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement underpins quantum information processing and computing, yet its experimental quantification in complex, many-body condensed matter systems remains a considerable challenge. Here, we reveal a highly entangled electronic phase proximate to a quantum metal-insulator transition, identified by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering interferometry. This approach reveals that entanglement across atomic sites generates characteristic interference patterns, which our model accurately reproduces, enabling extraction of a full entanglement spectrum and resolution of the underlying quantum states. Our analysis of the pyrochlore iridate Nd2Ir2O7 demonstrates that the system undergoes pronounced quantum fluctuations in its spin, orbital and charge degrees of freedom, even in the presence of a long-range 'all-in-all-out' antiferromagnetic order. Importantly, the observed entanglement signatures facilitate the coexistence of multiple exotic symmetry-breaking orders. Complementary investigations using Raman spectroscopy corroborate the presence of these hidden orders and their emergent excitations. In particular, we observe a two-magnon-bound state below the lowest single-magnon excitation energy, which, together with split phonon modes, provides strong evidence for cubic symmetry-breaking orders of magnetic origin juxtaposed with the all-in-all-out order. Our work thus establishes a direct link between quantum entanglement and emergent unconventional orders, opening new avenues for investigating quantum materials.</description>

      <title>The role of dimensionality in the magnetic properties of CeIn$_3$ nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have explored the Metallic-Flux Nanonucleation method to synthesize single crystals and nanowires (diameter $\approx$ 170 nm) of CeIn$_{3}$ and compare their properties. The effects of reduced dimensionality were systematically investigated using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), Selected area electron diffraction (SAED), magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Semi-quantitative EDS analysis revealed a Ce:In ratio of 1:3.1(1), and the SAED results confirmed that the nanowires are polycrystalline with a cubic unit cell. Magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and NMR data indicated a suppression of the antiferromagnetic transition to $T_N$ $\approx$ 2.4 K compared to the bulk value ($\approx$ 10 K). Furthermore, NMR analysis at temperatures below 2.8 K showed a reduced quadrupole frequency, $\nu_Q$ $\approx$ 1.77(2) MHz, and provided evidence of polycrystalline nanowires formed within the nanoporous alumina template, in agreement with SAED results. We attribute these findings to an increasing magnetic order frustration induced by dimensionality in CeIn$_{3}$ nanowires.</description>

      <title>Tuning electronic correlations in the Kagome metals $RT_3$B$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $RT_3$B$_2$ ($R=$Y, Lu, $T=$ Co, Os) family hosts a perfect kagome lattice of $T$ atoms, offering an interesting platform to investigate the interplay of electronic structure, superconductivity, and lattice dynamics. Here, we compare two members of this family, LuOs$_3$B$_2$ and YCo$_3$B$_2$, with similar crystallography but differing chemical composition, leading to distinct electronic correlation strengths and spin-orbit coupling effects. We confirm superconductivity in LuOs$_3$B$_2$ with $T_c = 4.75$K, while YCo$_3$B$_2$ remains non-superconducting above 1.8K. First-principles estimates of the electron-phonon coupling for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ are consistent with its observed $T_c$ and suggest a moderate coupling strength. Both materials exhibit kagome-derived electronic features, including quasi-flat bands, Dirac cones, and van Hove singularities. Fermi surface calculations reveal quasi-one-dimensional behavior along the $c$-axis in YCo$_3$B$_2$, in contrast to the more three-dimensional Fermiology of LuOs$_3$B$_2$. Phonon calculations for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ show imaginary modes, indicating potential lattice instabilities. Experimental estimates of the Wilson and Kadowaki-Woods ratios point to non-negligible electronic correlations in both compounds.</description>

      <title>Multipole phases in a type of spin/fermion ladders with local conserved quantities and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spin/fermion ladder models with multipole phases, which are traditional transverse-field-Ising phases formed by multipole moments. These phases feature non-trivial order with zero magnetization. The multipole models have dimer local conserved quantities that are Ising terms of spin. The Hilbert spaces are locally fragmented into independent sectors described effectively by {\it higher-order spin}. For dipole models, we consider two ladder geometries and work out the phase diagrams. Different phases of the model can be distinguished experimentally with the dynamical structure factor. Higher-order multipole models are obtained by introducing more dimer conserved quantities. The phases are characterized by the values of the local conserved quantities and the transverse-Ising phases of the higher-order spin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present view of modern physics on non-equilibrium dynamics is that generic systems equilibrate or thermalize under rather general conditions, even closed systems under unitary time evolution. The investigation of exceptions thus not only appears attractive, in view of quantum computing where thermalization is a threat it also seems to be necessary. Here, we present aspects of the one-magnon dynamics on the kagome lattice antiferromagnet as an example of a non-equilibrating dynamics due to flat bands. Similar to the one-dimensional delta chain localized eigenstates also called localized magnons lead to disorder-free localization and prevent the system from equilibration.</description>

      <title>Spin liquid state in a three-dimensional pyrochlore-like frustrated magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional frustrated spin lattice in MgCrGaO4, where Cr3+ ions occupy a pyrochlore-like network, exemplifies a quantum magnet with competing interactions, macroscopic degeneracy, and exotic low-energy excitations. Using thermodynamic, electron spin resonance (ESR), muon spin relaxation (muSR), and inelastic neutron scattering (INS) techniques, we observe no magnetic order or spin freezing down to 57 mK, despite a sizable exchange interaction (J= 58 K) between Cr3+ (S=3/2) moments and inherent site disorder. Below the characteristic exchange energy scale, all experimental probes detect the emergence of antiferromagnetic short-range spin correlations, corroborated by magnetic diffuse scattering in the wave vector dependence of low-energy magnetic excitations centered on Q = 1.5 A^-1 in inelastic neutron scattering experiments. The low-temperature specific heat follows a near-quadratic dependence without a gap, consistent with algebraic spin correlations. These results establish MgCrGaO4 as a rare three-dimensional classical spin liquid featuring a highly degenerate ground-state manifold and gapless excitations, offering a strong impetus for the experimental realization of spin liquids in higher-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Instability of the Haldane Phase: Roles of Charge Fluctuations and Hund's Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the stability of the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase in spin-1/2 Heisenberg and half-filled Hubbard ladders coupled by ferromagnetic Hund's interactions. Using density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we analyze key signatures of the Haldane phase: long-range string order, finite spin gap, and characteristic entanglement spectrum degeneracies. In spin-only Heisenberg ladders, we find immediate onset and continuous strengthening of the Haldane phase with increasing Hund's coupling. In contrast, the inclusion of charge fluctuations in Hubbard ladders leads to a nontrivial stability regime, revealing a robust yet bounded region where SPT order persists despite significant charge fluctuations. We identify distinct boundaries separating a trivial insulating phase from the Haldane SPT phase, governed by both Coulomb repulsion and Hund's coupling. Our results highlight the subtle interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom in correlated itinerant systems and establish essential criteria for observing Haldane physics experimentally in fermionic ladder materials.</description>

      <title>Revealing electron-electron interactions in graphene at room temperature with the quantum twisting microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Twisting Microscope (QTM) is a groundbreaking instrument that enables energy- and momentum-resolved measurements of quantum phases via tunneling spectroscopy across twistable van der Waals heterostructures. In this work, we significantly enhance the QTMs resolution and extend its measurement capabilities to higher energies and twist angles by incorporating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as a tunneling dielectric. This advancement unveils previously inaccessible signatures of the dispersion in the tunneling between two monolayer graphene (MLG) sheets, features consistent with a logarithmic correction to the linear Dirac dispersion arising from electron-electron (e-e) interactions with a fine-structure constant of alpha = 0.32. Remarkably, we find that this effect, for the first time, can be resolved even at room temperature, where these corrections are extremely faint. Our results underscore the exceptional resolution of the QTM, which, through interferometric interlayer tunneling, can amplify even subtle modifications to the electronic band structure of two-dimensional materials. Our findings reveal that strong e-e interactions persist even in symmetric, nonordered graphene states and emphasize the QTMs unique ability to probe spectral functions and their excitations of strongly correlated ground states across a broad range of twisted and untwisted systems.</description>

Abstract: Recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity on multilayer nickelates under high pressure have stimulated great interest. The magnetic and charge configurations in the normal phase of multilayer nickelates which closely relate to the spin-charge fluctuations remain under strongly debated. In this work, we focus the normal-state magnetic, charge and orbital configurations and its evolutions with hydrostatic pressure and Sr-doping concentration of monolayer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$. We reveal that in the ambient pressure tetragonal La2NiO4 displays Neel-type antiferromagnetic order in planer Ni spins with negligible interlayer magnetic coupling; with the increase of pressure, La2NiO4 evolves from insulate into metallic state with the critical pressure about P = 50 GPa; with the substitution of La by Sr, the magnetic ground state evolves from G-type, A-type, to double spin striped antiferromagnetic states, as well as weak charge and orbital orders, at x=1; These results can greatly promote our understanding of the magnetic properties of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, and shed the light of the pairing mechanism of unconventional nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Evidence of topological Kondo insulating state in MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological Kondo insulators (TKIs) are topologically protected insulating states induced not by single-particle band inversions, but by the Kondo interaction between itinerant electrons and a lattice of local magnetic moments. Although experiments have suggested the emergence of three-dimensional (3D) TKIs in the rare earth compound SmB6, its two-dimensional (2D) counterpart has not been demonstrated to date. Here we report experimental evidence of a TKI in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moir\'e bilayers, which support a Kondo lattice with topologically nontrivial Kondo interactions. We prepare in a dual-gated device a triangular lattice Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer Kondo-coupled to a half-filled itinerant band in the WSe2 layer. Combined transport and compressibility measurements show that the prepared state supports metallic transport at high temperatures and, at low temperatures, an insulating bulk with conducting helical edge states protected by spin-Sz conservation. The presence of Kondo singlets is further evidenced by their breakdown at high magnetic fields. Such behaviors are in stark contrast to the simple metallic state when the Mott insulator in the MoTe2 layer is depleted by gating. Our results open the door for exploring tunable topological Kondo physics in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Complex Absorbing Potential Green's Function Methods for Resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex absorbing potential (CAP) formalism has been successfully employed in various wavefunction-based methods to study electronic resonance states. In contrast, Green's function-based methods are widely used to compute ionization potentials and electron affinities but have seen limited application to resonances. We integrate the CAP formalism within the $GW$ approximation, enabling the description of electronic resonances in a Green's function framework. This approach entails a fully complex treatment of orbitals and quasiparticle energies in a non-Hermitian setting. We validate our CAP-$GW$ implementation by applying it to the prototypical shape resonances of \ce{N2^-}, \ce{CO^-}, \ce{CO_2^-}, \ce{C2H2-}, \ce{C2H4-}, and \ce{CH2O-}. It offers a fast and practical route to approximate both the lifetimes and positions of resonance states, achieving an accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art wavefunction-based methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically and numerically investigate an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer with two superconducting terminals and a strongly correlated quantum dot in one arm. Through a rigorous derivation, we prove that this double-path interferometer is spectrally equivalent to a simpler system: an interacting quantum dot coupled to a non-interacting side-coupled proximitized mode and a semiconductor lead. This equivalence reveals a simple interpretation of the interferometer's behavior through the competition of a geometric factor $\chi$, a key parameter characterizing the anomalous part of the hybridization function, with the properties of the side-coupled mode. We identify the conditions for the formation of doublet chimney in the phase diagrams in more general setting. Moreover, we show how the obtained Andreev bound state spectra clearly indicate the presence of Josephson diode effect generated by interferometric phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum circuits consisting of kicked Ising models with postselected weak measurements, whose dynamics can be mapped onto a classical dynamical system. For a periodic (Floquet) non-unitary evolution, such circuits are exactly tractable and admit volume-to-area law transitions. We show that breaking time-translation symmetry down to a quasiperiodic (Fibonacci) time evolution leads to the emergence of a critical phase with tunable effective central charge and with a fractal origin. Furthermore, for some classes of random non-unitary circuits, we demonstrate the robustness of the volume-to-area law phase transition for arbitrary random realizations, thanks to the emergent compactness of the classical map encoding the circuit's dynamics.</description>

      <title>Orbital mixing as key ingredient for magnetic order in a van der Waals ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a vast increase in research onto van der Waals magnetic materials, due to the richness of many-body effects and the versatility for next-generation technologies. In many of these systems, magnetism is introduced via light 3\textit{d}-transition metal elements, combined with chalcogenides or halogens. Despite the high technological promise in the field of spintronics, the connection between the \textit{d}-wave orbital configuration and the occurrence of low-dimensional magnetic order is currently unclear. To solve this issue, here we address the prototypical two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI\textsubscript{3}, via complementary absorption and photoemission spectroscopies, and density functional theory calculations. We reveal the electronic structure and orbital character of bulk CrI\textsubscript{3} in the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, describing the couplings underpinning its energy diagram, and demonstrating that the mechanism of stabilization of ferromagnetism in this material is attributable to the orbital mixing between I \textit{p} and Cr \textit{e\textsubscript{g}} states. These findings reveal the microscopic connection between orbital and spin degrees of freedom, providing fundamental insights that can be readily generalized to many other low-dimensional magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Spin-split magnon bands induce pure spin current in insulating altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets offer a promising platform for dissipationless spin transport by combining zero net magnetization with spontaneous non-relativistic spin splitting. However, their magnonic transport properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we develop a quantum-kinetic theory for thermally driven magnon currents that cleanly separates Berry-curvature-driven intrinsic contributions from Drude-like scattering-dependent terms. Applying this framework to a collinear honeycomb antiferromagnet with anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, we reveal spin-split magnon bands that support both intrinsic and extrinsic spin Nernst and Seebeck currents. For realistic parameters, we predict a sizable magnon spin-splitting angle (about 3.3 degrees) and a pure transverse spin current capable of exerting a strong spin-splitter torque suitable for magnetization switching.</description>

      <title>Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with Quantic Tensor Trains: Ground States and Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a tensor network framework based on the quantic tensor train (QTT) format to efficiently solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which governs Bose-Einstein condensates under mean-field theory. By adapting time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) and gradient descent methods, we accurately handle the GPE's nonlinearities within the QTT structure. Our approach enables high-resolution simulations with drastically reduced computational cost. We benchmark ground states and dynamics of BECs--including vortex lattice formation and breathing modes--demonstrating superior performance over conventional grid-based methods and stable long-time evolution due to saturating bond dimensions. This establishes QTT as a powerful tool for nonlinear quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Signature of gate tunable superconducting network in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted van der Waals materials provide a tunable platform for investigating two-dimensional superconductivity and quantum phases. Using spectra-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we study the superconducting states in twisted bilayer graphene and track their evolution from insulating phases. Gate-dependent spectroscopic measurements reveal two distinct regimes: under-doped ({\nu} = -2.3) and optimally doped ({\nu} = -2.6). In the under-doped regime, partial superconductivity arises, forming a network interspersed with non-gapped regions. At optimal doping, the entire unit cell demonstrates superconductivity, with gap size modulation showing an anti-correlation with the local density of states. This gate-dependent transition from an insulating phase to a modulated superconductor uncovers an unexpected spatial hierarchy in pairing behavior and offers direct microscopic insights to constrain theories of superconductivity in moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of Electride-like $s$ States Coexisting with Correlated $d$ Electrons in NdNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite exhibiting a similar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band character to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates host additional electron pockets that distinguish them from single-band cuprates. The elusive orbital origin of these electron pockets has led to competing theoretical scenarios. Here, using polarization-dependent and resonant angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we determine the orbital character of the Fermi surfaces in NdNiO$_2$. Our data reveal that the electron-like pocket arises predominantly from interstitial $s$ states, with negligible contributions from rare-earth 5$d$ and 4$f$ orbitals near the Fermi level. The observation of well-defined quantum well states indicates a uniform distribution of these interstitial electrons throughout the film thickness. By comparing with electronic structure of LaNiO$_2$, we find that the rare-earth element modulates the Ni-derived bands and hopping integrals through a chemical pressure effect. These findings clarify the role of rare-earth elements in shaping the low-energy electronic structure and establish the presence of electride-like interstitial $s$ states in a correlated oxide system, where electrons occupy lattice voids rather than atomic orbitals. The electride-like character offer new insight into the self-doping and superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We distinguish between longitudinal and transverse spin excitations in the ultrafast response of iron by probing exchange splitting {\Delta}Eex and magnetic linear dichroism (MLD) in time- and angleresolved photoemission. Comparing spin-split partner bands at the Fermi level shows that {\Delta}Eex remains constant upon optical excitation. In contrast, the different MLD response of spin-orbitsplit valence bands reveals non-equilibrium, transverse spin dynamics. Magnon generation in Fe is ultrafast, electronic band specific, and drives the collapse of spin-orbit hybridization gaps.</description>

      <title>Universal Bound States in Long-range Spin Chains with an Impurity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how quasi-particles interact with impurities is crucial for unveiling novel properties of quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is the enhanced scattering between electrons and magnetic impurities in the low-energy limit, which gives rise to the Kondo effect. In this letter, motivated by recent developments in quantum simulation platforms, we investigate the universal behavior of long-range quantum spin chains with a single local impurity, focusing on systems that conserve the magnon number. Using effective field theory, we show that distinct classes of universal three-magnon states can emerge when the impurity-mediated two-magnon interaction is on resonance. When the long-range coupling decays as $1/r^\alpha$, we find that (i) for $\alpha\in (2,2.89)$, the system exhibits Efimov effects, with the three-body binding energy forming a geometric series $\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-n (\alpha-1) \pi/s_0(\alpha)$, (ii) for $\alpha=2$, the system shows semi-super Efimov effects with $\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-(n\pi-\theta)^2/8$. Our theoretical prediction is validated by the numerical solution of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian equation. Our results could be tested experimentally in the future on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-assisted charge instability in ultrathin RuO$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_2$) has been in the focus of contemporary condensed matter research as a prototypical candidate material for altermagnetism. In the face of daunting evidence for bulk magnetic order despite promising theoretical predictions, it naturally suggests the focus on thin films where Coulomb interactions are dimensionally quenched and may yield a more strongly correlated environment prone to magnetic ordering. Here, we combine scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), density functional theory (DFT), and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to investigate atomically ordered ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) grown on Ru(0001). Contrary to predictions of magnetic order, we observe a nonmagnetic charge density wave (CDW) instability that is driven by Fermi surface nesting within the flat-band surface state, and stabilized by the incommensurate moir\'e stacking with the substrate. We further identify a nonmagnetic and metastable 2 $\times$ 2 surface reconstruction that breaks in-plane mirror symmetry and can be reversibly toggled via STM tip manipulation. Our spin-polarized STM measurements find no sign of any magnetic instability at the RuO$_2$ surface. As much as our findings refute proposals for either bulk or surface magnetism in RuO$_2$, we establish ultrathin RuO$_2$(110) as an intriguing platform for exploring Moir\'e-assisted electronic surface order.</description>

      <title>Disentangling strategies and entanglement transitions in unitary circuit games with matchgates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In unitary circuit games, two competing parties, an "entangler" and a "disentangler", can induce an entanglement phase transition in a quantum many-body system. The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which we characterize both numerically and analytically.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Glass in the Two-Dimensional Disordered Heisenberg Model via Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional frustrated quantum Heisenberg model with bond disorder on nearest-neighbor couplings using the recently introduced Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States framework, which enables accurate and efficient computation of disorder-averaged observables with a single variational optimization. Simulations on large lattices reveal an extended region of the phase diagram where long-range magnetic order vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, while the overlap order parameter, which characterizes quantum spin glass states, remains finite. These findings, supported by a semiclassical analysis based on a large-spin expansion, provide compelling evidence that the spin glass phase is stable against quantum fluctuations, unlike the classical case where it disappears at any finite temperature.</description>

      <title>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the invariant operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries of a tensor product spin chain if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an on-site action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem. Using this, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exists gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain. Finally, we apply our framework to show that any state covariant under an anomalous Kramers-Wannier type duality must be gapless.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Dual Implicit Neural Representations for Source Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significant challenges exist in efficient data analysis of most advanced experimental and observational techniques because the collected signals often include unwanted contributions--such as background and signal distortions--that can obscure the physically relevant information of interest. To address this, we have developed a self-supervised machine-learning approach for source separation using a dual implicit neural representation framework that jointly trains two neural networks: one for approximating distortions of the physical signal of interest and the other for learning the effective background contribution. Our method learns directly from the raw data by minimizing a reconstruction-based loss function without requiring labeled data or pre-defined dictionaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by considering a challenging case study involving large-scale simulated as well as experimental momentum-energy-dependent inelastic neutron scattering data in a four-dimensional parameter space, characterized by heterogeneous background contributions and unknown distortions to the target signal. The method is found to successfully separate physically meaningful signals from a complex or structured background even when the signal characteristics vary across all four dimensions of the parameter space. An analytical approach that informs the choice of the regularization parameter is presented. Our method offers a versatile framework for addressing source separation problems across diverse domains, ranging from superimposed signals in astronomical measurements to structural features in biomedical image reconstructions.</description>

Abstract: A biorthonormal-block density-matrix renormalization group algorithm is proposed to accurately compute properties of large-scale non-Hermitian many-body systems, in which a renormalized-space partition of the non-Hermitian reduced density matrix is implemented to fulfill the prerequisite for the biorthonormality of the renormalization group (RG) transformation and to optimize the construction of saved Hilbert spaces. A redundancy in saved spaces of the reduced density matrix is exploited to reduce a condition number resulting from the non-unitarity of the left and right transformation matrices, in order to ensure the numerical stability of the RG procedure. The algorithm is successfully applied to an interacting fermionic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with nonreciprocal hoppings and staggered complex chemical potential, exhibiting novel many-body phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06440v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feynman diagrams are an essential tool for simulating strongly correlated electron systems. However, stochastic quantum Monte Carlo sampling suffers from the sign problem, particularly when solving a multiorbital quantum impurity model. Recently, two approaches have been proposed for efficient numerical treatment of Feynman diagrams: Tensor Cross Interpolation (TCI) to replace stochastic sampling and the Quantics Tensor Train (QTT) representation for compressing space-time dependence. One of the remaining challenges is the nontrivial task of identifying low-rank structures in weak-coupling Feynman diagrams for multiorbital electron-phonon systems. In particular, the traditional TCI algorithm faces an ergodicity problem, which prevents it from fully exploring the multiorbital space. To address this, we incorporate a new algorithm called global search, which resolves this issue. By combining this approach with QTT, we uncover low-rank structures and achieve efficient numerical integration with exponential resolution in time and faster-than-power-law convergence of error relative to computational cost. Additionally, our approach does not require the division of discontinuous regions necessary in non-quantics TCI.</description>

      <title>Thermally-induced mimicry of quantum cluster excitations and implications for the magnetic transition in FePSe$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two dimensional magnets, the interplay of thermal fluctuations and spin anisotropy control the existence of long-range magnetic order. In the van der Waals antiferromagnets FePX$_3$, orbital degeneracy in the $t2g$ levels of the Fe$^{2+}$ ions in octahedral coordination yields strong uniaxial anisotropy, which stabilizes magnetic order up to T$\approx$100 K. Recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements around the magnetic ordering transition have shown the existence of a broad spectrum of magnetic fluctuations with nontrivial momentum dependence, which has been interpreted as evidence for localized entangled cluster excitations. In this paper, we offer an alternative interpretation using classical nonlinear spin dynamics simulations. We present stochastic Landau Lifshitz dynamics simulations that reproduce the neutron scattering measurements of Chen et al. [npj Quantum Mater. 9, 40 (2024)] on FePSe$_3$. These calculations faithfully explain the dynamical structure factor's momentum and energy dependence and point to a classical origin for the excitations observed in neutron spectroscopy and that the order-disorder transition can be understood in terms of thermal fluctuations overcoming the anisotropy energy.</description>

      <title>Left-left-right-right magnetic order in spin-1/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg chain</title>

Abstract: In this work, we perform a combination of analytical and numerical studies on the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Heisenberg chain in the region of negative Kitaev and positive Heisenberg couplings. Apart from the antiferromagnetic phase, we find a magnetically ordered phase with left-left-right-right order and a gapless phase with central charge value $c=1$, resolving the existing contradictory results in literature regarding this parameter region. In particular, the origin of the left-left-right-right order is clarified based on a perturbative Luttinger liquid analysis. The left-left-right-right phase is further shown to persist in the Kitaev-Heisenberg-Gamma model when a small nonzero Gamma interaction is introduced. Using a coupled-chain method, we also demonstrate that the one-dimensional (1D) left-left-right-right order gives a quasi-1D explanation for the 2D stripy order of the same model on the honeycomb lattice.</description>

      <title>Large-$N$ SU(4) Schwinger boson theory for coupled-dimer antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic large-$N$ expansion based on the Schwinger boson representation of SU(4) coherent states of dimers for the paradigmatic spin-$1/2$ bilayer square lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet. This system exhibits a quantum phase transition between a quantum paramagnetic state and a N\'eel order state, driven by the coupling constant $g = J'/J$, which is defined as the ratio between the inter-dimer $J'$ and intra-dimer $J$ exchange interactions. We demonstrate that this approach accurately describes static and dynamic properties on both sides of the quantum phase transition. The critical coupling constant $g_c \approx 0.42$ and the dynamic spin structure factor reproduce quantum Monte Carlo results with high precision. Notably, the $1/N$ corrections reveal the longitudinal mode of the magnetically ordered phase along with the overdamping caused by its decay into the two-magnon continuum. The present large-$N$ $SU(N)$ Schwinger boson theory can be extended to more general cases of quantum paramagnets that undergo a quantum phase transition into magnetically ordered states.</description>

      <title>Evidence for valence-bond pairing in a one-dimensional two-orbital system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valence bond (VB) states as the formation mechanism of Cooper pairs, eventually leading to high-temperature superconductivity, remain a controversial topic. Although various VB-like states find variational relevance in the description of specific spin models and quantum spin liquids, in the realm of many-body fermionic Hamiltonians, the evidence for such states as ground states wave functions remains elusive, challenging the valence-bond pairing mechanism. Here, we present evidence of a VB ground state with pairing tendencies, particularly at finite doping. We achieved this for the generic two-orbital Hubbard model in low dimension, where the VB states can be associated with the presence of the topological order manifested by edge states.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic linear Edelstein effect in helical EuIn2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the ongoing interest in understanding the actual magnetic ground state of the promising axion insulator candidate EuIn2As2, we present here a spin symmetry analysis and ab-initio calculations, aiming to identify specific exchange-dominated physics that could offer insights into the current debate. We investigate two non-collinear coplanar magnetic orders reported in this compound: the helical and broken helical phases. Our symmetry analysis shows that magnetic-exchange alone results in the formation of an out-of-plane odd-wave order in momentum space with a single un-polarized nodal plane in both phases. Additionally, we identified an in-plane g-wave order that emerges exclusively in the broken helical phase, providing a distinguishing feature for this phase. Furthermore, we report a non-relativistic Edelstein effect with a distinct out-of-plane polarized spin density that dominates over spin-orbit coupling effects. Our ab-initio calculations reveal a significant contrast in the magnitude of this effect between both phases, which could serve as a means to identify the magnetic transition and distinguish them from other magnetic ground states proposed for this compound.</description>

      <title>Field-Induced Magnon Decay, Magnon Shadows, and Roton-like Excitations in the Honeycomb Antiferromagnet YbBr$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the search for quantum many-body phenomena in magnetic materials has a strong focus on highly frustrated systems, even unfrustrated quantum magnets show a multitude of unconventional phenomena in their spin excitation spectra. YbBr$_3$ is an excellent realization of the $S = 1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice, and we have performed detailed spectroscopic experiments with both unpolarized and polarized neutrons at all applied magnetic fields up to saturation. We observe extensive excitation continua, which cause strong renormalization and the decay of single magnons at higher fields, while coherent features include field-induced ``shadows'' of the single magnons and the spectacular emergence of a roton-like excitation. To guide and interpret our experiments, we performed systematic calculations by the method of cylinder matrix-product states that provide quantitative agreement with the neutron scattering data and a qualitative benchmark for the spectral signatures of strong quantum fluctuations even in the absence of magnetic frustration.</description>

      <title>Thermal Quench Dynamics of Visons in Gapless Kitaev Spin Liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relaxation dynamics of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a thermal quench is dominated by the quasi-stochastic diffusion and pair annihilation of visions, which are gapped flux excitations of an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field of the Kitaev spin liquid. Both the diffusion energy barrier as well as the effective interactions between visons are mediated by the Majorana fermions which are fractionalized quasiparticles of the spin liquid. Through extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the interplay between the thermal diffusion and nonlocal multi-vision interactions leads to a variety of temperature-dependent dynamical behaviors ranging from diffusion-limited and terminal-velocity-limited annihilation to dynamical arresting and freezing. Notably, we show that the freezing phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of metastable $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ vison crystals and a hidden coarsening of super-clusters associated with a broken $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier--phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier--phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the general explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring appropriate hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05055).</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper (arXiv:2501.05054), we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side on timescales comparable to the phonon period. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum--classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</description>

      <title>Local signatures of altermagnetism</title>

Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a class of collinear compensated N\'eel ordered magnets that break time-reversal symmetry and feature spin-split band structures. Based on versatile microscopic models able to capture the altermagnetic sublattice degrees of freedom, we study characteristic local signatures of altermagnetism near disorder sites. We give a complete list of two-dimensional models that exhibit altermagnetism classified by their corresponding layer groups. Specifically, we calculate the local density of states in the vicinity of pointlike nonmagnetic impurities and expose its spatial dependence for two minimal models showcasing $d$-wave and $g$-wave altermagnetism. The momentum structure of the nodes ($d$-wave, $g$-wave, etc.) is directly imprinted on the total local density of states, thus measurable by scanning tunneling conductance experiments. This signature is present both in the spin-resolved as well as the spin-summed local density of states. We find a weaker response in the nonmagnetic state from the anisotropic crystal environment and uncover the importance of the sublattice degree of freedom to model altermagnets. We also study coexistence phases of altermagnetism and superconductivity and provide predictions for the local impurity response of in-gap bound states. The response of impurity bound states strongly enhances the distinct altermagnetic signature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a class of lattice $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum Hamiltonians with bond-dependent Ising couplings and a mutually {\guillemotleft}anticommuting{\guillemotright} algebra of extensively many local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ conserved charges that was explicated in [arXiv:2407.06236]. This mutual algebra is reminiscent of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Pauli matrix algebra but encoded in the structure of \emph{local conserved charges}. These models have finite residual entropy density in the ground state with a simple but non-trivial degeneracy counting and concomitant quantum spin liquidity as proved in [arXiv:2407.06236]. The spin liquidity relies on a geometrically site-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that is rather natural in presence of an {\guillemotleft}anticommuting{\guillemotright} structure, as opposed to for example the bond-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ hexagonal plaquette charges of the Kitaev honeycomb spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ model which leads to a mutually commuting local algebra.
  In this work, we make several exact statements on the many-body order that can be present within the class of {\guillemotleft}anticommuting{\guillemotright} quantum spin liquids. We elucidate the differences between the many-body order in these models and that found in some gapped quantum spin liquids with mutually commuting local algebras, e.g. the Kitaev toric code or Levin-Wen models. We also point out a mutually commuting algebra with local support that are naturally expressed as multi-linear Majorana forms in the Kitaev representation of these quantum spin liquids. They capture non-trivial quantum resonances throughout the lattice in these {\guillemotleft}anticommuting{\guillemotright} $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex chalcogenides in the $M$PS$_3$ family of materials ($M$ = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) display remarkably different phase progressions depending upon the metal center orbital filling, character of the P-P linkage, and size of the van der Waals gap. There is also a stacking pattern and spin state difference between the lighter and heavier transition metal-containing systems that places CoPS$_3$ at the nexus of these activities. Despite these unique properties, this compound is under-explored. Here, we bring together Raman scattering spectroscopy and infrared absorption spectroscopy with X-ray techniques to identify a structural component to the 119 K magnetic ordering transition as well as a remarkable lower temperature set of magnon-phonon pairs that engage in avoided crossings along with a magnetic scattering continuum that correlates with phonon lifetime effects. These findings point to strong spin-phonon entanglement as well as opportunities to control these effects under external stimuli.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, based on the off-diagonal wave function variational Monte Carlo method. We use an optimized wave function that is improved from an initial one-body wave function by multiplying by multiple correlation operators that are given by the form of exp($-S$)-type where $S$ is a suitable operator. We examine the inhomogeneous ground state at near 1/8 doping in the strongly correlated region where the on-site Coulomb interaction is larger than the bandwidth. The $d$-wave superconductivity with a spatially oscillating gap function can coexist with the charge ordering in the ground state without magnetic ordering, and superconducting condensation energy increases by this coexistence. We also show the $d$-wave pair correlation function as a function of lattice sites. The correlation function indicates that the long-range superconducting order indeed exists, and also that the strong electron correlation suppresses the pair correlation function.</description>

      <title>Spin Seebeck Effect of Triangular-lattice Spin Supersolid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the developed thermal tensor-network approach, we investigate the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) of the triangular-lattice quantum antiferromagnet hosting spin supersolid phase. We focus on the low-temperature scaling behaviors of the normalized spin current across the interface. Using the 1D Heisenberg chain as a benchmark system, we observe a negative spinon spin current exhibiting algebraic scaling $T^{\alpha}$, with exponent $\alpha$, in the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase. On the triangular lattice, spin frustration dramatically enhances the low-temperature SSE, with distinct spin-current signatures - particularly the sign reversal and characteristic temperature dependence - distinguishing different spin states. Remarkably, we discover a persistent, negative spin current in the spin supersolid phase. It saturates to a non-zero value in the low-temperature limit, and can be ascribed to the Goldstone-mode-mediated spin supercurrents. Moreover, a universal scaling $T^{d/z}$ is found at the U(1)-symmetric polarization quantum critical points. These distinct quantum spin transport traits provide sensitive probes for spin-supersolid compounds such as Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$. Furthermore, our results establish spin supersolids as a tunable quantum platform for spin caloritronics in the ultralow-temperature regime.</description>

However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine Structure of Quantum Entanglement</title>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent advantages and limitations. In this work, we introduce the hyperfine structure of entanglement, which decomposes entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases, especially topological gapped state and trivial gapped state. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhanced Sensitivity through Many-Body Bloch Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13921v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on the resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from quantum-enhanced scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes. This is due to the induced localization by increasing the interaction between the excitations. We show that a simple particle configuration measurement together with a maximum likelihood estimation can closely reach the ultimate precision limit in both single- and multi-particle probes.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from spin-canting fluctuations in rhombohedral graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports soft magnon modes. In particular, we show that these soft modes can mediate pairing through inter-band scattering events that are symmetry-forbidden in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, thus providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</description>

      <title>Pair Density Waves and Supercurrent Diode Effect in Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metallic altermagnets are unusual collinear magnets that feature zero net magnetization with momentum-dependent spin splitting. Here, we show that this spin splitting can induce pair density wave states even in the absence of external magnetic fields. Focusing on BCS-type attractive interactions, we find the stabilization of symmetrically distinct pair density wave states depending on the chemical potential. These states include Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states, both of which break inversion symmetry. We investigate the supercurrent properties and discover non-reciprocal supercurrents for both the Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states with distinct spatial dependencies. We propose that the supercurrent diode effect can serve as an experimental tool for distinguishing between different pair density waves in metallic altermagnets and discuss the relation to material candidates.</description>

      <title>Periodic classical trajectories and quantum scars in many-spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</description>

      <title>Observation of disorder-free localization using a (2+1)D lattice gauge theory on a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disorder-induced phenomena in quantum many-body systems pose significant challenges for analytical methods and numerical simulations at relevant time and system scales. To reduce the cost of disorder-sampling, we investigate quantum circuits initialized in states tunable to superpositions over all disorder configurations. In a translationally-invariant lattice gauge theory (LGT), these states can be interpreted as a superposition over gauge sectors. We observe localization in this LGT in the absence of disorder in one and two dimensions: perturbations fail to diffuse despite fully disorder-free evolution and initial states. However, R\'enyi entropy measurements reveal that superposition-prepared states fundamentally differ from those obtained by direct disorder sampling. Leveraging superposition, we propose an algorithm with a polynomial speedup in sampling disorder configurations, a longstanding challenge in many-body localization studies.</description>

      <title>A Universal Circuit Set Using the $S_3$ Quantum Double</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One potential route toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computation is to use non-Abelian topological codes. In this work, we investigate how to achieve this goal with the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ -- a specific non-Abelian topological code. By embedding each on-site Hilbert space into a qubit-qutrit pair, we give an explicit construction of the circuits for creating, moving, and locally measuring all non-trivial anyons. We also design a specialized anyon interferometer to remotely measure the total charge of well-separated anyons; this avoids fusion, which would compromise fault tolerance. These protocols enable the implementation of a universal gate set proposed by Cui et al. and active quantum error correction of the circuit-level noise during the computation process. To further reduce the error rate and facilitate error correction, we encode each physical degree of freedom of $\mathcal{D}(S_3)$ into a novel, quantum, error-correcting code, enabling fault-tolerant realization, at the logical level, of all gates in the anyon manipulation circuits. Our proposal offers a promising path to realize robust universal topological quantum computation in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Universal approach to light driven "superconductivity" via preformed pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there are many different mechanisms which have been proposed to understand the physics behind light induced ``superconductivity", what seems to be common to the class of materials in which this is observed are strong pairing correlations, which are present in the normal state. Here we argue, that the original ideas of Eliashberg are applicable to such a pseudogap phase and that with exposure to radiation the fermions are redistributed to higher energies where they are less deleterious to pairing. What results then is a photo-induced state with dramatically enhanced number of nearly condensed fermion pairs. In this phase, because the a.c. conductivity, $\sigma(\omega) = \sigma_1(\omega) + i \sigma_2(\omega)$, is dominated by the bosonic contribution, it can be computed using conventional (Aslamazov Larkin) fluctuation theory. We, thereby, observe the expected fingerprint of this photoinduced ``superconducting" state which is a $1/\omega$ dependence in $\sigma_2$ with fits to the data of the same quality as found for the so-called photo-enhanced (Drude) conductivity scenario. Here, however, we have a microscopic understanding of the characteristic low energy scale which appears in transport and which is necessarily temperature dependent. This approach also provides insight into recent observations of concomitant diamagnetic fluctuations. Our calculations suggest that the observed light-induced phase in these strongly paired superconductors has only short range phase coherence without long range superconducting order.</description>

      <title>Classical Fractons: Local chaos, global broken ergodicity and an arrow of time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report new results on classical nonrelativistic dipole conserving particles - fractons. These have been previously shown to exhibit "Machian" dynamics where the motion of one particle requires the presence of others in its proximity, such that dynamics produces ergodicity breaking steady states characterized by clusters. In this work, we show that although the global state breaks ergodicity, a limited version of ergodic behavior is retained within the clusters which may or may not be chaotic, depending on the nature of the microscopic Hamiltonian. In certain cases, we show that the dynamics can be mapped to that of a billiards particle in various stadiums. We also show that the many-fracton trajectories characteristically exhibit a central time or "Janus point" and thus a generic nonequilibrium bidirectional arrow of time.</description>

Abstract: Fractons, excitations with restricted mobility, have emerged as a novel paradigm in high-energy and condensed matter physics, revealing deep connections to gauge theories and gravity. Here, we propose a tensorial generalization of electromagnetic duality using a doubled-potential framework with two symmetric tensor gauge fields. This approach symmetrically describes electric and magnetic sectors, introducing covariant magnetic fractons with reduced mobility and supporting a genuine fractonic self-duality. Notably, we find the absence of a Witten-like effect in the covariant fractonic case, precluding the emergence of fractonic dyons.</description>

      <title>Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.</description>

Abstract: Although high-threshold and low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, such as bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, can reduce the physical-qubit cost by an order of magnitude compared to the Kitaev toric code, their torus layout remains difficult for physical implementation. In this work, we introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully planar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present planar code families with logical dimensions $k=6\sim13$, e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically local weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a $[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of magnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary anyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding high-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware architectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose distance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC codes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold fault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic two-dimensional hardware.</description>

      <title>Spin and energy diffusion vs. subdiffusion in disordered spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the high-temperature spin diffusion in spin chains with random local fields has been the subject of numerous studies concerning the phenomenon of many-body localization (MBL), the energy diffusion in the same models has been much less explored. We demonstrate that energy diffusion is faster at weak random fields but becomes essentially equal at strong fields; hence, both diffusions determine the slowest relaxation time scale (Thouless time) in the system. Numerically reachable finite-size systems reveal the anomalously large distribution of diffusion constants with respect to actual field configurations. Despite the exponential-like dependence of diffusion on field strength, the results for sensitivity to twisted boundary conditions are incompatible with the Thouless criterion for localization and the presumed transition to MBL, at least for numerically reachable sizes. In contrast, we find indications of the scenario of subdiffusive transport, particularly in the dynamical diffusivity response.</description>

      <title>One dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with long range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting one-dimensional bosons with long range hopping decaying as a power law $r^{-\alpha}$ with distance $r$ are considered with the renormalization group and the self-consistent harmonic approximation. For $\alpha\ge 3$, the ground state is always a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, whereas for $\alpha &lt;3$, a ground state with long range order breaking the continuous global gauge symmetry becomes possible for sufficiently weak repulsion. At positive temperature, continuous symmetry breaking becomes restricted to $\alpha&lt;2$, and for $2&lt;\alpha&lt;3$, a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with the Tomonaga-Luttinger exponent diverging at low temperature is found.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnets via spin torque exerted by photocurrent of excitons: Signatures in charge pumping and THz emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's function (TDNEF) for electrons driven by fsLP are coupled self-consistently to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductor. This theory explains how fsLP, of central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a {\em nonequilibrium spintronic mechanism}. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) decodes frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by {\em nonlocal} damping with the LLG equation due to, explicitly included via TDNEGF, electronic bath. The TDNEGF part of the loop is also used to include excitons via mean-field treatment, utilizing off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, of Coulomb interaction binding conduction-band electrons and valence-band holes. Finally, our theory predicts how excited magnons will {\em pump} time-dependent charge currents into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor that will then emit electromagnetic radiation. The windowed FFT of these signals contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</description>
