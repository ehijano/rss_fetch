      <title>On the definition and importance of interpretability in scientific machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though neural networks trained on large data sets have been successfully used to describe and predict many physical phenomena, there is a sense among scientists that, unlike traditional scientific models, where relationships come packaged in the form of simple mathematical expressions, the findings of the neural network cannot be integrated into the body of scientific knowledge. Critics of ML's inability to produce human-understandable relationships have converged on the concept of "interpretability" as its point of departure from more traditional forms of science. As the growing interest in interpretability has shown, researchers in the physical sciences seek not just predictive models, but also to uncover the fundamental principles that govern a system of interest. However, clarity around a definition of interpretability and the precise role that it plays in science is lacking in the literature. In this work, we argue that researchers in equation discovery and symbolic regression tend to conflate the concept of sparsity with interpretability. We review key papers on interpretable ML from outside the scientific community and argue that, though the definitions and methods they propose can inform questions of interpretability for SciML, they are inadequate for this new purpose. Noting these deficiencies, we propose an operational definition of interpretability for the physical sciences. Our notion of interpretability emphasizes understanding of the mechanism over mathematical sparsity. Innocuous though it may seem, this emphasis on mechanism shows that sparsity is often unnecessary. It also questions the possibility of interpretable scientific discovery when prior knowledge is lacking. We believe a precise and philosophically informed definition of interpretability in SciML will help focus research efforts toward the most significant obstacles to realizing a data-driven scientific future.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Collapse of the Wavefunction: A Testable Proposal Motivated by Discrete Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A modified form of quantum mechanics which includes a new mechanism for wavefunction collapse is proposed. The collapse provides a solution to the quantum measurement problem. This modified quantum mechanics is shown to arise naturally from a fully discrete physics, where all physical quantities are discrete rather than continuous. We compare the theory to the spontaneous collapse theories of Ghirardi, Rimini, Weber and Pearle, and argue that the new theory lends itself well to a realist interpretation of the wavefunction.</description>

      <title>The non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering of a nucleon beam around a cylinder containing a non-Abelian flux is studied. We confirm all the previsions of Wu and Yang. We consider the generalization to the gauge group $SU(N)$, and derive a classification scheme. Isospin precession is recovered also at the classical limit.</description>

      <title>Reproducing EPR correlations without superluminal signalling: backward conditional probabilities and Statistical Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bell's theorem states that no model that respects Local Causality and Statistical Independence can account for the correlations predicted by quantum mechanics via entangled states. This paper proposes a new approach, using backward-in-time conditional probabilities, which relaxes conventional assumptions of temporal ordering while preserving Statistical Independence as a "fine-tuning condition. It is shown how such models can account for EPR/Bell correlations and, analogously, the GHZ predictions while nevertheless forbidding superluminal signalling.</description>
