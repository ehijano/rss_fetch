      <title>Ambiguous Persuasion: An Ex-Ante Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.05376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a persuasion game where both the sender and receiver are ambiguity averse with maxmin expected utility (MEU) preferences and the sender can choose an ambiguous information structure. This paper analyzes the game in an ex-ante formulation: the sender first commits to an information structure, and then the receiver best responds by choosing an ex-ante message-contingent action plan. Under this formulation, I show it is never strictly beneficial for the sender to use an ambiguous information structure as opposed to a standard unambiguous one. This result is robust to (i) both players having (possibly heterogeneous) ambiguous beliefs over the states, and/or (ii) the receiver having non-MEU, uncertainty-averse preferences. However, it is \emph{not} robust to the sender having non-MEU preferences.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Value of Monitoring Structures in Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies how improved monitoring affects the limit equilibrium payoff set for stochastic games with imperfect public monitoring. We introduce a simple generalization of Blackwell garbling called weighted garbling in order to compare different monitoring structures for this class of games. Our main result is the monotonicity of the limit perfect public equilibrium (PPE) payoff set with respect to this information order. We show that the limit PPE payoff set expands when the monitoring structure gets more informative with respect to the weighted garbling order. We also show that a similar monotonicity holds for strongly symmetric equilibrium for symmetric stochastic games. Finally, we show that our weighted garbling order is useful to compare the limit PPE payoff set for different state transition laws and monitoring structures when the limit feasible payoff set is the same.</description>

      <title>Efficient Major Transition Exchange under Distributional and Dual Priority-respecting Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real matching markets encounter distributional and fairness constraints. Motivated by the Chinese Major Transition Program (CMT), this paper studies the design of exchange mechanisms within a fresh framework of both distributional and dual priority-respecting constraints. Specifically, each student has an initial assigned major and applies to transfer to a more desirable one. A student can successfully transfer majors only if they obtain eligibility from both their initial major and the applied major. Each major has a dual priority: a strict priority over current students who wish to transfer out and a strict priority over students from other majors who wish to transfer in. Additionally, each major faces a ceiling constraint and a floor constraint to regulate student distribution. We show that the existing mechanisms of CMT result in avoidable inefficiencies, and propose two mechanisms that can match students to majors in an efficient way as well as respecting each major's distributional and dual priority. The efficient mechanisms are based on a proposed solution concept: eligibility maximization (EM), and two processes for identifying improvement cycles--specifically, transfer-in exchangeable cycles and transfer-out exchangeable cycles.</description>

      <title>Numerical Representation of Preferences over Random Availability Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We interpret a fuzzy set as a random availability function and provide sufficient conditions under which a preference relation over the set of all random availability functions can be represented by a utility function.</description>
