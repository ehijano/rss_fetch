      <title>Selective tracking of charge carrier dynamics in CuInS2 quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CuInS2 quantum dots have been studied in a broad range of applications, but despite this, the fine details of their charge carrier dynamics remain a subject of intense debate. Two of the most relevant points of discussion are the hole dynamics and the influence of Cu:In synthesis stoichiometry on them. It has been proposed that Cu-deficiency leads to the formation of Cu2+, affecting the localization of holes into Cu defects. Importantly, it is precisely these confined hole states which are used to explain the interesting photoluminescence properties of CuInS2 quantum dots. We use static X-ray spectroscopy to reveal no evidence for a measurable amount of native Cu2+ states in Cu-deficient samples. Instead, the improved properties of these samples are explained by an increase of crystallinity, reducing the concentration of mid gap states. Furthermore, to understand the charge carrier dynamics, herein we employ ultrafast optical transient absorption, and fluorescence up-conversion spectroscopies in combination with ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy using a hard X-ray free electron laser. We demonstrate that in non-passivated samples, holes are transferred from Cu atoms in sub-picosecond timescales. We assign this transfer to occur towards the thiol-based ligands. Finally, we observe that Cu-deficient samples are more robust against the photothermal heating effects of using higher laser fluences. This is not the case for the stoichiometric sample, where heating effects on the structure are directly observed.</description>

      <title>Chemical potential of the warm dense electron gas from ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present extensive new \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulation results for the chemical potential of the warm dense uniform electron gas (UEG), spanning a broad range of densities and temperatures. This is achieved by following two independent routes, i) based on the direct estimation of the free energy [Dornheim \emph{et al.}, arXiv:2407.01044] and ii) using a histogram estimator in PIMC simulations with a varying number of particles. We empirically confirm the expected inverse linear dependence of the exchange--correlation (XC) part of the chemical potential on the simulated number of electrons, which allows for a reliable extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit without the necessity for an additional finite-size correction. We find very good agreement (within $\Delta\mu_\textnormal{xc}\lesssim0.5\%$) with the previous parametrization of the XC-free energy by Groth \emph{et al.}~[\emph{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{119}, 135001 (2017)], which constitutes an important cross validation of current state-of-the-art UEG equations of state. In addition to being interesting in its own right, our study constitutes the basis for the future PIMC based investigation of the chemical potential of real warm dense matter systems starting with hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Time-reversible implementation of MASH for efficient nonadiabatic molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we describe various improved implementations of the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) for simulating nonadiabatic dynamics. These include time-reversible and piecewise-continuous integrators, which is only formally possible because of the deterministic nature of the underlying MASH equations of motion. The new algorithms allow for the use of either wave-function overlaps or nonadiabatic coupling vectors to propagate the spin, which encodes the electronic state. For a given time-step, $\Delta t$, it is demonstrated that the global error for these methods is $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)$ compared to the $\mathcal{O}(\Delta t)$ error of standard implementations. This allows larger time-steps to be used for a desired error tolerance, or conversely, more accurate observables given a fixed value of $\Delta t$. The newly developed integrators thus provide further advantages for the MASH method, demonstrating that it can be implemented more efficiently than other surface-hopping approaches, which cannot construct time-reversible integrators due to their stochastic nature.</description>

      <title>Surface Modification and Subsequent Fermi Density Enhancement of Bi(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects introduced to the surface of Bi(111) break the translational symmetry and modify the surface states locally. We present a theoretical and experimental study of the 2D defects on the surface of Bi(111) and the states that they induce. Bi crystals cleaved in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) at low temperature (110 K) and the resulting ion-etched surface are investigated by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) as well as spectroscopy (STS) techniques in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. STS measurements of cleaved Bi(111) reveal that a commonly observed bilayer step edge has a lower density of states (DOS) around the Fermi level as compared to the atomic-flat terrace. Following ion bombardment, the Bi(111) surface reveals anomalous behavior at both 110 and 300 K: Surface periodicity is observed by LEED, and a significant increase in the number of bilayer step edges and energetically unfavorable monolayer steps is observed by STM. It is suggested that the newly exposed monolayer steps and the type A bilayer step edges result in an increase to the surface Fermi density as evidenced by UPS measurements and the Kohn-Sham DOS. These states appear to be thermodynamically stable under UHV conditions.</description>

      <title>Network-forming phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes forming coacervates in a solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of coacervates through phase separation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PEs) is critical for understanding biological condensates and developing responsive materials. Traditionally, coacervates are viewed as spherical droplets with growth dynamics resembling liquid-liquid phase separation. However, our fluid particle dynamics simulations incorporating hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions challenge this perspective. Here, we find that oppositely charged PEs form a percolated network even in semi-dilute solutions, coarsening with a unique growth law, $\ell \propto t^{1/2}$. This self-similarity, absent for neutral polymers in poor solvents, arises because PEs in good solvents exhibit weaker, longer-range attractions due to spatial charge inhomogeneity under global charge neutrality. This results in a lower density of the PEs-rich phase and reduced interfacial tension. Increased charge asymmetry further slows network coarsening. Additionally, coacervate droplets initially display irregular shapes due to weak interfacial tension, transitioning slowly to spherical forms. Our research provides new insights into coacervate morphology and coarsening dynamics.</description>

      <title>Core excitations of uranyl in Cs$_{2}$UO$_{2}$Cl$_{4}$ from relativistic embedded damped-response time-dependent density functional theory calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray spectroscopies, by their high selectivity and sensitivity to the chemical environment around the atoms probed, provide significant insight into the electronic structure of molecules and materials. Interpreting experimental results requires reliable theoretical models, accounting for environment, relativistic, electron correlation, and orbital relaxation effects in a balanced manner. In this work, we present a protocol for the simulation of core excited spectra with damped response time-dependent density functional theory based on the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian (4c-DR-TD-DFT), in which environment effects are accounted for through the frozen density embedding (FDE) method. We showcase this approach for the uranium M$_4$-, L$_3$-edge and oxygen K-edge of uranyl tetrachloride (UO$_2$Cl$_4^{2-}$) unit as found in a host Cs$_{2}$UO$_{2}$Cl$_{4}$ crystal. We have found that the 4c-DR-TD-DFT simulations yield excitation spectra that very closely match the experiment for the uranium M$_4$- and oxygen K-edges, with good agreement for the broad experimental spectra for the L$_3$-edge. By decomposing the complex polarizability in terms of its components we have been able to correlate our results with angle-resolved spectra. We have observed that for all edges, but in particular the uranium M$_4$-edge, an embedded model in which the chloride ligands are replaced by an embedding potential, reproduces rather well the spectral profile obtained for UO$_2$Cl$_4^{2-}$. Our results underscore the importance of the equatorial ligands to simulating core spectra at both uranium and oxygen edges.</description>

      <title>A versatile and transportable endstation for controlled molecule experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a new versatile transportable endstation for controlled molecule (eCOMO) experiments providing a combination of molecular beam purification by electrostatic deflection and simultaneous ion and electron detection using velocity-map imaging (VMI). The $b$-type electrostatic deflector provides spatial dispersion of species based on their effective-dipole-moment-to-mass ratio. This enables selective investigation of molecular rotational quantum states, conformers, and molecular clusters. Furthermore, the double-sided VMI spectrometer equipped with two high-temporal-resolution event-driven Timepix3 cameras provides detection of all generated ions independently of their mass-over-charge ratio and electrons. To demonstrate the potential of this novel apparatus, we present experimental results from our investigation of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) after ionization. Specifically, we provide the characterization of the molecular beam, electrostatic deflector, and electron- and ion-VMI spectrometer. The eCOMO endstation delivers a platform for ultrafast dynamics studies using a wide range of light sources from table-top lasers to free-electron-laser and synchrotron-radiation facilities. This makes it suitable for research activities spanning from atomic, molecular, and cluster physics, over energy science and chemistry, to structural biology.</description>

      <title>Excited-State-Specific Kohn-Sham Formalism for the Asymmetric Hubbard Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on our recent study [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02052, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 14, 8780 (2023)], we explore the generalization of the ground-state Kohn-Sham (KS) formalism of density-functional theory (DFT) to the (singlet) excited states of the asymmetric Hubbard dimer at half-filling. While we found that the KS-DFT framework can be straightforwardly generalized to the highest-lying doubly-excited state, the treatment of the first excited state presents significant challenges. Specifically, using a density-fixed adiabatic connection, we show that the density of the first excited state lacks non-interacting $v$-representability. However, by employing an analytic continuation of the adiabatic path, we demonstrate that the density of the first excited state can be generated by a complex-valued external potential in the non-interacting case. More practically, by performing state-specific KS calculations with exact and approximate correlation functionals -- each state possessing a distinct correlation functional -- we observe that spurious stationary solutions of the KS equations may arise due to the approximate nature of the functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the spectroscopy of the 14 lowest excited electronic states in the radioactive molecule radium monofluoride (RaF). The observed excitation energies are compared with fully relativistic state-of-the-art Fock-space coupled cluster (FS-RCC) calculations, which achieve an agreement of &gt;=99.64% (within ~12 meV) with experiment for all states. Guided by theory, a firm assignment of the angular momentum and term symbol is made for 10 states and a tentative assignment for 4 states. The role of high-order electron correlation and quantum electrodynamics effects in the excitation energy of excited states is studied, found to be important for all states. Establishing the simultaneous accuracy and precision of calculations is an important step for research at the intersection of particle, nuclear, and chemical physics, including searches of physics beyond the Standard Model, for which RaF is a promising probe.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Denoising to Non-Equilibrium Structures Improves Equivariant Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions of atoms such as forces in 3D atomistic systems is fundamental to many applications like molecular dynamics and catalyst design. However, simulating these interactions requires compute-intensive ab initio calculations and thus results in limited data for training neural networks. In this paper, we propose to use denoising non-equilibrium structures (DeNS) as an auxiliary task to better leverage training data and improve performance. For training with DeNS, we first corrupt a 3D structure by adding noise to its 3D coordinates and then predict the noise. Different from previous works on denoising, which are limited to equilibrium structures, the proposed method generalizes denoising to a much larger set of non-equilibrium structures. The main difference is that a non-equilibrium structure does not correspond to local energy minima and has non-zero forces, and therefore it can have many possible atomic positions compared to an equilibrium structure. This makes denoising non-equilibrium structures an ill-posed problem since the target of denoising is not uniquely defined. Our key insight is to additionally encode the forces of the original non-equilibrium structure to specify which non-equilibrium structure we are denoising. Concretely, given a corrupted non-equilibrium structure and the forces of the original one, we predict the non-equilibrium structure satisfying the input forces instead of any arbitrary structures. Since DeNS requires encoding forces, DeNS favors equivariant networks, which can easily incorporate forces and other higher-order tensors in node embeddings. We study the effectiveness of training equivariant networks with DeNS on OC20, OC22 and MD17 datasets and demonstrate that DeNS can achieve new state-of-the-art results on OC20 and OC22 and significantly improve training efficiency on MD17.</description>
