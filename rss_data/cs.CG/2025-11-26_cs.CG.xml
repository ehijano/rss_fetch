      <title>On Compaction and Realizability of Almost Convex Octilinear Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Octilinear graph drawings are a standard paradigm extending the orthogonal graph drawing style by two additional slopes (+1 and -1). We are interested in two constrained drawing problems where the input specifies a so-called representation, that is: a planar embedding; the angles occurring between adjacent edges; the bends along each edge. In Orthogonal Realizability one is asked to compute any orthogonal drawing satisfying the constraints, while in Orthogonal Compaction the goal is to find such a drawing using minimum area. While Orthogonal Realizability can be solved in linear time, Orthogonal Compaction is NP-hard even if the graph is a cycle. In contrast, already Octilinear Realizability is known to be NP-hard. In this paper we investigate Octilinear Realizability and Octilinear Compaction problems. We prove that Octilinear Realizability remains NP-hard if at most one face is not convex or if each interior face has at most 8 reflex corners. We also strengthen the hardness proof of Octilinear Compaction, showing that Octilinear Compaction does not admit a PTAS even if the representation has no reflex corner except at most 4 incident to the external face. On the positive side, we prove that Octilinear Realizability is FPT in the number of reflex corners and for Octilinear Compaction we describe an XP algorithm on the number of edges represented with a +1 or -1 slope segment (i.e., the diagonals), again for the case where the representation has no reflex corner except at most 4 incident to the external face.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Computing Continuous Dynamic Time Warping in 2D under Different Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous Dynamic Time Warping (CDTW) measures the similarity of polygonal curves robustly to outliers and to sampling rates, but the design and analysis of CDTW algorithms face multiple challenges. We show that CDTW cannot be computed exactly under the Euclidean 2-norm using only algebraic operations, and we give an exact algorithm for CDTW under norms approximating the 2-norm. The latter result relies on technical fundamentals that we establish, and which generalise to any norm and to related measures such as the partial Fr\'echet similarity.</description>

      <title>LINSCAN -- A Linearity Based Clustering Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DBSCAN and OPTICS are powerful algorithms for identifying clusters of points in domains where few assumptions can be made about the structure of the data. In this paper, we leverage these strengths and introduce a new algorithm, LINSCAN, designed to seek lineated clusters that are difficult to find and isolate with existing methods. In particular, by embedding points as normal distributions approximating their local neighborhoods and leveraging a distance function derived from the Kullback Leibler Divergence, LINSCAN can detect and distinguish lineated clusters that are spatially close but have orthogonal covariances. We demonstrate how LINSCAN can be applied to seismic data to identify active faults, including intersecting faults, and determine their orientation. Finally, we discuss the properties a generalization of DBSCAN and OPTICS must have in order to retain the stability benefits of these algorithms.</description>

      <title>SCNode: Spatial and Contextual Coordinates for Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective node representation lies at the heart of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), as it directly impacts their ability to perform downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Most existing GNNs, particularly message passing graph neural networks, rely on neighborhood aggregation to iteratively compute node embeddings. While powerful, this paradigm suffers from well-known limitations of oversquashing, oversmoothing, and underreaching that degrade representation quality. More critically, MPGNNs often assume homophily, where connected nodes share similar features or labels, leading to poor generalization in heterophilic graphs where this assumption breaks down.
  To address these challenges, we propose \textit{SCNode}, a \textit{Spatial-Contextual Node Embedding} framework designed to perform consistently well in both homophilic and heterophilic settings. SCNode integrates spatial and contextual information, yielding node embeddings that are not only more discriminative but also structurally aware. Our approach introduces new homophily matrices for understanding class interactions and tendencies. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that SCNode achieves superior performance over conventional GNN models, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability in diverse graph structures.</description>
