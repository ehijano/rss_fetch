      <title>Follow the Leader: Enhancing Systematic Trend-Following Using Network Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic, trend-following strategy, applied to commodity futures markets, that combines univariate trend indicators with cross-sectional trend indicators that capture so-called {\em momentum spillover}, which can occur when there is a lead-lag relationship between the trending behaviour of different markets. Our strategy utilises two methods for detecting lead-lag relationships, with a method for computing {\em network momentum}, to produce a novel trend-following indicator. We use our new trend indicator to construct a portfolio whose performance we compare to a baseline model which uses only univariate indicators, and demonstrate statistically significant improvements in Sharpe ratio, skewness of returns, and downside performance, using synthetic bootstrapped data samples taken from time-series of actual prices.</description>

      <title>How low-cost AI universal approximators reshape market efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) famously stated that prices fully reflect the information available to traders. This critically depends on the transfer of information into prices through trading strategies. Traders optimise their strategy with models of increasing complexity that identify the relationship between information and profitable trades more and more accurately. Under specific conditions, the increased availability of low-cost universal approximators, such as AI systems, should be naturally pushing towards more advanced trading strategies, potentially making it harder and harder for inefficient traders to profit. In this paper, we leverage on a generalised notion of market efficiency, based on the definition of an equilibrium price process, that allows us to distinguish different levels of model complexity through investors' beliefs, and trading strategies optimisation, and discuss the relationship between AI-powered trading and the time-evolution of market efficiency. Finally, we outline the need for and the challenge of describing out-of-equilibrium market dynamics in an adaptive multi-agent environment.</description>

      <title>TradingAgents: Multi-Agents LLM Financial Trading Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading. More details on TradingAgents are available at https://TradingAgents-AI.github.io.</description>
