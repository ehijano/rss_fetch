      <title>Input gradient annealing neural network for solving low-temperature Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel yet simple deep learning approach, called input gradient annealing neural network (IGANN), for solving stationary Fokker-Planck equations. Traditional methods, such as finite difference and finite elements, suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Neural network based algorithms are meshless methods, which can avoid the curse of dimensionality. However, at low temperature, when directly solving a stationary Fokker-Planck equation with more than two metastable states in the generalized potential landscape, the small eigenvalue introduces numerical difficulties due to a large condition number. To overcome these problems, we introduce the IGANN method, which uses a penalty of negative input gradient annealing during the training. We demonstrate that the IGANN method can effectively solve high-dimensional and low-temperature Fokker-Planck equations through our numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of a three-dimensional system of Topp model with diabetes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical models of glucose, insulin, and pancreatic $\beta$-cell mass dynamics are essential for understanding the physiological basis of type 2 diabetes. This paper investigates the Topp model's discrete-time dynamics to represent these interactions. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the system's trajectory, examining both local and global behavior. First, we establish the invariance of the positive trajectory and analyze the existence of fixed points. Then, we conduct a complete stability analysis, determining the local and global asymptotic stability of these fixed points. Finally, numerical examples validate the effectiveness and applicability of our theoretical findings. Additionally, we provide biological interpretations of our results.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formalism of countably generated self-affine sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we further develop the thermodynamic formalism of affine iterated function systems with countably many transformations by showing the existence and extending earlier characterisations of the equilibrium states of finite affine iterated function systems to the countably infinite case. As an application, under mild conditions, we prove that the affinity dimension of a countable affine iterated function system is equal to the supremum of the affinity dimensions of its finite subsystems. We deduce corollaries concerning the Hausdorff dimension of countably generated self-affine sets in dimensions $1$, $2$, and $3$ satisfying mild deterministic assumptions and in arbitrary dimension with generic translations.</description>

      <title>Preperiodic points of polynomial dynamical systems over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a prime $p$, positive integers $r,n$, and a polynomial $f$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_{p^r}$, let $W_{p,r,n}(f)=f^n\left(\mathbb{F}_{p^r}\right)\setminus f^{n+1}\left(\mathbb{F}_{p^r}\right)$. As $n$ varies, the $W_{p,r,n}(f)$ partition the set of strictly preperiodic points of the dynamical system induced by the action of $f$ on $\mathbb{F}_{p^r}$. In this paper we compute statistics of strictly preperiodic points of dynamical systems induced by unicritical polynomials over finite fields by obtaining effective upper bounds for the proportion of $\mathbb{F}_{p^r}$ lying in a given $W_{p,r,n}(f)$. Moreover, when we generalize our definition of $W_{p,r,n}(f)$, we obtain both upper and lower bounds for the resulting averages.</description>

      <title>Solvable Initial Value Problems Ruled by Discontinuous Ordinary Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study initial value problems having dynamics ruled by discontinuous ordinary differential equations with the property of possessing a unique solution. We identify a precise class of such systems that we call \emph{solvable intitial value problems} and we prove that for this class of problems the unique solution can always be obtained analytically via transfinite recursion. We present several examples including a nontrivial one whose solution yields, at an integer time, a real encoding of the halting set for Turing machines; therefore showcasing that the behavior of solvable systems is related to ordinal Turing computations.</description>

      <title>Competing bootstrap processes on the random graph $G(n,p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of classic bootstrap percolation in which two competing processes concurrently evolve on the same graph $G(n,p)$. Nodes can be in one of three states, conveniently represented by different colors: red, black and white. Initially, a given number $a_R$ of active red nodes (red seeds) are selected uniformly at random among the $n$ nodes. Similarly, a given number $a_B$ of active black nodes (black seeds) are selected uniformly at random among the other $n-a_R$ nodes. All remaining nodes are initially white (inactive). White nodes wake up at times dictated by independent Poisson clocks of rate 1. When a white node wakes up, it checks the state of its neighbors: if the number of red (black) neighbors exceeds the number of black (red) neighbors by a fixed amount $r \geq 2$, the node becomes an active red (black) node, and remains so forever. The parameters of the model are, besides $r$ (fixed) and $n$ (tending to $\infty$), the numbers $a_R$ ($a_B$) of initial red (black) seeds, and the edge existence probability $p=p(n)$. We study the size $A^*_R$ ($A^*_B$) of the final set of active red (black) nodes, identifying different regimes which are analyzed under suitable time-scales, allowing us to obtain detailed (asymptotic) temporal dynamics of the two concurrent activation processes.</description>

      <title>Data-driven approximation of Koopman operators and generators: Convergence rates and error bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global information about dynamical systems can be extracted by analysing associated infinite-dimensional transfer operators, such as Perron-Frobenius and Koopman operators as well as their infinitesimal generators. In practice, these operators typically need to be approximated from data. Popular approximation methods are extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) and generator extended mode decomposition (gEDMD). We propose a unified framework that leverages Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the operator of interest on a finite-dimensional space spanned by a set of basis functions. Our framework contains EDMD and gEDMD as special cases, but can also be used to approximate more general operators. Our key contributions are proofs of the convergence of the approximating operator and its spectrum under non-restrictive conditions. Moreover, we derive explicit convergence rates and account for the presence of noise in the observations. Whilst all these results are broadly applicable, they also refine previous analyses of EDMD and gEDMD. We verify the analytical results with the aid of several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.05862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make quantitative improvements to recently obtained results on the structure of the image of a large difference set under certain quadratic forms and other homogeneous polynomials. Previous proofs used deep results of Benoist-Quint on random walks in certain subgroups of $\operatorname{SL}_r(\mathbb{Z})$ (the symmetry groups of these quadratic forms) that were not of a quantitative nature. Our new observation relies on noticing that rather than studying random walks, one can obtain more quantitative results by considering polynomial orbits of these group actions that are not contained in cosets of submodules of $\mathbb{Z}^r$ of small index. Our main new technical tool is a uniform Furstenberg-S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem that holds for a large class of polynomials not necessarily vanishing at zero, which may be of independent interest and is derived from a density increment argument and Hua's bound on polynomial exponential sums.</description>

      <title>Uniform syndeticity in multiple recurrence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02833v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main theorem of this paper establishes a uniform syndeticity result concerning the multiple recurrence of measure-preserving actions on probability spaces. More precisely, for any integers $d,l\geq 1$ and any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we prove the existence of $\delta&gt;0$ and $K\geq 1$ (dependent only on $d$, $l$, and $\varepsilon$) such that the following holds:
  Consider a solvable group $\Gamma$ of derived length $l$, a probability space $(X, \mu)$, and $d$ pairwise commuting measure-preserving $\Gamma$-actions $T_1, \ldots, T_d$ on $(X, \mu)$. Let $E$ be a measurable set in $X$ with $\mu(E) \geq \varepsilon$. Then, $K$ many (left) translates of \begin{equation*} \left\{\gamma\in\Gamma\colon \mu(T_1^{\gamma^{-1}}(E)\cap T_2^{\gamma^{-1}} \circ T^{\gamma^{-1}}_1(E)\cap \cdots \cap T^{\gamma^{-1}}_d\circ T^{\gamma^{-1}}_{d-1}\circ \ldots \circ T^{\gamma^{-1}}_1(E))\geq \delta \right\} \end{equation*} cover $\Gamma$. This result extends and refines uniformity results by Furstenberg and Katznelson.
  As a combinatorial application, we obtain the following uniformity result. For any integers $d,l\geq 1$ and any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there are $\delta&gt;0$ and $K\geq 1$ (dependent only on $d$, $l$, and $\varepsilon$) such that for all finite solvable groups $G$ of derived length $l$ and any subset $E\subset G^d$ with $m^{\otimes d}(E)\geq \varepsilon$ (where $m$ is the uniform measure on $G$), we have that $K$-many (left) translates of \begin{multline*}
  \{g\in G\colon m^{\otimes d}(\{(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\in G^d\colon (a_1,\ldots,a_n),(ga_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n),\ldots,(ga_1,ga_2,\ldots, ga_n)\in E\})\geq \delta \} \end{multline*} cover $G$.
  The proof of our main result is a consequence of an ultralimit version of Austin's amenable ergodic Szem\'eredi theorem.</description>

      <title>Tracking Superharmonic Resonances for Nonlinear Vibration of Conservative and Hysteretic Single Degree of Freedom Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many modern engineering structures exhibit nonlinear vibration. Characterizing such vibrations efficiently is critical to optimizing designs for reliability and performance. For linear systems, steady-state vibration occurs only at the forcing frequencies. However, nonlinearities (e.g., contact, friction, large deformation, etc.) can result in nonlinear vibration behavior including superharmonics - responses at integer multiples of the forcing frequency. When the forcing frequency is near an integer fraction of the natural frequency, superharmonic resonance occurs, and the magnitude of the superharmonics can exceed that of the fundamental harmonic that is externally forced. Characterizing such superharmonic resonances is critical to improving engineering designs. The present work extends the concept of phase resonance nonlinear modes (PRNM) to be applicable to general nonlinearities, and is demonstrated for eight different nonlinear forces. The considered forces include stiffening, softening, contact, damping, and frictional nonlinearities that have not been previously considered with PRNM. The proposed variable phase resonance nonlinear modes (VPRNM) method can accurately track superharmonic resonances for hysteretic nonlinearities that exhibit amplitude dependent phase resonance conditions that cannot be captured by PRNM. The proposed method allows for characterization of superharmonic resonances without constructing a full frequency response curve at every force level with the harmonic balance method. Thus, the present method allows for analysis of potential failures due to large amplitudes near the superharmonic resonance with reduced computational cost. The consideration of single degree of freedom systems in the present paper provides insights into superharmonic resonances and a basis for understanding internal resonances for multiple degree of freedom systems.</description>

      <title>Link Prediction Accuracy on Real-World Networks Under Non-Uniform Missing Edge Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world network datasets are typically obtained in ways that fail to capture all edges. The patterns of missing data are often non-uniform as they reflect biases and other shortcomings of different data collection methods. Nevertheless, uniform missing data is a common assumption made when no additional information is available about the underlying missing-edge pattern, and link prediction methods are frequently tested against uniformly missing edges. To investigate the impact of different missing-edge patterns on link prediction accuracy, we employ 9 link prediction algorithms from 4 different families to analyze 20 different missing-edge patterns that we categorize into 5 groups. Our comparative simulation study, spanning 250 real-world network datasets from 6 different domains, provides a detailed picture of the significant variations in the performance of different link prediction algorithms in these different settings. With this study, we aim to provide a guide for future researchers to help them select a link prediction algorithm that is well suited to their sampled network data, considering the data collection process and application domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact group and $\mu$ an admissible probability measure on $G$. Let $(B,\nu)$ be the universal topological Poisson $\mu$-boundary of $(G,\mu)$ and $\Pi_s(G)$ the universal minimal strongly proximal $G$-flow. This note is inspired by a recent result of Hartman and Kalantar. We show that for a locally compact second countable group $G$ the following conditions are equivalent: (i) the measure $\nu$ is the unique $\mu$-stationary measure on $B$, (ii) $(B,G) \cong (\Pi_s(G),G)$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Stable Processes on Amenable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04159v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is a countable amenable group, then every stationary non-Gaussian symmetric $\alpha$-stable (S$\alpha$S) process indexed by $G$ is ergodic if and only if it is weakly-mixing, and it is ergodic if and only if its Rosinski minimal spectral representation is null. This extends the results for $\mathbb{Z}^d$, and answers a question of P. Roy on discrete nilpotent groups to the extent of all countable amenable groups. As a result we construct on the Heisenberg group and on many Abelian groups, for all $\alpha$ in (0,2), stationary S$\alpha$S processes that are weakly-mixing but not strongly-mixing.</description>

      <title>Continuous space core-periphery model with transport costs in differentiated agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01040v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The core-periphery model with transport costs in differentiated agriculture is extended to a continuous space. The stability of a homogeneous stationary solution exhibits redispersion under positive agricultural transport costs; it transitions from stable to unstable and finally stable again as manufacturing transport costs decrease. It is numerically observed that a solution starting from around the unstable homogeneous solution eventually forms a spike-like agglomeration. Moreover, the redispersion also appears here in the sense that the number of the spikes goes from decreasing to increasing as the manufacturing transport costs decrease. It is also observed that lower agricultural transport costs and stronger preference for agricultural variety promote agglomeration.</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of K3 surfaces, signatures, and isometries of lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06698v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Every Salem numbers of degree 4,6,8,12,14 or 16 is the dynamical degree of an automorphism of a non-projective K3 surface. We define a notion of signature of an automorphism, and use it to give a necessary and sufficient condition for Salem numbers of degree 10 and 18 to be realized as the dynamical degree of such an automorphism. The first part of the paper contains results on isometries of lattices.</description>

      <title>The eventual image</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a category with enough limits and colimits, one can form the universal automorphism on an endomorphism in two dual senses. Sometimes these dual constructions coincide, as in the categories of finite sets, finite-dimensional vector spaces, and compact metric spaces. There, beginning with an endomorphism $f$, there is a doubly-universal automorphism on $f$ whose underlying object is the eventual image $\bigcap_n \mathrm{im}(f^n)$. Our main theorem unifies these examples, stating that in any category with a factorization system satisfying certain axioms, the eventual image has two dual universal properties. A further theorem characterizes the eventual image as a terminal coalgebra. In all, nine characterizations of the eventual image are given, valid at different levels of generality.</description>

      <title>Closed-Loop Koopman Operator Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a method to identify a Koopman model of a feedback-controlled system given a known controller. The Koopman operator allows a nonlinear system to be rewritten as an infinite-dimensional linear system by viewing it in terms of an infinite set of lifting functions. A finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator can be identified from data by choosing a finite subset of lifting functions and solving a regression problem in the lifted space. Existing methods are designed to identify open-loop systems. However, it is impractical or impossible to run experiments on some systems, such as unstable systems, in an open-loop fashion. The proposed method leverages the linearity of the Koopman operator, along with knowledge of the controller and the structure of the closed-loop system, to simultaneously identify the closed-loop and plant systems. The advantages of the proposed closed-loop Koopman operator approximation method are demonstrated in simulation using a Duffing oscillator and experimentally using a rotary inverted pendulum system. An open-source software implementation of the proposed method is publicly available, along with the experimental dataset generated for this paper.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Safety-Critical Control for Networked Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As modern systems become ever more connected with complex dynamic coupling relationships, the development of safe control methods for such networked systems becomes paramount. In this paper, we define a general networked model with coupled dynamics and local control and discuss the relationship of node-level safety definitions for individual agents with local neighborhood dynamics. We define a node-level barrier function (NBF), node-level control barrier function (NCBF), and collaborative node-level barrier function (cNCBF) and provide conditions under which sets defined by these functions will be forward invariant. We use collaborative node-level barrier functions to construct a novel distributed algorithm for the safe control of collaborating network agents and provide conditions under which the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a viable set of safe control actions for all agents or a terminally infeasible state for at least one agent. We introduce the notion of non-compliance of network neighbors as a metric of robustness for collaborative safety for a given network state and chosen barrier function hyper-parameters. We illustrate these results on a networked susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model.</description>

      <title>On the Folklore set and Dirichlet spectrum for matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Folklore set of Dirichlet improvable matrices in $\mathbb R^{m\times n}$ which are neither singular nor badly approximable. We prove the non-emptiness for all positive integer pairs $m,n$ apart from $\{m,n\}=\{ 1,1\}$ and $\{m,n\}=\{ 2,3\}$ in a constructive way. For a wide range of integer pairs $(m,n)$ we construct subsets of the Folklore set with an exact prescribed Dirichlet constant (in some right neighbourhood of $0$). This enables us to provide information on the Dirichlet Spectrum of matrices. The key technique of our construction is to build certain $2$-dimensional simultaneously approximable very singular vectors, and then `lift' these vectors to higher dimensions by `glueing' them to a large set of well-behaved matrices. Our technique is also applicable to arbitrary norms. As a corollary, we obtain lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of these sets. These statements complement previous results of the middle-named author (Selecta Math. 2023), Beresnevich et. al. (Adv. Math. 2023), and Das et. al. (Adv. Math. 2024).</description>
