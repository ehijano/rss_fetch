      <title>Emulating Brain-like Rapid Learning in Neuromorphic Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving personalized intelligence at the edge with real-time learning capabilities holds enormous promise in enhancing our daily experiences and helping decision making, planning, and sensing. However, efficient and reliable edge learning remains difficult with current technology due to the lack of personalized data, insufficient hardware capabilities, and inherent challenges posed by online learning.
  Over time and across multiple developmental stages, the brain has evolved to efficiently incorporate new knowledge by gradually building on previous knowledge. In this work, we emulate the multiple stages of learning with digital neuromorphic technology that simulates the neural and synaptic processes of the brain using two stages of learning. First, a meta-training stage trains the hyperparameters of synaptic plasticity for one-shot learning using a differentiable simulation of the neuromorphic hardware. This meta-training process refines a hardware local three-factor synaptic plasticity rule and its associated hyperparameters to align with the trained task domain. In a subsequent deployment stage, these optimized hyperparameters enable fast, data-efficient, and accurate learning of new classes. We demonstrate our approach using event-driven vision sensor data and the Intel Loihi neuromorphic processor with its plasticity dynamics, achieving real-time one-shot learning of new classes that is vastly improved over transfer learning. Our methodology can be deployed with arbitrary plasticity models and can be applied to situations demanding quick learning and adaptation at the edge, such as navigating unfamiliar environments or learning unexpected categories of data through user engagement.</description>

      <title>Exploring the origins of switching dynamics in a multifunctional reservoir computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of multifunctionality has enabled reservoir computers (RCs), a type of dynamical system that is typically realised as an artificial neural network, to reconstruct multiple attractors simultaneously using the same set of trained weights. However there are many additional phenomena that arise when training a RC to reconstruct more than one attractor. Previous studies have found that, in certain cases, if the RC fails to reconstruct a coexistence of attractors then it exhibits a form of metastability whereby, without any external input, the state of the RC switches between different modes of behaviour that resemble properties of the attractors it failed to reconstruct. In this paper we explore the origins of these switching dynamics in a paradigmatic setting via the `seeing double' problem.</description>

      <title>CTRQNets &amp; LQNets: Continuous Time Recurrent and Liquid Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have continued to gain prevalence in the modern era for their ability to model complex data through pattern recognition and behavior remodeling. However, the static construction of traditional neural networks inhibits dynamic intelligence. This makes them inflexible to temporal changes in data and unfit to capture complex dependencies. With the advent of quantum technology, there has been significant progress in creating quantum algorithms. In recent years, researchers have developed quantum neural networks that leverage the capabilities of qubits to outperform classical networks. However, their current formulation exhibits a static construction limiting the system's dynamic intelligence. To address these weaknesses, we develop a Liquid Quantum Neural Network (LQNet) and a Continuous Time Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (CTRQNet). Both models demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy compared to existing quantum neural networks (QNNs), achieving accuracy increases as high as 40\% on CIFAR 10 through binary classification. We propose LQNets and CTRQNets might shine a light on quantum machine learning's black box.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning to Predict Late-Onset Breast Cancer Metastasis: the Single Hyperparameter Grid Search (SHGS) Strategy for Meta Tuning Concerning Deep Feed-forward Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While machine learning has advanced in medicine, its widespread use in clinical applications, especially in predicting breast cancer metastasis, is still limited. We have been dedicated to constructing a DFNN model to predict breast cancer metastasis n years in advance. However, the challenge lies in efficiently identifying optimal hyperparameter values through grid search, given the constraints of time and resources. Issues such as the infinite possibilities for continuous hyperparameters like l1 and l2, as well as the time-consuming and costly process, further complicate the task. To address these challenges, we developed Single Hyperparameter Grid Search (SHGS) strategy, serving as a preselection method before grid search. Our experiments with SHGS applied to DFNN models for breast cancer metastasis prediction focus on analyzing eight target hyperparameters: epochs, batch size, dropout, L1, L2, learning rate, decay, and momentum. We created three figures, each depicting the experiment results obtained from three LSM-I-10-Plus-year datasets. These figures illustrate the relationship between model performance and the target hyperparameter values. For each hyperparameter, we analyzed whether changes in this hyperparameter would affect model performance, examined if there were specific patterns, and explored how to choose values for the particular hyperparameter. Our experimental findings reveal that the optimal value of a hyperparameter is not only dependent on the dataset but is also significantly influenced by the settings of other hyperparameters. Additionally, our experiments suggested some reduced range of values for a target hyperparameter, which may be helpful for low-budget grid search. This approach serves as a prior experience and foundation for subsequent use of grid search to enhance model performance.</description>

      <title>A Novel Denoising Technique and Deep Learning Based Hybrid Wind Speed Forecasting Model for Variable Terrain Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wind flow can be highly unpredictable and can suffer substantial fluctuations in speed and direction due to the shape and height of hills, mountains, and valleys, making accurate wind speed (WS) forecasting essential in complex terrain. This paper presents a novel and adaptive model for short-term forecasting of WS. The paper's key contributions are as follows: (a) The Partial Auto Correlation Function (PACF) is utilised to minimise the dimension of the set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF), hence reducing training time; (b) The sample entropy (SampEn) was used to calculate the complexity of the reduced set of IMFs. The proposed technique is adaptive since a specific Deep Learning (DL) model-feature combination was chosen based on complexity; (c) A novel bidirectional feature-LSTM framework for complicated IMFs has been suggested, resulting in improved forecasting accuracy; (d) The proposed model shows superior forecasting performance compared to the persistence, hybrid, Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), and Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)-based deep learning models. It has achieved the lowest variance in terms of forecasting accuracy between simple and complex terrain conditions 0.70%. Dimension reduction of IMF's and complexity-based model-feature selection helps reduce the training time by 68.77% and improve forecasting quality by 58.58% on average.</description>

      <title>Halfway Escape Optimization: A Quantum-Inspired Solution for General Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02850v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper first proposes the Halfway Escape Optimization (HEO) algorithm, a quantum-inspired metaheuristic designed to address general optimization problems characterized by rugged landscapes and high-dimensionality with an efficient convergence rate. The study presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of HEO's performance against established optimization algorithms, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), and Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). The primary analysis encompasses 14 benchmark functions with dimension 30, demonstrating HEO's effectiveness and adaptability in navigating general optimization problems and providing valuable insights into its performance. The test of HEO in Pressure Vessel Design and Tubular Column Design infers its feasibility and potential in real-time applications. Further validation in Osmancik-97 and Cammeo Rice Classification proves the effectiveness of HEO and achieves a higher accuracy record.</description>

      <title>Research Advances and New Paradigms for Biology-inspired Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are gaining popularity in the computational simulation and artificial intelligence fields owing to their biological plausibility and computational efficiency. This paper explores the historical development of SNN and concludes that these two fields are intersecting and merging rapidly. Following the successful application of Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and Dynamic Audio Sensors (DAS), SNNs have found some proper paradigms, such as continuous visual signal tracking, automatic speech recognition, and reinforcement learning for continuous control, that have extensively supported their key features, including spike encoding, neuronal heterogeneity, specific functional circuits, and multiscale plasticity. Compared to these real-world paradigms, the brain contains a spiking version of the biology-world paradigm, which exhibits a similar level of complexity and is usually considered a mirror of the real world. Considering the projected rapid development of invasive and parallel Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), as well as the new BCI-based paradigms that include online pattern recognition and stimulus control of biological spike trains, SNNs naturally leverage their advantages in energy efficiency, robustness, and flexibility. The biological brain has inspired the present study of SNNs and effective SNN machine-learning algorithms, which can help enhance neuroscience discoveries in the brain by applying them to the new BCI paradigm. Such two-way interactions with positive feedback can accelerate brain science research and brain-inspired intelligence technology.</description>
