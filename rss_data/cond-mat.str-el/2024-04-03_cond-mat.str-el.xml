      <title>Cluster state as a non-invertible symmetry protected topological phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the standard 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ cluster model has a non-invertible global symmetry, described by the fusion category Rep(D$_8$). Therefore, the cluster state is not only a $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, but also a non-invertible SPT phase. We further find two new commuting Pauli Hamiltonians for the other two Rep(D$_8$) SPT phases on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits, matching the classification in field theory and mathematics. We identify the edge modes and the local projective algebras at the interfaces between these non-invertible SPT phases. Finally, we show that there does not exist a symmetric entangler that maps between these distinct SPT states.</description>

      <title>Enhanced pair-density-wave vertices in a bilayer Hubbard model at half-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the pair-density-wave (PDW) state found in the one-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg chain, we report on a determinant quantum Monte Carlo DQMC study of pair-fields for a two- dimensional half-filled Hubbard layer coupled to an itinerant, non-interacting layer with one electron per site. In a specific range of interlayer hopping, the pairing vertex associated with PDW order becomes more attractive than that for uniform d-wave pairing, although both remain subdominant to the leading antiferromagnetic correlations at half-filling. Our result sheds light on where one potentially may find a PDW state in such a model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note addresses the effects of long-ranged and/or retarded interactions on the bosonic collective modes in the so-called 'strange metals'. Recently, there have been conflicting reports on the very existence of such stable collective excitations and their properties. Extending a number of approaches that were previously used in the analyses of the standard Fermi liquid one finds evidence for, both, conventional and novel behaviors of the non-Fermi-liquid counterparts of the zero-, shear-, and other 'sounds'.</description>

      <title>Structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of triangular-lattice transition-metal phosphates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the spin supersolid candidate Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ stimulates numerous research interest on the triangular-lattice transition-metal phosphates. Here we report a comprehensive study on the structural, magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of polycrystalline Na$_2$$A$$T$(PO$_4$)$_2$ ($A$ = Ba, Sr; $T$ = Co, Ni, Mn). X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements confirm that Na$_2$Ba$T$(PO$_4$)$_2$ (NB$T$P) crystallizes in a trigonal structure, while Na$_2$Sr$T$(PO$_4$)$_2$ (NS$T$P) forms a monoclinic structure with a slight distortion of the triangular network of $T^{2+}$ ions. The dc magnetization data show that all six compounds order antiferromagnetically below 2 K, and the N\'{e}el temperatures of NS$T$P are consistently higher than those of NB$T$P for $T$ = Co, Ni, and Mn, due to the release of geometrical frustration by monoclinic distortions. Further magnetocaloric measurements show that trigonal NB$T$P can reach a lower temperature in the quasi-adiabatic demagnetization process and thus shows a better performance in the magnetic refrigeration, compared with monoclinic NS$T$P. Our findings highlight the outstanding magnetocaloric performances of the trigonal transition-metal phosphates, and disclose two necessary ingredients for a superior magnetic coolant that can reach an ultra-low temperature, including a perfect geometrically frustrated lattice and a small effective spin number associated with the magnetic ions.</description>

      <title>C-type antiferromagnetic structure of topological semimetal CaMnSb$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determination of the magnetic structure and confirmation of the presence or absence of inversion ($\mathcal{P}$) and time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) symmetry is imperative for correctly understanding the topological magnetic materials. Here high-quality single crystals of the layered manganese pnictide CaMnSb$_2$ are synthesized using the self-flux method. De Haas-van Alphen oscillations indicate a nontrivial Berry phase of $\sim$ $\pi$ and a notably small cyclotron effective mass, supporting the Dirac semimetal nature of CaMnSb$_2$. Neutron diffraction measurements identify a C-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) structure below $T\rm_{N}$ = 303(1) K with the Mn moments aligned along the $a$ axis, which is well supported by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The corresponding magnetic space group is $Pn'm'a'$, preserving a $\mathcal{P}\times\mathcal{T}$ symmetry. Adopting the experimentally determined magnetic structure, band crossings near the Y point in momentum space and linear dispersions of the Sb $5p_{y,z}$ bands are revealed by the DFT calculations. Furthermore, our study predicts the possible existence of an intrinsic second-order nonlinear Hall effect in CaMnSb$_2$, offering a promising platform to study the impact of topological properties on nonlinear electrical transports in antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Understanding spin currents from magnon dispersion and polarization: Spin-Seebeck effect and neutron scattering study on Tb3Fe5O12</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon spin currents in the ferrimagnetic garnet Tb3Fe5O12 with 4f electrons were examined through the spin-Seebeck effect and neutron scattering measurements. The compound shows a magnetic compensation, where the spin-Seebeck signal reverses above and below Tcomp = 249.5(4) K. Unpolarized neutron scattering unveils two major magnon branches with finite energy gaps, which are well-explained in the framework of spin-wave theory. Their temperature dependencies and the direction of the precession motion of magnetic moments, i.e. magnon polarization, defined using polarized neutrons, explain the reversal at Tcomp and decay of the spin-Seebeck signals at low temperatures. We illustrate an example that momentum- and energy-resolved microscopic information is a prerequisite to understanding the magnon spin current.</description>

      <title>Photodriven Mott insulating heterostructures: A steady-state study of impact ionization processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the photocurrent and spectral features in a simplified model of a Mott photovoltaic system consisting of a multilayered insulating heterostructure. The central correlated region is coupled to two metallic leads kept at different chemical potentials. A periodic drive applied to the correlated region produces excited doublons and holons across the Mott gap which are then separated by a potential gradient, which mimics the polarization-induced electric field present in oxyde heterostructures. The nonequilibrium Floquet steady-state is addressed by means of dynamical mean-field theory and its Floquet extension, while the so-called auxiliary master equation approach is employed as impurity solver. We find that impact ionization, identified by a kink in the photocurrent as function of the driving frequency, becomes significant and is generally favoured by weak, narrow-band hybridizations to the leads beyond a certain strength of the driving field. On the other hand, in the case of a direct coupling to metallic leads with a flat band, we observe a drastic reduction of impact ionization and of the photocurrent itself.</description>

      <title>Stacking of charge-density waves in 2H-NbSe$_2$ bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ ab-initio electronic structure calculations to investigate the charge-density waves and periodic lattice distortions in bilayer 2H-NbSe$_2$. We demonstrate that the vertical stacking can give rise to a variety of patterns that may lower the symmetry of the CDW exhibited separately by the two composing 1H-NbSe$_2$ monolayers. The general tendency to a spontaneous symmetry breaking observed in the ground state and the first excited states is shown to originate from a non-negligible inter-layer coupling. Simulated images for scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) as well as diffraction/scattering patterns show signatures of the different stacking orders. This may not only be useful to reinterpret past experiments on surfaces and thin films, but may also be exploited to devise ad-hoc experiments for the investigation of the stacking order in 2H-NbSe$_2$. We anticipate that our analysis does not only apply to the 2H-NbSe$_2$ bilayer, but is also relevant for thin films and bulk, whose smallest centro-symmetric component is indeed the bilayer. Finally, our results illustrate clearly that the vertical stacking is not only important for 1T structures, as exemplified by the metal-to-insulator transition observed in 1T-TaS$_2$, but seems to be a general feature of metallic layered transition metal dichalcogenides as well.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Matsubara series expansion for imaginary-time correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Fourier-Matsubara series expansion is derived for imaginary-time correlation functions that constitutes the imaginary-time generalization of the infinite Matsubara series for equal-time correlation functions. The expansion is consistent with all known exact properties of imaginary-time correlation functions and opens up new avenues for the utilization of quantum Monte Carlo simulation data. Moreover, the expansion drastically simplifies the computation of imaginary-time density-density correlation functions with the finite temperature version of the self-consistent dielectric formalism. Its existence underscores the utility of imaginary-time as a complementary domain for many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Frustration-induced quantum criticality in Ni-doped CePdAl as revealed by the $\mu$SR technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In CePdAl, the 4$f$ moments of cerium arrange to form a geometrically frustrated kagome lattice. Due to frustration in addition to Kondo- and RKKY- interactions, this metallic system shows a long-range magnetic order (LRO) with a $T_{\rm N}$ of only 2.7\,K. Upon Ni doping at the Pd sites, $T_{\rm N}$ is further suppressed, to reach zero at a critical concentration $x_c \approx 0.15$. Here, by using muon-spin relaxation and rotation ($\mu$SR), we investigate at a local level CePd$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$Al for five different Ni-concentrations, both above and below $x_c$. Similar to the parent CePdAl compound, for $x = 0.05$, we observe an incommensurate LRO, which turns into a quasi-static magnetic order for $x = 0.1$ and 0.14. More interestingly, away from $x_c$, for $x = 0.16$ and 0.18, we still observe a non-Fermi liquid regime, evidenced by a power-law divergence of the longitudinal relaxation at low temperatures. In this case, longitudinal field measurements exhibit a time-field scaling, indicative of a cooperative spin dynamics that persists for $x &gt; x_c$. Furthermore, similar to the externally applied pressure, the chemical pressure induced by Ni doping suppresses the region below $T^*$, characterized by a spin-liquid like dynamical behavior. Our results suggest that the magnetic properties of CePdAl are similarly affected by the hydrostatic- and the chemical pressure. We also confirm that the unusual non-Fermi liquid regime (compared to conventional quantum critical systems) is due to the presence of frustration that persists up to the highest Ni concentrations.</description>

      <title>The ground state of electron-doped $t-t'-J$ model on cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of the electron-doped $t-t'-J$ model on cylinders with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). We adopt both periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions along the circumference direction to explore the finite size effect. We study doping levels of $1/6$, $1/8$, and $1/12$ which represent the most interesting region in the phase diagram of electron-doped cuprates. We find that for width-4 and 6 systems, the ground state for fixed doping switches between anti-ferromagnetic Neel state and stripe state under different boundary conditions and with system widths, indicating the presence of large finite size effect in the $t-t'-J$ model. We also have a careful analysis of the $d$-wave pairing correlations which also changes quantitatively with boundary conditions and widths of the system. However, the pairing correlations are enhanced when the system becomes wider for all dopings, suggesting the existence of possible long-ranged superconducting order in the thermodynamic limit. The width-8 results are found to be dependent on the starting state in the DMRG calculation for the kept states we can reach. For width-8 system only Neel (stripe) state can be stabilized in DMRG calculation for $1/12$ ($1/6$) doping, while both stripe and Neel states are stable in the DMRG sweep for $1/8$ doping, regardless of the boundary conditions. These results indicate that $1/8$ doping is likely to lie in the boundary of a phase transition between the Neel phase with lower doping and the stripe phase with higher doping, consistent with the previous study. The sensitivity of ground state on boundary conditions and size observed in this work is similar to that in the $t'$- Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Strong interactions and isospin symmetry breaking in a supermoir\'e lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multilayer moir\'e heterostructures, the interference of multiple twist angles ubiquitously leads to tunable ultra-long-wavelength patterns known as supermoir\'e lattices. However, their impact on the system's many-body electronic phase diagram remains largely unexplored. We present local compressibility measurements revealing numerous incompressible states resulting from supermoir\'e-lattice-scale isospin symmetry breaking driven by strong interactions. By using the supermoir\'e lattice occupancy as a probe of isospin symmetry, we observe an unexpected doubling of the miniband filling near $\nu=-2$, possibly indicating a hidden phase transition or normal-state pairing proximal to the superconducting phase. Our work establishes supermoir\'e lattices as a tunable parameter for designing novel quantum phases and an effective tool for unraveling correlated phenomena in moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Correlation of Structural and Magnetic Properties of RFeO3 (R=Dy, Lu)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In orthoferrites the rare-earth (R) ion has a big impact on structural and magnetic properties in particular the ionic size influences the octahedral tilt and the R3+- Fe3+ interaction modifies properties like the spin reorientation. Growth induced strain in thin films is another means to modify materials properties since the sign of strain affects the bond length and therefore directly the orbital interaction. Our study focuses on epitaxially grown (010) oriented DyFeO3 and LuFeO3 thin films, thereby investigating the impact of compressive lattice strain on the magnetically active Dy3+ and magnetically inactive Lu3+ compared to uniaxially strained single crystal DyFeO3. The DyFeO3 films exhibits a shift of more than 20K in spin-reorientation temperatures, maintain the antiferromagnetic {\Gamma}4 phase of the Fe-lattice below the spin reorientation, and show double step hysteresis loops for both in-plane directions between 5 K and 390 K. This is the signature of an Fe-spin induced ferromagnetic Dy3+ lattice above the N\'eel temperature of the Dy. The observed shift in the film spin reorientation temperatures vs lattice strain is in good agreement with isostatic single crystal neutron diffraction experiments with a rate of 2 K/ kbar bar.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Fermi polaron after a kick: two-sided singularity of the momentum distribution, Bragg reflection and other exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mobile impurity particle immersed in a quantum fluid forms a polaron - a quasiparticle consisting of the impurity and a local disturbance of the fluid around it. We ask what happens to a one-dimensional polaron after a kick, i.e. an abrupt application of a force that instantly delivers a finite impulse to the impurity. In the framework of an integrable model describing an impurity in a one-dimensional gas of fermions or hard-core bosons, we calculate the distribution of the polaron momentum established when the post-kick relaxation is over. A remarkable feature of this distribution is a two-sided power-law singularity that can correspond to one of two processes. In the first process, the whole impulse is transferred to the polaron, without creating phonon-like excitations of the fluid. In the second process, the impulse is shared between the polaron and the center-of-mass motion of the fluid, again without creating any fluid excitations. The latter process is, in fact, a Bragg reflection at the edge of the emergent Brillouin zone. We carefully analyze the conditions for each of the two cases and derive the asymptotic form of the distribution in the vicinity of the singularity.</description>

Abstract: An emergent and promising tensor-network-based impurity solver is to represent the path integral as a matrix product state, where the bath is analytically integrated out using Feynman-Vernon influence functional. Here we present an approach to calculate the equilibrium impurity spectral function based on the recently proposed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators method. The central idea is to perform a quench from a separable impurity-bath initial state as in the non-equilibrium scenario. The retarded Green's function $G(t+t_0, t'+t_0)$ is then calculated after an equilibration time $t_0$ such that the impurity and bath are approximately in thermal equilibrium. There are two major advantages of this method. First, since we focus on real-time dynamics, we do not need to perform the numerically ill-posed analytic continuation in the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo case that relies on imaginary-time evolution. Second, the entanglement growth of the matrix product states in real-time calculations is observed to be much slower than that in imaginary-time calculations, leading to a significant improvement in numerical efficiency. The accuracy of this method is demonstrated in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model and benchmarked against the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Spin ice evidence in the frustrated Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 pyrochlore compounds</title>

Abstract: Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 pyrochlore compounds have exhibited spin ice behavior. These compounds have not been adequately reported based on the concept of magnetic frustration. Here, we have synthesized and characterized Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 to study the ground state magnetic properties. We confirmed the cubic pyrochlore structure via X-ray powder diffraction. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements show an absence of magnetic order down to 400 mK. Interestingly, the low-temperature magnetic heat capacity exhibited a broad maximum around Tmax = 0.9 K for Gd2GaSbO7 and Tmax = 1 K for Gd2InSbO7, suggesting the presence of spin fluctuations and following the T^1.71 and T^1.49 dependence for Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 respectively. We scale the ratio between nearest-neighbour exchange and dipolar interaction of all the reported Gd-based pyrochlores, where Gd2InSbO7 has the lowest and weaker exchange interaction of all among others. It states that chemical pressure has an impact on exchange interaction due to the different pathways of mediators between magnetic ions. This study reveals the robust spin ice behaviour in the ground state like Dy2Ti2O7 and Ho2Ti2O7. It is in stark contrast with other Gd-Pyrochlore compounds that hold the long-range magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Amplified entanglement witnessed in a quantum critical metal</title>

Abstract: Strong correlations in matter promote a landscape of ground states and associated quantum critical points. For metallic systems, there is increasing recognition that the quantum criticality goes beyond the standard Landau framework and, thus, novel means are needed to characterize the quantum critical fluid. Here we do so by studying the entanglement properties near a quantum critical point of a strongly correlated metal. We calculate the mutual information and quantum Fisher information of an Anderson/Kondo lattice model across its Kondo destruction quantum critical point. The quantum Fisher information of the spin degree of freedom peaks at the quantum critical point and indicates a strongly entangled ground state. Our results are supported by the quantum Fisher information extracted from inelastic neutron scattering measurements in quantum critical heavy fermion metals. Our work opens a new avenue to advance the understanding of metallic quantum criticality in a broad range of strongly correlated systems, and points to a new regime of quantum matter to witness amplified entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive research has focused on phenomena arising from the chirality of crystalline or magnetic structures. Recently, we have proposed the "Nonlinear Chiral Thermo-Electric (NCTE) Hall effect," in which current flows in the direction of the cross product of the electric field and the temperature gradient in a material with a chiral structure. Despite its importance for device applications such as heat flow sensors and logic circuits, there are no quantitative demonstrations in actual materials. We investigate the NCTE Hall effect and the second-order response to the electric field in Te, which hosts the chiral crystal structure, based on $ab \ initio$ calculations and symmetry argument. We clarify that the NCTE Hall current can flow parallel to the chiral axis, whereas such behavior is absent for the second-order response to the DC electric field. Quantitative estimation predicts the large NCTE Hall current which is sufficiently detectable in experiments, and the orbital magnetic moment will play an important role in the vicinity of the top of the valence band.</description>

Abstract: Starting from a simple dipole-conserving Hamiltonian model, after introducing a proper quantisation framework, we construct the linear-response theory of a fracton quantum gas. We show how to consistently construct the density operator and we calculate the density-density linear-response function in the limit of large number of (fracton) flavours. We show how to construct its random-phase approximation, from which we calculate the fracton-plasmon dispersion.</description>

      <title>Effects of strain-tunable valleys on charge transport in bismuth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of the valley degree of freedom can boost the technological development of novel functional devices based on valleytronics. The current mainstream platform for valleytronics is to produce a monolayer with inversion asymmetry, in which the strain-band engineering through the substrates can serve to improve the performance of valley-based devices. However, pinpointing the effective role of strain is inevitable for the precise design of the desired valley structure. Here, we demonstrate the charge transport under continuously controllable external strain for bulk bismuth crystals with three equivalent electron valleys and one hole valley. The strain response of resistance, namely elastoresistance, exhibits the evolutions in both antisymmetric and symmetric channels with decreasing temperature. The elastoresistance behaviors mainly reflect the significant changes in valley density depending on the symmetry of induced strain, evidenced by our strain-dependent quantum oscillation measurements and first-principle band calculations under strain. These facts suggest the successful tune and evaluation of the valley populations through strain-dependent charge valley transport.</description>

      <title>Optimally Localized Wannier Functions for 2D Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The construction of optimally localized Wannier functions (and Wannier functions in general) for a Chern insulator has been considered to be impossible owing to the fact that the second moment of such functions is generally infinite. In this manuscript, we propose a solution to this problem in the case of a single band. We accomplish this by drawing an analogy between the minimization of the variance and the minimization of the electrostatic energy of a periodic array of point charges in a smooth neutralizing background. In doing so, we obtain a natural regularization of the diverging variance and this leads to an analytical solution to the minimization problem. We demonstrate our results numerically for a particular model system. Furthermore, we show how the optimally localized Wannier functions provide a natural way of evaluating the electric polarization for a Chern insulator.</description>

      <title>Efficient tensor network simulation of IBM's largest quantum processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15642v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how quantum-inspired 2d tensor networks can be used to efficiently and accurately simulate the largest quantum processors from IBM, namely Eagle (127 qubits), Osprey (433 qubits) and Condor (1121 qubits). We simulate the dynamics of a complex quantum many-body system -specifically, the kicked Ising experiment considered recently by IBM in Nature 618, p. 500-505 (2023)- using graph-based Projected Entangled Pair States (gPEPS), which was proposed by some of us in PRB 99, 195105 (2019). Our results show that simple tensor updates are already sufficient to achieve very large unprecedented accuracy with remarkably low computational resources for this model. Apart from simulating the original experiment for 127 qubits, we also extend our results to 433 and 1121 qubits, and for evolution times around 8 times longer, thus setting a benchmark for the newest IBM quantum machines. We also report accurate simulations for infinitely-many qubits. Our results show that gPEPS are a natural tool to efficiently simulate quantum computers with an underlying lattice-based qubit connectivity, such as all quantum processors based on superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Band mixing in the quantum anomalous Hall regime of twisted semiconductor bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remarkable recent experiments have observed fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effects at zero field and unusually high temperatures in twisted semiconductor bilayer $t$MoTe$_2$. Intriguing observations in these experiments such as the absence of integer Hall effects at twist angles where a fractional Hall effect is observed, do however remain unexplained. The experimental phase diagram as a function of twist angle remains to be established. By comprehensive numerical study, we show that band mixing has large qualitative and quantitative effects on the energetics of competing states and their energy gaps throughout the twist angle range $\theta\leq 4^\circ$. This lays the ground for the detailed realistic study of a rich variety of strongly correlated twisted semiconductor multilayers and an understanding of the phase diagram of these fascinating systems.</description>

      <title>Full Counting Statistics of Charge in Quenched Quantum Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unless constrained by symmetry, measurement of an observable on an ensemble of identical quantum systems returns a distribution of values which are encoded in the full counting statistics. While the mean value of this distribution is important for determining certain properties of a system, the full distribution can also exhibit universal behavior. In this paper we study the full counting statistics of particle number in one dimensional interacting Bose and Fermi gases which have been quenched far from equilibrium. In particular we consider the time evolution of the Lieb-Liniger and Gaudin-Yang models quenched from a Bose-Einstein condensate initial state and calculate the full counting statistics of the particle number within a subsystem. We show that the scaled cumulants of the charge in the initial state and at long times are simply related and in particular the latter are independent of the model parameters. Using the quasi-particle picture we obtain the full time evolution of the cumulants and find that although their endpoints are fixed, the finite time dynamics depends strongly on the model parameters. We go on to construct the scaled cumulant generating functions and from this determine the limiting charge probability distributions at long time which are shown to exhibit distinct non-trivial and non-Gaussian fluctuations and large deviations.</description>

      <title>Local operator quench induced by two-dimensional inhomogeneous and homogeneous CFT Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore non-equilibrium processes in two-dimensional conformal field theories (2d CFTs) due to the growth of operators induced by inhomogeneous and homogeneous Hamiltonians by investigating the time dependence of the partition function, energy density, and entanglement entropy. The non-equilibrium processes considered in this paper are constructed out of the Lorentzian and Euclidean time evolution governed by different Hamiltonians. We explore the effect of the time ordering on entanglement dynamics so that we find that in a free boson CFT and RCFTs, this time ordering does not affect the entanglement entropy, while in the holographic CFTs, it does. Our main finding is that in the holographic CFTs, the non-unitary time evolution induced by the inhomogeneous Hamiltonian can retain the initial state information longer than in the unitary time evolution.</description>
