      <title>A Categorical Approach to Coalgebraic Fixpoint Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a framework for incorporating alternation-free fixpoint logics into the dual-adjunction setup for coalgebraic modal logics. We achieve this by using order-enriched categories. We give a least-solution semantics as well as an initial algebra semantics, and prove they are equivalent. We also show how to place the alternation-free coalgebraic $\mu$-calculus in this framework, as well as PDL and a logic with a probabilistic dynamic modality.</description>

      <title>Intersection Types via Finite-Set Declarations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lambda-cube is a famous pure type system (PTS) cube of eight powerful explicit type systems that include the simple, polymorphic and dependent type theories. The lambda-cube only types Strongly Normalising (SN) terms but not all of them. It is well known that even the most powerful system of the lambda-cube can only type the same pure untyped lambda-terms that are typable by the higher-order polymorphic implicitly typed lambda-calculus Fomega, and that there is an untyped {\lambda}-term U' that is SN but is not typable in Fomega or the lambda-cube. Hence, neither system can type all the SN terms it expresses. In this paper, we present the f-cube, an extension of the lambda-cube with finite-set declarations (FSDs) like y\in{C1,...,Cn} : B which means that y is of type B and can only be one of C1,..., Cn. The novelty of our FSDs is that they allow to represent intersection types as Pi-types. We show how to translate and type the term U' in the f-cube using an encoding of intersection types based on FSDs. Notably, our translation works without needing anything like the usual troublesome intersection-introduction rule that proves a pure untyped lambda-term M has an intersection of k types using k independent sub-derivations. As such, our approach is useful for language implementers who want the power of intersection types without the pain of the intersection-introduction rule.</description>

      <title>Better Bounded Bisimulation Contractions (Preprint)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bisimulations are standard in modal logic and, more generally, in the theory of state-transition systems. The quotient structure of a Kripke model with respect to the bisimulation relation is called a bisimulation contraction. The bisimulation contraction is a minimal model bisimilar to the original model, and hence, for (image-)finite models, a minimal model modally equivalent to the original. Similar definitions exist for bounded bisimulations ($k$-bisimulations) and bounded bisimulation contractions. Two finite models are $k$-bisimilar if and only if they are modally equivalent up to modal depth $k$. However, the quotient structure with respect to the $k$-bisimulation relation does not guarantee a minimal model preserving modal equivalence to depth $k$. In this paper, we remedy this asymmetry to standard bisimulations and provide a novel definition of bounded contractions called rooted $k$-contractions. We prove that rooted $k$-contractions preserve $k$-bisimilarity and are minimal with this property. Finally, we show that rooted $k$-contractions can be exponentially more succinct than standard $k$-contractions.</description>

      <title>Solvable Initial Value Problems Ruled by Discontinuous Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study initial value problems having dynamics ruled by discontinuous ordinary differential equations with the property of possessing a unique solution. We identify a precise class of such systems that we call \emph{solvable intitial value problems} and we prove that for this class of problems the unique solution can always be obtained analytically via transfinite recursion. We present several examples including a nontrivial one whose solution yields, at an integer time, a real encoding of the halting set for Turing machines; therefore showcasing that the behavior of solvable systems is related to ordinal Turing computations.</description>

      <title>Capabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our daily lives, as in science and in all other domains, we encounter huge numbers of dispositions (tendencies, potentials, powers) which are realized in processes such as sneezing, sweating, shedding dandruff, and on and on. Among this plethora of what we can think of as mere dispositions is a subset of dispositions in whose realizations we have an interest a car responding well when driven on ice, a rabbits lungs responding well when it is chased by a wolf, and so on. We call the latter capabilities and we attempt to provide a robust ontological account of what capabilities are that is of sufficient generality to serve a variety of purposes, for example by providing a useful extension to ontology-based research in areas where capabilities data are currently being collected in siloed fashion.</description>

      <title>A Logic for Reasoning About Aggregate-Combine Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a modal logic in which counting modalities appear in linear inequalities. We show that each formula can be transformed into an equivalent graph neural network (GNN). We also show that a broad class of GNNs can be transformed efficiently into a formula, thus significantly improving upon the literature about the logical expressiveness of GNNs. We also show that the satisfiability problem is PSPACE-complete. These results bring together the promise of using standard logical methods for reasoning about GNNs and their properties, particularly in applications such as GNN querying, equivalence checking, etc. We prove that such natural problems can be solved in polynomial space.</description>

      <title>CaTT contexts are finite computads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two novel descriptions of weak {\omega}-categories have been recently proposed, using type-theoretic ideas. The first one is the dependent type theory CaTT whose models are {\omega}-categories. The second is a recursive description of a category of computads together with an adjunction to globular sets, such that the algebras for the induced monad are again {\omega}-categories. We compare the two descriptions by showing that there exits a fully faithful morphism of categories with families from the syntactic category of CaTT to the opposite of the category of computads, which gives an equivalence on the subcategory of finite computads. We derive a more direct connection between the category of models of CaTT and the category of algebras for the monad on globular sets, induced by the adjunction with computads.</description>

      <title>A Curry-Howard Correspondence for Linear, Reversible Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a linear and reversible programming language with inductives types and recursion. The semantics of the languages is based on pattern-matching; we show how ensuring syntactical exhaustivity and non-overlapping of clauses is enough to ensure reversibility. The language allows to represent any Primitive Recursive Function. We then give a Curry-Howard correspondence with the logic $\mu$MALL: linear logic extended with least fixed points allowing inductive statements. The critical part of our work is to show how primitive recursion yields circular proofs that satisfy $\mu$MALL validity criterion and how the language simulates the cut-elimination procedure of $\mu$MALL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an NP upper bound on a theory of integer-indexed integer-valued arrays that extends combinatory array logic with an ordering relation on the index set and the ability to express sums of elements. We compare our fragment with seven other fragments in the literature in terms of their expressiveness and computational complexity.</description>
