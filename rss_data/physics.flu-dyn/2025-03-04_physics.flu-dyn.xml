      <title>Numerical investigation of erosive wear considering surface degradation using coupled CFD-DEM and a bond model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-dimensional simulation model is proposed here to study the erosive wear of structure caused by solid particles, which accounts for the accumulation of surface deformation and degradation during the erosion process. Although there are numerous studies on the erosion, they have been primarily based on semi-empirical equations to predict the material loss and lack of an engineering approach to account for the surface evolution during erosion process, which is proved to be of great important. Our proposed model aims to overcome these challenges. In this approach, a conventional volume of solid object is discretized into a number of discrete spherical elements. A bond network is added to connect neighbouring particles at micro-scale, forming a cohesive structure at macro-scale. It is indeed a combination of particulate flow simulation by coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) - Discrete Element Method (DEM) and materials modelling by DEM using a bond model. An extensive study of fluid response in both laminar and turbulent flow is conducted when the traditional continuous rigid object is replaced by a corresponding discrete deformable object composed of bonded spherical particles. The replacement of discrete object allows this model to naturally incorporate the three-way interaction of fluid, structure, and particles. The interaction between fluid and structure at macro-scale is implicitly represented by the interaction between fluid and bonded particles at micro-scale, while material properties and the micro-structure of the solid object are reproduced by properties of bond that account for deformation and fracture. Both resolved and unresolved coupling schemes result in good agreement with the traditional CFD approach.</description>

      <title>Revision of the linear stability paradox for known bounded shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known paradox of linear stability for the some bounded shear flows is not solved up to now and is bypassed on the basis of the non-linear mechanisms consideration. We prove that it is arising only due to an idealized assumption of an exact space periodicity for the small hydrodynamic perturbations. When finite non-zero viscosity is taken into account only quasi-periodic boundary conditions must be used. The conditions of linear instability to the Hagen-Poiseuille flow and to the plane Couette flow are obtained.</description>

      <title>Reduced order modeling of the unsteady pressure on turbine rotor blades using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In transonic turbine stages, complex interactions between trailing edge shocks from nozzle guide vanes and rotor blades generate unsteady wall pressure fields, impacting rotor aerodynamic performance and structural integrity. While shock-related phenomena are prominent, unsteady pressure fluctuations can also arise in subsonic regimes from wake interactions. Traditional methods like Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations are accurate but computationally expensive. To address this, a novel deep learning-based Reduced Order Model (ROM) is proposed, built on a database of URANS simulations, to predict unsteady pressure fields on turbine rotor blades at a fraction of the cost. The model consists of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) integrated with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture time-series data, overcoming the limitations of traditional linear ROMs in capturing nonlinear phenomena, such as moving shocks. The goal is to develop a ROM that accurately reproduces unsteady pressure fields from URANS simulations while reducing computational costs. The ROM is applied to the Turbine Aero-Thermal External Flows (TATEF2) project configuration, a representative test case in turbomachinery research. Model performance is evaluated using machine learning quality metrics and design-oriented criteria, including the accuracy of the first harmonic in the Fourier transform of the unsteady pressure field. The impact of the simulation database size on model accuracy is also analyzed, considering the number of training simulations required for task-specific accuracy as a key factor in industrial applicability.</description>

      <title>Direct Numerical Simulations of Droplet Impact onto Heated Surfaces using the Program Free Surface 3D (FS3D)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet impact onto heated surfaces is a widespread process in industrial applications, particularly in the context of spray cooling techniques. Therefore, it is essential to study the complex phenomenon of droplet spreading, heat removal from a hot surface, and flow distribution during the impact. This study focuses on Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the initial stage of a water droplet impact onto a highly conducting heated surface, below the saturation temperature of the liquid. The maximum spreading diameters at different impact velocities in the presence of a heated surface, are analysed. Free Surface 3D (FS3D), an in-house code developed at the Institute of Aerospace Thermodynamics, University of Stuttgart, is used for this work. A grid independence study investigates the resolution required to resolve the flow field around the droplet. As evaporation effects during the initial stage of the droplet impact process are negligible, they are ignored. However, for longer simulation times, evaporation plays a significant role in the process. Preparing for such simulations, an evaporating droplet in cross flow is simulated to study the performance gain in the newly implemented hybrid OpenMP and MPI parallelisation and red-black optimization in the evaporation routines of FS3D. Both the scaling limit and efficiency were improved by using the hybrid (MPI with OpenMP) parallelisation, while the red-black scheme optimization raised the efficiency only. An improved performance of 23% of the new version is achieved for a test case investigated with the tool MAQAO. Additionally, strong and weak scaling performance tests are conducted. The new version is found to scale up to 256 nodes compared to 128 nodes for the original version. The maximum time-cycles per hour (CPH) achieved with the new version is 35% higher compared to the previous version.</description>

      <title>High viscosity effects on solitary wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental and numerical study of linear and non-linear viscous effects in transient non-linear long wave propagation in Newtonian and shear thinning fluids in the laminar flow regime. Using optical measuring techniques (Fourier Transform Profilometry) and numerical simulations (open-source CFD library OpenFOAM), we show that the wave phase speed decreases in both glycerin and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solutions with respect to that in water. A decrease in wave phase speed is observed, and a dispersion relation is obtained for surface waves through dimensional analysis from five dimensionless groups: the dimensionless wave celerity, the shallowness parameter, dimensionless amplitude, Reynolds number and the flow index. To complete the picture on wave propagation, an empirical dependence between the wave attenuation and the last four dimensionless groups mentioned above is found for non-linear long surface waves. We conclude quantitatively about all the viscosity effects in non-linear long wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Trailing-Edge Jet-Buffet Phenomenon Using Circulation Control at Transonic Speeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of a periodic jet detachment occurring on an elliptic airfoil utilizing circulation control at transonic speeds was evaluated using numerical simulations. As the momentum of the jet increases beyond a prescribed magnitude, the jet begins to detach periodically from the surface of the trailingedge. The effect was analyzed by both URANS calculations as well as by data driven methods such as the Dynamic Mode Decomposition. The results of the investigation showed that the effect, termed jet buffet is decoupled from the dominant shockwave located at the top surface of the wing. Indicating that the jet can no longer augment the wings circulation, and thus the termination of circulation control. Furthermore, it was found that the driving mechanism of the jet buffet originated from a feedback of pressure propagating between the trailing edge shockwave and the downstream separation bubble produced by the jet. Consequently the jet buffet causes noticeable fluctuations in the aerodynamic coefficients and such impacts the design implications of circulation control at transonic flight.</description>

      <title>Poromechanical modelling of responsive hydrogel pumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermo-responsive hydrogels are smart materials that rapidly switch between hydrophilic (swollen) and hydrophobic (shrunken) states when heated past a threshold temperature, resulting in order-of-magnitude changes in gel volume. Modelling the dynamics of this switch is notoriously difficult, and typically involves fitting a large number of microscopic material parameters to experimental data. In this paper, we present and validate an intuitive, macroscopic description of responsive gel dynamics and use it to explore the shrinking, swelling and pumping of responsive hydrogel displacement pumps for microfluidic devices. We finish with a discussion on how such tubular structures may be used to speed up the response times of larger hydrogel smart actuators and unlock new possibilities for dynamic shape change.</description>

      <title>Flowing menisci: coupled dynamics and liquid exchange with soap films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid foams exhibit menisci whose lengths range from hundreds of microns in microfoams to several centimeters in macroscopic bubble arrangements. These menisci thin under gravity until reaching a steady thickness profile, where hydrostatic and capillary pressures are balanced. While these menisci are in contact with soap films, dynamical liquid exchanges between them are neglected in current drainage models, which assume thin films provide a negligible liquid reservoir. Using controlled experiments, we systematically measure the shape of an isolated meniscus placed in a vertical soap film. By increasing the film thickness, we identify a flowing regime in which the flux from the adjacent film significantly enlarges the meniscus. We present an analytical model that extends the drainage equation to incorporate this film flux and introduce a gravito-exchange length, which sets the minimum meniscus thickness. The model is in quantitative agreement with experiments, capturing the transition between hydrostatic and flowing menisci. This study has implications for flowing or rearranging foams, where thick films are commonly observed.</description>

      <title>Probability of Transition to Turbulence in a Reduced Stochastic Model of Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of turbulence initiation in pipe flow under different noise structures by estimating the probability of initiating metastable transitions. We establish lower bounds on turbulence transition probabilities using linearized models with multiplicative noise near the laminar state. First, we consider the case of stochastic perturbations by It\^o white noise; then, through the Stratonovich interpretation, we extend the analysis to noise types such as white and red noise in time. Our findings demonstrate the viability of detecting the onset of turbulence as rare events under diverse noise assumptions. The results also contribute to applied SPDE theory and offer valuable methodologies for understanding turbulence across application areas.</description>

      <title>OptMetaOpenFOAM: Large Language Model Driven Chain of Thought for Sensitivity Analysis and Parameter Optimization based on CFD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Merging natural language interfaces with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) workflows presents transformative opportunities for both industry and research. In this study, we introduce OptMetaOpenFOAM - a novel framework that bridges MetaOpenFOAM with external analysis and optimization tool libraries through a large language model (LLM)-driven chain-of-thought (COT) methodology. By automating complex CFD tasks via natural language inputs, the framework empowers non-expert users to perform sensitivity analyses and parameter optimizations with markedly improved efficiency. The test dataset comprises 11 distinct CFD analysis or optimization tasks, including a baseline simulation task derived from an OpenFOAM tutorial covering fluid dynamics, combustion, and heat transfer. Results confirm that OptMetaOpenFOAM can accurately interpret user requirements expressed in natural language and effectively invoke external tool libraries alongside MetaOpenFOAM to complete the tasks. Furthermore, validation on a non-OpenFOAM tutorial case - namely, a hydrogen combustion chamber - demonstrates that a mere 200-character natural language input can trigger a sequence of simulation, postprocessing, analysis, and optimization tasks spanning over 2,000 lines of code. These findings underscore the transformative potential of LLM-driven COT methodologies in linking external tool for advanced analysis and optimization, positioning OptMetaOpenFOAM as an effective tool that streamlines CFD simulations and enhances their convenience and efficiency for both industrial and research applications.

      <title>Solute transport due to Periodic Loading in a Soft Porous Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In soft porous media, deformation drives solute transport via the intrinsic coupling between flow of the fluid and rearrangement of the pore structure. Solute transport driven by periodic loading, in particular, can be of great relevance in applications including the geomechanics of contaminants in the subsurface and the biomechanics of nutrient transport in living tissues and scaffolds for tissue engineering. However, the basic features of this process have not previously been systematically investigated. Here, we fill this hole in the context of a 1D model problem. We do so by expanding the results from a companion study, in which we explored the poromechanics of periodic deformations, by introducing and analysing the impact of the resulting fluid and solid motion on solute transport. We first characterise the independent roles of the three main mechanisms of solute transport in porous media -- advection, molecular diffusion, and hydrodynamic dispersion -- by examining their impacts on the solute concentration profile during one loading cycle. We next explore the impact of the transport parameters, showing how these alter the relative importance of diffusion and dispersion. We then explore the loading parameters by considering a range of loading periods -- from slow to fast, relative to the poroelastic timescale -- and amplitudes -- from infinitesimal to large. We show that solute spreading over several loading cycle increases monotonically with amplitude, but is maximised for intermediate periods because of the increasing poromechanical localisation of the flow and deformation near the permeable boundary as the period decreases.</description>

      <title>Stability of elastoviscoplastic plane Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several studies have investigated the turbulent flow of elastoviscoplastic (EVP) fluids, which exhibit yield stress in addition to viscoelasticity. The instabilities that could be responsible for the transition to turbulence in the EVP fluid flows remain unknown. Thus, the present explores the linear stability of EVP plane Couette flow (PCF) by employing the Saramito model. The eigenvalue problem is solved by using the pseudo-spectral method. In the limit of vanishing yield stress, EVP fluid behaves as Upper Convected Maxwell (UCM) fluid. The creeping flow of UCM fluid exhibits two stable Gorodotsov \&amp; Leonov (GL) modes, thus a stable flow. As the Bingham number (i.e., yield stress) increases, the GL modes become unstable, implying an unstable flow. Additionally, there are new unstable modes with phase speed equalling the average velocity of the fluid. The analysis reveals an extra tangential stress term, arising due to yield stress, is responsible for the predicted instabilities. Also, the Saramito model exhibits weak Hadamard instability, i.e., unstable perturbations of arbitrarily small wavelengths. The present study demonstrates the removal of the Hadamard instability by adding a stress diffusion term in the Saramito constitutive equation. To conclude, the PCF of an EVP fluid is linearly unstable.</description>

      <title>Flow control of three-dimensional cylinders transitioning to turbulence via multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing active-flow-control (AFC) strategies for three-dimensional (3D) bluff bodies is a challenging task with critical industrial implications. In this study we explore the potential of discovering novel control strategies for drag reduction using deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a high-dimensional AFC setup on a 3D cylinder, considering Reynolds numbers ($Re_D$) from $100$ to $400$, which is a range including the transition to 3D wake instabilities. The setup involves multiple zero-net-mass-flux jets positioned on the top and bottom surfaces, aligned into two slots. The method relies on coupling the computational-fluid-dynamics solver with a multi-agent reinforcement-learning (MARL) framework based on the proximal-policy-optimization algorithm. MARL offers several advantages: it exploits local invariance, adaptable control across geometries, facilitates transfer learning and cross-application of agents, and results in a significant training speedup. \rev{For instance, our results demonstrate $16\%$ drag reduction for $Re_D=400$, outperforming classical periodic control, which yields up to $6\%$ reduction.} A proper-orthogonal-decomposition (POD) analysis at $Re_D=400$ reveals that the DRL control results in a stable wake structure with longer recirculation bubble. To the authors' knowledge, the present MARL-based framework represents the first time where training is conducted in 3D cylinders. This breakthrough paves the way for conducting AFC on progressively more complex turbulent-flow configurations.</description>

      <title>Feigenbaum universality in subcritical Taylor-Couette flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feigenbaum universality is shown to occur in subcritical shear flows. Our testing ground is the counter-rotation regime of the Taylor-Couette flow, where numerical calculations are performed within a small periodic domain. The accurate computation of up to the seventh period doubling bifurcation, assisted by a purposely defined Poincar\'e section, has enabled us to reproduce the two Feigenbaum universal constants with unprecedented accuracy in a fluid flow problem. We have further devised a method to predict the bifurcation diagram up to the accumulation point of the cascade based on the detailed inspection of just the first few period doubling bifurcations. Remarkably, the method is applicable beyond the accumulation point, with predictions remaining valid, in a statistical sense, for the chaotic dynamics that follows.</description>

Abstract: Flow control around bluff bodies, such as elliptical cylinders, is crucial in various engineering applications, where drag reduction and vortex shedding suppression are key objectives.This study trains a flow control strategy based on reinforcement learning (RL) to control the flow around an elliptical cylinder between two walls. The theme of this study is to explore whether multi-objective flow control can be achieved for elliptical cylinders with varying aspect ratios (Ar) under low energy consumption conditions. The RL training results indicate that for elliptical cylinders with larger Ar, the control strategy successfully reduces drag, minimizes lift fluctuations, and completely suppresses vortex shedding, all while consuming minimal external energy.However, as the Ar decreases, achieving the desired multi-objective control becomes increasingly difficult, even with substantial external energy consumption.Through physical analysis, we find that the interaction between the blockage ratio (\beta) and Ar limits the effective suppression of vortex shedding, thereby affecting the performance of the control strategy in stabilizing wake dynamics.Further, by reducing \beta, the study demonstrates consistent multi-objective control across all Ar values while maintaining energy efficiency.For extremely slender cylinders, balancing energy consumption with performance remains a challenge, yet vortex shedding is still effectively suppressed.This work underscores the efficacy of RL-driven flow control in achieving stabilization of the flow around slender bluff bodies.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient flow control via optimized synthetic jet placement using deep reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: This study utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to develop flow control strategies for circular and square cylinders, enhancing energy efficiency and minimizing energy consumption while addressing the limitations of traditional methods.We find that the optimal jet placement for both square and circular cylinders is at the main flow separation point, achieving the best balance between energy efficiency and control effectiveness.For the circular cylinder, positioning the jet at approximately 105{\deg} from the stagnation point requires only 1% of the inlet flow rate and achieves an 8% reduction in drag, with energy consumption one-third of that at other positions. For the square cylinder, placing the jet near the rear corner requires only 2% of the inlet flow rate, achieving a maximum drag reduction of 14.4%, whereas energy consumption near the front corner is 27 times higher, resulting in only 12% drag reduction.In multi-action control, the convergence speed and stability are lower compared to single-action control, but activating multiple jets significantly reduces initial energy consumption and improves energy efficiency. Physically, the interaction of the synthetic jet with the flow generates new vortices that modify the local flow structure, significantly enhancing the cylinder's aerodynamic performance.Our control strategy achieves a superior balance between energy efficiency and control performance compared to previous studies, underscoring its significant potential to advance sustainable and effective flow control.</description>

      <title>Hybrid LES/RANS for flows including separation: A new wall function using Machine Learning based on binary search trees</title>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used for developing wall functions for Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulations (IDDES). The ML model is based on KDtree which essentially is a fast look-up table. It searches the nearest target datapoint(s) for which y+ and U+ are closest to the CFD y+ and U+ cells. The target y+ value gives the friction velocity which is used for setting the wall shear stress for the wall-parallel velocity and for fixing k and epsilon at the wall-adjacent cells. Two target databases are created from time-averaged data of low-Reynolds number (i.e. wall-resolved) IDDES: diffuser flow with opening angle alpha=15 degrees and hump flow.
  The new ML wall function is used to predict five test cases: diffuser flow with opening angles alpha=15 degrees and alpha=10 degrees the hump flow, channel flow at $Re_tau=16 000 and flat-plate boundary layer.
  A novel grid strategy is used. The wall-adjacent cells are large (20 &lt; y+ &lt; 60 in attached boundary layers). But further away from the wall, the wall-normal cell distribution is identical to that of a low-Re number grid. This new grid is found to improve the predictions compared to a standard wall-function grid.
  It is found that the number of cells for a wall-resolved IDDES grid (grid stretching 15%) is a factor of 0.2ln(Re_tau) larger than that of a standard wall-functions mesh (constant wall-normal grid cells).
  The new ML wall function is found to perform well compared to the low-Re IDDES and better than the Reichardt's wall function</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion equations describe heat transfer and flow structure in annular convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat transfer in a fluid can be be greatly enhanced by natural convection, giving rise to the nuanced relationship between the Nusselt number and Rayleigh number that has been a focus of modern fluid dynamics. Our work explores convection in an annular domain, where the geometry reinforces the large-scale circulatory flow pattern that is characteristic of natural convection. The flow must match the no-slip condition at the boundary, leading to a thin boundary layer where both the flow velocity and the temperature vary rapidly. Within such a geometry, a novel Nusselt-Rayleigh scaling emerges, suggesting subtle differences in the heat transfer mechanisms as compared to the well-known case of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection. To understand the heat transfer characteristics of this system, we derive a reduced model from the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations where the equations of flow and heat are transformed to a system of low-order partial differential equations (PDEs). This system of PDEs takes the form of a reaction-diffusion system, and its solution preserves the same boundary layer structures seen in the direct numerical simulation (DNS). By matching the solutions inside and outside the boundary layer, our asymptotic analysis recovers the Nusselt-Rayleigh relationship measured in DNS and yields a power-law scaling with exponent 1/4.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work characterises the starting vortex and unsteady shear layer generated by an impulsively started National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics 0010 (NACA 0010) airfoil at angles of attack ranging from 3 degrees- 7 degrees. Measurements are obtained by using time resolved Particle Image Velocimetry. The net circulation in the field is accurately predicted by Wagner's function. It is observed that the starting vortex detaches from the shear layer whilst the airfoil is surging. Starting vortex circulation at detachment is presented for a range of surge speeds at pre-stall angles of attack for a given surge distance. Kinematic conditions resulting in starting vortex detachment are examined qualitatively through Finite Time Lyapunov Exponents and quantitatively through a non-dimensional velocity ratio. Furthermore, the formation of secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz-type vortices in the shear layer is found to depend on the Reynolds number rather than the detachment of the starting vortex.</description>

      <title>Multiscale circulation in wall-parallel planes of turbulent channel flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wall turbulence consists of various sizes of vortical structures that induce flow circulation around a wide range of closed Eulerian loops. Here we investigate the multiscale properties of circulation around such loops in statistically homogeneous planes parallel to the wall. Using a high-resolution direct numerical simulation database of turbulent channels at Reynolds numbers of $Re_\tau=180$, 550, 1000 and 5200, circulation statistics are obtained in planes at different wall-normal heights. Intermittency of circulation in the planes of the outer flow ($y^+ \gtrsim 0.1Re_\tau$) takes the form of universal bifractality as in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. The bifractal character simplifies to space-filling character close to the wall, with scaling exponents that are linear in the moment order, and lower than those given by the Kolmogorov paradigm. The probability density functions of circulation are long-tailed in the outer bifractal region, {with evidence showing their invariance with respect to the loop aspect ratio}, while those in the inner region are closely Gaussian. The unifractality near the wall implies that the circulation there is not intermittent in character.</description>

      <title>Transient growth and nonlinear breakdown of wavelet-based resolvent modes in turbulent channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effectiveness of the time-localised principal resolvent forcing mode at actuating the near wall cycle of turbulence. The mode is restricted to a wavelet pulse and computed from an SVD of the windowed wavelet-based resolvent operator so that it produces the largest amplification via the linearised Navier-Stokes equations. We then inject this time-localised mode into the turbulent minimal flow unit at different intensities, and measure the instantaneous deviation of the system's response from the optimal resolvent response mode. This is possible under the new formulation, which enables the modes to represent transient trajectories. For the most energetic spatial wave numbers in the minimal flow unit -- constant in the streamwise direction and once-periodic in the spanwise direction -- the forcing mode takes the shape of streamwise rolls and produces a response mode in the form of streamwise streaks that transiently grow and decay. For initial times and close to the wall, the DNS response matches the principal response mode well, but due to nonlinearities, the response across all forcing intensities decays prematurely, and a higher forcing intensity leads to faster energy decay. The principal forcing mode still leads to significant energy amplification and is more effective than a randomly-generated forcing structure and the second suboptimal resolvent forcing mode at amplifying the near-wall streaks. We compute the nonlinear energy transfer to secondary modes and observe that the breakdown of the actuated mode proceeds similarly across all forcing intensities: in the near-wall region, the induced streak forks into a structure twice periodic in the spanwise direction; in the outer region, the streak breaks up into a structure that is once periodic in the streamwise direction. In both regions, spanwise gradients account for the dominant share of nonlinear energy transfer.</description>

      <title>An Insight into Parameter Identifiability Issues in the Carreau-Yasuda Model: a More Consistent Rheological Formulation for Shear-thinning non-Newtonian Inelastic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14728v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Carreau-Yasuda rheological model is widely employed in both research and industrial applications to describe the shear-thinning behaviour of non-Newtonian inelastic fluids. However, its calibration against experimental data is often affected by intrinsic identifiability issues, which can lead to misleading physical interpretations of model parameters and unreliable flow predictions. In this paper, starting from the analysis of the identifiability challenges associated with the Carreau-Yasuda model, a novel rheological formulation for shear-thinning non-Newtonian inelastic fluids is proposed. Analytical results and exemplary numerical case studies demonstrate that the proposed formulation is based on physically meaningful model parameters, whose identifiability is not compromised by the key limitations of the Carreau-Yasuda model. Moreover, the new approach allows for effective parameter estimation through a straightforward direct identification strategy, eliminating the need for inverse calibration procedures based on optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductance Correlations of Static Lubricated Ball Bearings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ball bearings are commonly used to reduce the friction in rotating mechanical components. The present work reports improved numerical approaches to model bearing thermal conductance in the absence of convection. We start by modeling the thermal pathway across a single ball-to-race pathway for a simplified geometry, an azimuthally symmetric ball in contact with a flat surface (ball-on-flat). A first-principles approach is used to calculate the static lubricant meniscus shape using a custom-developed Python code. We apply the finite element method (FEM) to extract total thermal conductance of the lubricated ball-on-flat system. Using similar methods, we also present a three-dimensional numerical model of the lubricant meniscus in a static angular contact ball bearing section (ball-on-race). By generating thermal conductance correlations for Yovanovich's classic lubricated model, our two-dimensional multiphysics model, and our three-dimensional multiphysics model, we enable comparison of the results of all three models. To compare them, parametric studies are conducted to illustrate the effect of lubricant volume and applied load on the total thermal conductance for each model. The hierarchical methodology reported here improves both the fidelity of tribo-thermo-mechanical modeling and establishes a reference for the accuracy of commonly used geometric approximations for thermal transport in spacecraft ball bearings.</description>

      <title>A review of Bayesian sensor-based estimation and uncertainty quantification of aerodynamic flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many applications in aerodynamics depend on the use of sensors to estimate the evolving state of the flow. In particular, a wide variety of traditional and learning-based strategies for closed-loop control rely on some knowledge of the aerodynamic state in order to decide on actions. This estimation task is inherently accompanied by uncertainty due to the noisy measurements of sensors or the non-uniqueness of the underlying mapping, and knowledge of this uncertainty can be as important for decision-making as that of the state itself. The tracking of uncertainty is challenged by the often-nonlinear relationship between the sensor measurements and the flow state. For example, a collection of passing vortices leaves a footprint in wall pressure sensors that depends nonlinearly on the strengths and positions of the vortices. In this paper, we will review the recent body of work on flow estimation. We will discuss the basic tools of probability, including sampling and estimation, in the powerful setting of Bayesian inference and demonstrate these tools in static flow estimation examples. We will then proceed to unsteady examples and illustrate the application of sequential estimation, and particularly, the ensemble Kalman filter. Finally, we will discuss uncertainty quantification in neural network approximations of the mappings between sensor measurements and flow states. Recent aerodynamic applications of neural networks have shown that the flow state can be encoded into a very low-dimensional latent space, and we will discuss the implications of this encoding on uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Hemodynamic analysis of the Pulsatile Flow in Tubes of Bipolar Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsatile flow through compressed or defective blood vessels is a topic of fundamental importance in hemodynamics, particularly in cardiovascular research. This study examines flow dynamics within a tube with a bipolar cross section, possibly representing the geometry of bicuspid aortic valves (BAV), aortic bifurcations, and the aortic arch regions where non-uniform vessel shapes significantly influence hemodynamic behavior. An analytical solution is derived for the governing equations of pulsatile and poiseuille flow in a bipolar cross-sectional tube. The analysis focuses on the velocity field, flow rate, and wall shear stress (WSS) across different pulsation frequencies and geometric parameters, highlighting how these factors interact to shape flow characteristics. At low frequencies, the velocity profile remains smooth, with gradual acceleration and deceleration phases. In contrast, at higher frequencies, oscillatory effects become more pronounced, and the peak volume flow, initially occurring near ${\omega}t=0$ and ${\omega}t$=${\pi}$, shifts toward an earlier phase in the cycle ${\omega}t=0$ to ${\omega}t={\pi}/2)$ before stabilizing at very high frequencies. Shear stress behavior also exhibits frequency-dependent variations. At low frequencies, the fluid responds smoothly to pressure gradients, producing a shear stress distribution similar to steady flow. However, as frequency increases, inertial and unsteady effects introduce phase lags, leading to more complex shear stress patterns. These findings provide valuable insights into the interplay between vessel geometry and pulsatile forces, with implications for understanding disease progression and refining diagnostic models in cardiovascular medicine.</description>
