      <title>Impacts of Climate Change-Induced Salinity Intrusion on Physiological Parameters of Aquatic Hydrophytes from Coastal Rivers of Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing temperature, precipitation regimes, and sea level rise, often associated with climate change, cause salinity intrusion into groundwater and surface water, affecting aquatic ecosystems. This study investigates the impacts of salinity on the physiological traits of freshwater hydrophytes, including Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), Buffalo Spinach (Enhydra fluctuans), and Taro (Colocasia esculenta). The plants were exposed to salinity concentrations of 0, 10, 20, and 30 ppt for 48 hours. Parameters such as biomass, stomata density, transpiration rate, chlorophyll content, relative water content, and histo-architectural changes were analyzed. The results showed a decline in biomass, stomatal density, and relative water content with increasing salinity. Taro demonstrated higher salt tolerance compared to other species. Histological observations revealed deformities in root and tuber tissues under saline stress. These findings highlight the critical impacts of climate change-induced salinity on aquatic plant ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Mating versus alternative blood sources as determinants to mosquito abundance and population resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deterministic nonlinear ordinary differential equation model for mosquito dynamics in which the mosquitoes can quest for blood either within a human population or within non-human/vertebrate populations is derived and studied. The model captures both the mosquito's aquatic and terrestrial forms and includes a mechanism to investigate the impact of mating on mosquito dynamics. The model uses a restricted form of homogeneous mixing based on the idea that the mosquito has a blood-feeding habit by accounting for the mosquitoes' blood-feeding preferences as well as its gonotrophic cycle. This characterization allows us to compartmentalise the total mosquito population into distinct compartments according to the spatial location of the mosquito (breeding site, resting places and questing places) as well as blood-fed status. Issues of overcrowding and intraspecific competition both within the aquatic and the terrestrial stages of the mosquito's life forms are addressed and considered in the model. Results show that the inclusion of mating induces bi-stability; a phenomenon whereby locally stable trivial and non-trivial equilibria co-exist with an unstable non-zero equilibrium. The local nature of the stable equilibria is demonstrated by numerically showing that the long-term state of the system is sensitive to initial conditions. The bi-stability state is analogous to the phenomenon of the Allee effect that has been reported in population biology. The model's results, including the derivation of the threshold parameter of the system, are comprehensively tested via numerical simulations. The output of our model has direct application to mosquito control strategies, for it clearly shows key points in the mosquito's developmental pathway that can be targeted for control purposes.</description>

      <title>Infinite Mixture Models for Improved Modeling of Across-Site Evolutionary Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific studies in many areas of biology routinely employ evolutionary analyses based on the probabilistic inference of phylogenetic trees from molecular sequence data. Evolutionary processes that act at the molecular level are highly variable, and properly accounting for heterogeneity in evolutionary processes is crucial for more accurate phylogenetic inference. Nucleotide substitution rates and patterns are known to vary among sites in multiple sequence alignments, and such variation can be modeled by partitioning alignments into categories corresponding to different substitution models. Determining $\textit{a priori}$ appropriate partitions can be difficult, however, and better model fit can be achieved through flexible Bayesian infinite mixture models that simultaneously infer the number of partitions, the partition that each site belongs to, and the evolutionary parameters corresponding to each partition. Here, we consider several different types of infinite mixture models, including classic Dirichlet process mixtures, as well as novel approaches for modeling across-site evolutionary variation: hierarchical models for data with a natural group structure, and infinite hidden Markov models that account for spatial patterns in alignments. In analyses of several viral data sets, we find that different types of infinite mixture models emerge as the best choices in different scenarios. To enable these models to scale efficiently to large data sets, we adapt efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms and exploit opportunities for parallel computing. We implement this infinite mixture modeling framework in BEAST X, a widely-used software package for Bayesian phylogenetic inference.</description>

      <title>The transition to speciation in the finite genome Derrida-Higgs model: a heuristic solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of speciation, where an ancestral species divides in two or more new species, involves several geographic, environmental and genetic components that interact in a complex way. Understanding all these elements at once is challenging and simple models can help unveiling the role of each factor separately. The Derrida-Higgs model describes the evolution of a sexually reproducing population subjected to mutations in a well mixed population. Individuals are characterized by a string with entries $\pm1$ representing a haploid genome with biallelic genes. If mating is restricted by genetic similarity, so that only individuals that are sufficiently similar can mate, sympatric speciation, i.e. the emergence of species without geographic isolation, can occur. Only four parameters rule the dynamics: population size $N$, mutation rate $\mu$, minimum similarity for mating $q_{min}$ and genome size $B$. In the limit $B\rightarrow\infty$, speciation occurs if the simple condition $q_{min}&gt;(1+4\mu N)^{-1}$ is satisfied. However, this condition fails for finite genomes, and speciation does not occur if the genome size is too small. This indicates the existence of a critical genome size for speciation. In this work, we develop an analytical theory of the distribution of similarities between individuals, a quantity that defines how tight or spread out is the genetic content of the population. This theory is carried out in the absence of mating restrictions, where evolution equations for the mean and variance of the similarity distribution can be derived. We then propose a heuristic description of the speciation transition which allows us to numerically calculate the critical genome size for speciation as a function of the other model parameters. The result is in good agreement with the simulations of the model and may guide further investigations on theoretical conditions for species formation.</description>

      <title>Argentine ants regulate traffic flow with stopped individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the emerging traffic patterns of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) as they navigated a narrow bridge between their nest and a food source. By tracking ant movements in experiments with varying bridge widths and colony sizes and analyzing the resulting trajectories, we discovered that a small subset of ants stopped for long periods of time, acting as obstacles and affecting traffic flow. Interestingly, the fraction of these stopped ants increased with wider bridges, suggesting a mechanism to reduce traffic flow to a narrower section of the bridge. To quantify transport efficiency, we measured the average speed of the ants on the bridge as a function of the pressure of ants arriving at the bridge, finding this relationship to be an increasing but saturating function of the pressure. We developed an agent-based model for ant movement and interactions to better understand these dynamics. Including stopped agents in the model was crucial to explaining the experimental observations. We further validated our hypothesis by introducing artificial obstacles on the bridges and found that our simulations accurately mirrored the experimental data when these obstacles were included. These findings provide new insights into how Argentine ants self-organize to manage traffic, highlighting a unique form of dynamic obstruction that enhances traffic flow in high-density conditions. This study advances our understanding of self-regulation in biological traffic systems and suggests potential applications for managing human traffic in congested environments.</description>

      <title>Epidemiology of the Living Dead: A social Force Model of a Zombie Outbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt the social force model of crowd dynamics to capture the evacuation during a zombie outbreak from an academic building. Individuals navigate the building, opening doors, and evacuate to the nearest exit. Zombies chase the uninfected individuals, and once caught there is a probability of a susceptible individual being infected or killed, or for the zombie to be killed by the person being attacked. We find that the speed of the zombies plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the evacuation, the rate of infection, and the number of casualties during the outbreak. The model leads to insights that may be relevant to other, less fictitious, emergency situations.</description>

      <title>Large-sample analysis of cost functionals for inference under the coalescent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coalescent is a foundational model of latent genealogical trees under neutral evolution, but suffers from intractable sampling probabilities. Methods for approximating these sampling probabilities either introduce bias or fail to scale to large sample sizes. We show that a class of cost functionals of the coalescent with recurrent mutation and a finite number of alleles converge to tractable processes in the infinite-sample limit. A particular choice of costs yields insight about importance sampling methods, which are a classical tool for coalescent sampling probability approximation. These insights reveal that the behaviour of coalescent importance sampling algorithms differs markedly from standard sequential importance samplers, with or without resampling. We conduct a simulation study to verify that our asymptotics are accurate for algorithms with finite (and moderate) sample sizes. Our results also facilitate the a priori optimisation of computational resource allocation for coalescent sequential importance sampling. We do not observe the same behaviour for importance sampling methods under the infinite sites model of mutation, which is regarded as a good and more tractable approximation of finite alleles mutation in most respects.</description>

      <title>Hypothesizing the Transmission of Smells: Six Methods of Chemical Travel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hypothesis regarding the travel and movement of chemicals between locations. We introduce six distinct methods to explain this process. The chemicals referred to in this article are those that we detect by the nose and can travel through the air. These are generally known as odorants or volatile compounds. Method 1 involves decomposing chemicals and transmitting their formulas digitally. Method 2 embeds chemicals in water, freezes it into ice, and transports it to the receiver, where the chemicals are extracted upon melting. Method 3 transfers chemicals via water logistics, with the receiver extracting them from the water. Method 4 uses airtight pipelines to transport chemicals in water, which are then extracted by the receiver. Method 5 projects chemical odors into the air, where the receiver captures them using suction. Method 6 draws from optical fiber technology to transmit chemical odors through a cable, ensuring the chemical composition remains intact. Each method ensures the receiver experiences the same scent as the sender.</description>

      <title>A statistical framework for detecting therapy-induced resistance from drug screens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resistance to therapy remains a significant challenge in cancer treatment, often due to the presence of a stem-like cell population that drives tumor recurrence post-treatment. Moreover, many anticancer therapies induce plasticity, converting initially drug-sensitive cells to a more resistant state, e.g. through epigenetic processes and de-differentiation programs. Understanding the balance between therapeutic anti-tumor effects and induced resistance is critical for identifying treatment strategies. In this study, we introduce a robust statistical framework, based on multi-type branching process models of the evolutionary dynamics of tumor cell populations, to detect and quantify therapy-induced resistance phenomena from high throughput drug screening data. Through comprehensive in silico experiments, we show the efficacy of our framework in estimating parameters governing population dynamics and drug responses in a heterogeneous tumor population where cell state transitions are influenced by the drug. Finally, using recent in vitro data from multiple sources, we demonstrate that our framework is effective for analyzing real-world data and generating meaningful predictions.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale phylodynamic modelling of rapid punctuated pathogen evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational multi-scale pandemic modelling remains a major and timely challenge. Here we identify specific requirements for a new class of pandemic models operating across three scales: (1) rapid pathogen evolution, punctuated by emergence of new variants, (2) human interactions within a heterogeneous population, and (3) public health responses which constrain individual actions to control the disease transmission. We then present a pandemic modelling framework satisfying these requirements and capable of simulating multi-scale dynamic feedback loops. The developed framework comprises a stochastic agent-based model of pandemic spread, coupled with a phylodynamic model of the within-host pathogen evolution. It is validated with a case study, modelling a rapid punctuated evolution of SARS-CoV-2, based on global and contemporary genomic surveillance data, during the COVID-19 transmission within a large heterogeneous population. We demonstrate that the model captures the essential features of the COVID-19 pandemic and the novel coronavirus evolution, while retaining computational tractability and scalability.</description>
