      <title>Probing Electrical Properties of A Silicon Nanocrystal Thin Film Using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on a thin film of Si nanocrystals (SiNCs) while applying DC or AC external biases to extract the resistance and the capacitance of the thin film. The measurement consists of the application of 10 V DC or square wave pulses of 10 V amplitude to the sample at various frequencies ranging from 0.01 Hz to 1 MHz while recording X-ray photoemission data. To analyze the data, we propose three different models with varying degrees of accuracy. The calculated capacitance of SiNCs agrees with the experimental value in the literature.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Interface Printing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing is an expanding multidisciplinary field encompassing applications including medical devices, aerospace components, microfabrication strategies, and artificial organs. Among additive manufacturing approaches, light-based printing technologies, including two-photon polymerization, projection micro stereolithography, and volumetric printing, have garnered significant attention due to their speed, resolution and/or potential applications for biofabrication. In this study, we introduce dynamic interface printing (DIP), a new 3D printing approach that leverages an acoustically modulated, constrained air-liquid boundary to rapidly generate cm-scale three-dimensional structures within tens of seconds. Distinct from volumetric approaches, this process eliminates the need for intricate feedback systems, specialized chemistry, or complex optics while maintaining rapid printing speeds. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique across a broad array of materials and intricate geometries, including those that would be impossible to print via conventional layer-by-layer methods. In doing so, we demonstrate the rapid fabrication of complex structures in-situ, overprinting, structural parallelisation, and biofabrication utility. Moreover, we showcase that the formation of surface waves at this boundary enables enhanced mass transport, material flexibility, and permits three-dimensional particle patterning. We therefore anticipate that this approach will be invaluable for applications where high resolution, scalable throughput, and biocompatible printing is required.</description>

      <title>Photonic-Electronic Integrated Circuits for High-Performance Computing and AI Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, the demand for computational power has surged, particularly with the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI). As we navigate the post-Moore's law era, the limitations of traditional electrical digital computing, including process bottlenecks and power consumption issue, are propelling the search for alternative computing paradigms. Among various emerging technologies, integrated photonics stands out as a promising solution for the next generation of high-performance computing due to the inherent advantages of light, such as low latency, high bandwidth, and unique multiplexing techniques. Furthermore, the progress in photonic integrated circuits (PICs), which are equipped with abundant photoelectronic components, positions photonic-electronic integrated circuits as a viable solution for high-performance computing and as hardware AI accelerators. In this review, we survey recent advancements in both PIC-based digital and analog computing for AI, exploring the principal benefits and obstacles of implementation. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive analysis of photonic AI from the perspectives of hardware implementation, accelerator architecture, and software-hardware co-design. In the end, acknowledging the existing challenges, we underscore potential strategies for overcoming these issues and offer insights into the future drivers for optical computing.</description>

      <title>All van der Waals three-terminal SOT-MRAM realized by topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time, realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected: the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Interference patterns of propagating spin wave in spin Hall oscillator arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss the observation of spin wave interference generated by magnetic oscillators. We employ micromagnetic simulations for two coherent spin Hall nanowire oscillators positioned nearby, horizontally or vertically. The two nanowires produce circular waves with short wavelengths on the order of 100 nm, which interfere with each other. In the horizontal configuration, the spin waves exhibit constructive and destructive fringes, indicating amplification or cancellation of the amplitudes, respectively. The synchronization of spin waves in the current geometry of the two nanowires is facilitated by the combination of dipolar field and propagating spin waves. Additionally, the vertical alignment results in standing spin waves characterized by multiple antinodes and nodes. These observations are interpreted using a wave model that incorporates the superposition principle for each case.</description>

      <title>Two-photon polymerization of optical microresonators for precise pH sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In water monitoring, environmental analysis, cell culture stability, and biomedical applications, precise pH control is demanded. Traditional methods like pH strips and meters have limitations: pH strips lack precision, while electrochemical meters, though more accurate, are fragile, prone to drift, and unsuitable for small volumes. In this paper, we propose a method for optical detection of the pH value based on the multiplexed sensor with 4D microcavities fabricated with two-photon polymerization. This approach employs pH-triggered reversible variations in microresonator geometry and integrates hundreds of dual optically coupled 4D microcavities to achieve the detection limit of 0.003 pH units. The proposed solution is a clear instance for the use-case oriented application of the two-photon polymerized structures of high optical quality. With benefits of the multiplexed imaging platform, dual 4D microresonators can be integrated alongside other microresonator types for pH-corrected biochemical studies.</description>

      <title>Broad Instantaneous Bandwidth Microwave Spectrum Analyzer with a Microfabricated Atomic Vapor Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on broad instantaneous bandwidth microwave spectrum analysis with hot $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms in a microfabricated vapor cell in a large magnetic field gradient. The sensor is a MEMS atomic vapor cell filled with isotopically pure $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ and $\mathrm{N}_2$ buffer gas to localize the motion of the atoms. The microwave signals of interest are coupled through a coplanar waveguide to the cell, inducing spin flip transitions between optically pumped ground states of the atoms. A static magnetic field with large gradient maps the $\textit{frequency spectrum}$ of the input microwave signals to a position-dependent $\textit{spin-flip pattern}$ on absorption images of the cell recorded with a laser beam onto a camera. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate a microwave spectrum analyzer that has $\approx$ 1 GHz instantaneous bandwidth centered at 13.165 GHz, 3 MHz frequency resolution, 2 kHz refresh rate, and a -23 dBm single-tone microwave power detection limit in 1 s measurement time. A theoretical model is constructed to simulate the image signals by considering the processes of optical pumping, microwave interaction, diffusion of $^{87}\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms, and laser absorption. We expect to reach more than 25 GHz instantaneous bandwidth in an optimized setup, limited by the applied magnetic field gradient. Our demonstration offers a practical alternative to conventional microwave spectrum analyzers based on electronic heterodyne detection.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Numerical Method for Modeling Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (JTWPAs) are wideband, ultralow-noise amplifiers used to enable the readout of superconducting qubits. While individual JTWPAs have achieved high performance, behavior between devices is inconsistent due to wide manufacturing tolerances. Amplifier designs could be modified to improve resilience towards variations in amplifier components; however, existing device models often rely on analytical techniques that typically fail to incorporate component variations. To begin addressing this issue, a 1D numerical method for modeling JTWPAs is introduced in this work. The method treats the Josephson junctions and transmission lines in an amplifier as coupled subsystems and can easily incorporate arbitrary parameter variations. We discretize the transmission line subsystem with a finite element time domain method and the Josephson junction subsystem with a finite difference method, with leapfrog time marching used to evolve the system in time. We validate our method by comparing the computed gain to an analytical model for a traditional JTWPA architecture and one with resonant phase matching. We then use our method to demonstrate the impact of variations in Josephson junctions and phase-matching resonators on amplification. In future work, the method will be adjusted to incorporate additional amplifier architectures and extended to a 3D full-wave approach.</description>

      <title>Physics-Enhanced Multi-fidelity Learning for Optical Surface Imprint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human fingerprints serve as one unique and powerful characteristic for each person, from which policemen can recognize the identity. Similar to humans, many natural bodies and intrinsic mechanical qualities can also be uniquely identified from surface characteristics. To measure the elasto-plastic properties of one material, one formally sharp indenter is pushed into the measured body under constant force and retracted, leaving a unique residual imprint of the minute size from several micrometers to nanometers. However, one great challenge is how to map the optical image of this residual imprint into the real wanted mechanical properties, \ie, the tensile force curve. In this paper, we propose a novel method to use multi-fidelity neural networks (MFNN) to solve this inverse problem. We first build up the NN model via pure simulation data, and then bridge the sim-to-real gap via transfer learning. Considering the difficulty of collecting real experimental data, we use NN to dig out the unknown physics and also implant the known physics into the transfer learning framework, thus highly improving the model stability and decreasing the data requirement. The final constructed model only needs three-shot calibration of real materials. We tested the final model across 20 real materials and achieved satisfying accuracy. This work serves as one great example of applying machine learning into scientific research, especially under the constraints of data limitation and fidelity variance.</description>

      <title>Additively manufactured ceramics for compact quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum technologies are advancing from fundamental research in specialized laboratories to practical applications in the field, driving the demand for robust, scalable, and reproducible system integration techniques. Ceramic components can be pivotal thanks to high stiffness, low thermal expansion, and excellent dimensional stability under thermal stress. We explore lithography-based additive manufacturing of technical ceramics especially for miniaturized physics packages and electro-optical systems. This approach enables functional systems with precisely manufactured, intricate structures and high mechanical stability while minimizing size and weight. It facilitates rapid prototyping, simplifies fabrication and leads to highly integrated, reliable devices. As an electrical insulator with low outgassing and high temperature stability, printed technical ceramics such as Al2O3 and AlN bridge a technology gap in quantum technology and offer advantages over other printable materials. We demonstrate this potential with CerAMRef, a micro-integrated rubidium D2 line optical frequency reference on a printed Al2O3 micro-optical bench and housing. The frequency instability of the reference is comparable to laboratory setups while the volume of the integrated spectroscopy setup is only 6 ml. We identify potential for future applications in compact atomic magnetometers, miniaturized optical atom traps, and vacuum system integration.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport in a 2D amorphous material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) crystals proved revolutionary soon after graphene was discovered in 2004. However, 2D amorphous materials only became accessible in 2020 and remain largely unexplored. In particular, the thermophysical properties of amorphous materials are of great interest upon transition from 3D to 2D. Here, we probe thermal transport in 2D amorphous carbon. A cross-plane thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) down to 0.079 $\rm{Wm}^{-1}K^{-1}$ is measured for van der Waals stacked multilayers at room temperature, which is among the lowest reported to date. Meanwhile, an unexpectedly high in-plane $\kappa$ is obtained for freestanding monolayers which is a few times larger than what is predicted by conventional wisdom for 3D amorphous carbon with similar $\rm{sp}^{2}$ fraction. Our molecular dynamics simulations reveal the role of disorder and highlight the impact of dimensionality. Amorphous materials at the 2D limit open up new avenues for understanding and manipulating heat at the atomic scale.</description>
