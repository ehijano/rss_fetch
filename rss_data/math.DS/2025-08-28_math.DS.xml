      <title>Slope gap distribution of the double heptagon and an algorithm for determining winning vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distribution of renormalized gaps between slopes of saddle connections on translation surfaces. Specifically, we describe a procedure for finding the "winning holonomy vectors" as defined by Kumanduri-Sanchez-Wang in arXiv:2102.10069, which constitutes a key step in calculating the slope gap distribution for an arbitrary Veech surface. We then apply this method to explicitly compute the gap distribution for the regular double heptagon translation surface. This extends work of Athreya-Chaika-Lelievre in arXiv:1308.4203 on the gap distribution for the "golden L" translation surface, which is equivalent to the regular double pentagon surface.</description>

      <title>Ruelle's zeta function for non-Archimedean rational maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the transfer operators defined over $\mathbb{C}_p$-valued analytic functions for subhyperbolic rational maps on $\mathbb{Q}_p$, and showed that the corresponding Ruelle's zeta functions are meromorphic on $\mathbb{C}_p$. We also used $\mathbb{R}$-valued transfer operators to study the shape of the corresponding Julia sets, and proved a Levin-Sodin-Yuditski type identity for general rational maps on $\mathbb{C}_p$. In all the results above, $\mathbb{Q}_p$ can be replaced with any non-Archimedean local field with characteristic $0$, and $\mathbb{C}_p$ the metric completion of its algebraic closure.</description>

      <title>Generalized Stochastic Resilience for Early Warning Signals Based on Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing methods for detecting tipping phenomena at an early stage is an important problem in various fields such as ecology, medicine, and economics. A tipping phenomenon is characterized by a rapid transition resulting from the accumulation of small parameter changes and is known to be related to bifurcations of dynamical systems. However, few studies have examined how nonlinear properties near bifurcation points affect early warning signal (EWS) performance. In this study, we apply the Koopman operator, which describes the time evolution of dynamical systems in an infinite-dimensional function space, to generalize stochastic resilience the theoretical basis of EWSs such as variance-based ones. As a result, we develop a novel signal capable of more accurately predicting tipping events by separately isolating stochastic fluctuations induced by noise and contributions from a continuous spectrum emerging immediately above tipping points. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach detects early signs of tipping phenomena more robustly than conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Disrupting the scammer lifecycle: A dynamically-consistent numerical analysis of a compartment model for scam-victim dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online deception and financial scams represent a pervasive threat in the digital age, yet a quantitative analysis and understanding of their propagation is lacking. This study introduces a novel model based on the framework of epidemiological models to describe the interaction between scammers and their victims. We propose a five-compartment deterministic model ($S-V-R-A_s-R_s$) calibrated using longitudinal data in fraud reports from the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre. The model's theoretical properties are established, including the non-negativity of the state variables and the stability threshold defined by the basic reproduction number ($\mathcal{R}_0$). A non-standard finite difference scheme is developed for the numerical simulations to ensure dynamical consistency between the continuous deterministic model and its discrete equivalent. A key finding of the model sensitivity analysis indicates that the proliferation of scams is overwhelmingly driven by the lifecycle of scammers, their recruitment, attrition, and arrest, rather than the susceptibility of the victim population. The results of this study provide strong quantitative evidence that the most effective control strategies are those that directly disrupt the scammers' population. Overall, this study provides a crucial model for designing and evaluating evidence-based policies to combat the scourge of cybercrime.</description>

      <title>Fractal analysis of slow-fast and regular systems: A survey of recent results and future perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey recent developments in fractal analysis of regular and slow-fast dynamical systems using Minkowski dimension. Our focus is on spiral trajectories near monodromic limit periodic sets in regular systems and entry-exit sequences in slow-fast systems with degenerate singularities. For regular systems, we recall connections between Minkowski dimension and cyclicity. Key results include fractal classifications of weak foci, degenerate foci, and polycycles, where dimensional relationships predict limit cycle birth. For slow-fast systems, we survey the coordinate-free fractal methodology analyzing slow-fast Hopf points and canard cycles through slow divergence integrals and entry-exit sequences. The Minkowski dimension takes discrete values yielding upper bounds for the number of limit cycles without normal form transformations. The fractal approach provides computational advantages, works with original coordinates, and reveals geometric structures underlying bifurcation phenomena. Applications span neuroscience, chemistry, population dynamics, and climate modeling. We also discuss extensions to piecewise smooth and three-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Regression: Parameter Estimation in Parameter-Linear Nonlinear Dynamic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new efficient hybrid parameter estimation method based on the idea, that if nonlinear dynamic models are stated in terms of a system of equations that is linear in terms of the parameters, then regularized ordinary least squares can be used to estimate these parameters from time series data. We introduce the term "Physics-Informed Regression" (PIR) to describe the proposed data-driven hybrid technique as a way to bridge theory and data by use of ordinary least squares to efficiently perform parameter estimation of the model coefficients of different parameter-linear models; providing examples of models based on nonlinear ordinary equations (ODE) and partial differential equations (PDE). The focus is on parameter estimation on a selection of ODE and PDE models, each illustrating performance in different model characteristics. For two relevant epidemic models of different complexity and number of parameters, PIR is tested and compared against the related technique, physics-informed neural networks (PINN), both on synthetic data generated from known target parameters and on real public Danish time series data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark. Both methods were able to estimate the target parameters, while PIR showed to perform noticeably better, especially on a compartment model with higher complexity. Given the difference in computational speed, it is concluded that the PIR method is superior to PINN for the models considered. It is also demonstrated how PIR can be applied to estimate the time-varying parameters of a compartment model that is fitted using real Danish data from the COVID-19 pandemic obtained during a period from 2020 to 2021. The study shows how data-driven and physics-informed techniques may support reliable and fast -- possibly real-time -- parameter estimation in parameter-linear nonlinear dynamic models.</description>

      <title>Stabilized automorphism groups and full groups of odometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we show that the stabilized automorphism group of odometers arising from actions of residually finite groups coincides with the topological full group of the odometer acting on itself by right multiplication. We then prove that two odometers have isomorphic stabilized automorphism groups if and only if they have isomorphic clopen subgroups of the same index. As a consequence, continuous orbit equivalence implies isomorphic stabilized automorphism groups, while for $\mathbb{Z}^d$-odometers, isomorphic stabilized automorphism groups imply orbit equivalence. In general, neither continuous orbit equivalence nor orbit equivalence is equivalent to having isomorphic stabilized automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>Weak expansion properties and a large deviation principle for coarse expanding conformal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coarse expanding conformal systems were introduced by P. Ha\"issinsky and K. M. Pilgrim to study the essential dynamical properties of certain rational maps on the Riemann sphere in complex dynamics from the point of view of Sullivan's dictionary.
  In this paper, we prove that for a metric coarse expanding conformal system $f\colon(\mathfrak{X}_1,X)\rightarrow (\mathfrak{X}_0,X)$ with repellor $X$, the map $f|_X\colon X\rightarrow X$ is asymptotically $h$-expansive. Moreover, we show that $f|_X$ is not $h$-expansive if there exists at least one branch point in the repellor. We also prove that $f|_X$ is forward expansive when there is no branch point in the repellor.
  Our study of expansion properties does not rely on symbolic codings or Markov partitions, and exploits directly the geometric data.
  As a consequence of asymptotic $h$-expansiveness, for $f|_X$ and each real-valued continuous potential on $X$, there exists at least one equilibrium state. For such maps, if some additional assumptions are satisfied, we can furthermore establish a level-$2$ large deviation principle for iterated preimages, followed by an equidistribution result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibrium states are natural dynamical analogues of Gibbs states in thermodynamic formalism. This paper investigates their computability within the framework of Computable Analysis. We show that the unique equilibrium state for a computable, open, topologically exact, distance-expanding map $T\colon X\rightarrow X$ and a computable H\"older continuous potential $\varphi\colon X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is always computable. As an application, we establish the computability of equilibrium states for computable hyperbolic rational maps and their respective geometric potentials. Moreover, we develop a constructive method to exhibit the non-uniqueness of equilibrium states for some dynamical systems. We also present some computable dynamical systems whose equilibrium states are all non-computable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-temperature large deviation principle for equilibrium states in the context of distance-expanding maps. The logarithmic-type zero-temperature limit in the large deviation principle induces a tropical algebra structure, which motivates our study of the tropical adjoint Bousch operator $\mathcal{L}_A^{*}$ since the Bousch operator $\mathcal{L}_A$ is tropical linear and corresponds to the Ruelle operator $\mathcal{R}_A$.
  We extend tropical functional analysis, define the adjoint operator $\mathcal{L}_A^{*}$ corresponding to $\mathcal{R}_A^{*}$, and establish the existence and generic uniqueness of tropical eigen-densities of $\mathcal{L}_A^{*}$. The Aubry set and the Ma\~{n}\'{e} potential, both originating from weak KAM theory, serve as important tools in the representation of tropical eigen-densities.
  We derive a sufficient condition for the large deviation principle which holds for a generic H\"{o}lder potential and establish a characterization theorem for the large deviation principle.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first show that the collection of all subsets of \( \mathbb{R} \) having lower dimension \( \gamma \in [0,1] \) is dense in \( \Pi(\mathbb{R}) \), the space of compact subsets of \( \mathbb{R} \). Furthermore, we show that the set of Borel probability measures with lower dimension \( \beta \in [0, m] \) is dense in \( \Omega(\mathbb{R}^m) \), the space of Borel probability measures on \( \mathbb{R}^m \). We also prove that the quantization and the lower dimension of a measure \( \vartheta \) coincide with those of the convolution of \( \vartheta \) with a finite combination of Dirac measures. In the end, we compute the lower dimension of the invariant measure associated with the product IFS.</description>

Consider the group measure space von Neumann algebra $\mathscr M = \operatorname{L}(\Gamma \curvearrowright G/H)$ associated with the nonsingular action $\Gamma \curvearrowright G/H$ and regard the group von Neumann algebra $M = \operatorname{L}(\Gamma)$ as a von Neumann subalgebra $M \subset \mathscr M$. We show that the group $\operatorname{Aut}_M(\mathscr M)$ of all unital normal $\ast$-automorphisms of $\mathscr M$ acting identically on $M$ is isomorphic to the Weyl group $\mathscr W_G$ of the semisimple algebraic group $G$. Our main theorem is a noncommutative analogue of a rigidity result of Bader-Furman-Gorodnik-Weiss for group actions on algebraic homogeneous spaces and moreover gives new insight towards Connes' rigidity conjecture for higher rank lattices.</description>
