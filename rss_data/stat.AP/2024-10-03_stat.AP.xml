      <title>Choosing alpha post hoc: the danger of multiple standard significance thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental assumption of classical hypothesis testing is that the significance threshold $\alpha$ is chosen independently from the data. The validity of confidence intervals likewise relies on choosing $\alpha$ beforehand. We point out that the independence of $\alpha$ is guaranteed in practice because, in most fields, there exists one standard $\alpha$ that everyone uses -- so that $\alpha$ is automatically independent of everything. However, there have been recent calls to decrease $\alpha$ from $0.05$ to $0.005$. We note that this may lead to multiple accepted standard thresholds within one scientific field. For example, different journals may require different significance thresholds. As a consequence, some researchers may be tempted to conveniently choose their $\alpha$ based on their p-value. We use examples to illustrate that this severely invalidates hypothesis tests, and mention some potential solutions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Temporal Decorrelation of State Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many commercial and defense applications involve multisensor, multitarget tracking, requiring the fusion of information from a set of sensors. An interesting use case occurs when data available at a central node (due to geometric diversity or retrodiction) allows for the tailoring of state estimation for a target. For instance, if a target is initially tracked with a maneuvering target filter, yet the target is clearly not maneuvering in retrospect, it would be beneficial at the fusion node to refilter that data with a non-maneuvering target filter. If measurements can be shared to the central node, the refiltering process can be accomplished by simply passing source measurements through an updated state estimation process. It is often the case for large, distributed systems, however, that only track information can be passed to a fusion center. In this circumstance, refiltering data becomes less straightforward as track states are linearly dependent across time, and the correlation needs to be properly accounted for before/during refiltering. In this work, a model-based temporal decorrelation process for state estimates with process noise will be studied. A decorrelation procedure will be presented based on a linear algebraic formulation of the problem, and process noise estimates will be created that ensure a conservative system state estimate. Numerical examples will be given to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fast nonparametric feature selection with error control using integrated path stability selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feature selection can greatly improve performance and interpretability in machine learning problems. However, existing nonparametric feature selection methods either lack theoretical error control or fail to accurately control errors in practice. Many methods are also slow, especially in high dimensions. In this paper, we introduce a general feature selection method that applies integrated path stability selection to thresholding to control false positives and the false discovery rate. The method also estimates q-values, which are better suited to high-dimensional data than p-values. We focus on two special cases of the general method based on gradient boosting (IPSSGB) and random forests (IPSSRF). Extensive simulations with RNA sequencing data show that IPSSGB and IPSSRF have better error control, detect more true positives, and are faster than existing methods. We also use both methods to detect microRNAs and genes related to ovarian cancer, finding that they make better predictions with fewer features than other methods.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes in the Stochastic Blockmodel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic variational Bayes algorithms have become very popular in the machine learning literature, particularly in the context of nonparametric Bayesian inference. These algorithms replace the true but intractable posterior distribution with the best (in the sense of Kullback-Leibler divergence) member of a tractable family of distributions, using stochastic gradient algorithms to perform the optimization step. stochastic variational Bayes inference implicitly trades off computational speed for accuracy, but the loss of accuracy is highly model (and even dataset) specific. In this paper we carry out an empirical evaluation of this trade off in the context of stochastic blockmodels, which are a widely used class of probabilistic models for network and relational data. Our experiments indicate that, in the context of stochastic blockmodels, relatively large subsamples are required for these algorithms to find accurate approximations of the posterior, and that even then the quality of the approximations provided by stochastic gradient variational algorithms can be highly variable.</description>

      <title>Identifying Genetic Variants for Obesity Incorporating Prior Insights: Quantile Regression with Insight Fusion for Ultra-high Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obesity is widely recognized as a critical and pervasive health concern. We strive to identify important genetic risk factors from hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for obesity. We propose and apply a novel Quantile Regression with Insight Fusion (QRIF) approach that can integrate insights from established studies or domain knowledge to simultaneously select variables and modeling for ultra-high dimensional genetic data, focusing on high conditional quantiles of body mass index (BMI) that are of most interest. We discover interesting new SNPs and shed new light on a comprehensive view of the underlying genetic risk factors for different levels of BMI. This may potentially pave the way for more precise and targeted treatment strategies. The QRIF approach intends to balance the trade-off between the prior insights and the observed data while being robust to potential false information. We further establish the desirable asymptotic properties under the challenging non-differentiable check loss functions via Huber loss approximation and nonconvex SCAD penalty via local linear approximation. Finally, we develop an efficient algorithm for the QRIF approach. Our simulation studies further demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Empirical Determination of Baseball Eras: Multivariate Changepoint Analysis in Major League Baseball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use multivariate change point analysis methods, to identify not only mean shifts but also changes in variance across a wide array of statistical time series. Our primary objective is to empirically discern distinct eras in the evolution of baseball, shedding light on significant transformations in team performance and management strategies. We leverage a rich dataset comprising baseball statistics from the late 1800s to 2020, spanning over a century of the sport's history. Results confirm previous historical research, pinpointing well-known baseball eras, such as the Dead Ball Era, Integration Era, Steroid Era, and Post-Steroid Era. Moreover, the study delves into the detection of substantial changes in team performance, effectively identifying periods of both dynasties and collapses within a team's history. The multivariate change point analysis proves to be a valuable tool for understanding the intricate dynamics of baseball's evolution. The method offers a data-driven approach to unveil structural shifts in the sport's historical landscape, providing fresh insights into the impact of rule changes, player strategies, and external factors on baseball's evolution. This not only enhances our comprehension of baseball, showing more robust identification of eras than past univariate time series work, but also showcases the broader applicability of multivariate change point analysis in the domain of sports research and beyond.</description>

      <title>Considerations for the planning, conduct and reporting of clinical trials with interim analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interim analyses are prevalent in clinical trials. Although methodology is well established, there are aspects of how to operationalize and interpret interim analyses which remain unclear to many stakeholders. In this paper, a team of statisticians from the pharmaceutical industry, academia, and regulatory agencies provide a multi-stakeholder perspective on the key concepts behind interim analyses and considerations on terminology. We illustrate our proposals using a hypothetical clinical trial.</description>

      <title>Approximate Bayesian computation for Markovian binary trees in phylogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees describe the relationships between species in the evolutionary process, and provide information about the rates of diversification. To understand the mechanisms behind macroevolution, we consider a class of multitype branching processes called Markovian binary trees (MBTs). MBTs allow for trait-based variation in diversification rates, and provide a flexible and realistic probabilistic model for phylogenetic trees. We develop an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) scheme to infer the rates of MBT parameters by exploiting the information in the shapes of phylogenetic trees.We evaluate the accuracy of this inference method using simulation studies, and find that our method is able to detect variation in the diversification rates, with accuracy comparable to, and generally better than, likelihood-based methods. In an application to a real-life phylogeny of squamata, we reinforce conclusions drawn from earlier studies, in particular supporting the existence of ovi-/viviparity transitions in both directions. Our method demonstrates the potential for more complex models of evolution to be employed in phylogenetic inference, in conjunction with likelihood-free schemes.</description>

      <title>A Causal Bayesian Network and Probabilistic Programming Based Reasoning Framework for Robot Manipulation Under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robot object manipulation in real-world environments is challenging because robot operation must be robust to a range of sensing, estimation, and actuation uncertainties to avoid potentially unsafe and costly mistakes that are a barrier to their adoption. In this paper, we propose a flexible and generalisable physics-informed causal Bayesian network (CBN) based framework for a robot to probabilistically reason about candidate manipulation actions, to enable robot decision-making robust to arbitrary robot system uncertainties -- the first of its kind to use a probabilistic programming language implementation. Using experiments in high-fidelity Gazebo simulation of an exemplar block stacking task, we demonstrate our framework's ability to: (1) predict manipulation outcomes with high accuracy (Pred Acc: 88.6%); and, (2) perform greedy next-best action selection with 94.2% task success rate. We also demonstrate our framework's suitability for real-world robot systems with a domestic robot. Thus, we show that by combining probabilistic causal modelling with physics simulations, we can make robot manipulation more robust to system uncertainties and hence more feasible for real-world applications. Further, our generalised reasoning framework can be used and extended for future robotics and causality research.</description>

      <title>Exploring language relations through syntactic distances and geographic proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Languages are grouped into families that share common linguistic traits. While this approach has been successful in understanding genetic relations between diverse languages, more analyses are needed to accurately quantify their relatedness, especially in less studied linguistic levels such as syntax. Here, we explore linguistic distances using series of parts of speech (POS) extracted from the Universal Dependencies dataset. Within an information-theoretic framework, we show that employing POS trigrams maximizes the possibility of capturing syntactic variations while being at the same time compatible with the amount of available data. Linguistic connections are then established by assessing pairwise distances based on the POS distributions. Intriguingly, our analysis reveals definite clusters that correspond to well known language families and groups, with exceptions explained by distinct morphological typologies. Furthermore, we obtain a significant correlation between language similarity and geographic distance, which underscores the influence of spatial proximity on language kinships.</description>

      <title>Categorization of 33 computational methods to detect spatially variable genes from spatially resolved transcriptomics data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18779v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomics data, detecting spatially variable genes (SVGs) is crucial. Numerous computational methods exist, but varying SVG definitions and methodologies lead to incomparable results. We review 33 state-of-the-art methods, categorizing SVGs into three types: overall, cell-type-specific, and spatial-domain-marker SVGs. Our review explains the intuitions underlying these methods, summarizes their applications, and categorizes the hypothesis tests they use in the trade-off between generality and specificity for SVG detection. We discuss challenges in SVG detection and propose future directions for improvement. Our review offers insights for method developers and users, advocating for category-specific benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Ensemble data assimilation to diagnose AI-based weather prediction model: A case with ClimaX version 0.3.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based weather prediction research is growing rapidly and has shown to be competitive with the advanced dynamic numerical weather prediction models. However, research combining AI-based weather prediction models with data assimilation remains limited partially because long-term sequential data assimilation cycles are required to evaluate data assimilation systems. This study proposes using ensemble data assimilation for diagnosing AI-based weather prediction models, and marked the first successful implementation of ensemble Kalman filter with AI-based weather prediction models. Our experiments with an AI-based model ClimaX demonstrated that the ensemble data assimilation cycled stably for the AI-based weather prediction model using covariance inflation and localization techniques within the ensemble Kalman filter. While ClimaX showed some limitations in capturing flow-dependent error covariance compared to dynamical models, the AI-based ensemble forecasts provided reasonable and beneficial error covariance in sparsely observed regions. In addition, ensemble data assimilation revealed that error growth based on ensemble ClimaX predictions was weaker than that of dynamical NWP models, leading to higher inflation factors. A series of experiments demonstrated that ensemble data assimilation can be used to diagnose properties of AI weather prediction models such as physical consistency and accurate error growth representation.</description>

      <title>Condensation phenomena of ions in an electrostatic logarithmic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of an electrostatic logarithmic trap (ELT) on an ionic gas confined in a cylindric chamber are studied in detail, with special reference to the effects of the ion-ion Coulombic interactions and the resulting low-temperature thermodynamics. The collapse of the ions in radially localized states, about the axial cathode, is shown to cause an abrupt (but not critical) transition from non degeneration to strong degeneration, at a special temperature $T_c$. This transition could actually involve both Bosons and Fermions and is not to be confused with a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), which is excluded in principle. However, while for Bosons the resulting effects on the pressure are observable in the ultra high vacuum (UHV) regime, the Fermions' density should fall well below UHV, for the pressure change to be observable. This is because the ion-ion \emph{exchange} interactions increase the kinetic energy along the axial cathode, which makes the Fermi level and the non degeneration threshold temperature increase accordingly.</description>
