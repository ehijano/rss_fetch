      <title>Pareto-optimality of Majoranas in hybrid platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To observe Majorana bound states, and especially to use them as a qubit, requires careful optimization of competing quality metrics. We systematically compare Majorana quality in proximitized semiconductor nanowires and quantum dot chains. Using multi-objective optimization, we analyze the fundamental trade-offs between topological gap and localization length, two key metrics that determine MBS coherence and operational fidelity. We demonstrate that these quantities cannot be simultaneously optimized in realistic models, creating Pareto frontiers that define the achievable parameter space. Our results show that QD chains achieve both comparable quality as nanowires and a regime with a much shorter localization length, making them particularly promising for near-term quantum computing applications where device length and disorder are limiting factors.</description>

      <title>From two dimensions to wire networks in a dice-lattice Josephson array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Josephson arrays consisting of a dice-lattice network of superconducting weak links surrounding rhombic plaquettes of proximitized semiconductor. Josephson coupling of the weak links and electron density in the plaquettes are independently controlled by separate electrostatic gates. Applied magnetic flux results in an intricate pattern of switching currents associated with frustration, $f$. For depleted plaquettes, the switching current is nearly periodic in $f$, expected for a phase-only description, while occupied plaquettes yield a decreasing envelope of switching currents with increasing $f$. A model of flux dependence based on ballistic small-area junctions and diffusive large-area plaquettes yields excellent agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Quantum Filtering of Hydrogen Isotopes through Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the growing demand in the energy, medical, and industrial sectors, we investigate a hydrogen isotope separation technique that offers both a high separation factor and economic feasibility. Our findings reveal that filtering isotopes through two-dimensional graphene layers provides an exceptionally efficient quantum-mechanical method for isotope separation. Using a recently developed analytical pairwise potential between hydrogen isotopes and carbon atoms in graphene, we examine the classical trajectories of isotopes near the graphene layer, as well as the quantum-mechanical tunneling properties of isotopes through the graphene layer. Using various quantum-mechanical methods, we calculate both the isotope tunneling probabilities and the quantum-mechanical isotope sticking probabilities. Our study shows that quantum filtering through graphene layers can be an effective technique for enriching deuterium by separating it from protium.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Spin-Wave Dynamics in Crescent-Shaped Ferromagnetic Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in the study of spin-wave propagation in ferromagnetic waveguides has highlighted the role of nonreciprocity arising from both the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the chiral nature of dipolar interactions. In this paper, we examine how a nanowire with a crescent-shaped cross-section affects spin-wave propagation along its long axis when a bias magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the axis. Employing micromagnetic simulations supported by analytical modeling, we systematically analyze the effects of geometry and external magnetic field strength on the magnetization dynamics and spin-wave amplitude distribution. The results demonstrate that these factors modify the dispersion relation of spin waves and influence its nonreciprocity, which can vary depending on the mode type. This work advances the fundamental understanding of spin-wave dynamics in curved geometries and offers new perspectives for designing magnonic waveguides with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Skyrmions and Spiral Reorientation Processes in Chiral Magnets with Cubic Anisotropy: Guidelines for Bridging Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the phenomenological Dzyaloshinskii framework, a central theoretical approach for describing magnetization processes in bulk chiral magnets, and demonstrate how magnetocrystalline cubic anisotropy reshapes the phase diagrams of states and provides the key mechanism stabilizing low-temperature skyrmion phases. We show that, for magnetic field directions along the easy anisotropy axes, the phase diagrams feature stable skyrmion pockets for both signs of the anisotropy constant. We further analyze the nature of the transitions at the critical field $H_{c1}$, associated with the reorientation of stable and metastable spirals along the field. We also examine the transition at $H_{c2}$, where the conical state closes into the homogeneous state accompanied by a deviation of the wave vector from the field direction. By mapping characteristic anisotropy-dependent parameters in the theoretical phase diagrams, we provide guidelines for connecting theory with experiment and for estimating the cubic anisotropy constant in Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si and MnSi. Our results indicate that samples Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si with small $x \sim 0.1$ possess sufficiently strong cubic anisotropy to stabilize a low-temperature skyrmion phase. Overall, these theoretical findings establish a quantitative framework for predicting and interpreting skyrmion stability in other cubic helimagnets as well.</description>

      <title>Superconducting meander-line surface coil for NMR spectroscopy of nanoscale thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique to study local magnetism in a variety of materials. However, the inherently low sensitivity of conventional inductively detected solid state NMR typically requires a large number of spins, reducing its applicability to two-dimensional (2D) materials and nanoscale thin films. To overcome this experimental challenge, we introduce a novel probe based on a superconducting meander-line surface coil that significantly enhances the NMR sensitivity for thin samples. Using a NbN meander with an optimized geometry, we demonstrate the sensitivity of this technique by detecting the NMR signal of a 150-nm-thick boron film containing only $\sim 2\times10^{16}$ $^{11}$B nuclear spins. Spin-echo measurements and theoretical modeling offer insight into the parameters limiting the coil's performance. This work lays the foundation for developing highly sensitive NMR probes, potentially unlocking new opportunities for studying atomically thin materials.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Enhancement of Series-Connected Cross-Conjugated Molecular Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric response of single-molecule junctions composed of acyclic cross-conjugated molecules, including dendralene analogues and related iso-poly(diacetylene) (iso-PDA) motifs, in which node-possessing repeat units are connected in series. Using many-body quantum transport theory, we show that increasing the number of repeat units leaves the fundamental gap essentially unchanged while giving rise to a split-node spectrum whose cumulative broadening dramatically enhances the thermopower. This form of quantum enhancement can exceed other interference-based mechanisms, such as the coalescence of nodes into a supernode, suggesting new opportunities for scalable quantum-interference-based materials. Although illustrated here with cross-conjugated systems, the underlying principles apply broadly to series-connected architectures hosting multiple interference nodes. Finally, we evaluate the scaling of the electronic figure of merit ZT and the maximum thermodynamic efficiency. Together, these results highlight the potential for split-node-based materials to realize quantum-enhanced thermoelectric response.</description>

      <title>Phase-controlled quantum transport signatures in a quantum dot-Majorana hybrid ring system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum transport in a hybrid ring system consisting of a quantum dot (QD) coupled to two Majorana bound states (MBSs) hosted in a topological superconducting nanowire, threaded by a magnetic flux. Utilizing the dissipaton equation-of-motion approach, we demonstrate that the differential conductance shows periodic behavior and its periodicity depends on both the QD energy level and the MBS overlapping. A zero-bias peak (ZBP) emerges as a result of the balance between normal and anomalous tunneling processes, associated with the presence of a single MBS. Beyond the phase-dependent periodic behavior, the shot noise exhibits voltage-dependent transitions between sub-Poissonian ($F = 0.5$), Poissonian ($F = 1$), and super-Poissonian ($F &gt; 1$) regimes. Strikingly, we find a giant Fano factor ($F\gg1$) emerging at the balance point, accompanied by a peak in the shot noise. This distinctive feature may serve as a supplementary signature for MBS detection. However, both ZBP in the differential conductance and shot noise peak are degraded by thermal effects.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Electrostatic and Quantum-Confinement Modeling of Silicon Nanowire Double Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a three-dimensional simulation study of silicon nanowire double quantum dots with leads, which extends beyond traditional effective-mass or quasi-1D and quasi-2D approaches typically applied to bulk or planar geometries. Using the Sentaurus QTX, we self-consistently couple a 3-D Poisson solver with two-dimensional Schr\"odinger solutions along the strongly confined width * thickness cross-sections normal to the transport direction, yielding bound-state energies and wavefunctions across the device cross-section. This method captures wavefunction evolution, subband formation, and valley splitting while retaining the full three-dimensional electrostatics of the device. Our results show that narrow quantum dots (width = 5 nm) provide strong confinement, enhanced valley splitting, and robust single-electron localization, whereas wider quantum dots (width = 20 nm) allow single-electron occupation at lower gate voltages but with shallower quantum wells and additional higher-order modes in the wavefunction. Importantly, the quantum dot width also plays a key role in tunnel coupling: smaller channel widths enhance wavefunction overlap across the barrier, resulting in higher tunnel coupling, whereas increasing the width reduces coupling, which eventually saturates once the width is approximately twice the plunger-gate length. By systematically varying the quantum dot width together with plunger- and barrier-gate lengths, we investigate their combined influence on the conduction-band profile and interdot coupling. Together, these simulations provide design guidelines for geometry-driven control of confinement, valley splitting, and tunnel coupling in silicon nanowire double quantum dots.</description>

      <title>On the decoherence of Majorana zero modes mediated by gapless fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decoherence of a collection of Majorana zero modes weakly coupled to a gapless reservoir of non-interacting fermions. Using the Born-Markov approximation, we derive a Lindblad master equation for the dissipative dynamics of the Majorana zero modes. Due to the long-range coupling between Majorana zero modes mediated by the gapless reservoir, the Lindblad jump operators are non-local linear combinations of the Majorana operators. We show that, as a consequence, the dissipative dynamics can exhibit long relaxation times, i.e. a slow decay of fermion parities. A spectral analysis of the Liouvillian shows that the slow-down is suppressed as a power law of the distance between Majorana zero modes. Finally, we validate the Lindblad equation by comparison with unbiased numerical simulations of the time evolution of the full density matrix. In particular, these illustrate that non-Markovian dynamics establishes non-local correlations at small times.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study magnon-plasmon coupling in effectively two-dimensional stacks of van der Waals layers in the context of the band structure topology. Invoking the quasiparticle approximation, we show that the magnetic dipole coupling between the plasmons in a metallic layer and the magnons in a neighboring magnetic layer gives rise to a Berry curvature. As a result, the hybrid quasiparticles acquire an anomalous velocity, leading to intrinsic anomalous thermal Hall and spin-Nernst effects in ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We propose magnetic layers supporting skyrmion crystals as a platform to realize chiral magnon-plasmon edge states, inviting the notion of topological magnon-plasmonics.</description>

      <title>Atomically resolved electron reflectivity at a metal/semiconductor interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An atomically flat interface is achieved between face-centered cubic Al and diamond lattice Ge via molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Based on the measurements of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we demonstrate an atomically resolved lateral periodic change of the electron reflectivity at the Al/Ge interface. The variation of electron reflectivity is up to 24% in lateral 2 nm. We speculate that the change of reflectivity results from the local electronic states at the Al/Ge interface. This phenomenon provides an atomically non-destructive method for detecting the buried interfacial states in hetero-structures by STM.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-Field Control of Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquids in Ta2Pd3Te5 Edge States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ta2Pd3Te5 is a quasi-one-dimensional transition-metal telluride whose heavy atoms endow the material with strong spin-orbit coupling, while the Fermi level inside the bulk gap makes the low-energy electronic structure highly tunable.Theory and early experiments have already identified a wealth of emergent phases in this platform: an excitonic insulator driven by electron-hole binding, a second-order topological insulator protected by crystalline symmetry, a potential topological-protected quantum-spin-Hall edge, and proximity-induced edge supercurrents when coupled to a conventional s-wave superconductor. These properties make it a promising platform for hosting Majorana zero modes and quantum computation, provided that time-reversal symmetry can be broken by a Zeeman gap. In this work, we demonstrate that the one-dimensional edge channels of exfoliated Ta2Pd3Te5 host a robust and tunable Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid by electrostatic gating because it shifts the chemical potential across the bulk gap without changing the gap size. More importantly, the application of a magnetic field introduces a Zeeman gap that systematically increases the TLL power-law exponent alpha. Furthermore, rotating the field reveals a pronounced twofold anisotropy--alpha is maximal for a field parallel to the edge and minimal for a perpendicular orientation--originating from an orientation-dependent edge g-factor that is likely amplified by quantum-confinement-induced orbital-angular-moment quenching. The existence of gate-tunable edge supercurrents together with the field-controlled Zeeman gap provides a direct route to break time-reversal symmetry in a particle-hole-symmetric superconducting gap and thus to engineer a topological superconducting phase, paving the way towards Majorana-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Gate Voltage Tunable Second Harmonic Generation in Mono- and Bi-layer Black Phosphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black phosphorene (BP) has emerged as a promising platform for tunable nonlinear photonics due to its layer-dependent bandgap, high carrier mobility, and remarkable in-plane anisotropy. This study investigates the second-harmonic generation (SHG) of monolayer and bilayer BP under an external static electric field, with describing the electronic states by a tight-binding model and the dynamics by semiconductor Bloch equations. Our results reveal that BP exhibits large second-order nonlinear optical response along the armchair direction, with significant resonant enhancement when the incident photon energy approaches half of its bandgap. Under an applied electric field of $10^7$ V/m, the effective second-order nonlinear susceptibility of BP can be as large as $10^3$ pm/V, surpassing that of the conventional nonlinear crystal AgGaSe$_2$ by more than an order of magnitude. With respect to the static electric field induced by gate voltage, we discuss the relation between the electric-field-induced second harmonic (EFISH) generation and conventional SHG -- under lower gate voltage, the EFISH approach agrees well with the SHG solutions, whereas the former is no longer applicable under higher gate voltage. Specifically, as the increasing gate voltage, monolayer BP exhibits the bandgap expansion and the corresponding blue-shift in the SHG resonant peak. In contrast, bilayer BP undergoes a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition, forming Dirac cone and generating divergent SHG spectra as photon energy goes to zero. Additionally, the chemical potential allows for precise control over interband and intraband nonlinear responses. This work provides important theoretical foundations for the development of BP-based tunable nonlinear photonic devices and expands the application potential of anisotropic two-dimensional materials in nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Amplification and Detection of Single Itinerant Microwave Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon detectors are an essential part of the toolbox of modern quantum optics for implementing quantum technologies and enabling tests of fundamental physics. The low energy of microwave photons, the natural signal path for superconducting quantum devices, makes their detection much harder than for visible light. Despite impressive progress in recent years and the proposal and realization of a number of different detector architectures, the reliable detection of a single itinerant microwave photon remains an open topic.
  Here, we investigate and simulate a detailed protocol for single-photon multiplication and subsequent amplification and detection. At its heart lies a Josephson-photonics device which uses inelastic Cooper-pair tunneling driven by a dc bias in combination with the energy of an incoming photon to create multiple photons, thus compensating for the low-energy problem. Our analysis provides clear design guidelines for utilizing such devices, which have previously been operated in an amplifier mode with a continuous wave input, for counting photons. Combining a formalism recently developed by M{\o}lmer to describe the full quantum state of in- and outgoing photon pulses with stochastic Schr\"odinger equations, we can describe the full multiplication and detection protocol and calculate performance parameters, such as detection probabilities and dark count rates. With optimized parameters, a high population of a single output mode can be achieved that can then be easily distinguished from vacuum noise in heterodyne measurements of quadratures with a conventional linear amplifier. Realistic devices with two multiplication stages with multiplication of $16$ reach for an impinging Gaussian pulse of length $T$ a detection probability of $84.5\%$ with a dark count rate of $10^{-3}/T$, and promise to outperform competing schemes.</description>

      <title>Far-field radiation of bulk, edge and corner eigenmodes from a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger plasmonic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subwavelength arrays of plasmonic nanoparticles allow us to control the behaviour of light at the nanoscale. Here, we develop an eigenmode analysis, employing a coupled electromagnetic dipole formalism, which permits us to isolate the contribution to the far-field radiation of each array mode. Specifically, we calculate the far-field radiation patterns by bulk, edge and corner out-of-plane eigenmodes in a finite 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) array of plasmonic nanoparticles with out-of-plane dipolar resonances. The breaking of symmetries in multipartite unit cells is exploited to tailor the optical properties and far-field radiation of the resonant modes. We prove that the antisymmetric modes are darker and have higher Q-factors than their symmetric counterparts. Also, the out-of-plane nature of the dipolar resonances imposes that all bulk $\Gamma$-modes are dark, while corner and edge states need extra in-plane symmetries to cancel the far-field radiation; radiation patterns in turn become more complex and concentrated along the array plane with increasing array size.</description>

      <title>Surface-Localized Magnetic Order in RuO2 Thin Films Revealed by Low-Energy Muon Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) has recently emerged as a candidate altermagnet, yet its intrinsic magnetic ground state, particularly in thin films, remains debated. This study aims to clarify the nature and spatial extent of the magnetic order in RuO2 thin films grown under different conditions. Thin films of RuO2 with thicknesses of 30 nm and 33 nm are fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and sputtering onto TiO2(110) and Al2O3(1-102) substrates, respectively. Low-energy muon spin rotation/relaxation (LE-muSR) with depth-resolved sensitivity measurements is performed in transverse magnetic fields (TF) from 4 K to 290 K. The muSR data collected with a muon implantation energy of 1 keV reveal that magnetic signals originate from the near-surface region of the film (&lt;10 nm), and the affected volume fraction is at most about 8.5%. The localized magnetic response is consistent across different substrates, growth techniques, and parameter sets, suggesting a common origin related to surface defects and dimensionality effects. The combined use of TF-muSR and the study of depth-dependent implantation with low-energy muons provides direct evidence for surface-confined, inhomogeneous static magnetic order in RuO2 thin films, helping reconcile discrepancies. These findings underscore the importance of considering reduced-dimensional contributions and motivate further investigation into the role of defects, strain, and stoichiometry on the magnetic properties of RuO2, especially at the surface.</description>

      <title>Dominant scattering mechanisms and mobility peak in cryogenic 2D electron transport in Silicon (110) confinement by high-k oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of silicon nano-devices at cryogenic temperatures is critical for quantum computing technologies. Through multi-valley Monte Carlo simulations of Si (110) systems, we reveal a fundamental shift in electron transport physics at low temperatures. Phonon scattering becomes negligible, and mobility is instead dictated by a competition between remote Coulomb scattering (RCS) at low carrier densities and surface roughness scattering (SRS) at high densities. This competition creates a distinct peak in electron mobility. Furthermore, we demonstrate a critical design trade-off for high-$\kappa$ dielectrics like $\mathrm{HfO_2}$: while enhancing gate control, they introduce strong remote phonon scattering, which can suppress mobility. These findings provide essential guidelines for the material selection and design of next-generation cryogenic nano-devices.</description>

      <title>Topological surface magnon-polariton in an insulating canted antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitation and control of antiferromagnetic magnon modes lie at the heart of coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Here, we propose a topological surface magnon-polariton as the potential means to excite antiferromagnetic magnons in the prototypical magnonic material hematite. We show that in an insulating canted antiferromagnet, where the magnons can strongly couple to photons using electrical on-chip layouts, a surface magnon-polariton mode exists in the gap of the bulk magnon-photon bands. The emergence of surface magnon-polariton mode is further attributed to the nontrivial topology of bulk magnon-photon bands. Magnon-photon coupling enhances the Berry curvature near the anticrossing points, leading to a topological bulk Chern band associated with the surface magnon-polaritons. Our work provides a general principle for the utilisation of optomagnetic properties in antiferromagnets, with an illustration of its feasibility in the particular case of hematite.</description>

      <title>Classical to Quantum Diffusive Transport in Atomically Thin Semiconductors Capped with High-k Dielectric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dielectric environment surrounding semiconductors plays a crucial role in determining device performance, a role that becomes especially pronounced in atomically thin semiconductors where charge carriers are confined within a few atomic layers and strongly interact with their surroundings. High-k dielectrics, such as hafnium oxide (HfO2), have been shown to enhance the performance of two-dimensional (2D) materials by suppressing scattering from charged impurities and phonons, but most studies to date have focused on room-temperature transistor operation. Their influence on quantum transport properties at low temperatures remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate how capping monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with HfO2 modifies its electronic behavior in the quantum regime. By comparing devices with and without HfO2 capping, we find that uncapped devices exhibit transport dominated by classical diffusive scattering, whereas capped devices show clear Fabry-Perot interference patterns, providing direct evidence of phase-coherent quantum transport enabled by dielectric screening. To gain further insight, we develop a tight-binding interferometer model that captures the effect of dielectric screening on conductive modes and reproduces the experimental trends. Our findings demonstrate that dielectric engineering provides a powerful route to control transport regimes in TMD devices.</description>

      <title>Strong interlayer coupling and chiral flat-band cascades in twisted bilayer gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From atomic crystals to macroscopic material structures, twisted bilayer systems have emerged as a promising route to control wave phenomena. In few-layer van der Waals (vdW) materials, however, the intrinsically weak interlayer coupling typically demands fine control of small twist angles to reach magic-angle conditions. Here, we show that one-dimensional photonic crystal bilayers can overcome this limitation by accessing a regime of strong interlayer coupling -- comparable to intralayer coupling. This strong coupling enables flat-band formation over a broad angular range even at large twist angles. We experimentally realize this regime by stacking WS$_2$ gratings using a two-step lithography method, resulting in ultra-wide chiral flat-band cascades in magic-angle twisted bilayer gratings. Our work not only provides a platform for designing photonic applications with tunable localization but also explores a new regime of physics unattainable in conventional solid-state based moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin bismuth-yttrium iron garnet films with tunable and compensated magnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the epitaxial growth of nm-thick films of bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG) by high-temperature off-axis radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. We demonstrate accurate control of the magnetic properties by tuning of the sputtering parameters and epitaxial strain on various (111)-oriented garnet substrates. BiYIG films with up to -0.80\% lattice mismatch with the substrate remain fully strained up to 60~nm-thick, maintaining a high crystalline quality. Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirm coherent epitaxial growth, the absence of defects, and limited interdiffusion at the BiYIG/substrate interface. Varying the tensile or compressive strain between -0.80\% and +0.56\% in BiYIG allows for accurate compensation of the total magnetic anisotropy through magneto-elastic coupling. The effective magnetic anisotropy of sputtered BiYIG films can be further tuned via the off-axis deposition angle and the oxygen flow during growth, which determine the cation stoichiometry. Under optimized growth conditions, a ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) linewidth of 1~mT at 10~GHz is reliably obtained even for thicknesses as low as 10~nm. We also report small FMR linewidths in ultrathin (2-5~nm) BiYIG films grown on diamagnetic substrate yttrium scandium gallium garnet. These findings highlight the promise of low-damping, strain-engineered nm-thick BiYIG films for implementing advanced functionalities in spin-orbitronic and magnonic devices. Specifically, the magnetic-anisotropy compensation and low damping enable large cone-angle magnetization dynamics immune to magnon-magnon nonlinear scattering.</description>

      <title>Surface band-selective moir\'e effect induces flat band in mixed-dimensional heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we reveal a curious type of moir\'e effect that selectively modifies the surface states of bulk crystal. We synthesize mixed-dimensional heterostructures consisting of a noble gas monolayer grow on the surface of bulk Bi(111), and determine the electronic structure of the heterostructures using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We directly observe moir\'e replicas of the Bi(111) surface states, while the bulk states remain barely changed. Meanwhile, we achieve control over the moir\'e period in the range of 25 {\AA} to 80 {\AA} by selecting monolayers of different noble gases and adjusting the annealing temperature. At large moir\'e periods, we observe hybridization between the surface band replicas, which leads to the formation of a correlated flat band. Our results serve as a bridge for understanding the moir\'e modulation effect from 2D to 3D systems, and provide a feasible approach for the realization of correlated phenomena through the engineering of surface states via moir\'e effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water, a ubiquitous and fundamental substance, plays a critical role across a wide range of disciplines from physics and chemistry to biology and engineering. Despite theoretical predictions of several phases of two-dimensional (2D) ice confined between idealized hydrophobic walls, experimental validation has been limited to the square phase, whose structural origin remains controversial. Here, we propose a realistic nanoconfinement setup using wide-bandgap hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as the capping layer and Cu(111) as the substrate. This protocol enables scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to resolve the atomic-scale arrangement of water molecules beneath the h-BN layer, overcoming the limitations of conventional techniques. Simulated STM images unambiguously identify all ordered flat 2D ice phases, as well as coexisting phases, and effectively distinguish them from potential contaminants. These findings establish a robust framework for experiment to systematically probe the phase structures of 2D ice, opening an avenue for studying nanoconfined water under ambient conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a second-quantized representation with a structure of balanced ternary formalism, which involves three substances in organic molecular materials, namely electron, hole and charge-transfer exciton, into a uniform framework. The quantum thermodynamic of excitons is investigated in a closed and compact manner, benefitting from the interplay of the three substances. In order to be friendly with quantum simulations, the interactions among them are all described with unitary transformations. Significantly, the nonconserving dynamics of particle numbers, such as the generation of charge current and the exciton fission in organic semiconductors, is consistently expressed by this unitary formalism on the basis of bosonic coherent states. The spin degree of freedom is further taken into account, and an exotic molecular ferromagnetic ordering is induced in a specific configuration of excitons. This balanced ternary formalism establishes a solid bridge to connect thermodynamics and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Liouvillian Exceptional Points Through Newton Polygons and Tropical Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of open quantum systems described by the Lindblad master equation follows according to non-Hermitian operators. As a result, such systems can host non-Hermitian degeneracies called Liouvillian exceptional points (EPs). In this work, we show that Newton polygons and tropical geometric approach allow identification and characterization of Liouvillian EPs. We use two models -- dissipative spin$-1/2$ system and dissipative superconducting qubit system -- to illustrate our method. We demonstrate that our approach captures the anisotropy and order of the Liouvillian EPs, while also revealing the subtle dependence on the form of the perturbation. Our analytical analysis is supplemented by direct numerical calculations of the scaling and exchange of eigenvalues around Liouvillian EPs. Our analytical approach could be useful in understanding and designing Liouvillian EPs of desired order.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency Pairing in Josephson Junctions Coupled by Magnetic Textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions coupled through magnetic textures provide a controllable platform for odd-frequency superconductivity and Majorana physics. Within a tight-binding Green function framework, induced pair correlations and spectral properties are analyzed under various magnetic and geometric conditions. When the junction is in the topologically trivial regime, even-frequency singlet pairing is dominant, whereas the topological phase is characterized by the coexistence of Majorana bound states and robust odd-frequency equal-spin triplet pairing at the interface edges. The odd-frequency polarized triplets reveal a divergent $1/\omega$ behavior when the Majorana states are decoupled, which is intrinsically connected to their self-conjugation property. The zero-frequency divergence evolves into shifted resonances and linear low-frequency behavior once hybridization occurs. A nonmagnetic interruption in the texture separates the topological superconductor into two topological segments and generates additional inner Majorana modes. When the nonmagnetic barrier is comparable to the inner Majorana states localization length, they hybridize and modify their associated odd-frequency triplet pairing, while the outer edge modes preserve their self-conjugated nature. Tuning the superconducting phase difference further controls the onset of the topological regime and the stability of localized Majorana states. The results highlight the central role of odd-frequency triplet correlations as a probe of topological superconductivity in magnetically engineered Josephson junctions.</description>

      <title>Observation of electromagnons in a monolayer multiferroic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals multiferroics have emerged as a promising platform to explore novel magnetoelectric phenomena. Recently, it has been shown that monolayer NiI$_2$ hosts robust type-II multiferroicity down to the two-dimensional limit, a giant dynamical magnetoelectric coupling at terahertz frequencies, and an electrically switchable spin polarization. These developments present the possibility of engineering ultrafast, low-energy-consumption, and electrically-tunable spintronic devices based on the collective excitations of the multiferroic order, electromagnons. However, the direct visualization of these bosonic modes in real space and within the monolayer limit remains elusive. Here, we report the atomic-scale observation of electromagnons in monolayer NiI$_2$ using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. By tracking the thermal evolution of the multiferroic phase, we establish the energy scale and resolve coherent in-gap excitations of the symmetry-broken multiferroic state. Comparison with first-principles and spin-model calculations reveals that the low-energy modes originate from electromagnon excitations. Spatially resolved inelastic tunneling spectroscopy maps show a stripe-like modulation of the local spectral function at electromagnon energies, matching theoretical predictions. These results provide direct evidence of the internal structure of electromagnons and establish a methodology to probe these modes at the atomic scale, opening avenues for electrically tunable spintronics.</description>

      <title>Enhanced thermal stability of inverted perovskite solar cells by bulky passivation with pyridine-functionalized triphenylamine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08401</link>

Abstract: Despite competitive efficiency compared to Si solar cells and relevant stability at near room temperatures the rapid degradation at elevated temperatures remains the critical obstacle for exploitation of perovskite photovoltaics. In this work, a 4-(pyridin-4-yl)triphenylamine (TPA-Py) with pyridine anchor group was employed for inter-grain bulk modification of double-cation CsCH(NH2)2PbI3 perovskite absorbers to enhance thermal stability. Through coordination and dipole-dipole interactions, nitrogen-containing fragments (diphenylamine and pyridine) of TPA-Py passivate uncoordinated cations and improve the phase resilience of perovskite films against segregation. This resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 21.3% with a high open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V. Notable impact of self-assembled monolayer incorporated into the bulk of perovskite film manifested in huge improvement of thermal stability at 85{\deg}C (ISOS-D-2). TPA-Py modification improved extended the T80 lifetime to ~600 h compared to only 200 h for the reference under harsh heating stress in ambient conditions. In-depth analysis using photoinduced voltage transients and admittance spectroscopy after different stress periods revealed the screening of ion migration (0.45 eV) for devices with TPA-Py. This work offers an important understanding of the bulk modification of microcrystalline perovskite absorbers and guide for robust design of bulk and buried interfaces in highly efficient perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear response functions and disorder: the case of photogalvanic effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of disorder in the form of impurity scattering on a generalized version of the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals where the frequency detuning between the two orthogonally polarized beams is nonzero. Considering a minimal model with two Weyl nodes at different energies, we employ the self-consistent Born approximation to unravel the dependence of the associated two-point retarded Green's function on the strength of intra- and internode scattering, frequency detuning, and energy difference between the two Weyl nodes. In the case of intranode scattering only, the second-order current density acquires Drude-like features, which we elucidate further by introducing an effective scattering strength. The Drude-like theory can even describe the second-order response in the presence of strong internode scattering, provided the latter has a linear interdependence with the intranode scattering. By properly adjusting the frequency detuning, we also find the real part of the two-point retarded Green's function to be reminiscent of a "quantized CPGE"-like form, although the imaginary part of the latter function is in general finite, and the second-order current density oscillates with time due to the finite frequency detuning. We finally conclude with an outlook on possible experimental consequences.</description>

      <title>Topologically Charged Vortices at Superconductor-Quantum Hall Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore interface states between a type-II $s$-wave superconductor (SC) and a $\nu = 1$ quantum Hall (QH) state. We show that the effective interaction gives rise to two emergent Abelian Higgs fields, representing paired electrons localized at the SC-QH interface. These fields interact with each other in the presence of a Chern-Simons term originating from the QH sector. The Chern-Simons term leads to a topological contribution to the photon mass and imparts a \emph{fractional} topological charge of $e/2$ to the interface vortices. The topological mass modifies the vortex lattice at the interface, while the topological charge leads to formation of vortex quadruplets. We predict that these effects lead to a \emph{topological} Abrikosov lattice at the interface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of three-layer graphene heterostructures in which the layers are twisted by the magic angle ($\sim$1.1$^\circ$) or by $\sim$$30^\circ$ to form a graphene quasicrystal. The heterostacks are described using realistic structural relaxations and tight-binding Hamiltonians, and their transport properties are computed for both pristine and disordered systems containing up to $\sim$8 million atoms. Owing to the weak interlayer coupling, we resolve the hybridization between magic-angle flat bands and quasicrystalline states, which are modified in distinct ways across low- and high-energy windows, revealing a new hybrid electronic regime to explore.</description>

      <title>Driven-dissipative turbulence in exciton-polariton quantum fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.</description>

Abstract: Large-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) realizes a multicomponent quantum Hall (QH) platform of spin, valley and layer pseudospins with strong Coulomb interaction-driven symmetry broken phases. Here, we investigate the low energy Landau-level spectrum of layer-decoupled TBLG and identify skyrmion-textured charged excitations and a field-induced insulating transition to an intervalley coherent state at zero-filling factor. Symmetric potential difference perpendicular to TBLG demonstrated layer coherent population of ground states with uniform energy barriers, while the charge imbalance in the layers at finite displacement field led to multidomain nucleation and a pronounced hysteresis in the exchange-dominated transport regime suggesting first order phase transitions between different QH ferromagnetic ground states.</description>

      <title>Shot noise signatures of candidate states for the fractional quantum Hall $\nu = 12/5$ state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are highly sought after because of their ability to host non-abelian anyons, whose braiding statistics make them excellent candidates for qubits in topological quantum computing. Multiple theoretical studies on the $\nu=\frac{12}{5}$ FQH state predict various quasi-particle states hosted by the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau, which include $\mathbb Z_3$ parafermions and Majorana modes. In this work, we provide a systematic protocol to distinguish among four possible candidate wavefunctions of the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau using zero-frequency shot noise experiments on a filter-geometry. Qualitative comparisons of Fano-Factors provide a robust way to predict the candidate state across both the full and partial thermal equilibration regimes without prior knowledge of the experimental information, like thermal equilibration length, to allow for more realistic experiments.</description>

      <title>Effect of interatomic repulsion and quasi-degenerate states on a Kitaev-transmon qubit based on double quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ and particular states disregarded previously on the Kitaev-transmon system proposed by Pino \textit{et al.} \cite{pino} which consists of a Josephson junction between two double quantum dots (DQDs) modeled by the spinless Kitaev Hamiltonian. For an isolated DQD, we demonstrate that a ``sweet spot'' hosting ``poor man's Majorana'' states persist in the presence of $V$, provided that system parameters are appropriately tuned. For the full system, we demonstrate that at the sweet spots of both DQDs, all eigenstates are doubly degenerate. This degeneracy arises from the existence of an operator that maps between two decoupled Hilbert subspaces. Away from the sweet spots, the microwave spectrum becomes sensitive to the choice of initial state. In our study, we consider transitions from the ground state (which depending on the flux alternates between the above mentioned subspaces) to all possible excited states. This scenario corresponds to a system initially in thermal equilibrium at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.</description>

      <title>Explicit equivalence between the spectral localizer and local Chern and winding markers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological band insulators are classified using momentum-space topological invariants, such as Chern or winding numbers, when they feature translational symmetry. The lack of translation symmetry in disordered, quasicrystalline, or amorphous topological systems has motivated alternative, real-space definitions of topological invariants, including the local Chern marker and the spectral localizer invariant.
  However, the equivalence between these invariants is so far implicit. Here, we explicitly demonstrate their equivalence from a systematic perturbative expansion in powers of the spectral localizer's parameter $\kappa$. By leveraging only the Clifford algebra of the spectral localizer, we prove that Chern and winding markers emerge as leading-order terms in the expansion. It bypasses abstract topological machinery, offering a simple approach accessible to a broader physics audience.</description>

      <title>Non-ohmic to ohmic crossover in the breakdown of the quantum Hall states in graphene under broadband excitations</title>

Abstract: Graphene, through the coexistence of large cyclotron gaps and small spin and valley gaps, offers the possibility to study the breakdown of the quantum Hall effect across a wide range of energy scales. In this work, we investigate the breakdown of the QHE in high-mobility graphene Corbino devices under broadband excitation ranging from DC up to 10 GHz. We find that the conductance is consistently described by variable range hopping (VRH) and extract the hopping energies from both temperature and field-driven measurements. Using VRH thermometry, we are able to distinguish between a cold and hot electron regime, which are dominated by non-ohmic VRH and Joule heating, respectively. Our results demonstrate that breakdown in the quantum Hall regime of graphene is governed by a crossover from non-ohmic, field-driven VRH to ohmic, Joule-heating-dominated transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological invariants have proved useful for analyzing emergent function as they characterize a property of the entire system, and are insensitive to local details, disorder, and noise. They support boundary states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and, in 2D systems, offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large phase space. Topological invariants have been heavily studied in quantum electronic systems and have been observed in other classical platforms such as mechanical lattices. However, this framework largely describes equilibrium systems within an ordered crystalline lattice, whereas biological systems are often strongly non-equilibrium with stochastic components. We review recent developments in topological states in discrete stochastic models in 1D and 2D systems, and initial progress in identifying testable signature of topological states in molecular systems and ecology. These models further provide simple principles for targeted dynamics in synthetic systems and in the engineering of reconfigurable materials. Lastly, we describe novel theoretical properties of these systems such as the necessity for non-Hermiticity in permitting edge states, as well as new analytical tools to reveal these properties. The emerging developments shed light on fundamental principles for non-equilibrium systems and topological protection enabling robust biological function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20% of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the relaxed atomic configuration of twisted bilayer graphene including heterostrain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuum atomic relaxation models for twisted bilayer graphene involve minimization of the sum of intralayer elastic energy and interlayer adhesion energy. The elastic energy favors a rigid twist i.e. no distortion in the twisted honeycomb lattices, while the adhesion energy favors Bernal stacking and breaking the relaxation into triangular AB and BA stacked domains. We compare the results of two relaxation models with the published Bragg interferometry data, finding good agreement with one of the models. We then provide a method for finding a highly accurate approximation to the solution of this model which holds above the twist angle of $\approx0.7^\circ$ and thus covers the first magic angle. We find closed form expressions in the absence, as well as in the presence, of external heterostrain. These expressions are not written as a Taylor series in the ratio of adhesion and elastic energy, because, as we show, the radius of convergence of such a series is too small to access the first magic angle.</description>

Abstract: Neutral atoms emitted from liquid metal ion sources are an often-overlooked source of contamination and damage in focused ion beam microscopy. Beyond ions and single atoms, these sources also emit atom clusters. While most studies have investigated charged clusters, here we demonstrate that neutral clusters are also emitted. These neutral clusters bypass the electrostatic beam blanking system, allowing them to impinge on samples even when the ion beam is blanked. We investigate this phenomenon using thin (&lt;20 nm) freestanding membranes of hexagonal boron nitride, silicon, and silicon nitride as targets. Randomly dispersed nanopores that form upon neutral cluster exposure are revealed. The average nanopore diameter is ~2 nm with a narrow size distribution, suggesting that the atom clusters emitted from the source have a preferred size. Various electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the nanopores, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, multislice ptychography, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Finally, we show how electron irradiation in the transmission electron microscope can be used to both remove any amorphous material that may clog the pores and to controllably grow the pores to specific sizes. Tunable nanopores such as these are interesting for nanofluidic applications involving size-selective membranes.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and transport properties of epitaxial Bi (111) films on GaAs (111) substrates</title>

Abstract: In recent decades, the growth of ultrathin epitaxial bismuth (Bi) films on various substrates has garnered interest due to their unique electronic properties. We report upon the growth and electrical transport properties of epitaxial Bi (111) films in the thickness range of 5-32 nm deposited directly on GaAs (111) substrates, without a buffer layer. The quality of Bi films is found to depend on conditions for substrate treatment using Ar+ ion-milling and annealing. Substrates milled at low ion beam currents display poor surface reconstruction after annealing, which hinders the growth of high-quality films. In contrast, substrates milled under optimized conditions led to reconstructed surfaces upon annealing, resulting in epitaxial Bi films with predominantly single-domain orientation. Although epitaxial films formed in both cases, transport measurements indicated significantly higher conductivity for films grown on optimally treated substrates. Measurements at low temperatures suggest that the transport properties are dominated by a surface state with high mobility electrons. Magneto-transport measurements suggest that conductivity and mobility improve progressively with increasing film thickness. For the thinnest 5 nm film, a hole-like state emerges, presumably as the electron-like state is gapped out. These results provide a robust methodology for growing high-quality epitaxial Bi films on GaAs (111) and offer insights into their unique transport properties, and our ability to tune them.</description>

      <title>Generation of Volume-Law Entanglement by Local-Measurement-Only Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Higgs mode in superconducting Titanium nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report observations of Higgs modes in superconducting Titanium nanostructures at very low temperature. They appear as anomalies in the microwave complex impedance of the samples revealed by the presence of a dc supercurrent. By varying the sample geometry and contact material, we probe how the Higgs modes are sensitive to the dimensionality of superconductivity, the penetration of the dc and ac current densities in the sample and the dissipation in the contacts.</description>

      <title>Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</description>

      <title>Chiral quantum state circulation from photon lattice topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test these devices in the near term.</description>
