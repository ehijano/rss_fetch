      <title>Evolution and Pathogenicity of SARS-CoVs: A Microcanonical Analysis of Receptor-Binding Motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution and global impact of coronaviruses, notably SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, underscore the importance of understanding their molecular mechanisms in detail. This study focuses on the receptor-binding motif (RBM) within the Spike protein of these viruses, a critical element for viral entry through interaction with the ACE2 receptor. We investigate the sequence variations in the RBM across SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and its early variants of concern (VOCs). Utilizing multicanonical simulations and microcanonical analysis, we examine how these variations influence the folding dynamics, thermostability, and solubility of the RBMs. Our methodology includes calculating the density of states (DoS) to identify structural phase transitions and assess thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, we solve the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to model the solubility of the RBMs in aqueous environments. This methodology is expected to elucidate structural and functional differences in viral evolution and pathogenicity, likely improving targeted treatments and vaccines.</description>

      <title>Modelling Soil as a Living System: Feedback between Microbial Activity and Spatial Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil is a complex, dynamic material, with physical properties that depend on its biological content. We propose a cellular automaton model for self-organizing soil structure, where soil aggregates and serves as food for microbial species. These, in turn, produce nutrients that facilitate self-amplification, establishing a cyclical dynamic of consumption and regeneration. Our model explores the spatial interactions between these components and their role in sustaining a balanced ecosystem. The main results demonstrate that (1) spatial structure supports a stable living state, preventing population collapse or uncontrolled growth; (2) the spatial model allows for the coexistence of parasitic species, which exploit parts of the system without driving it to extinction; and (3) optimal growth conditions for microbes are associated to diverse length scales in the soil structure, suggesting that heterogeneity is key to ecosystem resilience. These findings highlight the importance of spatio-temporal dynamics of life in soil ecology.</description>

      <title>Towards Ultimate NMR Resolution with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, practical resolution is defined as the ability to distinguish and accurately determine signal positions against a background of overlapping peaks, thermal noise, and spectral artifacts. In the pursuit of ultimate resolution, we introduce Peak Probability Presentations ($P^3$)- a statistical spectral representation that assigns a probability to each spectral point, indicating the likelihood of a peak maximum occurring at that location. The mapping between the spectrum and $P^3$ is achieved using MR-Ai, a physics-inspired deep learning neural network architecture, designed to handle multidimensional NMR spectra. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MR-Ai enables coprocessing of multiple spectra, facilitating direct information exchange between datasets. This feature significantly enhances spectral quality, particularly in cases of highly sparse sampling. Performance of MR-Ai and high value of the $P^3$ are demonstrated on the synthetic data and spectra of Tau, MATL1, Calmodulin, and several other proteins.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Quantum Fingerprints in Plant Cells to Evaluate Plant productivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overcoming the strong chlorophyll background poses a significant challenge for measuring and optimizing plant growth. This research investigates the novel application of specialized quantum light emitters introduced into intact leaves of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), a well-characterized model plant system for studies of plant health and productivity. Leaves were harvested from plants cultivated under two distinct conditions: low light (LL), representing unhealthy leaves with reduced photosynthesis. and high light (HL), representing healthy leaves with highly active photosynthesis. Higher-order correlation data were collected and analyzed using machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to classify the photon emitter states. This CNN efficiently identified unique patterns and created distinct fingerprints for Nicotiana leaves grown under LL and HL, demonstrating significantly different quantum profiles between the two conditions. These quantum fingerprints serve as a foundation for a novel unified analysis of plant growth parameters associated with different photosynthetic states. By employing CNN, the emitter profiles were able to reproducibly classify the leaves as healthy or unhealthy. This model achieved high probability values for each classification, confirming its accuracy and reliability. The findings of this study pave the way for broader applications, including the application of advanced quantum and machine learning technologies in plant health monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>First passage time properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic diffusion coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (DCs). In the present study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic DCs that are positive and non-zero. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, the eventual absorption is certain. We also show that compared to diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average of a stochastic DC, in diffusion with the stochastic DC, there are particles that reach the absorbing boundary earlier. The approximate proportion of preceding particles is determined by the probability distribution of the time average of a stochastic DC for a given distance to the absorbing boundary. In addition, when particles begin to reach the absorbing boundary before the time change in a stochastic DC occurs, a stochastic DC with a larger supremum leads to an earlier arrival of particles at the absorbing boundary even if the ensemble averages of stochastic DCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, three more properties are revealed. The mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach the absorbing boundary, the exact proportion of preceding particles is almost zero and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the L\'evy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties of diffusion with an ergodic DC result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the ensemble average. For three-dimensional diffusion with a spherical absorbing boundary, we obtain essentially the same results, except that the eventual absorption is not certain. Our results suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Propagator Imaging (MPI) with Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Microscopic Propagator Imaging (MPI) as a novel method to retrieve the indices of the microscopic propagator which is the probability density function of water displacements due to diffusion within the nervous tissue microstructures. Unlike the Ensemble Average Propagator indices or the Diffusion Tensor Imaging metrics, MPI indices are independent from the mesoscopic organization of the tissue such as the presence of multiple axonal bundle directions and orientation dispersion. As a consequence, MPI indices are more specific to the volumes, sizes, and types of microstructures, like axons and cells, that are present in the tissue. Thus, changes in MPI indices can be more directly linked to alterations in the presence and integrity of microstructures themselves. The methodology behind MPI is rooted on zonal modeling of spherical harmonics, signal simulation, and machine learning regression, and is demonstrated on both synthetic and Human Diffusion MRI data.</description>
