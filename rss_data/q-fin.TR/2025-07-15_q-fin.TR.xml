      <title>Boltzmann Price: Toward Understanding the Fair Price in High-Frequency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a parametrized family of prices derived from the Maximum Entropy Principle. The price is obtained from the distribution that minimizes bias, given the bid and ask volume imbalance at the top of the order book. Under specific parameter choices, it closely approximates the mid-price or the weighted mid-price. Using probabilities of bid and ask states, we propose a model of price dynamics in which both drift and volatility are driven by volume imbalance. Compared to standard models like Bachelier or Geometric Brownian Motion with constant volatility, our model can generate higher kurtosis and heavy-tailed distributions. Additionally, the drift term naturally emerges as a consequence of the order book imbalance. We validate the model through simulation and demonstrate its fit to historical equity data. The model provides a theoretical framework, integrating price, volume imbalance, and spread.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Trading Performance Through Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models: Evidence from the S&amp;P 500</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study integrates real-time sentiment analysis from financial news, GPT-2 and FinBERT, with technical indicators and time-series models like ARIMA and ETS to optimize S&amp;P 500 trading strategies. By merging sentiment data with momentum and trend-based metrics, including a benchmark buy-and-hold and sentiment-based approach, is evaluated through assets values and returns. Results show that combining sentiment-driven insights with traditional models improves trading performance, offering a more dynamic approach to stock trading that adapts to market changes in volatile environments.</description>

      <title>A Coincidence of Wants Mechanism for Swap Trade Execution in Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mathematically rigorous framework for identifying and completing Coincidence of Wants (CoW) cycles in decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators. Unlike existing auction based systems such as CoWSwap, our approach introduces an asset matrix formulation that not only verifies feasibility using oracle prices and formal conservation laws but also completes partial CoW cycles of swap orders that are discovered using graph traversal and are settled using imbalance correction. We define bridging orders and show that the resulting execution is slippage free and capital preserving for LPs. Applied to real world Arbitrum swap data, our algorithm demonstrates efficient discovery of CoW cycles and supports the insertion of synthetic orders for atomic cycle closure. This work can be thought of as the detailing of a potential delta-neutral strategy by liquidity providing market makers: a structured CoW cycle execution.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic regret in the ergodic Avellaneda-Stoikov market making model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the regret arising from learning the price sensitivity parameter $\kappa$ of liquidity takers in the ergodic version of the Avellaneda-Stoikov market making model. We show that a learning algorithm based on a maximum-likelihood estimator for the parameter achieves the regret upper bound of order $\ln^2 T$ in expectation. To obtain the result we need two key ingredients. The first is the twice differentiability of the ergodic constant under the misspecified parameter in the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with respect to $\kappa$, which leads to a second--order performance gap. The second is the learning rate of the regularised maximum-likelihood estimator which is obtained from concentration inequalities for Bernoulli signals. Numerical experiments confirm the convergence and the robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>
