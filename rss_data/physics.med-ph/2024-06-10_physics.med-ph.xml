      <title>Upright to supine image registration and contour propagation for thoracic patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A renewed interest in upright therapy is currently driven by the availability of upright positioning and imaging systems. Aside from reduced cost, upright positioning possibly provides clinical advantages. The comparison between upright and supine particle therapy treatments can be biased through multiple variables, such as differences in the target contouring on the two CTs. We present a method for upright and supine CT registration and structures propagation, and the investigation of an AI-based contouring tool for upright images. Six paired 4DCTs from Proton Therapy Collaboration Group registry were available from the Northwestern Medicine Proton Centre. Deformable image registration (DIR) is challenged by the different patient anatomy between postures, causing artefacts in the warped images. To achieve high quality contour propagation, we propose the construction of a region of interest covering the ribcage volume to overcome this problem. As no target contour ground truth was available, the registration quality analysis (QA) was performed on lung structures, for which dice score coefficient (DSC) and average Hausdorff distance (AHD) is reported. The TotalSegmentator tool, trained on supine dataset, was applied on upright images, verified against lung structures and used as additional comparison for contour propagation. The TotalSegmentator QA results in a maximum AHD of 2mm and a minimum DSC of 0.94. An average AHD of 1.5mm and 1.6mm, and an average DSC of 0.95 and 0.94 were obtained comparing the propagated volumes to manually contoured and AI structures, respectively. All AHD values are smaller than the CT slice distances. The developed framework allows for target propagation between upright and supine images, defining the first step to compare upright and supine therapy of thoracic patients and enabling the application of image fusion techniques in the upright therapy field.</description>

      <title>Dosimetric comparison of the BNCT treatment planning performances when using a nnU-NET to automatically segment Glioblastoma Multiforme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a preliminary evaluation of the use of the convolutional neural network nnU-NET to automatically contour the volume of Glioblastoma Multiforme in medical images of patients. The goal is to assist the preparation of the Treatment Planning of patients who undergo Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT). BNCT is a binary form of radiotherapy based on the selective loading of a suitable 10-boron concentration into the tumour and on subsequent low-energy neutron irradiation. The selectivity of the therapeutic effect is based on the capacity of the boron drug to target preferentially cancer cells, thus triggering the neutron capture only in the tumour and depositing there a lethal dose. Even if the tailoring of the beam to the tumour volume is less crucial for BNCT than for other radiation therapies, a proper delimitation of the tumour volume is needed to assess a safe and effective dosimetry. In clinical application the contour must be manually decided by the physician, however, a tool to automatically define important structures such as the Gross Tumour Volume (GTV) and the Organs At Risk (OAR) would be beneficial to enable medical physicists assessing preliminary positioning and simulated dosimetry before the approval or possible changes introduced by the radiotherapist. Moreover, an initial contouring may speed up the work of the physician. The nnU-NET was trained and tested and its performance was evaluated through different parameters such as the Dice Coefficient. To assess a more meaningful evaluation for BNCT, for the first time, this work analyzed the difference of the clinical dosimetry in 16 patients using the manual and the automatic contoured images.</description>

      <title>Nanodosimetric characterisation of proton track structure: a comparison of sampling and clustering algorithms using Geant4-DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the influence of the algorithm used to calculate conditional ionisation cluster size distributions (ICSD) and nanodosimetric parameters from proton track structures obtained with Geant4-DNA simulations. The Uniform Sampling (US) and Associated Volume (AV) sampling algorithms and the DBSCAN clustering algorithm were used to calculate the ICSD conditioned on cluster sizes $\nu \ge 1$. In the AV algorithm, we explored two configurations: one where sampling volumes could overlap ("Overlap") and one where volumes could not overlap ("No Overlap"). The Overlap configuration was corrected with the weight function $w(\nu)=\nu^{-1}$ to eliminate the bias towards regions of high density of ionisations. In sampling algorithms, clusters were defined as the number of ionisations in spheres of 3.4 nm in diameter. In DBSCAN, clusters were formed according to a proximity criterion (maximum distance of 3.4 nm) between two ionisations - no additional geometrical restrictions were applied. The conditional ICSD, the mean cluster size, and a set of complementary cumulative frequencies were compared. We considered differences in the mean difference larger than two standard deviations statistically significant. Overall, differences between the No Overlap and the Overlap configurations and between the US and AV algorithms were statistically significant but relatively small, except when statistical fluctuations dominated. DBSCAN always resulted in significantly larger mean cluster sizes. We showed that the fast and efficient AV can be used instead of the relatively inefficient US to calculate conditional ICSDs without significant loss of accuracy. The differences observed between DBSCAN and the other algorithms are understood and originate in the fact that while the scoring volume is fixed for the sampling algorithms, for DBSCAN, it evolves according to the distance between ionisations.</description>

      <title>Metasurfaces for infrared multi-modal microscopy: phase contrast and bright field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04576v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different imaging modalities are used to extract the diverse information carried in an optical field. Two prominent modalities include bright field and phase contrast microscopy that can visualize the amplitude and phase features of a sample, respectively. However, capturing both of these images on the same camera typically requires interchanging optical components. Metasurfaces are ultra-thin nanostructures that can merge both of these operations into a single miniaturized device. Here, a silicon-based metasurface that supports a Mie resonance is demonstrated to perform near-infrared phase contrast and bright field multi-modal microscopy that can be tuned by changing the polarization of the illumination. We performed experiments using optical fields with phase variations synthesized by a spatial light modulator and introduced by propagation through semi-transparent samples, including C. elegans, unstained human prostate cancer cells and breast tissue. The results demonstrate the potential of metasurfaces for label-free point-of-care testing.</description>

      <title>In vivo fundus imaging and computational refocusing with a diffuser-based fundus camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Access to eye care can be expanded with high-throughput, easy-to-use, and portable diagnostic tools. Phase mask encoded imaging could improve these aspects of the fundus camera by enabling computational refocusing without any moving parts. This approach circumvents the need to adjust lenses to compensate for refractive errors. We developed a computational fundus camera by introducing a holographic diffuser at the plane conjugate to the ocular pupil, resulting in a laterally shift-invariant point spread function. We demonstrate computational refocusing of a model eye fundus over a large range of defocus errors. We also show computationally refocused, color, in vivo, human fundus images with a $\geq$35-degree field-of-view (FOV). This technology could eventually be combined with the wavefront-sensing capabilities of phase mask encoded imaging to create a compact ophthalmic imaging system that simultaneously captures a fundus image and performs aberrometry.</description>
