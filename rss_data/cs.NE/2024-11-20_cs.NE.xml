      <title>Emergence of Implicit World Models from Mortal Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of world models and active exploration as emergent properties of open-ended behavior optimization in autonomous agents. In discussing the source of the open-endedness of living things, we start from the perspective of biological systems as understood by the mechanistic approach of theoretical biology and artificial life. From this perspective, we discuss the potential of homeostasis in particular as an open-ended objective for autonomous agents and as a general, integrative extrinsic motivation. We then discuss the possibility of implicitly acquiring a world model and active exploration through the internal dynamics of a network, and a hypothetical architecture for this, by combining meta-reinforcement learning, which assumes domain adaptation as a system that achieves robust homeostasis.</description>

      <title>The More the Merrier: On Evolving Five-valued Spectra Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolving Boolean functions with specific properties is an interesting optimization problem since, depending on the combination of properties and Boolean function size, the problem can range from very simple to (almost) impossible to solve. Moreover, some problems are more interesting as there may be only a few options for generating the required Boolean functions. This paper investigates one such problem: evolving five-valued spectra Boolean functions, which are the functions whose Walsh-Hadamard coefficients can only take five distinct values. We experimented with three solution encodings, two fitness functions, and 12 Boolean function sizes and showed that the tree encoding is superior to other choices, as we can obtain five-valued Boolean functions with high nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>SNN-Based Online Learning of Concepts and Action Laws in an Open World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the architecture of a fully autonomous, bio-inspired cognitive agent built around a spiking neural network (SNN) implementing the agent's semantic memory. The agent explores its universe and learns concepts of objects/situations and of its own actions in a one-shot manner. While object/situation concepts are unary, action concepts are triples made up of an initial situation, a motor activity, and an outcome. They embody the agent's knowledge of its universe's actions laws. Both kinds of concepts have different degrees of generality. To make decisions the agent queries its semantic memory for the expected outcomes of envisaged actions and chooses the action to take on the basis of these predictions. Our experiments show that the agent handles new situations by appealing to previously learned general concepts and rapidly modifies its concepts to adapt to environment changes.</description>

      <title>STREAM: A Universal State-Space Model for Sparse Geometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handling sparse and unstructured geometric data, such as point clouds or event-based vision, is a pressing challenge in the field of machine vision. Recently, sequence models such as Transformers and state-space models entered the domain of geometric data. These methods require specialized preprocessing to create a sequential view of a set of points. Furthermore, prior works involving sequence models iterate geometric data with either uniform or learned step sizes, implicitly relying on the model to infer the underlying geometric structure. In this work, we propose to encode geometric structure explicitly into the parameterization of a state-space model. State-space models are based on linear dynamics governed by a one-dimensional variable such as time or a spatial coordinate. We exploit this dynamic variable to inject relative differences of coordinates into the step size of the state-space model. The resulting geometric operation computes interactions between all pairs of N points in O(N) steps. Our model deploys the Mamba selective state-space model with a modified CUDA kernel to efficiently map sparse geometric data to modern hardware. The resulting sequence model, which we call STREAM, achieves competitive results on a range of benchmarks from point-cloud classification to event-based vision and audio classification. STREAM demonstrates a powerful inductive bias for sparse geometric data by improving the PointMamba baseline when trained from scratch on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN point cloud analysis datasets. It further achieves, for the first time, 100% test accuracy on all 11 classes of the DVS128 Gestures dataset.</description>

      <title>SpikingNeRF: Making Bio-inspired Neural Networks See through the Real World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10987v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose SpikingNeRF, which aligns the temporal dimension of spiking neural networks (SNNs) with the radiance rays, to seamlessly accommodate SNNs to the reconstruction of neural radiance fields (NeRF). Thus, the computation turns into a spike-based, multiplication-free manner, reducing energy consumption and making high-quality 3D rendering, for the first time, accessible to neuromorphic hardware. In SpikingNeRF, each sampled point on the ray is matched to a particular time step and represented in a hybrid manner where the voxel grids are maintained as well. Based on the voxel grids, sampled points are determined whether to be masked out for faster training and inference. However, this masking operation also incurs irregular temporal length, making it intractable for hardware processors, e.g., GPUs, to conduct parallel training. To address this problem, we develop the temporal padding strategy to tackle the masked samples to maintain regular temporal length, i.e., regular tensors, and further propose the temporal condensing strategy to form a denser data structure for hardware-friendly computation. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method can reduce energy consumption by an average of 70.79\% and obtain comparable synthesis quality with the ANN baseline. Verification on the neuromorphic hardware accelerator also shows that SpikingNeRF can further benefit from neuromorphic computing over the ANN baselines on energy efficiency. Codes and the appendix are in \url{https://github.com/Ikarosy/SpikingNeRF-of-CASIA}.</description>

      <title>Designing a Dataset for Convolutional Neural Networks to Predict Space Groups Consistent with Extinction Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a dataset of one-dimensional powder diffraction patterns was designed with new strategy to train Convolutional Neural Networks for predicting space groups. The diffraction pattern was calculated based on lattice parameters and Extinction Laws, instead of the traditional approach of generating it from a crystallographic database. This paper demonstrates that the new strategy is more effective than the conventional method. As a result, the model trained on the cubic and tetragonal training set from the newly designed dataset achieves prediction accuracy that matches the theoretical maximums calculated based on Extinction Laws. These results demonstrate that machine learning-based prediction can be both physically reasonable and reliable. Additionally, the model trained on our newly designed dataset shows excellent generalization capability, much better than the one trained on a traditionally designed dataset.</description>
