      <title>AG codes from the Hermitian curve for Cross-Subspace Alignment in Private Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Private information retrieval (PIR) addresses the problem of retrieving a desired message from distributed databases without revealing which message is being requested. Recent works have shown that cross-subspace alignment (CSA) codes constructed from algebraic geometry (AG) codes on high-genus curves can improve PIR rates over classical constructions. In this paper, we propose a new PIR scheme based on AG codes from the Hermitian curve, a well-known example of an $F_\ell$-maximal curve, that is, a curve defined over the finite field with $\ell$ elements which attains the Hasse-Weil upper bound on the number of its $F_\ell$-rational points. The large number of rational points enables longer code constructions, leading to higher retrieval rates than schemes based on genus 0, genus 1, and hyperelliptic curves of arbitrary genus. Our results highlight the potential of maximal curves as a natural source of efficient PIR constructions.</description>

      <title>The Dolbeault geometric Langlands conjecture via limit categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce limit categories for cotangent stacks of smooth stacks as an effective version of classical limits of categories of D-modules on them. We develop their general theory and pursue their relation with categories of D-modules. In particular, we establish the functorial properties of limit categories such as the smooth pull-back and projective push-forward. Using the notion of limit categories, we propose a precise formulation of the Dolbeault geometric Langlands conjecture, proposed by Donagi-Pantev as the classical limit of the de Rham geometric Langlands equivalence. It states an equivalence between the derived categories of moduli stacks of semistable Higgs bundles and limit categories of moduli stacks of all Higgs bundles. We prove the existence of a semiorthogonal decomposition of the limit category into quasi-BPS categories, which are categorical versions of BPS invariants on a non-compact Calabi-Yau 3-fold. This semiorthogonal decomposition is interpreted as a Langlands dual to the semiorthogonal decomposition constructed in our previous work on the category of coherent sheaves on the moduli stack of semistable Higgs bundles. We also construct Hecke operators on limit categories for Higgs bundles. They are expected to be compatible with Wilson operators under our formulation of Dolbeault geometric Langlands conjecture. The conjectured equivalence implies an equivalence between BPS categories for semistable Higgs bundles, which we expect to be a categorical version of the topological mirror symmetry conjecture for Higgs bundles by Hausel-Thaddeus.</description>

      <title>The index of a real vector field at an isolated complete intersection singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an unpublished note [H1] we have described a method to obtain a formula for the index of an analytic vector field with (complex) isolated zero on a real analytic hypersurface with (complex) isolated singularity. This formula, like the one of Eisenbud-Levine and Khimshiashvili [AGV] for smooth points, expresses the index by the signature of bilinear forms, which are defined by a local residue symbol (cf. [Ma]). In the complete intersection case, we use a generalized residue symbol, defined for free resolutions in [LJ], in the special case of generalized Koszul complexes to obtain a suitable calculus for the bilinear forms involved.</description>

Abstract: We study further Mumford's notion of local semistability and, in particular, show that semistable singularities are log canonical under mild assumptions. We provide many new examples of semistable and unstable singularities. More generally, we develop the theory of the Lech-Mumford constant, an invariant defined as an optimal constant in the Lech inequality.</description>

      <title>Tropical linear series and matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a notion of tropical linear series on metric graphs that combines two essential properties of tropicalizations of linear series on algebraic curves: the Baker-Norine rank and the independence rank. Our main results relate the local and global geometry of these tropical linear series to the combinatorial geometry of matroids and valuated matroids, respectively. As an application, we characterize exactly when the tropicalization of the canonical linear series on a single curve is equal to the locus of realizable tropical canonical divisors determined by M\"oller, Ulirsch, and Werner. We also illustrate our results with a wealth of examples; in particular, we show that the Bergman fan of every matroid appears as the local fan of a tropical linear series on a metric graph. The paper concludes with a list of ten open questions for future investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometric Tevelev degrees of projective space enumerate general, pointed algebraic curves interpolating through the maximal possible number of points. Previous work expresses these invariants in terms of Schubert calculus. Extending ideas of Gillespie--Reimer-Berg, we use the RSK correspondence to give a positive interpretation of these counts in terms of the combinatorics of words.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the $F$-signature function of the ample cone of any nontrivial ruled surface over $\mathbb{P}^1_k$ where $k$ is an algebraically closed field of prime characteristic. As an application, we construct a Noetherian $F$-finite strongly $F$-regular ring $R$ of prime characteristic admitting two maximal ideals $\mathfrak{n}_1,\mathfrak{n}_2\in \mathrm{Spec} R$ at which the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity and $F$-signature measure different singularities; that is, $\operatorname{e}_{\operatorname{HK}}(R_{\mathfrak{n}_1})&lt;\operatorname{e}_{\operatorname{HK}}(R_{\mathfrak{n}_2})$ and $s(R_{\mathfrak{n}_1})&lt;s(R_{\mathfrak{n}_2})$. Our calculation of the $F$-signature for the Hirzebruch surfaces also corrects an inaccuracy in a preprint by different authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general and effective algebraic framework for enumerating finite-length quotients of a torsion-free sheaf of arbitrary rank (the Quot zeta function) and finite-length coherent sheaves (the Coh zeta function) over reduced singular curves. We show that the Coh zeta function can be recovered as a transparent high-rank limit of Quot zeta functions. We prove that Quot zeta functions are motivically rational, using a novel parametrization and the geometry of affine Grassmannians, and that they satisfy an arbitrary-rank reflection principle, via harmonic analysis. As a first application, we compute explicit formulas for these zeta functions for all $y^2 = x^n$ singularities, revealing a surprising and previously unknown connection to Rogers--Ramanujan type $q$-series. Further applications to the enumerative geometry of affine Springer fibers and commuting varieties are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Tautological and non-tautological cycles on the moduli space of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tautological Chow ring of the moduli space $\mathcal{A}_g$ of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension $g$ was defined and calculated by van der Geer in 1999. By studying the Torelli pullback of algebraic cycles classes from $\mathcal{A}_g$ to the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_g^{\mathrm{ct}}$ of genus $g$ of curves of compact type, we prove that the product class $[\mathcal{A}_1\times \mathcal{A}_5]\in \mathsf{CH}^{5}(\mathcal{A}_6)$ is non-tautological, the first construction of an interesting non-tautological algebraic class on the moduli spaces of abelian varieties. For our proof, we use the complete description of the the tautological ring $\mathsf{R}^*(\mathcal{M}_6^{\mathrm{ct}})$ in genus 6 conjectured by Pixton and recently proven by Canning-Larson-Schmitt. The tautological ring $\mathsf{R}^*(\mathcal{M}_6^{\mathrm{ct}})$ has a 1-dimensional Gorenstein kernel, which is geometrically explained by the Torelli pullback of $[\mathcal{A}_1\times \mathcal{A}_5]$. More generally, the Torelli pullback of the difference between $[\mathcal{A}_1\times \mathcal{A}_{g-1}]$ and its tautological projection always lies in the Gorenstein kernel of $\mathsf{R}^*(\mathcal{M}_g^{\mathrm{ct}})$.
  The product map $\mathcal{A}_1\times \mathcal{A}_{g-1}\rightarrow \mathcal{A}_g$ is a Noether-Lefschetz locus with general Neron-Severi rank 2. A natural extension of van der Geer's tautological ring is obtained by including more general Noether-Lefschetz loci. Results and conjectures related to cycle classes of Noether-Lefschetz loci for all $g$ are presented.</description>

Abstract: A Calabi-Yau pair of index one and complexity zero is toric. Furthermore, a Calabi-Yau pair of index one and complexity one is of cluster type. In this article, we study Calabi-Yau pairs of index one and complexity two. We develop machinery to decide whether a Calabi-Yau of complexity two is of cluster type. This approach reduces the problem to studying del Pezzo fibrations over toric varieties. We apply this to the setting of Gorenstein del Pezzo surfaces of Picard rank one. We prove that such a surface $X$ is cluster type if and only if $X$ has only $A$-type singularities and either $\mathrm{vol}(X)&gt;1$ or $|X^{\rm sing}|\leq 3$.</description>

      <title>On The Geometry and Topology of Cayley Condition in Poncelet Porism for Triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19349v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the differential-geometric and topological properties of the Cayley condition in Poncelet porism for triangles, defined as the locus of pairs of non-degenerate conics that admit a Poncelet triangle. While the algebraic condition for this porism, established by Cayley, is classical, the geometric nature of the set of solutions has remained largely unexplored. We demonstrate that this Cayley set is a smooth, connected, 9-dimensional complex manifold. This is proven by showing it is an open subset of a smooth algebraic variety endowed with a trivial fiber bundle structure over the space of non-degenerate conics.
  To further analyze its structure, we construct the moduli space of transversely intersecting conic pairs under the action of $\mathbb{P}GL_3(\mathbb{C})$ and identify it with an open subset of $\mathbb{CP}^2/S_3$. We compute the fundamental group of a generic orbit.
  The elliptic j-invariant is then introduced as a holomorphic map on this space of conics, which factors through this moduli space. We analyze the subset of the Cayley set where this map is a submersion - its regular part - which corresponds to excluding points whose j-invariant is one of the critical values $0$ or $1728$. We prove that this regular part is the total space of a fiber bundle over $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{0,1728\}$. This structure allows for the computation of the fundamental group via the long exact sequence of homotopy.
  Finally, we provide a principal bundle formulation for the Poncelet correspondence itself over orbits of conic pairs.</description>

      <title>Decomposing the Diagonals of Invariant Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work begins the process of using the decomposition of the diagonal as a tool for studying the rationality of invariant fields of finite groups $G$. Our ground field must be characteristic 0 because of the use we make of Bertini theorems. The steps we take are, first, defining and studying an "open" version of Chow zero. Second, we use this to translate our study to that of a Chow group of $G$ Galois extensions. We prove a "Sylow" property and thereby yield a connection between the invariants of $G$ and that of its Sylow subgroups. In particular, we show that if $G$ is a finite group with $p$ Sylow subgroup $P$, $V$ is a faithful $G$ module, and $F(V)^P$ has nontrivial unramified cohomology, then $F(V)^G$ is not retract rational. Finally, we prove Sylow type theorems for decomposition of the diagonal and the centers of generic division algebras.</description>

      <title>$g$-vectors and $DT$-$F$-polynomials for Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review $\mathrm{Hom}$-infinite Frobenius categorification of cluster algebras with coefficients and use it to give two applications of Jensen--King--Su's Frobenius categorification of the Grassmannian: 1) we determine the $g$-vectors of the Pl\"ucker coordinates with respect to the triangular initial seed and 2) we express the $F$-polynomials associated with the Donaldson--Thomas transformation in terms of $3$-dimensional Young diagrams thus providing a new proof for a theorem of Daping Weng.</description>

      <title>Solving generic parametric linear matrix inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) $A = A_0 + x_1 A_1 + ... + x_n A_n \succeq 0$ with the $A_i$'s being $m \times m$ symmetric matrices, with entries in a ring $\mathcal{R}$. When $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{R}$, the feasibility problem consists in deciding whether the $x_i$'s can be instantiated to obtain a positive semidefinite matrix. When $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{Q}[y_1, ... , y_t]$, the problem asks for a formula on the parameters $y_1, ..., y_t$, which describes the values of the parameters for which the specialized LMI is feasible. This problem can be solved using general quantifier elimination algorithms, with a complexity that is exponential in n. In this work, we leverage the LMI structure of the problem to design an algorithm that computes a formula $\Phi$ describing a dense subset of the feasible region of parameters, under genericity assumptions. The complexity of this algorithm is exponential in n, m and t but becomes polynomial in $n$ when $m$ and $t$ are fixed. We apply the algorithm to a parametric sum-of-squares problem and to the convergence analyses of certain first-order optimization methods, which are both known to be equivalent to the feasibility of certain parametric LMIs, hence demonstrating its practical interest.</description>

      <title>Variants on Frobenius Intersection Flatness and Applications to Tate Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of singularities defined by Frobenius has been extensively developed for $F$-finite rings and for rings that are essentially of finite type over excellent local rings. However, important classes of non-local excellent rings, such as Tate algebras and their quotients (affinoid algebras) do not fit into either setting. We investigate here a framework for moving beyond the $F$-finite setting, developing the theory of three related classes of regular rings defined by properties of Frobenius. In increasing order of strength, these are Frobenius Ohm-Rush (FOR), Frobenius intersection flat, and Frobenius Ohm-Rush trace (FORT).
  We show that Tate algebras are Frobenius intersection flat, from which it follows that reduced affinoid algebras have test elements using a result of Sharp. We also deduce new cases of the openness of the $F$-pure locus.</description>
