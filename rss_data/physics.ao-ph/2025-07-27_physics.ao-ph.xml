      <title>Quantifying Carbon Cycle Extremes and Attributing Their Causes Under Climate and Land Use &amp; Land Cover Change from 1850 to 2300</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rising carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to human activities, such as fossil fuel burning and land use and land cover change (LULCC), are the major driver of climate change. Heatwaves, droughts, and fires have increased and are expected to accelerate with climate change in the twenty-first century and beyond. This increase in extreme climate conditions has the potential to further alter vegetation productivity (called gross primary production or GPP) and carbon uptake capacity. Here, we use a global Earth system model to investigate the impacts of (a) CO2 forcing and (b) CO2 and LULCC forcing on the intensity, frequency, and duration of extreme events in GPP. We found that the negative extremes in GPP, which are associated with higher losses in carbon uptake than expected, increase at a higher rate than positive GPP extremes; and this rate rises with LULCC forcing. The most dominant climate driver causing the GPP extremes is soil moisture anomalies, which are triggered by extremes in precipitation and temperature. The lagged responses of climate drivers on GPP extremes vary with the drivers and spatial location. The largest number of GPP extremes were driven by the compound effect of water-, temperature-, and fire-related drivers.</description>

      <title>CNN-based Surface Temperature Forecasts with Ensemble Numerical Weather Prediction over Medium-range Forecast Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a method that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with ensemble numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, enabling surface temperature forecasting at lead times beyond the short-range (five-day) forecast period. Owing to limited computational resources, operational medium-range temperature forecasts typically rely on low-resolution NWP models, which are prone to systematic and random errors. To resolve these limitations, the proposed method first reduces systematic errors through CNN-based post-processing (bias correction and spatial super-resolution) on each ensemble member, reconstructing high-resolution temperature fields from low-resolution model outputs. Second, it reduces random errors through ensemble averaging of the CNN-corrected members. This study also investigates whether the sequence of CNN correction and ensemble averaging affects the forecast accuracy. For comparison with the proposed method, we additionally conducted experiments with the CNN trained on ensemble-averaged forecasts. The first approach--CNN correction before ensemble averaging--consistently achieved higher accuracy than the reverse approach. Although based on low-resolution ensemble forecasts, the proposed method notably outperformed the high-resolution deterministic NWP models. These findings indicate that combining CNN-based correction with ensemble averaging effectively reduces both the systematic and random errors in NWP model outputs. The proposed approach is a practical and scalable solution for improving medium-range temperature forecasts, and is particularly valuable at operational centers with limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Discovering the dynamics of \emph{Sargassum} rafts' centers of mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since 2011, rafts of floating \emph{Sargassum} seaweed have frequently obstructed the coasts of the Intra-Americas Seas. The motion of the rafts is represented by a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Referred to as the eBOMB model, this builds on the Maxey--Riley equation by incorporating interactions between clumps of \emph{Sargassum} forming a raft and the effects of Earth's rotation. The absence of a predictive law for the rafts' centers of mass suggests a need for machine learning. In this paper, we evaluate and contrast Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). In both cases, a physics-inspired closure modeling approach is taken rooted in eBOMB. Specifically, the LSTM model learns a mapping from a collection of eBOMB variables to the difference between raft center-of-mass and ocean velocities. The SINDy model's library of candidate functions is suggested by eBOMB variables and includes windowed velocity terms incorporating far-field effects of the carrying flow. Both LSTM and SINDy models perform most effectively in conditions with tightly bonded clumps, despite declining precision with rising complexity, such as with wind effects and when assessing loosely connected clumps. The LSTM model delivered the best results when designs were straightforward, with fewer neurons and hidden layers. While LSTM model serves as an opaque black-box model lacking interpretability, the SINDy model brings transparency by discerning explicit functional relationships through the function libraries. Integration of the windowed velocity terms enabled effective modeling of nonlocal interactions, particularly in datasets featuring sparsely connected rafts.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Cross-Sphere Multiscale Deep Learning Predicts ENSO Skilfully Beyond 2 Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exerts global climate and societal impacts, but real-time prediction with lead times beyond one year remains challenging. Dynamical models suffer from large biases and uncertainties, while deep learning struggles with interpretability and multi-scale dynamics. Here, we introduce PTSTnet, an interpretable model that unifies dynamical processes and cross-scale spatiotemporal learning in an innovative neural-network framework with physics-encoding learning. PTSTnet produces interpretable predictions significantly outperforming state-of-the-art benchmarks with lead times beyond 24 months, providing physical insights into error propagation in ocean-atmosphere interactions. PTSTnet learns feature representations with physical consistency from sparse data to tackle inherent multi-scale and multi-physics challenges underlying ocean-atmosphere processes, thereby inherently enhancing long-term prediction skill. Our successful realizations mark substantial steps forward in interpretable insights into innovative neural ocean modelling.</description>

      <title>Examining Entropic Unbalanced Optimal Transport and Sinkhorn Divergences for Spatial Forecast Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An optimal transport (OT) problem seeks to find the cheapest mapping between two distributions with equal total density, given the cost of transporting density from one place to another. Unbalanced OT allows for different total density in each distribution. This is the typical setting for precipitation forecast and observation data, when considering the densities as accumulated rainfall, or intensity. In this work, entropic unbalanced OT and its associated Sinkhorn divergence are examined as a spatial forecast verification method for precipitation data. It offers many attractive features, such as morphing one field into another, defining a distance between fields and providing feature based optimal assignment. It is found that the Sinkhorn divergence is robust against the common double penalty problem (a form of phase error), on average aligns with expert assessments of model performance, and allows for a variety of novel pictorial illustrations of error. It provides informative summary scores, and has few limitations to its application. Combined, these findings place unbalanced entropy regularised optimal transport and the Sinkhorn divergence as an informative method which follows geometric intuition.</description>
