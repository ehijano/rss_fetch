      <title>From fully-nonlinear to semilinear evolution equations: two symmetry-integrable examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive two examples of fully-nonlinear symmetry-integrable evolution equations with algebraic nonlinearities, namely one class of 3rd-order equations and a 5th-order equation. To achieve this we study the equations' Lie-B\"acklund symmetries and apply multipotentialisations, hodograph transformations and generalised hodograph transformations to map the equations to known semilinear integrable evolution equations. As a result of this, we also obtain interesting symmetry-integrable quasilinear equations of order five and order seven, which we display explicitly.</description>

      <title>A corresponding relationship between nonlinear Hermitian systems and linear non-Hermitian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We note that the non-orthogonality of states and their coincidence at the degeneracy point are both admitted by nonlinear Hermitian systems and linear non-Hermitian systems. These striking characteristics motivate us to re-investigate the localized waves of nonlinear Hermitian systems and the eigenvalue degeneracies of linear non-Hermitian models, based on several well-known Lax integrable systems that have wide applications in nonlinear optics. We choose nonlinear Schrodinger equation integrability hierarchy to demonstrate the quantitative relations between dynamics of nonlinear Hermitian systems and eigenvalue degeneracies of linear non-Hermitian models. Specifically, the degeneracies of the real or imaginary spectrum of the linear non-Hermitian matrices are uncovered to clarify several essential characteristics of nonlinear localized waves, such as breathers, rogue waves, and solitons. We find that the exceptional points generally correspond to rogue waves for modulational instability cases and dark solitons with maximum velocity for the modulational stability cases. These insights provide another interesting perspective for understanding nonlinear localized waves, and hint that there are closer relations between nonlinear Hermitian systems and linear non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Dark states in an integrable XY central spin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04651v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eigenstates of central spin models in which the central spin is unentangled with the environment are known as dark states. They have recently been observed in a class of integrable XX models. Here we find that dark states are present in XY models, but only for particular configurations of the central spin magnetic field. We show this via an explicit construction of the Bethe states.</description>

      <title>Tremblay-Turbiner-Winternitz (TTW) system at integer index $k$: polynomial algebras of integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite 3-parametric family of superintegrable and exactly-solvable quantum models on a plane, admitting separation of variables in polar coordinates, marked by integer index $k$ was introduced in Journ Phys A 42 (2009) 242001 and was called in literature the TTW system. In this paper it is conjectured that the Hamiltonian and both integrals of TTW system have hidden algebra $g^{(k)}$ - it was checked for $k=1,2,3,4$ - having its finite-dimensional representation spaces as the invariant subspaces. It is checked that for $k=1,2,3,4$ that the Hamiltonian $H$, two integrals ${\cal I}_{1,2}$ and their commutator ${\cal I}_{12} = [{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2]$ are four generating elements of the polynomial algebra of integrals of the order $(k+1)$: $[{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_{12}] = P_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, $[{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_{12}] = Q_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, where $P_{k+1},Q_{k+1}$ are polynomials of degree $(k+1)$ written in terms of ordered monomials of $H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12}$. This implies that polynomial algebra of integrals is subalgebra of $g^{(k)}$. It is conjectured that all is true for any integer $k$.</description>
