      <title>Conformal Predictive Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores portfolio selection using predictive models for portfolio returns. Portfolio selection is a fundamental task in finance, and various methods have been developed to achieve this goal. For example, the mean-variance approach constructs portfolios by balancing the trade-off between the mean and variance of asset returns, while the quantile-based approach optimizes portfolios by accounting for tail risk. These traditional methods often rely on distributional information estimated from historical data. However, a key concern is the uncertainty of future portfolio returns, which may not be fully captured by simple reliance on historical data, such as using the sample average. To address this, we propose a framework for predictive portfolio selection using conformal inference, called Conformal Predictive Portfolio Selection (CPPS). Our approach predicts future portfolio returns, computes corresponding prediction intervals, and selects the desirable portfolio based on these intervals. The framework is flexible and can accommodate a variety of predictive models, including autoregressive (AR) models, random forests, and neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our CPPS framework using an AR model and validate its performance through empirical studies, showing that it provides superior returns compared to simpler strategies.</description>

      <title>Neuroevolution Neural Architecture Search for Evolving RNNs in Stock Return Prediction and Portfolio Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock return forecasting is a major component of numerous finance applications. Predicted stock returns can be incorporated into portfolio trading algorithms to make informed buy or sell decisions which can optimize returns. In such portfolio trading applications, the predictive performance of a time series forecasting model is crucial. In this work, we propose the use of the Evolutionary eXploration of Augmenting Memory Models (EXAMM) algorithm to progressively evolve recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for stock return predictions. RNNs are evolved independently for each stocks and portfolio trading decisions are made based on the predicted stock returns. The portfolio used for testing consists of the 30 companies in the Dow-Jones Index (DJI) with each stock have the same weight. Results show that using these evolved RNNs and a simple daily long-short strategy can generate higher returns than both the DJI index and the S&amp;P 500 Index for both 2022 (bear market) and 2023 (bull market).</description>

      <title>Financial Performance and Economic Implications of COFCO's Strategic Acquisition of Mengniu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) process between COFCO and Mengniu Dairy, exploring the motivations behind this strategic move and identifying its key aspects. By analyzing both the financial and non-financial contributions of Mengniu Dairy to COFCO, this study provides valuable insights and references for future corporate M&amp;A activities. The theoretical significance of this research lies in its focus on the relatively underexplored area of M&amp;A within the dairy industry, particularly in terms of M&amp;A contributions. Using the COFCO-Mengniu case as a model, the study broadens current research perspectives by assessing the impact of M&amp;A from financial and non-financial standpoints, enriching the body of literature on dairy industry M&amp;As.</description>
