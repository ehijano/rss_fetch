      <title>Geometric Approaches to Matrix Normalization and Graph Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normal matrices, or matrices which commute with their adjoints, are of fundamental importance in pure and applied mathematics. In this paper, we study a natural functional on the space of square complex matrices whose global minimizers are normal matrices. We show that this functional, which we refer to as the non-normal energy, has incredibly well-behaved gradient descent dynamics: despite it being non-convex, we show that the only critical points of the non-normal energy are the normal matrices, and that its gradient descent trajectories fix matrix spectra and preserve the subset of real matrices. We also show that, even when restricted to the subset of unit Frobenius norm matrices, the gradient flow of the non-normal energy retains many of these useful properties. This is applied to prove that low-dimensional homotopy groups of spaces of unit norm normal matrices vanish; for example, we show that the space of $d \times d$ complex unit norm normal matrices is simply connected for all $d \geq 2$. Finally, we consider the related problem of balancing a weighted directed graph -- that is, readjusting its edge weights so that the weighted in-degree and out-degree is the same at each node. We adapt the non-normal energy to define another natural functional whose global minima are balanced graphs and show that gradient descent of this functional always converges to a balanced graph, while preserving graph spectra and realness of the weights. Our results were inspired by concepts from symplectic geometry and Geometric Invariant Theory, but we mostly avoid invoking this machinery and our proofs are generally self-contained.</description>

      <title>The Morse property of limit functions appearing in mean field equations on surfaces with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the Morse property for functions related to limit functions of mean field equations on a smooth, compact surface $\Sigma$ with boundary $\partial\Sigma$. Given a Riemannian metric $g$ on $\Sigma$ we consider functions of the form
  \[
  f_g(x) := \sum_{i=1}^m\sigma_i^2R^g(x_i)+\sum_{i,j=1\\i\ne j}^m\sigma_i\sigma_jG^g(x_i,x_j)+h(x_1,\ldots,x_m),
  \]
  where $\sigma_i \neq 0$ for $i=1,\ldots,m$, $G^g$ is the Green function of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $(\Sigma,g)$ with Neumann boundary conditions, $R^g$ is the corresponding Robin function, and $h \in \mathcal{C}^{2}(\Sigma^m,\mathbb{R})$ is arbitrary. We prove that for any Riemannian metric $g$, there exists a metric $\widetilde g$ which is arbitrarily close to $g$ and in the conformal class of $g$ such that $f_{\widetilde g}$ is a Morse function. Furthermore we show that, if all $\sigma_i&gt;0$, then the set of Riemannian metrics for which $f_g$ is a Morse function is open and dense in the set of all Riemannian metrics.</description>

      <title>Existence and uniqueness of $t$-graphs of prescribed mean curvature in Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the prescribed mean curvature equation for $t$-graphs in a Riemannian Heisenberg group of arbitrary dimension. We characterize the existence of classical solutions in a bounded domain without imposing Dirichlet boundary data, and we provide conditions that guarantee uniqueness. Moreover, we extend previous results to solve the Dirichlet problem when the mean curvature is non-constant. Finally, by an approximation technique, we obtain solutions to the sub-Riemannian prescribed mean curvature equation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of unitary matrix elements in canonical bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the asymptotics of matrix elements in canonical bases of irreducible representations of the unitary group as the highest weight goes to infinity, in terms of the symplectic geometry of the associated coadjoint orbit. This uses tools of Berezin-Toeplitz quantization, and recovers as a special case the asymptotics of Wigner's d-matrix elements for the spin representations in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>The volume of pseudoeffective line bundles and partial equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.03827v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(L,he^{-u})$ be a pseudoeffective line bundle on an $n$-dimensional compact K\"ahler manifold $X$. Let $h^0(X,L^k\otimes \mathcal I(ku))$ be the dimension of the space of sections $s$ of $L^k$ such that $h^k(s,s)e^{-ku}$ is integrable. We show that the limit of $k^{-n}h^0(X,L^k\otimes \mathcal I(ku))$ exists, and equals the non-pluripolar volume of $P[u]_\mathcal I$, the $\mathcal I$-model potential associated to $u$. We give applications of this result to K\"ahler quantization: fixing a Bernstein-Markov measure $\nu$, we show that the partial Bergman measures of $u$ converge weakly to the non-pluripolar Monge--Amp\`ere measure of $P[u]_\mathcal I$, the partial equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flatness and E. Hopf's theorem for magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the notion of magnetic curvature recently introduced by the first author, we extend E. Hopf's theorem to the setting of magnetic systems. Namely, we prove that if the magnetic flow on the s-sphere bundle is without conjugate points, then the total magnetic curvature is non-positive, and vanishes if and only if the magnetic system is magnetically flat. We then prove that magnetic flatness is a rigid condition, in the sense that it only occurs when either the magnetic form is trivial and the metric is flat, or when the magnetic system is K\"ahler, the metric has constant negative sectional holomorphic curvature, and s equals the Ma\~n\'e critical value.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of the singular set of perimeter minimizers in spaces with a two-sided Ricci curvature bound</title>

Abstract: We show that the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set of perimeter minimizers in non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces with a two-sided Ricci curvature bound is at most $N-5$, where $N$ is the dimension of the ambient space. The estimate is sharp.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Kinematics of Recursive Origami Inspired by the Spidron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-periodic folding of periodic crease patterns paves the way to novel nonlinear phenomena that cannot be feasible through periodic folding. This paper focuses on the non-periodic folding of recursive crease patterns generalized from Spidron. Although it is known that the Spidron has a $1$-DOF isotropic rigid folding motion, its general kinematics and dependence on the crease pattern remain unclear. Using the kinematics of a single unit cell of the Spidron and the recursive construction of the folded state of multiple unit cells, we consider the folding of the Spidron that is not necessarily isotropic. We found that as the number of unit cells increases, the non-periodic folding is restricted and the isotropic folding becomes dominant. Then, we analyze the three kinds of isotropic folding modes by constructing $1$-dimensional dynamical systems governing each of them. We show that these systems can possess different recursive natures depending on folding modes even in an identical crease pattern. Furthermore, we show their novel nonlinear nature, including the period-doubling cascade leading to the emergence of chaos.</description>
