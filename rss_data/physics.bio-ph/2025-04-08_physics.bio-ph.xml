      <title>In vivo mapping organellar metabolism by optical-boxcar enhanced fluorescence-detected mid-infrared photothermal microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metabolism unfolds within specific organelles in eukaryotic cells. Lysosomes are highly metabolically active organelles, and their metabolic states dynamically influence signal transduction, cellular homeostasis, and organismal physiopathology. Despite the significance of lysosomal metabolism, a method for its in vivo measurement is currently lacking. Here, we report optical boxcar-enhanced, fluorescence-detected mid-infrared photothermal microscopy, together with AI-assisted data denoising and spectral deconvolution, to map metabolic activity and composition of individual lysosomes in living cells and organisms. Using this method, we uncovered lipolysis and proteolysis heterogeneity across lysosomes within the same cell, as well as early-onset lysosomal dysfunction during organismal aging. Additionally, we discovered organelle-level metabolic changes associated with diverse lysosomal storage diseases. This method holds the broad potential to profile metabolic fingerprints of individual organelles within their native context and quantitatively assess their dynamic changes under different physiological and pathological conditions, providing a high-resolution chemical cellular atlas.</description>

      <title>Plasma-Treated Polymeric Biomaterials for Improved Surface and Cell Adhesion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface modification of polymeric biomaterials using plasma has emerged as an effective strategy to optimize the cell-material interface without compromising the structural properties of the material. This work presents a critical review of the impact of low-temperature plasma treatment on enhancing cell adhesion, with emphasis on the physicochemical changes induced on the surface of polymers commonly used in biomedical applications. The mechanisms of interaction between reactive plasma species and the polymer surface are analyzed, along with techniques used to introduce hydrophilic functional groups that improve wettability and biocompatibility. Scientific evidence demonstrates that this type of surface modification promotes greater cell spreading, anchorage, and proliferation, making it particularly useful in the design of tissue engineering scaffolds, implantable devices, and vascular prostheses. Finally, current and future trends in the development of smart plasma-functionalized biomaterials are discussed, highlighting their role in regenerative medicine.</description>

      <title>Vortex transition and thermal mixing by pitching a perforated flexible panel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective transport of heat and mass is crucial to both industrial applications and physiological processes. Recent research has evaluated the benefit of using flexible reeds for triggering the vortex induced vibration to enhance mixing, as opposed to traditional techniques like rigid blender or static meshes. Inspired by the soft, porous, and moving fish gill lamellae, we proposed a new concept of thermal dispenser that prescribes active pitching motion to the leading edge of an otherwise passively flapping perforated panel. Experimental measurements revealed drastic differences between the steady leaky flow wake behind a statically deflected perforated panel and the periodic shedding wakes with complex vortex structure transitions behind an actuated perforated panel with or without chord-wise flexibility. A semi-empirical simulation of the thermal convection and diffusion takes the experimentally obtained velocity as input and yields the temperature results. Vortex dynamics, Lagrangian coherent structures, and thermal mixing behaviors were analyzed and compared to elucidate the effects of kinematics, perforation, and flexibility on the wake mode transitions, lateral entrainment mixing, and overall heating. Our work provides a foundational understanding of the fluid-structure interactions of perforated bendable panels under active control which has not been described before in the intermediate Reynolds number range. It provides insights for developing an innovative bio-inspired heat or mass dispenser potentially suitable for subtle and small scale applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting Soil Macronutrient Levels: A Machine Learning Approach Models Trained on pH, Conductivity, and Average Power of Acid-Base Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soil macronutrients, particularly potassium ions (K$^+$), are indispensable for plant health, underpinning various physiological and biological processes, and facilitating the management of both biotic and abiotic stresses. Deficient macronutrient content results in stunted growth, delayed maturation, and increased vulnerability to environmental stressors, thereby accentuating the imperative for precise soil nutrient monitoring. Traditional techniques such as chemical assays, atomic absorption spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods, albeit advanced, are prohibitively expensive and time-intensive, thus unsuitable for real-time macronutrient assessment. In this study, we propose an innovative soil testing protocol utilizing a dataset derived from synthetic solutions to model soil behaviour. The dataset encompasses physical properties including conductivity and pH, with a concentration on three key macronutrients: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Four machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset, with random forest regressors and neural networks being selected for the prediction of soil nutrient concentrations. Comparative analysis with laboratory soil testing results revealed prediction errors of 23.6% for phosphorus and 16% for potassium using the random forest model, and 26.3% for phosphorus and 21.8% for potassium using the neural network model. This methodology illustrates a cost-effective and efficacious strategy for real-time soil nutrient monitoring, offering substantial advancements over conventional techniques and enhancing the capability to sustain optimal nutrient levels conducive to robust crop growth.</description>

      <title>Retinotopic Mechanics derived using classical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of a cell$'$s receptive field is a bedrock in systems neuroscience, and the classical static description of the receptive field has had enormous success in explaining the fundamental mechanisms underlying visual processing. Borne out by the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual sensitivity to probe stimuli in primates, I build on top of this static account with the introduction of a new computational field of research, retinotopic mechanics. At its core, retinotopic mechanics assumes that during active sensing receptive fields are not static but can shift beyond their classical extent. Specifically, the canonical computations and the neural architecture that supports these computations are inherently mediated by a neurobiologically inspired force field (e.g.,$R_s\propto \sim 1 /\Delta M$). For example, when the retina is displaced because of a saccadic eye movement from one point in space to another, cells across retinotopic brain areas are tasked with discounting the retinal disruptions such active surveillance inherently introduces. This neural phenomenon is known as spatial constancy. Using retinotopic mechanics, I propose that to achieve spatial constancy or any active visually mediated task, retinotopic cells, namely their receptive fields, are constrained by eccentricity dependent elastic fields. I propose that elastic fields are self-generated by the visual system and allow receptive fields the ability to predictively shift beyond their classical extent to future post-saccadic location such that neural sensitivity which would otherwise support intermediate eccentric locations likely to contain retinal disruptions is transiently blunted.</description>

      <title>Human perceptual decision making of nonequilibrium fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To better characterize the statistical processes underlying human decision-making, we performed experiments where human participants visualized fluctuations of physical nonequilibrium stationary states, and we analyzed responses in the context of stochastic thermodynamics. A total of forty five participants viewed hundreds of movies of a particle endowed with drifted Brownian dynamics and were tasked with judging the motion as leftward or rightward in a quick and reliable manner. Overall, the results uncover fundamental performance limits, consistent with recently established thermodynamic trade-offs (uncertainty relations, TURs) involving speed, accuracy, and dissipation; specifically, lower rates of entropy production lead to longer decision times. Moreover, to achieve a given level of observed accuracy, participants require more time than predicted by Wald's optimal sequential probability ratio test, indicating suboptimal integration of available information. In view of such suboptimality, we develop an alternative account equipped with non-Markovian evidence integration with a memory time constant, and find tight fits. Our results suggest that humans adapt their memory relaxation time to the rate of dissipation of the observed phenomenon, favouring memory over momentary evidence for effective decisions in scenarios where stimuli are far from equilibrium. Furthermore, we identify the effects of the environmental stability on decision-making performance and memory by comparing the results of the two sets of experiments: blocked (stationary) versus intermixed (non-stationary) conditions. Our study illustrates that perceptual psychophysics using stimuli rooted in nonequilibrium physical processes provides a robust platform for understanding how the human brain makes decisions on stochastic information inputs.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional chiral active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model for helical motion of microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active movement is essential for the survival of microorganisms like bacteria, algae and unicellular parasites. In three dimensions, both swimming and gliding microorganisms often exhibit helical trajectories. Here we introduce a general stochastic dynamics model for these cases, namely a chiral active particle with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for torque, which implies a finite correlation time for internal noise. We present an analytical solution which is in very good agreement with computer simulations. We then show that for this type of internal noise, chirality and rotation increase the persistence of motion and results in helical trajectories that have a larger long-time mean squared displacement than straight trajectories at the same propulsion speed. We finally provide an experimental example by analyzing imaging data for malaria parasites that glide through hydrogels on helical trajectories.</description>

      <title>Effects of Flagellar Morphology on Swimming Performance and Directional Control in Microswimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a fluid environment, flagellated microswimmers propel themselves by rotating their flagella. The morphology of these flagella significantly influences forward speed, swimming efficiency, and directional stability, which are critical for their survival. This study begins by simulating the three-dimensional motion trajectories of microswimmers to analyze their kinematic characteristics. The simulation results demonstrate that microswimmers can actively adjust their forward direction by modifying the orientation of their flagella. We subsequently perform numerical simulations to visualize the flow fields generated by a microswimmer and examine the hydrodynamic interactions between the cell body and the flagella, focusing on their impacts on forward speed and swimming efficiency. We conclude that forward speed and swimming efficiency are closely related to the filament radius, pitch angle, and contour length of the flagella, while the yaw angle of locomotion is determined by the helix radius and contour length of the flagella. We conclude that the pitch angle for maximum forward speed is slightly smaller than that for maximum swimming efficiency, which suggests that microswimmers can effectively alternate between states of maximum forward speed and maximum swimming efficiency by fine-tuning their pitch angle and adapting to varying ecological conditions. These morphological characteristics of microswimmers may result from species competition and natural selection. This research establishes an optimized model for microswimmers, providing valuable insights for the design of enhanced microrobots tailored to specific applications.</description>
