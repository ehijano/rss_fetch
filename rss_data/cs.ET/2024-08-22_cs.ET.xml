      <title>Automated Synthesis of Fault-Tolerant State Preparation Circuits for Quantum Error Correction Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central ingredient in fault-tolerant quantum algorithms is the initialization of a logical state for a given quantum error-correcting code from a set of noisy qubits. A scheme that has demonstrated promising results for small code instances that are realizable on currently available hardware composes a non-fault-tolerant state preparation step with a verification step that checks for spreading errors. Known circuit constructions of this scheme are mostly obtained manually, and no algorithmic techniques for constructing depth- or gate-optimal circuits exist. As a consequence, the current state of the art exploits this scheme only for specific code instances and mostly for the special case of distance 3 codes. In this work, we propose an automated approach for synthesizing fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for arbitrary CSS codes. We utilize methods based on satisfiability solving (SAT) techniques to construct fault-tolerant state preparation circuits consisting of depth- and gate-optimal preparation and verification circuits. We also provide heuristics that can synthesize fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for code instances where no optimal solution can be obtained in an adequate timeframe. Moreover, we give a general construction for non-deterministic state preparation circuits beyond distance 3. Numerical evaluations using $d=3$ and $d=5$ codes confirm that the generated circuits exhibit the desired scaling of the logical error rates. The resulting methods are publicly available as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc. Such methods are an important step in providing fault-tolerant circuit constructions that can aid in near-term demonstration of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>SAM-SP: Self-Prompting Makes SAM Great Again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced Segment Anything Model (SAM), a Visual Foundation Model (VFM), has demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot segmentation tasks across diverse natural image datasets. Despite its success, SAM encounters noticeably performance degradation when applied to specific domains, such as medical images. Current efforts to address this issue have involved fine-tuning strategies, intended to bolster the generalizability of the vanilla SAM. However, these approaches still predominantly necessitate the utilization of domain specific expert-level prompts during the evaluation phase, which severely constrains the model's practicality.
  To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel self-prompting based fine-tuning approach, called SAM-SP, tailored for extending the vanilla SAM model. Specifically, SAM-SP leverages the output from the previous iteration of the model itself as prompts to guide subsequent iteration of the model. This self-prompting module endeavors to learn how to generate useful prompts autonomously and alleviates the dependence on expert prompts during the evaluation phase, significantly broadening SAM's applicability. Additionally, we integrate a self-distillation module to enhance the self-prompting process further. Extensive experiments across various domain specific datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed SAM-SP. Our SAM-SP not only alleviates the reliance on expert prompts but also exhibits superior segmentation performance comparing to the state-of-the-art task-specific segmentation approaches, the vanilla SAM, and SAM-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Phase-Based Approaches for Rapid Construction of Magnetic Fields in NV Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the second quantum revolution underway, quantum-enhanced sensors are moving from laboratory demonstrations to field deployments, providing enhanced and even new capabilities. Signal processing and operational software is becoming integral parts of these emerging sensing systems to reap the benefits of this progress. This paper looks into widefield Nitrogen Vacancy Center-based magnetometry and focuses on estimating the magnetic field from the Optically Detected Magnetic Resonances (ODMR) signal, a crucial output for various applications. Mapping the shifts of ODMR signals to phase estimation, a computationally efficient approaches are proposed. Involving Fourier Transform and Filtering as pre-processing steps, the suggested approaches involve linear curve fit or complex frequency estimation based on well-known super-resolution technique Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT). The existing methods in the quantum sensing literature take different routes based on Lorentzian fitting for determining magnetic field maps. To showcase the functionality and effectiveness of the suggested techniques, relevant results, based on experimental data are provided, which shows a significant reduction in computational time with the proposed method over existing methods</description>
