      <title>Selecting the Best Arm in One-Shot Multi-Arm RCTs: The Asymptotic Minimax-Regret Decision Framework for the Best-Population Selection Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a frequentist decision-theoretic framework for selecting the best arm in one-shot, multi-arm randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our approach characterizes the minimax-regret (MMR) optimal decision rule for any location-family reward distribution with full support. We show that the MMR rule is deterministic, unique, and computationally tractable, as it can be derived by solving the dual problem with nature's least-favorable prior. We then specialize to the case of multivariate normal (MVN) rewards with an arbitrary covariance matrix, and establish the local asymptotic minimaxity of a plug-in version of the rule when only estimated means and covariances are available. This asymptotic MMR (AMMR) procedure maps a covariance-matrix estimate directly into decision boundaries, allowing straightforward implementation in practice. Our analysis highlights a sharp contrast between two-arm and multi-arm designs. With two arms, the empirical success rule ("pick-the-winner") remains MMR-optimal, regardless of the arm-specific variances. By contrast, with three or more arms and heterogeneous variances, the empirical success rule is no longer optimal: the MMR decision boundaries become nonlinear and systematically penalize high-variance arms, requiring stronger evidence to select them. This result underscores that variance plays no role in optimal two-arm comparisons, but it matters critically when more than two options are on the table. Our multi-arm AMMR framework extends classical decision theory to multi-arm RCTs, offering a rigorous foundation and a practical tool for comparing multiple policies simultaneously.</description>

      <title>The exact distribution of the conditional likelihood-ratio test in instrumental variables regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the exact asymptotic distribution of the conditional likelihood-ratio test in instrumental variables regression under weak instrument asymptotics and for multiple endogenous variables. The distribution is conditional on all eigenvalues of the concentration matrix, rather than only the smallest eigenvalue as in an existing asymptotic upper bound. This exact characterization leads to a substantially more powerful test if there are differently identified endogenous variables. We provide computational methods implementing the test and demonstrate the power gains through numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Design-Based and Network Sampling-Based Uncertainties in Network Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators are widely used in network experiments to estimate spillover effects. We study the causal interpretation of, and inference for the OLS estimator under both design-based uncertainty from random treatment assignment and sampling-based uncertainty in network links. We show that correlations among regressors that capture the exposure to neighbors' treatments can induce contamination bias, preventing OLS from aggregating heterogeneous spillover effects for a clear causal interpretation. We derive the OLS estimator's asymptotic distribution and propose a network-robust variance estimator. Simulations and an empirical application demonstrate that contamination bias can be substantial, leading to inflated spillover estimates.</description>

      <title>Treatment-Effect Estimation in Complex Designs under a Parallel-trends Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the identification of dynamic treatment effects with panel data, in complex designs where the treatment may not be binary and may not be absorbing. We first show that under no-anticipation and parallel-trends assumptions, we can identify event-study effects comparing outcomes under the actual treatment path and under the status-quo path where all units would have kept their period-one treatment throughout the panel. Those effects can be helpful to evaluate ex-post the policies that effectively took place, and once properly normalized they estimate weighted averages of marginal effects of the current and lagged treatments on the outcome. Yet, they may still be hard to interpret, and they cannot be used to evaluate the effects of other policies than the ones that were conducted. To make progress, we impose another restriction, namely a random coefficients distributed-lag linear model, where effects remain constant over time. Under this model, the usual distributed-lag two-way-fixed-effects regression may be misleading. Instead, we show that this random coefficients model can be estimated simply. We illustrate our findings by revisiting Gentzkow, Shapiro and Sinkinson (2011).</description>

      <title>Consumer Welfare Under Individual Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01231v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a nonparametric method for estimating the distribution of consumer welfare from cross-sectional data with no restrictions on individual preferences. First demonstrating that moments of demand identify the curvature of the expenditure function, we use these moments to approximate money-metric welfare measures. Our approach captures both nonhomotheticity and heterogeneity in preferences in the behavioral responses to price changes. We apply our method to US household scanner data to evaluate the impacts of the price shock between December 2020 and 2021 on the cost-of-living index. We document substantial heterogeneity in welfare losses within and across demographic groups. For most groups, a naive measure of consumer welfare would significantly underestimate the welfare loss. By decomposing the behavioral responses into the components arising from nonhomotheticity and heterogeneity in preferences, we find that both factors are essential for accurate welfare measurement, with heterogeneity contributing more substantially.</description>

      <title>A Non-Parametric Approach to Heterogeneity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13721v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-parametric methodology to quantify preference heterogeneity in consumer choices. By repeatedly sampling individual observations and partitioning agents into groups consistent with the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preferences (GARP), we construct a similarity matrix capturing latent preference structures. Under mild assumptions, this matrix consistently and asymptotically normally estimates the probability that any pair of agents share a common utility function. Leveraging this, we develop hypothesis tests to assess whether demographic characteristics systematically explain unobserved heterogeneity. Simulations confirm the test's validity, and we apply the method to a standard grocery expenditure dataset.</description>
