      <title>Gauge invariant discretization of Chern-Simons couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discretize Chern-Simons couplings in gauge invariant way. We obtain (p+q)-forms representing Chern-Simons couplings on (p + q)-simplexes from wedge products of p- and q-forms on p- and q-simplexes, respectively, where p- and q-simplexes form (p+q)-simplexes by having a common vertex. We show that the Chern-Simons couplings on simplicial complexes reduce to Chern-Simons couplings on the manifolds in a continuum limit. Moreover, we prove that a typical discretized Chern-Simons term that has the Chern-Simons coupling is gauge invariant.</description>

      <title>Toward the application of large-$N$ deconfinement to SU(3) QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally known for $\mathrm{U}(N)$ gauge theory at finite temperature that phase transitions are manifested by taking the large-$N$ limit. Since the large-$N$ theory undergoes two thermodynamic phase transitions, a nontrivial intermediate phase can be realized in addition to the phases classified as the conventional confined and deconfined phases. In this talk, we discuss that a similar picture can be applied to QCD with $N=3$. In particular, we analyze the gauge configurations of lattice QCD calculations involving dynamical quarks and show the results of an analysis of the deviation due to finite-temperature effects from the Haar randomness expected at zero temperature in $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theory, using physical pictures suggested by the large-$N$ theory.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on thermal transition in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the picture of partial deconfinement developed in recent years for large-$N$ gauge theories, we propose a new way of analyzing and understanding thermal phase transition in QCD. We find nontrivial support for our proposal by analyzing the WHOT-QCD collaboration's lattice configurations for SU(3) QCD in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions with up, down, and strange quarks.
  We find that the Polyakov line (the holonomy matrix around a thermal time circle) is governed by the Haar-random distribution at low temperatures. The deviation from the Haar-random distribution at higher temperatures can be measured via the character expansion, or equivalently, via the expectation values of the Polyakov loop defined by the various nontrivial representations of SU(3).
  We find that the Polyakov loop corresponding to the fundamental representation and loops in the higher representation condense at different temperatures. This suggests that there are (at least) three phases, one intermediate phase existing in between the completely-confined and the completely-deconfined phases. Our identification of the intermediate phase is supported also by the condensation of instantons: by studying the instanton numbers of the WHOT-QCD configurations, we find that the instanton condensation occurs for temperature regimes corresponding to what we identify as the completely-confined and intermediate phases, whereas the instantons do not condense in the completely-deconfined phase.
  Our characterization of confinement based on the Haar-randomness explains why the Polyakov loop is a good observable to distinguish the confinement and the deconfinement phases in QCD despite the absence of the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ center symmetry.</description>

      <title>Improving the five-point bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the numerical evaluation of five-point conformal blocks in $d$-dimensions, greatly improving the efficiency of their computation. To do this we use an appropriate ansatz for the blocks as a series expansion in radial coordinates, derive a set of recursion relations for the unknown coefficients in the ansatz, and evaluate the series using a Pad\'e approximant to accelerate its convergence. We then study the $\langle\sigma\sigma\epsilon\sigma\sigma\rangle$ correlator in the 3d critical Ising model by truncating the operator product expansion (OPE) and only including operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta\leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We approximate the contributions of the operators above the cutoff by the corresponding contributions in a suitable disconnected five-point correlator. Using this approach, we compute a number of OPE coefficients with greater accuracy than previous methods.</description>

      <title>Extracting transition generalized parton distributions from hard exclusive pion-nucleon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the extraction of transition generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from production of two back-to-back high transverse momentum photons ($\gamma\gamma$) and a massive pair of leptons ($\ell^+\ell^-$) in hard exclusive pion-nucleon scattering. We argue that the exclusive scattering amplitude of both processes could be factorized into nonperturbative pion distribution amplitude and nucleon transition GPDs that are convoluted with perturbatively calculable short-distance matching coefficients. We demonstrate that the exclusive diphoton production not only is complementary to the Drell-Yan-type dilepton production for extracting the GPDs, but also provides enhanced sensitivities for extracting the parton momentum fraction $x$ dependence of the GPDs. We show that both exclusive observables are physically measurable at the J-PARC and AMBER experiment energies. If the target nucleon can be polarized, corresponding spin asymmetries can offer additional sensitivities for extracting transition GPDs.</description>

      <title>Light quarkonium hybrid mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the light quarkonium hybrid mesons of various spin-parities in QCD. Considering different interpolating currents made of the valence light quarks and single gluon, we calculate the mass and current coupling of the strange and nonstrange members of light hybrid mesons by including into computations the nonperturbative quark and gluon condensates up to ten dimensions in order to increase the accuracy of the results. The obtained results may be useful for future experimental searches of these hypothetical states. They can also be used in the calculations of different parameters related to the decays/interactions of light hybrid mesons to/with other states.</description>

      <title>Boosting Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo with Submatrix Updates: Unveiling the Phase Diagram of the 3D Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of strongly correlated fermionic systems, crucial for understanding condensed matter physics, has been significantly advanced by numerical computational methods. Among these, the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method stands out for its ability to provide exact numerical solutions. However, the computational complexity of DQMC, particularly in dealing with large system sizes and the notorious sign problem, limits its applicability. We introduce an innovative approach to enhance DQMC efficiency through the implementation of submatrix updates. Building upon the foundational work of conventional fast updates and delay updates, our method leverages a generalized submatrix update algorithm to address challenges in simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems with both onsite and extended interactions at both finite and zero temperatures. We demonstrate the method's superiority by comparing it with previous update methods in terms of computational complexity and efficiency. Specifically, our submatrix update method significantly reduces the computational overhead, enabling the simulation of system sizes up to 8,000 sites without pushing hard. This advancement allows for a more accurate determination of the finite temperature phase diagram of the 3D Hubbard model at half-filling. Our findings not only shed light on the phase transitions within these complex systems but also pave the way for more effective simulations of strongly correlated electrons, potentially guiding experimental efforts in cold atom simulations of the 3D Hubbard model.</description>
