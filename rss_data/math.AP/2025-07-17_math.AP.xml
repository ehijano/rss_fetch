      <title>Uniform dispersive estimates for the semi-classical Hartree equation with long-range interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Hartree equation with smooth but long-range interaction in the semi-classical regime, in three-dimensional space. We show that the density function of small-data solution decays at the optimal rate. When the semi-classical parameter $\hbar \in (0,1]$ is fixed, our result is essentially covered by the recent work by Nguyen and You [arXiv:2408.15860]; however, the novelty of this paper is the uniformity with respect to $\hbar$. Namely, both smallness condition for initial data and bounds for the solution are independent of $\hbar$. Moreover, the argument in this paper provides a new proof of the modified scattering for the long-range nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a Hartree type nonlinearity. Our proof relies on three main ingredients. First, we prove the boundedness of finite-time wave operators modified by phase corrections. Second, we show an $L^1$--$L^\infty$ dispersive estimate for the modified propagator. Third, we give various kinds of commutator estimates for density operators. By combining them, we can apply the usual bootstrap argument to obtain the main result.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stabilization of a coupled system comprising a parabolic PDE and an elliptic PDE with nonlinear terms. A rigorous backstepping design provides an explicit boundary control law and exponentially convergent observers from partial boundary measurements. Several theorems ensure exponential stability and well-posedness of the nonlinear closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>Semi-classical limit of quantum scattering states for the nonlinear Hartree equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article concerns the long-time dynamics of quantum particles in the semi-classical regime. First, we show that for the nonlinear Hartree equation with short-range interaction potential, small-data solutions obey dispersion bounds and they scatter, where the smallness conditions and the bounds are independent of the small parameter $\hbar\in(0,1]$ representing the reduced Planck constant. Then, taking the semi-classical limit $\hbar\to0$, we prove that the Wigner transforms of such quantum scattering states converge weakly-* to the corresponding classical scattering states for the Vlasov equation. As a direct consequence, we establish small-data scattering for the Vlasov equation without assuming regularity on initial data. Our analysis is based on a new uniform dispersion estimate for the free Schr\"odinger flow, which is simple but crucial to include singular interaction potentials such as inverse power-law potential $\frac{1}{|x|^a}$ with $1&lt;a&lt;\frac{5}{3}$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically sharp stability of Sobolev inequalities on the Heisenberg group with dimension-dependent constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the optimal asymptotic lower bound for the stability of Sobolev inequality on the Heisenberg group. We first establish the optimal local stability of Sobolev inequality on the CR sphere through bispherical harmonics and complicated orthogonality technique ( see Lemma 3.1). The loss of rearrangement inequality in the CR setting makes it impossible to use any rearrangement flow technique (either differential rearrangement flow or integral rearrangement flow) to derive the optimal stability of Sobolev inequality on the CR sphere from corresponding optimal local stability. To circumvent this, we will use the CR Yamabe flow to establish the optimal stability of Sobolev inequality on the Heisenberg group with the dimension-dependent constants (see Theorem 1.1). As an application, we also establish the optimal stability of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev (HLS) inequality for special conformal index with the dimension-dependent constants (see Theorem 1.3). Our approach is rearrangement-free and can be used to study the optimal stability problem for fractional Sobolev inequality or HLS inequality on the Heisenberg group once the corresponding continuous flow is established.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a parabolic-hyperbolic hybrid population model: an integrated semigroup approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the global dynamics of a hybrid parabolic-hyperbolic model describing populations with distinct dispersal and sedentary stages. We first establish the global well-posedness of solutions, prove a comparison principle, and demonstrate the asymptotic smoothness of the solution semiflow. Through the spectral analysis of the linearized system, we derive and characterize the net reproductive rate $\mathcal{R}_{0}$. Furthermore, an explicit relationship between $\mathcal{R}_{0}$ and the principal eigenvalue of the linearized system is analyzed. Under appropriate monotonicity assumptions, we show that $\mathcal{R}_{0}$ serves as a threshold parameter that completely determines the stability of steady states of the system. More precisely, when $\mathcal{R}_{0}&lt;1$, the trivial equilibrium is globally asymptotical stable, while when $\mathcal{R}_{0}&gt;1$, the system is uniformly persistent and there is a positive equilibrium which is unique and globally asymptotical stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a result on the existence of ground state solutions for the polyharmonic nonlinear equation $(-\Delta)^m u=g(u)$, assuming that $g$ has a general subcritical growth at infinity, inspired by Berestycki and Lions \cite{BerestyckiLions}. In comparison with the biharmonic case studied in \cite{Med-Siem}, the presence of a higher-order operator gives rise to several analytical challenges, which are overcome in the present work. Furthermore, we establish a new polyharmonic logarithmic Sobolev inequality.</description>

      <title>Symmetrization on the sphere and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new method of symmetrization of mappings on the $n$-sphere ($n\geq 2$). They are applied to estimate solutions of quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations of $p$-Laplacian type, with combinations of Dirac measures on the right-hand side. The case $p=n$ is reduced to a problem on the sphere, using a conformal transformation. The cases when $1 &lt; p &lt; n $ and $p &gt; $n are considered more briefly, full details being available in other papers of the author.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of a weighted ultrafast diffusion PDE on the real line, with a log-concave and log-lipschitz weight, and prove exponential convergence to equilibrium. This result goes beyond the compact setting studied in [22]. This equation is motivated by the gradient flow approach to the problem of quantization of measures introduced in [11].</description>

      <title>Nonlinear smoothing implies improved lower bounds on the radius of spatial analyticity for nonlinear dispersive equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a roadmap to establish improved lower bounds on the decay rate of the uniform radius of analyticity $\sigma(T)$ for a given nonlinear dispersive equation, reducing the problem to the derivation of nonlinear smoothing estimates with a specific distribution of extra derivatives. We apply this strategy for both the defocusing generalized KdV and the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with odd pure-power nonlinearity. For both equations, we reach the lower bound $\sigma(T)\gtrsim T^{-\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon}$, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, thus improving all available results in the current literature.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Unidimensional Structures Based on Generalised Continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work introduces a family of beam models derived from a three-dimensional higher-order elasticity framework. By incorporating three kinematic fields - the macroscopic displacement u, the micro-distortion tensor P, and the third-order tensor N - the study systematically explores three regimes: holonomic, semi-holonomic, and non-holonomic. These regimes correspond to varying levels of kinematic constraints, ranging from classical elasticity to a fully relaxed model. The holonomic case reduces to a higher-order Euler--Bernoulli beam model, while the semi-holonomic case generalises the Timoshenko beam model. The non-holonomic case provides a unified framework that naturally incorporates both dislocations and disclinations. Furthermore, the holonomic and semi-holonomic models are shown to emerge as singular limits of the non-holonomic model by increasing specific penalty coefficients. Simplified ordinary differential equation systems are derived for specific cases, such as pure traction and bending, illustrating the practical applicability of the models. The results highlight the hierarchical structure of the proposed framework and its ability to capture material defects in beam-like structures.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions of coupled Sobolev critical Schrodinger equations with mass subcritical couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with qualitative properties of positive solutions to the following coupled Sobolev critical Schr\"odinger equations $$ \begin{cases} -\Delta u+\lambda_1 u=\mu_1|u|^{2^*-2}u+\nu\alpha |u|^{\alpha-2}|v|^{\beta}u ~\hbox{in}~ \R^N,\\ -\Delta v+\lambda_2 v=\mu_2|v|^{2^*-2}v+\nu\beta |u|^{\alpha}|v|^{\beta-2}v ~\hbox{in}~ \R^N \end{cases} $$ subject to the mass constraints $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^2 \ud x=a^2$ and $\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|v|^2 \ud x=b^2$, where, $a&gt;0,\,b&gt;0,\,N=3,4$ and $2^*:=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ is the Sobolev critical exponent. The main purpose of this paper is focused on the mass mixed case, i. e., $ \alpha&gt;1,\beta&gt;1,\alpha+\beta&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}$. For some suitable small $\nu&gt;0$, we show that the above system admits two positive solutions, one of which is a local minimizer, and another one is a mountain pass solution. Moreover, as $\nu\to0^+$, asymptotic behaviors of solutions are also considered. Our result gives an affirmative answer to a Soave's type open problem raised by Bartsch {\it et al.} (Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations 62(1), Paper No. 9, 34, 2023).</description>

Abstract: The present paper establishes delicate properties of the Green function with Robin boundary conditions, in particular, elucidating the nature of the passage between the Dirichlet-like and Neumann-like behavior. This yields sharp quantifiable bounds on the corresponding harmonic measure and proves the phase transition in the behavior of the total flow earlier conjectured in physics literature in concert with the efficacy of mammalian lungs.</description>

      <title>Multiple normalized solutions for two coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations with attractive interactions and mass constriants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the following system of two coupled time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii equations $$ \begin{cases} -\Delta u+\lambda_1 u=\mu_1|u|^{p-2}u+\nu\alpha |u|^{\alpha-2}|v|^{\beta}u ~\hbox{in}~ \R^N,\\ -\Delta v+\lambda_2 v=\mu_2|v|^{q-2}v+\nu\beta |u|^{\alpha}|v|^{\beta-2}v ~\hbox{in}~ \R^N, \end{cases} $$ which arises in two-components Bose-Einstein condensates and involve attractive Sobolev subcritical or critical interactions, i. e., $\nu&gt;0$ and $\alpha+\beta\leq 2^*$. This system is employed by seeking critical points of the associated variational functional with the constrained mass below $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^2 {\rm d}x=a, \quad \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|v|^2 {\rm d}x=b.$$ In the mass mixed case, i. e., $2&lt;p&lt;2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;q&lt;2^*$, for some suitable $a,b,\nu$ and $\beta$, the system above admits two positive solutions. In particular, in the case $\alpha+\beta&lt;2^*$, using variational methods on the $L^2$-ball, two positive solutions are obtained, one of which is a local minimizer and the second one is a mountain pass solution.</description>

      <title>Pointwise convergence to initial data of heat and Poisson equations in Modulation Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize weighted modulation spaces (data space) for which the heat semigroup $e^{-tL}f$ converges pointwise to the initial data $f$ as time $t$ tends to zero. Here $L$ stands for the standard Laplacian $-\Delta $ or Hermite operator $H=-\Delta +|x|^2$ on the whole domain. Similar result also holds for Poisson semigroup $e^{-t\sqrt{L}}f.$ We also prove that the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator operates on certain modulation spaces. This may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Rigidity for the heat equation with density on Riemannian manifolds through a conformal change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate uniqueness of solution to the heat equation with a density $\rho$ on complete, non-compact weighted Riemannian manifolds of infinite volume. Our main goal is to identify sufficient conditions under which the solution $u$ vanishes identically, assuming that $u$ belongs to a certain weighted Lebesgue space with exponential or polynomial weight, $L^p_{\phi}$. We distinguish between the cases $p &gt; 1$ and $p = 1$ which required stronger assumptions on the manifold and the density function $\rho$. We develop a unified method based on a conformal transformation of the metric, which allows us to reduce the problem to a standard heat equation on a suitably weighted manifold. In addition, we construct explicit counterexamples on model manifolds which demonstrate optimality of our assumptions on the density $\rho$.</description>

      <title>The Snapshot Problem for the Euler-Poisson-Darboux Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Euler-Poisson-Darboux (EPD) equation with complex parameter $\alpha$ is given by $$ \Delta_x u=\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}+\frac{n-1+2\alpha}{t}\,\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}, $$ where $u(x,t)\in \mathscr E(\mathbb R^n\times \mathbb R)$, with $u$ even in $t$. For $\alpha=0$ and $\alpha=1$ the solution $u(x,t)$ represents a mean value over spheres and balls, respectively, of radius $|t|$ in $\mathbb R^n$. In this paper we consider existence and uniqueness results for the following two-snapshot problem: for fixed positive real numbers $r$ and $s$ and smooth functions $f$ and $g$ on $\mathbb R^n$, what are the conditions under which there is a solution $u(x,t)$ to the generalized EPD equation such that $u(x,r)=f(x)$ and $u(x,s)=g(x)$? The answer leads to a discovery of Liouville-like numbers related to Bessel functions, and we also study the properties of such numbers.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of nonlocal exchange energies in micromagnetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homogenization of nonlocal micromagnetic functionals incorporating both symmetric and antisymmetric exchange contributions under the physical constraint that the magnetization field takes values in the unit sphere. Assuming that the nonlocal interaction range and the scale of heterogeneities vanish simultaneously, we capture the asymptotic behavior of the nonlocal energies by identifying their $\Gamma$-limit, leading to an effective local functional expressed through a tangentially constrained nonlocal cell problem. Our proof builds upon a tailored notion of two-scale convergence, which takes into account oscillations only in specific directions. It enables us to describe the two-scale limit of suitable nonlocal difference quotients, yielding a nonlocal analog of the classical limit decomposition result for gradient fields. To deal with the manifold constraint of the magnetization, we additionally prove that the microscopic oscillations in the two-scale limit are constrained to lie in the tangent space of the sphere.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of blood vessel models, Part I: 3D-1D to 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a family of models describing blood perfusion through a tissue surrounding a thin blood vessel. Our goal is to rigorously establish convergence results among 3D-3D Darcy--Stokes, 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille, and 1D Green's function methods commonly used to model this process. In Part I, we propose a 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille system where the coupling across the permeable vessel surface involves an angle-averaged Neumann boundary condition coupled with a geometrically constrained Robin boundary condition. We show that this model is well-posed and moreover limits to a 1D Green's function model as the maximum vessel radius $\epsilon\to 0$. In the 1D model, the exterior blood pressure is given by an explicit Green's function expression involving the interior blood pressure. The interior pressure satisfies a novel 1D integrodifferential equation in which the integral term incorporates the effects of the exterior pressure and the vessel geometry. Much of this paper is devoted to analyzing this integrodifferential equation. Using the \emph{a priori} bounds obtained here, we show that the solution to the 1D model converges to the 3D-1D solution with a rate proportional to $\epsilon^{1/2}|\log\epsilon|$. In Part II [Ohm \&amp; Strikwerda, arXiv preprint July 2025], we rely on the 1D estimates to show that both the 1D and 3D-1D models converge to a coupled 3D-3D Darcy-Stokes system as $\epsilon\to 0$, thereby establishing a convergence chain among all hierarchy levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a hierarchy of three models of blood perfusion through a tissue surrounding a thin arteriole or venule. Our goal is to rigorously link 3D-3D Darcy--Stokes, 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille, and 1D Green's function methods commonly used to model this process. Here in Part II, we consider the most detailed level, a 3D-3D Darcy-Stokes system coupled across the permeable vessel surface by mass conservation and pressure/stress balance conditions. We derive a convergence result between the 3D-3D model and both the 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille model and 1D Green's function model proposed in Part I [Ohm \&amp; Strikwerda, arXiv preprint July 2025] at a rate proportional to $\epsilon^{1/6}|\log\epsilon|$, where $\epsilon$ is the maximum vessel radius. The rate is limited by the inclusion of a degenerate endpoint where the vessel radius vanishes, i.e. becomes indistinguishable from a capillary. Key to our proof are \emph{a priori} estimates for the 1D integrodifferential model obtained in Part I.</description>

      <title>Shape optimization of metastable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The definition of metastable states is an ubiquitous task in the design and analysis of molecular simulation, and is a crucial input in a variety of acceleration methods for the sampling of long configurational trajectories.
  Although standard definitions based on local energy minimization procedures can sometimes be used, these definitions are typically suboptimal, or entirely inadequate when entropic effects are significant, or when the lowest energy barriers are quickly overcome by thermal fluctuations.
  In this work, we propose an approach to the definition of metastable states, based on the shape-optimization of a local separation of timescale metric directly linked to the efficiency of a class of accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.
  To realize this approach, we derive analytic expressions for shape-variations of Dirichlet eigenvalues for a class of operators associated with reversible elliptic diffusions, and use them to construct a local ascent algorithm, explicitly treating the case of multiple eigenvalues.
  We propose two methods to make our method tractable in high-dimensional systems: one based on dynamical coarse-graining, the other on recently obtained low-temperature shape-sensitive spectral asymptotics.
  We validate our method on a benchmark biomolecular system, showcasing a significant improvement over conventional definitions of metastable states.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Self-Similar Energy Transfer Dynamics: a Case Study for 1D Burgers System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the problem of constructing flow evolutions leading to a self-similar energy cascade consistent with Kolmogorov's statistical theory of turbulence. As a first step in this direction, we focus on the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation as a toy model. Its solutions exhibiting self-similar behavior, in a precisely-defined sense, are found by framing this problems in terms of PDE-constrained optimization. The main physical parameters are the time window over which self-similar behavior is sought (equal to approximately one eddy turnover time), viscosity (inversely proportional to the ``Reynolds number") and an integer parameter characterizing the distance in the Fourier space over which self-similar interactions occur. Local solutions to this nonconvex PDE optimization problems are obtained with a state-of-the-art adjoint-based gradient method. Two distinct families of solutions, termed viscous and inertial, are identified and are distinguished primarily by the behavior of enstrophy which, respectively, uniformly decays and grows in the two cases. The physically meaningful and appropriately self-similar inertial solutions are found only when a sufficiently small viscosity is considered. These flows achieve the self-similar behaviour by a uniform steepening of the wave fronts present in the solutions. The methodology proposed and the results obtained represent an encouraging proof of concept for this approach to be employed to systematically search for self-similar flow evolutions in the context of three-dimensional turbulence.</description>

      <title>Integral gradient estimates on a closed surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(\Sigma, g)$ be a closed Riemann surface, and let $u$ be a weak solution to equation \[ - \Delta_g u = \mu, \] where $\mu$ is a signed Radon measure. We aim to establish $L^p$ estimates for the gradient of $u$ that are independent of the choice of the metric $g$. This is particularly relevant when the complex structure approaches the boundary of the moduli space. To this end, we consider the metric $g' = e^{2u} g$ as a metric of bounded integral curvature. This metric satisfies a so-called quadratic area bound condition, which allows us to derive gradient estimates for $g'$ in local conformal coordinates. From these estimates, we obtain the desired estimates for the gradient of $u$.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Stationary Integral Varifolds near Multiplicity 2 Planes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stationary integral $n$-varifolds $V$ in the unit ball $B_1(0)\subset\mathbb{R}^{n+k}$. Allard's regularity theorem establishes the existence of $\epsilon = \epsilon(n,k)\in (0,1)$ for which if $V$ is $\epsilon$-close (as varifolds) to the plane $P_0 = \{0\}^k\times\mathbb{R}^n$ with multiplicity 1 then, in $B_{1/2}(0)$, $V$ is represented by a single $C^{1,\alpha}$ minimal graph. However, when instead $P_0$ occurs with multiplicity $Q\in \{2,3,\dotsc\}$, simple examples show that this conclusion, now as a multi-valued graph, may fail, even if $V$ corresponds to an area-minimising rectifiable current.
  In the present work we investigate the structure of such $V$ which are close to planes with multiplicity $Q&gt;1$, focusing primarily on the case $Q=2$. We show that an $\epsilon$-regularity theorem holds when $V$ is close, as a varifold, to $P_0$ with multiplicity $2$, provided $V$ satisfies a certain topological structural condition on the part of its support where the density of $V$ is $&lt;2$. The conclusion then is that, in $B_{1/2}(0)$, $V$ is represented by the graph of a Lipschitz $2$-valued function over $P_0$ with small Lipschitz constant; in fact, the function is $C^{1,\alpha}$ in a precise generalised sense, and satisfies estimates, implying that all tangent cones at singular points in $B_{1/2}(0)$ are unique and comprised of stationary unions of $4$ half-planes (which may form a union of two distinct planes or a single multiplicity $2$ plane). The theorem does not require any additional assumption on the part of $V$ with density $\geq 2$ (which a priori may be a relatively large set in $\mathcal{H}^n$-measure with high topological complexity).
  As a corollary, we show that our $\epsilon$-regularity theorem applies unconditionally to stationary $2$-valued Lipschitz graphs with arbitrary Lipschitz constant, yielding improved regularity and uniform a priori estimates.</description>

Abstract: We study the regularity of quasi-minimal sets (in the sense of David and Semmes) with a boundary condition, which can be interpreted as quasi-minimizers of Plateau's problem in co-dimension one. For these Plateau-quasi-minimizers, we establish the optimal regularity, which is a characterization by bi-John domains with Ahlfors regular boundaries. This requires to investigate the Ahlfors regularity and also the uniform rectifiability of those sets, up to the boundary.</description>

Abstract: An inverse obstacle problem governed by the Stokes system in the time domain is considered. Two types of extraction formulae about the geometry of an unknown obstacle are given by using the most recent version of the time domain enclosure method in a unified style. Each of the formulae employs only a single set of velocity and the Cauchy stress fields over a finite time interval on the surface of the region where a viscous incompressible fluid occupies.</description>

      <title>Rigidly breaking potential flows and a countable Alexandrov theorem for polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05606v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study all the ways that a given convex body in $d$ dimensions can break into countably many pieces that move away from each other rigidly at constant velocity, with no rotation or shearing. The initial velocity field is locally constant, but may be continuous and/or fail to be integrable. For any choice of mass-velocity pairs for the pieces, such a motion can be generated by the gradient of a convex potential that is affine on each piece. We classify such potentials in terms of a countable version of a theorem of Alexandrov for convex polytopes, and prove a stability theorem. For bounded velocities, there is a bijection between the mass-velocity data and optimal transport flows (Wasserstein geodesics) that are locally incompressible.
  Given any rigidly breaking velocity field that is the gradient of a continuous potential, the convexity of the potential is established under any of several conditions, such as the velocity field being continuous, the potential being semi-convex, the mass measure generated by a convexified transport potential being absolutely continuous, or there being a finite number of pieces. Also we describe a number of curious and paradoxical examples having fractal structure.</description>

Abstract: In the context of neuroscience the elapsed-time model is an age-structured equation that describes the behavior of interconnected spiking neurons through the time since the last discharge, with many interesting dynamics depending on the type of interactions between neurons. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of this equation in the case of both discrete and distributed delays that account for the time needed to transmit a nerve impulse from one neuron to the rest the ensemble. To prove the convergence to the equilibrium, we follow an approach based on comparison principles for Volterra equations involving the total activity, which provides a simpler and more straightforward alternative technique than those in the existing literature on the elapsed-time model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider scalar conservation laws with smoothly varying spatially heterogeneous flux that is convex in the conserved variable. We show that under certain assumptions, a shock wave connecting two constant states emerges in finite time for all $L^{\infty}$ initial data satisfying the same far-field conditions. Under an additional assumption on the mixed partial derivative of the flux, we establish the stability of these simple shock profiles with respect to $L^2$ perturbations. The main tools we use are Dafermos' generalised characteristics for the evolution analysis and the relative entropy method for stability.</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity theory of the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation in a Lipschitz domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16095v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation \begin{equation}
  -\Delta u=f(X)\cdot u^{-\gamma} \end{equation} in a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega$, with the Dirichlet boundary condition and a positive, bounded function $f(X)$. A distinguishing feature is that the vanishing boundary condition introduces a singularity in the equation.
  We focus on the well-posedness of the equation and the growth rate of solutions near the boundary. The key is to classify the limiting cone of a boundary point into three categories based on its "frequency", and obtain distinct growth rate estimates for each case.
  Additionally, we discuss the boundary Harnack principle for the singular Lane-Emden-Fowler equation, which is essential in deriving the boundary growth rate estimate. To our knowledge, the boundary Harnack principle we derive is the first Kemper-type estimate for singular semi-linear equations. It notably differs from the classical one for linear equations, in particular, the boundedness of the ratio \(u/v\) does not imply its continuity.
  To address the lack of a suitable upper barrier, we introduce new techniques, including constructing upper barriers iteratively. We also construct a subharmonic auxiliary function $V(X)$ related to the solution $u$ in the limiting cone. The growth rate of $u(X)$ is then obtained inductively from the growth rate of the auxiliary function $V(X)$. Our results and methods offer novel insights into the behavior of singular elliptic equations in non-smooth domains.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Kiselev and Sarsam proposed the following nonlocal transport equation as a one-dimensional analogue of the 2D incompressible porous media (IPM) equation \begin{eqnarray*} \partial_t\rho+u\partial_x\rho= 0,~u=gH_a\rho, \end{eqnarray*} where the transform $H_a$ is defined by \begin{eqnarray*} H_af(x)=\frac{1}{\pi}P.V.\int\limits_{\R}\frac{a^2f(y)}{(x-y)((x-y)^2+a^2)}dy. \end{eqnarray*} In the work [Kiselev-Sarsam, Nonlinearity 2025 38 055018], the authors proved the local well-posedness for this 1D periodic IPM model as well as finite time blow-up for a class of smooth initial data. In this paper, we present several new weighted inequalities for the transform $H_a$ in the setting of the real line. Based on these integral inequalities, we also prove the finite time blow-up for this 1D IPM model on the real line.</description>

      <title>Structural stability of three dimensional steady Prandtl equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-posedness of the three dimensional Prandtl equation is an outstanding open problem due to the appearance of the secondary flow even though there are studies on analytic and Gevrey function spaces. This problem is raised as the third open problem in the classical book by Oleinik and Samokhin [43]. This paper aims to address this open problem in the steady case by introducing a new approach to study the structural stability of background profile that includes the famous Blasius solutions. The key observations include the introduction of some intrinsic vector fields and new versions of maximum principle. In particular, we overcome the difficulties caused by symmetry breaking through the analysis on the curvature-type quantities generated by commutators of the vector fields.</description>

      <title>Low regularity well-posedness of nonlocal dispersive perturbations of Burgers' equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem associated to a class of dispersive perturbations of Burgers' equations, which contains the low dispersion Benjamin-Ono equation, (also known as low dispersion fractional KdV equation), $$ \partial_tu-D_x^{\alpha}\partial_xu=\partial_x(u^2) \, ,$$ and prove that it is locally well-posed in $H^s(\mathbb K)$, $\mathbb K=\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb T$, for $s&gt;s_{\alpha}$, where \begin{equation*} s_\alpha=\begin{cases}
  1-\frac{3\alpha}4 &amp; \text{for} \quad \frac23 \le \alpha \le 1;
  \frac 32(1-\alpha) &amp; \text{for} \quad \frac13 \le \alpha \le \frac23;
  \frac 32-\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} &amp; \text{for} \quad 0 &lt; \alpha \le \frac13 .
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} The uniqueness is unconditional in $H^s(\mathbb K)$ for $s&gt;\max\{\frac12,s_{\alpha}\}$. Moreover, we obtain \emph{a priori} estimates for the solutions at the lower regularity threshold $s&gt;\widetilde{s}_\alpha$ where \begin{equation*} \widetilde{s}_\alpha=\begin{cases}
  \frac 12-\frac \alpha 4 &amp; \text{for} \quad \frac23 \le \alpha \le 1;
  1-\alpha &amp; \text{for} \quad \frac12 \le \alpha \le \frac23;
  \frac 32-\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} &amp; \text{for} \quad 0 &lt; \alpha \le \frac12 .
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} As a consequence of these results and of the Hamiltonian structure of the equation, we deduce global well-posedness in $H^s(\mathbb K)$ for $s&gt;s_{\alpha}$ when $\alpha&gt;\frac23$, and in the energy space $H^{\frac{\alpha}2}(\mathbb K)$ when $\alpha&gt;\frac45$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and stability in determining the wave equation from a single passive boundary measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses the inverse problem of simultaneously recovering both the wave speed coefficient and an unknown initial condition for the multidimensional wave equation from a single passive boundary measurement. Specifically, we establish uniqueness and H\"{o}lder stability estimates for determining these parameters in the wave equation on $\mathbb{R}^3$, where only a single boundary measurement of the solution--generated by the unknown initial data--is available. Our work connects to thermoacoustic and photoacoustic tomography (TAT/PAT) for the physically relevant case of piecewise constant sound speeds. We significantly relax the stringent conditions previously required for resolving this problem, extending results to general classes of piecewise constant sound speeds over inclusions with unknown locations. The approach combines frequency-domain solution representations with distinctive properties of elliptic and hyperbolic equations.</description>

Abstract: We mainly show that for a conformal metric $g=u^{\frac{4}{n-2m}}|dx|^2$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\geq 2m+1$, if the higher order Q-curvature $Q^{(2m)}_g$ is positive and has slow decay barrier near infinity, the lower order Q-curvature $Q^{(2)}_g$ and $Q^{(4)}_g$ are both positive if $m$ is at least two.</description>

      <title>Numerical Optimization of Eigenvalues of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present numerical minimizers for the first seven eigenvalues of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field in a wide range of field strengths. Adapting an approach by Antunes and Freitas, we use gradient descent for the minimization procedure together with the Method of Fundamental solutions for eigenvalue computation. Remarkably, we observe that when the magnetic flux exceeds the index of the target eigenvalue, the minimizer is always a disk.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear SPDEs and Maximal Regularity: An Extended Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18561v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth exposition of our recent results on the well-posedness theory for stochastic evolution equations, employing maximal regularity techniques. The core of our approach is an abstract notion of critical spaces, which, when applied to nonlinear SPDEs, coincides with the concept of scaling-invariant spaces. This framework leads to several sharp blow-up criteria and enables one to obtain instantaneous regularization results. Additionally, we refine and unify our previous results, while also presenting several new contributions.
  In the second part of the survey, we apply the abstract results to several concrete SPDEs. In particular, we give applications to stochastic perturbations of quasi-geostrophic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and reaction-diffusion systems (including Allen--Cahn, Cahn--Hilliard and Lotka--Volterra models). Moreover, for the Navier--Stokes equations, we establish new Serrin-type blow-up criteria. While some applications are addressed using $L^2$-theory, many require a more general $L^p(L^q)$-framework. In the final section, we outline several open problems, covering both abstract aspects of stochastic evolution equations, and concrete questions in the study of linear and nonlinear SPDEs.</description>

      <title>On geometry of $Q^{(2k)}_g$-curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of current article is to study the geometry of $Q$-curvature. For simplicity, we start with a very simple model: a complete and conformal metric $g=e^{2u}|dx|^2$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We assume the metric $g$ has non-negative $nth$-order $Q$-curvature and non-negative scalar curvature. We show that the Ricci curvature is non-negative. We further assume that the metric $g$ is not degenerate in the sense that the isoperimetric ratio near the end is positive. With this extra assumption, we show that the growth rate of $kth$ elementary symmetric function $\sigma_k(g)$ of Ricci curvature over geodesic ball of radius $r$ is at most polynomial in $r$ with order $n-2k$ for all $1 \leq k \leq \frac{n-2}{2}$. Similarly, we are able to show that the same growth control holds for $2kth$-order $Q$-curvature. Finally, we also observe that for $k=1$ or $2$, the gap theorems for $Q^{(2k)}_g$ hold true.</description>
