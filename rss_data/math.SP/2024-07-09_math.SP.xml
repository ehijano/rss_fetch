      <title>Limiting Over-Smoothing and Over-Squashing of Graph Message Passing by Deep Scattering Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become pivotal tools for processing graph-structured data, leveraging the message passing scheme as their core mechanism. However, traditional GNNs often grapple with issues such as instability, over-smoothing, and over-squashing, which can degrade performance and create a trade-off dilemma. In this paper, we introduce a discriminatively trained, multi-layer Deep Scattering Message Passing (DSMP) neural network designed to overcome these challenges. By harnessing spectral transformation, the DSMP model aggregates neighboring nodes with global information, thereby enhancing the precision and accuracy of graph signal processing. We provide theoretical proofs demonstrating the DSMP's effectiveness in mitigating these issues under specific conditions. Additionally, we support our claims with empirical evidence and thorough frequency analysis, showcasing the DSMP's superior ability to address instability, over-smoothing, and over-squashing.</description>

      <title>Limits and Powers of Koopman Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems provide a comprehensive way to study complex and changing behaviors across various sciences. Many modern systems are too complicated to analyze directly or we do not have access to models, driving significant interest in learning methods. Koopman operators have emerged as a dominant approach because they allow the study of nonlinear dynamics using linear techniques by solving an infinite-dimensional spectral problem. However, current algorithms face challenges such as lack of convergence, hindering practical progress. This paper addresses a fundamental open question: \textit{When can we robustly learn the spectral properties of Koopman operators from trajectory data of dynamical systems, and when can we not?} Understanding these boundaries is crucial for analysis, applications, and designing algorithms. We establish a foundational approach that combines computational analysis and ergodic theory, revealing the first fundamental barriers -- universal for any algorithm -- associated with system geometry and complexity, regardless of data quality and quantity. For instance, we demonstrate well-behaved smooth dynamical systems on tori where non-trivial eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator cannot be determined by any sequence of (even randomized) algorithms, even with unlimited training data. Additionally, we identify when learning is possible and introduce optimal algorithms with verification that overcome issues in standard methods. These results pave the way for a sharp classification theory of data-driven dynamical systems based on how many limits are needed to solve a problem. These limits characterize all previous methods, presenting a unified view. Our framework systematically determines when and how Koopman spectral properties can be learned.</description>

      <title>Dirac cones and magic angles in the Bistritzer--MacDonald TBG Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the generic existence of Dirac cones in the full Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian for twisted bilayer graphene. Its complementary set, when Dirac cones are absent, is the set of magic angles. We show the stability of magic angles obtained in the chiral limit by demonstrating that the perfectly flat bands transform into quadratic band crossings when perturbing away from the chiral limit. Moreover, using the invariance of Euler number, we show that at magic angles there are more band crossings beyond these quadratic band crossings. This is the first result showing the existence of magic angles for the full Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian and solves Open Problem No.2 proposed in the recent survey arXiv:2310.20642.</description>

      <title>On fractional Hardy-type inequalities in general open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, when $sp&gt;N$, the sharp Hardy constant $\mathfrak{h}_{s,p}$ of the punctured space $\mathbb R^N\setminus\{0\}$ in the Sobolev-Slobodecki\u{\i} space provides an optimal lower bound for the Hardy constant $\mathfrak{h}_{s,p}(\Omega)$ of an open $\Omega\subsetneq \mathbb R^N$. The proof exploits the characterization of Hardy's inequality in the fractional setting in terms of positive local weak supersolutions of the relevant Euler-Lagrange equation and relies on the construction of suitable supersolutions by means of the distance function from the boundary of $\Omega$. Moreover, we compute the limit of $\mathfrak{h}_{s,p}$ as $s\nearrow 1$, as well as the limit when $p \nearrow \infty$. Finally, we apply our results to establish a lower bound for the non-local eigenvalue $\lambda_{s,p}(\Omega)$ in terms of $\mathfrak{h}_{s,p}$ when $sp&gt;N$, which, in turn, gives an improved Cheeger inequality whose constant does not vanish as $p\nearrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics under demographic and environmental stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the study of the long term dynamics of diffusion processes modelling a single species that experiences both demographic and environmental stochasticity. In our setting, the long term dynamics of the diffusion process in the absence of demographic stochasticity is determined by the sign of $\Lambda_0$, the external Lyapunov exponent, as follows: $\Lambda_0&lt;0$ implies (asymptotic) extinction and $\Lambda_0&gt;0$ implies convergence to a unique positive stationary distribution $\mu_0$. If the system is of size $\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$ for small $\epsilon&gt;0$ (the intensity of demographic stochasticity), demographic effects will make the extinction time finite almost surely. This suggests that to understand the dynamics one should analyze the quasi-stationary distribution (QSD) $\mu_\epsilon$ of the system. The existence and uniqueness of the QSD is well-known under mild assumptions.
  We look at what happens when the population size is sent to infinity, i.e., when $\epsilon\to 0$. We show that the external Lyapunov exponent still plays a key role: 1) If $\Lambda_0&lt;0$, then $\mu_\epsilon\to \delta_0$, the mean extinction time is of order $|\ln \epsilon|$ and the extinction rate associated with the QSD $\mu_{\epsilon}$ has a lower bound of order $\frac{1}{|\ln\epsilon|}$; 2) If $\Lambda_0&gt;0$, then $\mu_\epsilon\to \mu_0$, the mean extinction time is polynomial in $\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$ and the extinction rate is polynomial in $\epsilon^{2}$. Furthermore, when $\Lambda_0&gt;0$ we are able to show that the system exhibits multiscale dynamics: at first the process quickly approaches the QSD $\mu_\epsilon$ and then, after spending a polynomially long time there, it relaxes to the extinction state. We give sharp asymptotics in $\epsilon$ for the time spent close to $\mu_\epsilon$.</description>
