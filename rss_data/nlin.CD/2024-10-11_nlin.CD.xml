      <title>A five-dimensional Lorenz-type model near the temperature of maximum density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current study formulates a convective model of the Lorenz type near the temperature of maximum density. The existence of this temperature actualizes water dynamics in temperate lakes. There is a conceptual interest what this feature induces in Lorenz-type models. The consideration starts with the zero coefficient of thermal expansion. Other steps are like famous Tritton's approach to derive the Lorenz model. This allows us to reduce difficulties with a selection of Galerkin functions. The analysis focuses on changes induced by zeroing the coefficient of thermal expansion. It results in a five-dimensional Lorenz-type model, whose equations are all nonlinear. The new model reiterates many features of the standard Lorenz model. The nontrivial critical points appear, when the zero critical point becomes unstable. The nontrivial critical points correspond to two possible directions of fluid flow. Phase trajectories of the new model were studied numerically. The results are similar to the known five-dimensional extensions of the Lorenz model.</description>

      <title>Chaos in opinion-driven disease dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became evident that the effectiveness of applying intervention measures is significantly influenced by societal acceptance, which, in turn, is affected by the processes of opinion formation. This article explores one among the many possibilities of a coupled opinion-epidemic system. The findings reveal either intricate periodic patterns or chaotic dynamics, leading to substantial fluctuations in opinion distribution and, consequently, significant variations in the total number of infections over time. Interestingly, the model is exhibiting the protective pattern.</description>

      <title>Using Lagrangian descriptors to calculate the Maslov index of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maslov index of a periodic orbit is an important piece in the semiclassical quantization of non-integrable systems, while almost all existing techniques that lead to a rigorous calculation of this index are elaborate and mathematically demanding. In this paper, we describe a straightforward technique, for systems with two degrees of freedom, based on the Lagrangian descriptors. Our method is illustrated by applying it to the two-dimensional coupled quartic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Learning to learn ecosystems from limited data -- a meta-learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in developing data-driven approaches to ecological systems for tasks such as state estimation and prediction is the paucity of the observational or measurement data. For example, modern machine-learning techniques such as deep learning or reservoir computing typically require a large quantity of data. Leveraging synthetic data from paradigmatic nonlinear but non-ecological dynamical systems, we develop a meta-learning framework with time-delayed feedforward neural networks to predict the long-term behaviors of ecological systems as characterized by their attractors. We show that the framework is capable of accurately reconstructing the ``dynamical climate'' of the ecological system with limited data. Three benchmark population models in ecology, namely the Hastings-Powell model, a three-species food chain, and the Lotka-Volterra system, are used to demonstrate the performance of the meta-learning based prediction framework. In all cases, enhanced accuracy and robustness are achieved using five to seven times less training data as compared with the corresponding machine-learning method trained solely from the ecosystem data. A number of issues affecting the prediction performance are addressed.</description>

      <title>Type-III intermittency in emergent bursting dynamics of globally coupled rotators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globally coupled populations of phase rotators with linear adaptive coupling can exhibit collective bursting oscillations between asynchronous and partially synchronized states, which can be either periodic or chaotic. Here, we analyze the transition between these two regimes, where the dynamics consists of periods of nearly regular bursting interspersed with irregular spiking intervals, and demonstrate its correspondence to intermittent transition to chaos. Specifically, we consider a bimodal Kuramoto model with linear global feedback, which allows for a mean-field formulation of the dynamics and thus to investigate the phenomenology in the thermodynamic limit. We reconstruct the one-dimensional first-return maps of inter-burst intervals and estimate the Floquet multiplier associated with the unstable bursting solution. The results indicate type-III intermittency, which is also supported by the scaling of the average laminar periods as the control parameter varies, along with their probability density distribution.</description>

      <title>Melancholia States of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a much studied component of the climate system, because its suspected multistability is associated with tipping behaviour yielding potentially large regional and global climatic impacts. In this paper we investigate the global stability properties of the system using an ocean general circulation model. We construct an unstable AMOC state, i.e., an unstable solution of the flow that resides between the stable regimes of a vigorous and collapsed AMOC. Such a solution, also known as a Melancholia or edge state, is a dynamical saddle embedded in the boundary separating the competing basins of attraction. It is physically relevant since it lies on the most probable path of a noise-induced transition between the two stable regimes, and because tipping occurs when one of the attractors and the Melancholia state collide. Its properties may thus give hints towards physical mechanisms and predictability of the critical transition. We find that while the AMOC Melancholia state as viewed from its upper ocean properties lies between the vigorous and collapsed regimes, it is characterized by an Atlantic deep ocean that is fresher and colder compared to both stable regimes. The Melancholia state has higher dynamic enthalpy than either stable state, representing a state of higher potential energy that is in good agreement with the dynamical landscape view on metastability.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles, respectively, play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial for analyzing sensitivity to perturbations, and optimizing and controlling various systems.</description>
