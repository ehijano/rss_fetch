      <title>X-ray and multiwavelength polarization of Mrk 501 from 2022 to 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multiwavelength polarization measurements of the luminous blazar Mrk~501 over a 14-month period. The 2--8 keV X-ray polarization was measured with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) with six 100-ks observations spanning from 2022 March to 2023 April. Each IXPE observation was accompanied by simultaneous X-ray data from NuSTAR, Swift/XRT, and/or XMM-Newton. Complementary optical-infrared polarization measurements were also available in the B, V, R, I, and J bands, as were radio polarization measurements from 4.85 GHz to 225.5 GHz. Among the first five IXPE observations, we did not find significant variability in the X-ray polarization degree and angle with IXPE. However, the most recent sixth observation found an elevated polarization degree at $&gt;3\sigma$ above the average of the other five observations. The optical and radio measurements show no apparent correlations with the X-ray polarization properties. Throughout the six IXPE observations, the X-ray polarization degree remained higher than, or similar to, the R-band optical polarization degree, which remained higher than the radio value. This is consistent with the energy-stratified shock scenario proposed to explain the first two IXPE observations, in which the polarized X-ray, optical, and radio emission arises from different regions.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic Hydrodynamic Simulations of binary strange star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform fully general-relativistic simulations of binary strange star mergers considering two different approaches for thermal effects. The first uses a cold equation of state (EOS) derived from a modified version of the MIT bag model which is then supplemented by a $\Gamma$-law correction. The second approach employs a microphysical description of the finite-temperature effects. We describe results obtained with the two treatments, highlighting the influence of thermal effects. We find that the postmerger dynamics differs significantly in the two cases, leading to quantitative differences in the postmerger gravitational-wave spectrum and ejecta mass. The peak frequency of the postmerger gravitational-wave emission is consistent with the established quasi-universal relations for binary neutron star mergers and as a result, our simulations cannot distinguish between mergers of neutron stars and those of strange stars. Our models with realistic treatment of finite-temperature effects produce a significant amount of ejecta $\gtrsim 0.02\ M_{\odot}$. The resulting flux of strangelets near the Earth, computed assuming that all neutron star mergers are in fact strange-stars mergers and that the binary considered here is representative, is in tension with experimental upper limits. As such, our results tentatively disfavor a scenario in which strange-quark matter is the lowest energy state of matter.</description>

      <title>Joint gravitational wave detection by TianQin and LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the detection accuracy of double white dwarfs (DWDs), stellar-mass black hole binaries (SBHBs), light and heavy intermediate mass ratio inspirals (IMRIs), extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) of astronomical origin for TianQin, LISA, and joint detection. We use a Fisher matrix analysis and consider for each source the averaged detection accuracy over a realistic range of parameters. We find that on average TianQin obtains more accurate parameter estimation for DWDs and light IMRIs, LISA for heavy IMRIs, EMRIs, MBHBs, and the galactic foreground of the SGWB, and both contribute similarly to the detection of SBHBs and the extra-galactic SGWB. Nevertheless, for all sources joint detection allows setting tighter constraints on most parameters highlighting its importance for future detection.</description>

      <title>Follow-up observations of apparently one-off sources from the Parkes telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A small fraction of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been observed with multiple bursts, whereas most Galactic sources emitting radio pulses are known to repeat. Here we present the results of follow-up observations of two FRBs and four rotating radio transients (RRATs). Among these, only one RRAT has been observed with repeating pulses, with an estimated period of around 1.297047 s. For comparison, we reanalysed the Parkes archival follow-up observations in CSIRO's data archive for all apparently one-off sources discovered by the Parkes telescopes, including 13 RRATs and 29 FRBs. In total, 3 RRATs are suggested to be repeaters, but no repeating signals were detected from the other sources. Reporting details of the non-detection observations for the apparently one-off sources would help investigate their origins, and catastrophic scenarios are worth proposing for both extragalactic and Galactic sources.</description>

      <title>SN 2021dbg: A Luminous Type IIP-IIL Supernova Exploding from a Massive Star with a Layered Shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present extensive observations and analysis of supernova (SN) 2021dbg, utilizing optical photometry and spectroscopy. For approximately 385 days following the explosion, SN 2021dbg exhibited remarkable luminosity, surpassing most SNe II. This initial high luminosity is potentially attributed to the interaction between the ejected material and the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), as evidenced by the pronounced interaction signatures observed in its spectra. The subsequent high luminosity is primarily due to the significant $^{56}$Ni ($0.17 \pm 0.05$ M$_{\odot}$) produced in the explosion. Based on the flux of flash emission lines detected in the initial spectra, we estimate that the CSM mass near the progenitor amounted to $\sim$(1.0--2.0) $\times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$, likely resulting from intense stellar wind activity 2--3 yr preceding the explosion. Considering the bolometric light curve, nebular spectrum modeling, and mass-loss rate, we suggest that the progenitor of SN 2021dbg was a red supergiant (RSG) with a mass of $\sim 20$ M$_{\odot}$ and a radius of 1200 R$_{\odot}$. This RSG featured a thick hydrogen shell, which may have contained a region with a sharp decrease in material density, electron density, and temperature, contributing to its layered structure. This object demonstrates mixed features of SNe IIP and SNe IIL, making it as a transitional event linking the above two subclasses of SNe II.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrino emission from tidal disruption event outflow-cloud interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs), characterized by their luminous transients and high-velocity outflows, have emerged as plausible sources of high-energy neutrinos contributing to the diffuse neutrino. In this study, we calculate the contribution of TDEs to the diffuse neutrino by employing the outflow-cloud model within the TDE framework. Our analysis indicates that the contribution of TDEs becomes negligible when the redshift $Z$ exceeds 2. Employing a set of fiducial values, which includes outflow energy $E_{\rm kin}=10^{51}$ erg, a proton spectrum cutoff energy $E_{\rm p,max}=100$ PeV, a volume TDE rate $\dot{N}=8 \times 10^{-7}\ \rm Mpc^{-3}\ year^{-1}$, covering fraction of clouds $C_V=0.1$, energy conversion efficiency in the shock $\eta =0.1$, and a proton spectrum index $\Gamma=-1.7$, we find that TDEs can account for approximately 80\% of the contribution at energies around 0.3 PeV. Additionally, TDEs still contribute around 18\% to the IceCube data below 0.1 PeV and the total contribution is $\sim 24^{+2}_{-15}\%$. In addition, we also discuss the potential influence of various parameter values on the results in detail. With the IceCube data, we impose constraints on the combination of the physical parameters, i.e., $C_{f}=\dot{N}E_{\rm kin}C_{\rm v}\eta$. Future observations or theoretical considerations would fix some physical parameters, which will help to constrain some individual parameters of TDEs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dissipation in short gamma-ray burst jets. I. Resistive relativistic MHD evolution in a model environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short gamma-ray bursts originate when relativistic jets emerge from the remnants of binary neutron star mergers. Both the jet and the remnant are believed to be strongly magnetized, and the presence of magnetic fields is known to influence the jet propagation across the surrounding post-merger environment. In the magnetic interplay between the jet and the environment itself, effects due to a finite plasma conductivity may be important, especially in the first phases of the jet propagation. We aim to investigate such effects, from jet launching to its final breakout from the post-merger environment. 2D axisymmetric and full 3D resistive relativistic MHD simulations, are performed with the PLUTO numerical code. Different models for physical resistivity, which must be small but still above the numerical one (producing unwanted smearing of structures in any ideal MHD code) are considered and compared. All simulations are performed by using an axisymmetric analytical model for the jet propagation environment; we leave the case of jet propagation in a realistic environment (i.e. imported from actual binary neutron star merger simulation) to a later study. Significant differences in the jet structure and induced turbulence are clearly seen in 2D axisymmetric simulations. Regions with a resistive electric field parallel to the magnetic field form and non-thermal particle acceleration may be enhanced there. The level of dissipated Ohmic power is also dependent on the various recipes for resistivity. Most of the differences arise before breakout from the magnetized environment, whereas once the jet enters the external atmosphere these differences are preserved during further propagation despite the lower grid refinement. Finally, we show and discuss the 3D evolution of the jet within the same environment, in order to highlight the emergence of non-axisymmetric features.</description>

      <title>A $\sim 43$ GeV $\gamma$-ray line signature in the directions of a group of nearby massive galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe, galaxy clusters have provided the first piece of evidence for the presence of dark matter and may be suitable targets for indirect dark matter searches. Among various signals, the GeV-TeV $\gamma$-ray line has been taken as the smoking-gun signal of the dark matter annihilation/decay since no known astrophysical/physical process(es) could generate such a peculiar spectrum. With 15.5 years of Fermi-LAT P8R3 publicly available data, we search for the $\gamma$-ray line emission in the directions of a group of 13 nearby massive galaxy clusters with an unbinned likelihood analysis. A $\gamma$-ray line signal at $\sim 43.2$ GeV has a net TS value of $\approx 30$ if we only take into account the data in the directions of Virgo, Fornax and Ophiuchus clusters, three massive clusters with the highest J-factors expected to generate the dark matter annihilation signal. The signal still presents when the data of other 10 nearby massive clusters have also been included, though the TS value decreases to $\approx 21$ likely because of their lower signal-to-noise ratios. The absence of this signal in the inner Galaxy disfavors both the instrumental effect and the canonical dark matter annihilation interpretation, and a more sophisticated dark matter model or very peculiar astrophysical scenario might be needed. This $\gamma$-ray line signal, if intrinsic, could be unambiguously verified by the Very Large Area $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope in its first two years of performance.</description>

      <title>A multi-wavelength study to decipher the 2017 flare of the blazar OJ 287</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In February 2017, the blazar OJ~287 underwent a period of intense multiwavelength activity. It reached a new historic peak in the soft X-ray (0.3-10 keV) band, as measured by Swift-XRT. This event coincides with a very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray outburst that led VERITAS to detect emission above 100 GeV, with a detection significance of $10\sigma$ (from 2016 December 9 to 2017 March 31). The time-averaged VHE $\gamma$-ray spectrum was consistent with a soft power law ($\Gamma = -3.81 \pm 0.26$) and an integral flux corresponding to $\sim2.4\%$ that of the Crab Nebula above the same energy. Contemporaneous data from multiple instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum reveal complex flaring behavior, primarily in the soft X-ray and VHE bands. To investigate the possible origin of such an event, our study focuses on three distinct activity states: before, during, and after the February 2017 peak. The spectral energy distributions during these periods suggest the presence of at least two non-thermal emission zones, with the more compact one responsible for the observed flare. Broadband modeling results and observations of a new radio knot in the jet of OJ~287 in 2017 are consistent with a flare originating from a strong recollimation shock outside the radio core.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Short Gamma-Ray Burst Physics and Their Host Galaxies from Systematic Radio Follow-up Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are explosive transients caused by binary mergers of compact objects containing at least one neutron star. Multi-wavelength afterglow observations provide constraints on the physical parameters of the jet, its surrounding medium, and the microphysics of the enhanced magnetic fields and accelerated electrons in the blast wave at the front of the jet. The synchrotron radio emission can be tracked for much longer than in other spectral regimes, and it can pin down the evolution of the spectral peak. We present the results of a systematic observing campaign of eight short GRBs with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Additionally, we present observations of four of these short GRBs using the ATCA radio telescope and two of these short GRBs with the e-MERLIN radio telescope. Using these results we report one possible detection of a short GRB afterglow from GRB 230217A and deep upper limits for the rest of our short GRB observations. We use these observations to place constraints on some of the physical parameters, in particular those related to electron acceleration, the circumburst density, and gamma-ray energy efficiency. We discuss how deeper observations with new and upgraded telescopes should be able to determine if the gamma-ray efficiency differs between long and short GRBs. We also report detections of the likely host galaxies for four of the eight GRBs and upper limits for another GRB, increasing the number of detected host galaxies in the radio with implications for the star formation rate in these galaxies.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of the knee in the cosmic ray spectrum across the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The all-particle spectrum of cosmic rays measured at Earth has a knee-like feature around 4 PeV. A priori, it is not clear if this is a local feature specific to the Solar neighbourhood in the Milky Way, or if it is a generic property of the galactic cosmic ray spectrum. We argue that combining gamma-ray and cosmic-ray data of LHAASO indicates that the knee is a local feature. In order to demonstrate this, we derive a model for the local cosmic-ray spectra and composition, consistent with the recent LHAASO measurements of the all-particle spectrum and the mean logarithmic mass in the knee region. We calculate the spectrum of diffuse gamma-ray emission based on this model and find that the expected spectral shape of the diffuse gamma-ray flux is not consistent with LHAASO measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the 10-100 TeV energy range.</description>

      <title>Muon-induced collisional flavor instability in core-collapse supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos are known to undergo flavor conversion among their three flavors. In the theoretical modeling of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), there has been a great deal of attention to recent discoveries of a new type of neutrino flavor conversions, namely collisional flavor instability (CFI), in which the instability is induced by the flavor-dependent decoherence due to the disparity of neutrino-matter interactions among flavors. In this paper, we study how the appearance of on-shell muons and associated neutrino-matter interactions can impact CFIs based on linear stability analysis of flavor conversions. Some striking results emerge from the present study. First, we analytically show that breaking beta- and pair equilibrium is a necessary condition to trigger CFIs. This also indicates that CFIs with on-shell muons could appear in $e \tau$ and $\mu \tau$ neutrino mixing sectors in very high-density region ($\gtrsim 10^{13} {\rm g/cm^{3}}$), exhibiting a possibility of large impacts of CFIs on CCSN. Second, resonance-like CFIs, having a much higher growth rate than normal CFIs, can be triggered by muons. The resonance point of CFIs is different between $e \tau$ and $\mu \tau$ sectors; the former (latter) occurs at $\mu_{e (\mu)} = \mu_{n} - \mu_{p}$, where $\mu_{i}$ denotes the chemical potential of $i$ constitute ($n$ and $p$ represent neutrons and protons, respectively). Our result suggests that the non-linear evolution of CFI with on-shell muons would induce flavor conversions with the complex interplay among all three different neutrino-mixing sectors.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars and the dense matter equation of state: from microscopic theory to macroscopic observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past years have witnessed tremendous progress in understanding the properties of neutron stars and of the dense matter in their cores, made possible by electromagnetic observations of neutron stars and the detection of gravitational waves from their mergers. These observations provided novel constraints on neutron-star structure, that is intimately related to the properties of dense neutron-rich matter described by the nuclear equation of state. Nevertheless, constraining the equation of state over the wide range of densities probed by astrophysical observations is still challenging, as the physics involved is very broad and the system spans many orders of magnitude in densities. Here, we review theoretical approaches to calculate and model the neutron-star equation of state in various regimes of densities, and discuss the related consequent properties of neutron stars. We describe how the equation of state can be calculated from nuclear interactions that are constrained and benchmarked by nuclear experiments. We review neutron-star observations, with particular emphasis on information provided by gravitational-wave signals and electromagnetic observations. Finally, we discuss future challenges and opportunities in the field.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection: an alternative explanation of radio emission in galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of galaxy clusters show radio emission extended over almost the system scale, necessitating mechanisms for particle acceleration. Previous models for acceleration such as diffusive shock acceleration and that due to turbulence fall short in terms of efficiency. In this letter, we propose the possibility of acceleration via magnetic reconnection. In particular, we invoke the plasmoid instability which has been previously applied to understand particle energization in high energy systems. Turbulence in galaxy clusters lead to fluctuation dynamos that are known to generate magnetic fields structures consisting of sharp reversals. These form natural sites of reconnection. We perform Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of the plasmoid instability in collisionless and nonrelativistic plasmas. We show that the resulting particle energy spectra have power law indices that are consistent with that inferred from observations. Our estimates of the maximum achievable Lorentz factor is about $10^5$ indicating that acceleration due magnetic reconnection is a promising avenue for understanding the origin of nonthermal emission in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>The first-order phase transition in the neutron star from the deep neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the first-order phase transition within neutron stars, leveraging the deep neural network (DNN) framework alongside contemporary astronomical measurements. The equation of state (EOS) for neutron stars is delineated in a piecewise polytropic form, with the speed of sound ($c_s$) serving as a pivotal determinant. In the phase transition region, $c_s$ is presumed to be zero, while in other intervals, it is optimized utilizing the DNN. Various onset energy densities of phase transition ($\varepsilon_{pt}$), spanning from $2\varepsilon_0$ to $3\varepsilon_0$ (where $\varepsilon_0$ denotes the energy density at nuclear saturation density), as well as phase transition widths ($\Delta\varepsilon$) ranging from $0.5\varepsilon_0$ to $\varepsilon_0$, are examined. Our findings underscore that smaller values of $\varepsilon_{pt}$ lead to a more substantial impact of $\Delta\varepsilon$ on neutron star properties, encompassing maximum mass, corresponding radius, tidal deformability, phase transition mass, and trace anomaly. Conversely, when $\varepsilon_{pt}$ exceeds $2.5\varepsilon_0$, the influence of $\Delta\varepsilon$ diminishes, resulting in a stiffer EOS compared to scenarios lacking a phase transition. Furthermore, the trace anomaly at high density shifts to negative values upon the commencement of the phase transition. It is noteworthy that the correlations between the average speed of sound at different energy density segments demonstrate a notably weak connection. The discernment of whether a phase transition has occurred with the present observables of neutron stars poses a challenging task.</description>

      <title>X-ray Sources Classification Using Machine Learning: A Study with EP-WXT Pathfinder LEIA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray observations play a crucial role in time-domain astronomy. The Einstein Probe (EP), a recently launched X-ray astronomical satellite, emerges as a forefront player in the field of time-domain astronomy and high-energy astrophysics. With a focus on systematic surveys in the soft X-ray band, EP aims to discover high-energy transients and monitor variable sources in the universe. To achieve these objectives, a quick and reliable classification of observed sources is essential. In this study, we developed a machine learning classifier for autonomous source classification using data from the EP-WXT Pathfinder Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy (LEIA) and EP-WXT simulations. The proposed Random Forest classifier, built on selected features derived from light curves, energy spectra, and location information, achieves an accuracy of approximately 95% on EP simulation data and 98% on LEIA observational data. The classifier is integrated into the LEIA data processing pipeline, serving as a tool for manual validation and rapid classification during observations. This paper presents an efficient method for the classification of X-ray sources based on single observations, along with implications of most effective features for the task. This work facilitates rapid source classification for the EP mission and also provides valuable insights into feature selection and classification techniques for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of X-ray source classification that can be adapted to other X-ray telescope data.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis of Thorne-\.Zytkow objects: Rejuvenated donors and unexplored progenitors in the common envelope formation channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Common envelope evolution of a massive star and a neutron star companion has two possible outcomes: formation of a short-period binary (a potential gravitational wave source progenitor) or a merger of the massive star with the neutron star. If the binary merges, a structure with a neutron star core surrounded by a large diffuse envelope, a so-called Thorne-\.Zytkow object (T\.ZO), may form. The predicted appearance of this hypothetical class of star is very similar to red supergiants, making observational identification difficult.
  Aims. Our objective is to understand the properties of systems that are potential T\.ZO progenitors, e.g., binary systems that enter a common envelope phase with a neutron star companion. We also aim to distinguish those that have been through a previous stable mass transfer phase, which can rejuvenate the accretor. We estimate the number of T\.ZOs in the Milky Way and assess the impact of uncertainties in their formation.
  Methods. We use the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS at Solar metallicity and with common envelope efficiency parameter set to unity to determine the population demographics of T\.ZOs. We use one-dimensional evolutionary T\.ZO models from the literature to determine a fit for T\.ZO lifetime in order to estimate the current number of T\.ZOs in the Galaxy as well as to assess core disruption during the merger.
  Results. We explore the progenitors in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, calculate formation rates, and investigate kinematics of the progenitor stars. We find that the vast majority ($\approx 92\%$) of T\.ZO progenitors in our population have experienced mass transfer and become rejuvenated before their formation event. Using a constant star formation rate we estimate $\approx 2\times 10 ^{-4}$ T\.ZOs per $M_\odot$ in our Galaxy, corresponding to $\approx 5\pm 1$ T\.ZOs in the Milky Way at present.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic neutron star crust, solar system mountains, and gravitational waves</title>

Abstract: "Mountains" or non-axisymmetric deformations of rotating neutron stars (NS) efficiently radiate gravitational waves (GW). We consider analogies between NS mountains and surface features of solar system bodies. Both NS and moons such as Europa or Enceladus have thin crusts over deep oceans while Mercury has a thin crust over a large metallic core. Thin sheets may wrinkle in universal ways. Europa has linear features, Enceladus has "Tiger" stripes, and Mercury has lobate scarps. NS may have analogous features. The innermost inner core of the Earth is anisotropic with a shear modulus that depends on direction. If NS crust material is also anisotropic this will produce an ellipticity, when the crust is stressed, that grows with spin frequency. This yields a braking index (log derivative of spin down rate assuming only GW spin down) very different from $n=5$ and could explain the maximum spin observed for neutron stars and a possible minimum ellipticity of millisecond pulsars.</description>

      <title>Prospects for a survey of the Galactic plane with the Cherenkov Telescope Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximately one hundred sources of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays are known in the Milky Way. A survey of the entire Galactic Plane in the energy range from a few tens of GeV to a few hundred TeV has been proposed as a Key Science Project for the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). This article presents the status of the studies towards the Galactic Plane Survey (GPS). We build and make publicly available a sky model that combines data from observations of known gamma-ray emitters with state-of-the-art physically-driven models of synthetic populations of the main classes of established Galactic VHE sources, as well as of interstellar emission from cosmic-ray interactions in the Milky Way. We also perform an optimisation of the observation strategy. We use the improved sky model and observation strategy to simulate GPS data that are analysed using the methods and software tools under development for real data. We show that the GPS has the potential to increase the number of known Galactic VHE emitters by almost a factor of five. This corresponds to the detection of more than two hundred pulsar wind nebulae and a few tens of supernova remnants at average integral fluxes one order of magnitude lower than in the existing sample above 1 TeV, therefore opening the possibility to perform unprecedented population studies. The GPS also has the potential to provide new VHE detections of binary systems and pulsars, and to detect bright PeVatrons. Furthermore, the GPS will constitute a pathfinder for deeper follow-up observations of these source classes. Finally, we show that we can extract from GPS data an estimate of the contribution to diffuse emission from unresolved sources, and that there are good prospects of detecting interstellar emission and statistically distinguishing different scenarios.

Abstract: Hybrid neutron stars, the compact objects consisting hadronic matter and strange quark matter, can be considered as the probes for the scalar tensor gravity. In this work, we explore the scalarization of hybrid neutron stars in the scalar tensor gravity. For the hadronic phase, we apply a piecewise polytropic equation of state constrained by the observational data of GW170817 and the data of six low-mass X-ray binaries with thermonuclear burst or the symmetry energy of the nuclear interaction. In addition, to describe the strange quark matter inside the hybrid neutron star, different MIT bag models are employed. We study the effects of the value of bag constant, the mass of s quark, the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter, and the density jump at the surface of quark-hadronic phase transition on the scalarization of hybrid neutron stars. Our results confirm that the scalarization is more sensitive to the value of bag constant, the mass of s quark, and the density jump compared to the perturbative quantum chromodynamics correction parameter.</description>

      <title>Bumpy Superluminous Supernovae Powered by Magnetar-star Binary Engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars in close binary systems can be tidally spun up by their companions, potentially leaving behind fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron stars, known as ``magnetars", after core collapse. These newborn magnetars can transfer rotational energy into heating and accelerating the ejecta, producing hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose that the magnetar wind of the newborn magnetar could significantly evaporate its companion star, typically a main-sequence or helium star, if the binary system is not disrupted by the {abrupt mass loss and} SN kick. The subsequent heating and acceleration of the evaporated star material along with the SN ejecta by the magnetar wind can produce a post-peak bump in the SLSN lightcurve. Our model can reproduce the primary peaks and post-peak bumps of four example observed multiband SLSN lightcurves, revealing that the mass of the evaporated material could be $\sim0.4-0.6\,M_\odot$ if the material is hydrogen-rich. {We propose that the magnetar could induce strongly enhanced evaporation from its companion star near the pericenter if the orbit of the post-SN binary is highly eccentric, ultimately generating multiple post-peak bumps in the SLSN lightcurves. This ``magnetar-star binary engine" model may offer a possible explanation for the evolution of polarization, along with the origin and velocity broadening of late-time hydrogen or helium broad spectral features observed in some bumpy SLSNe.} The diversity in the lightcurves and spectra of SLSNe may be attributed to the wide variety of companion stars and post-SN binary systems.</description>

      <title>Two models for the orbital modulation of $\gamma$-rays in Cyg X-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the currently available $\gamma$-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope on Cyg X-3. Thanks to its very strong $\gamma$-ray activity during 2018--2021, the data quality has significantly improved. We study the strong orbital modulation of the $\gamma$-rays observed during at high $\gamma$-ray fluxes. The modulation, as found earlier, is well modeled by anisotropic Compton scattering of the donor blackbody emission by relativistic electrons in a jet strongly misaligned with respect to the orbital axis. We confirm that this model fits well both the average $\gamma$-ray modulation light curve and the spectrum. However, we find that if the jet is aligned with the spin axis of a rotating black hole, it would undergo geodetic precession with the period of $\sim$50 years. However, its presence is ruled out by both the $\gamma$-ray and radio data. Therefore, we consider an alternative model in which the average jet direction jet is aligned, but it is bent to outside the orbit owing to the thrust of the donor stellar wind, and thus precesses at the orbital period. The $\gamma$-ray modulation appears then owing to the variable Doppler boosting of synchrotron self-Compton jet emission. The model also fits well the data. However, the fitted bending angle is much larger than the theoretical one based on the binary and wind parameters as currently known. Thus, both models disagree with important aspects of our current theoretical understanding of the system. We discuss possible ways to find the correct model.</description>

      <title>Impact of electron spectra on morphology of pulsar halos at ultra-high energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extended $\gamma$-ray halos around pulsars are unique probe of transportation of high-energy electrons (and positrons) in vicinities of such pulsars. Observations of morphologies of several such halos indicate that particles diffuse very slowly around pulsars, compared with that in the Milky Way halo. The energy-dependent morphologies are expected to be very important in studying the energy-dependence of the diffusion coefficient. In this work we point out that the spectrum of high-energy electrons takes effect in shaping the $\gamma$-ray morphologies at the ultra-high-energy bands, and thus results in a degeneracy between the electron spectrum and the energy-dependence of the diffusion coefficient. The reasons for such a degeneracy include both the Klein-Nishina effect of the inverse Compton scattering and the curvature (if any) of the electron spectrum. It it thus necessary to take into account the spectral shape of electrons when deriving the energy-dependence of diffusion coefficient using ultra-high-energy $\gamma$-ray measurements of extended pulsar halos.</description>

      <title>New and Robust Gravitational-Waveform Model for High-Mass-Ratio Binary Neutron Star Systems with Dynamical Tidal Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the analysis of gravitational-wave signals, fast and accurate gravitational-waveform models are required. These enable us to obtain information on the system properties from compact binary mergers. In this article, we introduce the NRTidalv3 model, which contains a closed-form expression that describes tidal effects, focusing on the description of binary neutron star systems. The model improves upon previous versions by employing a larger set of numerical-relativity data for its calibration, by including high-mass ratio systems covering also a wider range of equations of state. It also takes into account dynamical tidal effects and the known post-Newtonian mass-ratio dependence of individual calibration parameters. We implemented the model in the publicly available LALSuite software library by augmenting different binary black hole waveform models (IMRPhenomD, IMRPhenomX, and SEOBNRv5_ROM). We test the validity of NRTidalv3 by comparing it with numerical-relativity waveforms, as well as other tidal models. Finally, we perform parameter estimation for GW170817 and GW190425 with the new tidal approximant and find overall consistent results with respect to previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve by a factor of 4-20 the energy accuracy of the strongest soft X-ray transitions of Fe XVII ions by resonantly exciting them in an electron beam ion trap with a monochromatic beam at the P04 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron facility. By simultaneously tracking instantaneous photon-energy fluctuations with a high-resolution photoelectron spectrometer, we minimize systematic uncertainties down to 10-15 meV, or velocity equivalent $\pm\sim$5 km s$^{-1}$ in their rest energies, substantially improving our knowledge of this key astrophysical ion. Our large-scale configuration-interaction computations include more than four million relativistic configurations and agree with the experiment at a level without precedent for a 10-electron system. Thereby, theoretical uncertainties for interelectronic correlations become far smaller than those of quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections. The present QED benchmark strengthens our trust in future calculations of many other complex atomic ions of interest to astrophysics, plasma physics, and for the development of optical clocks with highly charged ions.</description>

Abstract: Advancements in cosmology through next-generation ground-based gravitational wave observatories will bring in a paradigm shift. We explore the pivotal role that gravitational-wave standard sirens will play in inferring cosmological parameters with next-generation observatories, not only achieving exquisite precision but also opening up unprecedented redshifts. We examine the merits and the systematic biases involved in gravitational-wave standard sirens utilizing binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole mergers. Further, we estimate the precision of bright sirens, golden dark sirens, and spectral sirens for these binary coalescences and compare the abilities of various next-generation observatories (A^sharp, Cosmic Explorer, Einstein Telescope, and their possible networks). When combining different sirens, we find sub-percent precision over more than 10 billion years of cosmic evolution for the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$. This work presents a broad view of opportunities to precisely measure the cosmic expansion rate, decipher the elusive dark energy and dark matter, and potentially discover new physics in the uncharted Universe with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Radio Scrutiny of the X-ray-Weak Tail of Low-Mass Active Galactic Nuclei: A Novel Signature of High-Eddington Accretion?</title>

Abstract: The supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6}$$-$$10^{10}~M_\odot$) that power luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs), i.e., quasars, generally show a correlation between thermal disk emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and coronal emission in hard X-rays. In contrast, some "massive" black holes (mBHs; $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5}$$-$$10^{6}~M_\odot$) in low-mass galaxies present curious X-ray properties with coronal radiative output up to 100$\times$ weaker than expected. To examine this issue, we present a pilot study incorporating Very Large Array radio observations of a sample of 18 high-accretion-rate (Eddington ratios $L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd} &gt; 0.1$), mBH-powered AGNs ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6}~M_\odot$) with Chandra X-ray coverage. Empirical correlations previously revealed in samples of radio-quiet, high-Eddington AGNs indicate that the radio$-$X-ray luminosity ratio, $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$, is approximately constant. Through multiwavelength analysis, we instead find that the X-ray-weaker mBHs in our sample tend toward larger values of $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$ even though they remain radio-quiet per their optical$-$UV properties. This trend results in a tentative but highly intriguing correlation between $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$ and X-ray weakness, which we argue is consistent with a scenario in which X-rays may be preferentially obscured from our line of sight by a "slim" accretion disk. We compare this observation to weak emission-line quasars (AGNs with exceptionally weak broad-line emission and a significant X-ray-weak fraction) and conclude by suggesting that our results may offer a new observational signature for finding high-accretion-rate AGNs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Large-Volume GAGG Scintillators for use in MeV Gamma-Ray Astrophysics</title>

Abstract: Gamma-ray astrophysics in the MeV band is an exciting field in astronomy due to its potential for multi-messenger astrophysics. It has, however, remained under-explored when compared to other wavelengths. One reason for this observational gap is the difficulties with measuring these high-energy photons and the requirement of large amounts of detection material. In this work, we investigate the usage of large-volume GAGG scintillators for use as a calorimeter in future MeV telescopes. We developed a $5\times5$ array calorimeter utilizing $1\times1\times6 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ GAGG crystals with onsemi C-series SiPM readout. We tested the calorimeter at the High Intensity Gamma-ray Facility (HIGS) with monoenergetic beams ranging from $2-25 \ \mathrm{MeV}$. Finally, we also investigate larger $1\times1\times8 \ \mathrm{cm}^3$ crystals and characterize their response across their depth when their surface treatment is either polished or frosted.</description>
