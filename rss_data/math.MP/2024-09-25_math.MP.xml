      <title>An Exposition on the Kaniadakis \kappa-Deformed Decay Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kaniadakis deformed \kappa-mathematics is an area of mathematics that has found relevance in the analysis of complex systems. Specifically, the mathematical framework in the context of a first-order decay \kappa-differential equation is investigated, facilitating an in-depth examination of the \kappa-mathematical structure which is appropriate at the undergraduate level. This framework serves as a foundational platform, representing the simplest non-trivial setting for such inquiries which is not known in the literature. Finally, additional avenues of study at the appropriate level are discussed.</description>

      <title>Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions and the Accuracy and Dimensionality of Spectral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result of this thesis is an efficient protocol to determine the frequencies of a signal $C(t)= \sum_k |a_k|^2 e^{i \omega_k t}$, which is given for a finite time, to a high degree of precision. Specifically, we develop a theorem that provides a fundamental precision guarantee. Additionally, we establish an approximation theory for spectral analysis through low-dimensional subspaces that can be applied to a wide range of problems. The signal processing routine relies on a symmetry between harmonic analysis and quantum mechanics. In this context, prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWF) are identified as the optimal information processing basis. To establish rigorous precision guarantees, we extend the concentration properties of PSWFs to a supremum bound and an $\ell_2$ bound on their derivatives. The new bounds allow us to refine the truncation estimates for the prolate sampling formula. We also provide a new geometrical insight into the commutation relation between an integral operator and a differential operator, both of which have PSWFs as eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>Functional Integral Construction of Topological Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce regular stratified piecewise linear manifolds to describe lattices and investigate the lattice model approach to topological quantum field theory in all dimensions. We introduce the unitary $n+1$ alterfold TQFT and construct it from a linear functional on an $n$-dimensional lattice model on an $n$-sphere satisfying three conditions: reflection positivity, homeomorphic invariance and complete finiteness. A unitary spherical $n$-category is mathematically defined and emerges as the local quantum symmetry of the lattice model. The alterfold construction unifies various constructions of $n+1$ TQFT from $n$-dimensional lattice models and $n$-categories. In particular, we construct a non-invertible unitary 3+1 alterfold TQFT from a linear functional and derive its local quantum symmetry as a unitary spherical 3-category of Ising type with explicit 20j-symbols, so that the scalar invariant of 2-knots in piecewise linear 4-manifolds could be computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Phase-space gaussian ensemble quantum camouflage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending the phase-space description of the Weyl-Wigner quantum mechanics to a subset of non-linear Hamiltonians in position and momentum, gaussian functions are identified as the quantum ground state. Once a Hamiltonian, $H^{W}(q,\,p)$, is constrained by the $\partial ^2 H^{W} / \partial q \partial p = 0$ condition, flow properties for generic $1$-dim systems can be analytically obtained in terms of Wigner functions and Wigner currents. For gaussian statistical ensembles, the exact phase-space profile of the quantum fluctuations over the classical trajectories are found, so to interpret them as a suitable Hilbert space state configuration for confronting quantum and classical regimes. In particular, a sort of {\em quantum camouflage} where the stationarity of classical statistical ensembles can be camouflaged by the stationarity of gaussian quantum ensembles is identified. Besides the broadness of the framework worked out in some previous examples, our results provide an encompassing picture of quantum effects on non-linear dynamical systems which can be interpreted as a first step for finding the complete spectrum of non-standard Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction-inspired multiparameter quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel strategy for obtaining optimal probe states and measurement schemes in a class of noiseless multiparameter estimation problems with symmetry among the generators. The key to the framework is the introduction of a set of quantum metrology conditions, analogous to the quantum error correction conditions of Knill and Laflamme, which are utilized to identify probe states that saturate the multiparameter quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound. Similar to finding two-dimensional irreps for encoding a logical qubit in error correction, we identify trivial irreps of finite groups that guarantee the satisfaction of the quantum metrology conditions. To demonstrate our framework, we analyze the SU(2) estimation with symmetric states in which three parameters define a global rotation of an ensemble of $N$ qubits. For even $N$, we find that tetrahedral symmetry and, with fine-tuning, $S_{3}$ symmetry, are minimal symmetry groups providing optimal probe states for SU(2) estimation, but that the quantum metrology conditions can also be satisfied in an entanglement-assisted setting by using a maximally entangled state of two spin-$N/2$ representations for any $N$. By extending the multiparameter method of moments to non-commuting observables, we use the quantum metrology conditions to construct a measurement scheme that saturates the multiparameter quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound for small rotation angles.</description>

      <title>Circumventing the Ricci-inverse no-go theorem with complexifiable singularities: a novel dark energy model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ricci-inverse gravity is a new type of fourth-order gravity theory based on the anti-curvature tensor, that is, the inverse of the Ricci tensor. In this context, we introduce a novel method to circumvent the binding effects of a well-known no-go theorem for cosmic trajectories that cannot smoothly join a decelerated cosmic age with the current accelerated expansion of the universe. We therefore design a new class of Ricci-inverse theories whose cosmologies, without falling into no-go singularities, achieve the observed expansion as a stable attractor solution. This new perspective retrains Ricci-inverse cosmologies as viable dark energy models.</description>

      <title>SLE Loop Measure and Liouville Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As recently shown by Holden and two of the authors, the conformal welding of two Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) disks produces a canonical variant of SLE curve whose law is called the SLE loop measure. In this paper, we demonstrate how LQG can be used to study the SLE loop measure. Firstly, we show that for $\kappa\in (8/3,8)$, the loop intensity measure of the conformal loop ensemble agrees with the SLE loop measure as defined by Zhan (2021). The former was initially considered by Kemppainen and Werner (2016) for $\kappa\in (8/3,4]$, and the latter was constructed for $\kappa\in (0,8)$. Secondly, we establish a duality for the SLE loop measure between $\kappa$ and $16/\kappa$. Thirdly, we obtain the exact formula for the moment of the electrical thickness for the shape (probability) measure of the SLE loop, which in the regime $\kappa\in (8/3,8)$ was conjectured by Kenyon and Wilson (2004). This relies on the exact formulae for the reflection coefficient and the one-point disk correlation function in Liouville conformal field theory. Finally, we compute several multiplicative constants associated with the SLE loop measure, which are not only of intrinsic interest but also used in our companion paper relating the conformal loop ensemble to the imaginary DOZZ formulae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the Nose-Hoover and Moore-Spiegel Oscillators, and in particular, their topological dynamics. We prove the dynamics of both these systems can be reduced to a flow on a solid torus, with at most a finite number of attracting periodic trajectories. As a consequence, we obtain that every periodic trajectory for the Nose-Hoover and the Moore-Spiegel Oscillators is a Torus knot.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modelling of Elasticity Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for the probabilistic modelling of random fourth order material tensor fields, with a focus on tensors that are physically symmetric and positive definite (SPD), of which the elasticity tensor is a prime example. Given the critical role that spatial symmetries and invariances play in determining material behaviour, it is essential to incorporate these aspects into the probabilistic description and modelling of material properties. In particular, we focus on spatial point symmetries or invariances under rotations, a classical subject in elasticity. Following this, we formulate a stochastic modelling framework using a Lie algebra representation via a memoryless transformation that respects the requirements of positive definiteness and invariance. With this, it is shown how to generate a random ensemble of elasticity tensors that allows an independent control of strength, eigenstrain, and orientation. The procedure also accommodates the requirement to prescribe specific spatial symmetries and invariances for each member of the whole ensemble, while ensuring that the mean or expected value of the ensemble conforms to a potentially 'higher' class of spatial invariance. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that the set of SPD tensors forms a differentiable manifold, which geometrically corresponds to an open cone within the ambient space of symmetric tensors. Thus, we explore the mathematical structure of the underlying sample space of such tensors, and introduce a new distance measure or metric, called the 'elasticity metric', between the tensors.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible duality defects in one, two, and three dimensions via gauging spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially modulated symmetries have emerged since the discovery of fractons, which characterize unconventional topological phases with mobility-constrained quasiparticle excitations. On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones. Our work provides a unified and systematic analytical framework for constructing exotic duality defects by gauging relevant symmetries.</description>

      <title>Limiting Spectral Distribution of a Random Commutator Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of a class of random matrices of the form $S_n^{-} = n^{-1}(X_1 X_2^* - X_2 X_1^*)$ where $X_k = \Sigma^{1/2}Z_k$, for $k=1,2$, $Z_k$'s are independent $p\times n$ complex-valued random matrices, and $\Sigma$ is a $p\times p$ positive semi-definite matrix, independent of the $Z_k$'s. We assume that $Z_k$'s have independent entries with zero mean and unit variance. The skew-symmetric/skew-Hermitian matrix $S_n^{-}$ will be referred to as a random commutator matrix associated with the samples $X_1$ and $X_2$. We show that, when the dimension $p$ and sample size $n$ increase simultaneously, so that $p/n \to c \in (0,\infty)$, there exists a limiting spectral distribution (LSD) for $S_n^{-}$, supported on the imaginary axis, under the assumptions that the spectral distribution of $\Sigma$ converges weakly and the entries of $Z_k$'s have moments of sufficiently high order. This nonrandom LSD can be described through its Stieltjes transform, which satisfies a coupled Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur-type functional equations. In the special case when $\Sigma = I_p$, we show that the LSD of $S_n^{-}$ is a mixture of a degenerate distribution at zero (with positive mass if $c &gt; 2$), and a continuous distribution with a symmetric density function supported on a compact interval on the imaginary axis. Moreover, we show that the companion matrix $S_n^{+} = \Sigma_n^\frac{1}{2}(Z_1Z_2^* + Z_2Z_1^*)\Sigma_n^\frac{1}{2}$, under identical assumptions, has an LSD supported on the real line, which can be similarly characterized.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble particle in one-dimensional potentials: mean first-passage time and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional run-and-tumble particle (RTP), which is a prototypical model for active system, moving within an arbitrary external potential. Using backward Fokker-Planck equations, we derive the differential equation satisfied by its mean first-passage time (MFPT) to an absorbing target, which, without any loss of generality, is placed at the origin. Depending on the shape of the potential, we identify four distinct ``phases'', with a corresponding expression for the MFPT in every case, which we derive explicitly. To illustrate these general expressions, we derive explicit formulae for two specific cases which we study in detail: a double-well potential and a logarithmic potential. We then present different applications of these general formulae to (i) the generalization of the Kramer's escape law for an RTP in the presence of a potential barrier, (ii) the ``trapping'' time of an RTP moving in a harmonic well and (iii) characterizing the efficiency of the optimal search strategy of an RTP subjected to stochastic resetting. Our results reveal that the MFPT of an RTP in an external potential exhibits a far more complex and, at times, counter-intuitive behavior compared to that of a passive particle (e.g., Brownian) in the same potential.</description>

Abstract: We consider a model for the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in rotating spherical coordinates. After establishing global-in-time existence and uniqueness of classical solutions, we turn our attention to the issue of stability of a class of steady zonal solutions (i.e., time-independent solutions that vary only with latitude). By identifying suitable conserved quantities and combining them to construct a Lyapunov function, we prove a stability result.</description>

Abstract: For general large non-Hermitian random matrices $X$ and deterministic normal deformations $A$, we prove that the local eigenvalue statistics of $A+X$ close to the critical edge points of its spectrum are universal. This concludes the proof of the third and last remaining typical universality class for non-Hermitian random matrices, after bulk and sharp edge universalities have been established in recent years.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with weakly nonminimally coupled monopole charge. We analytically and numerically investigate light ray propagation around such a black hole by employing the common Lagrangian formalism. Our analysis encompasses both radial and angular geodesics, for which we present analytical solutions in terms of incomplete Lauricella hypergeometric functions. Additionally, we explore the impact of the coupling constant on geodesic motion. Based on observations from the Event Horizon Telescope, we constrain the black hole parameters, resulting in a coupling constant range of $-0.5 M^2\lesssim \alpha\lesssim 0.5 M^2$. Throughout our analysis, we simulate all possible trajectories and, where necessary, perform numerical inversion of the included integrals.</description>

Abstract: We study the relationship between integrable Landau-Zener (LZ) models and Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations. The latter are originally equations for the correlation functions of two-dimensional conformal field theories, but can also be interpreted as multi-time Schr\"odinger equations. The general LZ problem is to find the probabilities of tunneling from eigenstates at $t=t_\text{in}$ to the eigenstates at $t\to+\infty$ for an $N\times N$ time-dependent Hamiltonian $\hat H(t)$. A number of such problems are exactly solvable in the sense that the tunneling probabilities are elementary functions of Hamiltonian parameters and time-dependent wavefunctions are special functions. It has recently been proposed that exactly solvable LZ models map to KZ equations. Here we use this connection to identify and solve various integrable hyperbolic LZ models $\hat H(t)=\hat A+\hat B/t$ for $N=2, 3$, and $4$, where $\hat A$ and $\hat B$ are time-independent matrices. Some of these models have been considered, though not fully solved, before and others are entirely new.</description>

      <title>Effective (Floquet) Lindblad generators from spectral unwinding</title>

Abstract: A mathematical description of the reduced dynamics of an open quantum system can often be given in terms of a completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) map, also known as quantum channel. In a seminal work by Wolf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 150402 (2008)], it was shown that deciding whether a given quantum channel was generated from an underlying effective Markovian dynamics, with time-independent Lindbladian generator, is generally an NP-hard problem. In this work we show that in cases where one has access to the full reduced dynamics at all previous times (the dynamical map) one can significantly facilitate the search for an effective generator by making use of Floquet theory. By performing a spectral unwinding such that the effective micromotion is minimized, the effective Floquet generator is often an excellent candidate for an effective Lindblad generator, hence significantly reducing the complexity of the search for an effective Lindblad generator in many (though not all) cases. Our results are relevant for engineering Floquet Lindbladians in complex many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Integrability of Conformal Loop Ensemble: Imaginary DOZZ Formula and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.01788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scaling limit of the probability that $n$ points are on the same cluster for 2D critical percolation is believed to be governed by a conformal field theory (CFT). Although this is not fully understood, Delfino and Viti (2010) made a remarkable prediction on the exact value of a properly normalized three-point probability. It is expressed in terms of the imaginary DOZZ formula of Schomerus, Zamolodchikov and Kostov-Petkova, which extends the structure constants of minimal model CFTs to continuous parameters. Later, similar conjectures were made for scaling limits of random cluster models and O$(n)$ loop models, representing certain three-point observables in terms of the imaginary DOZZ formula. Since the scaling limits of these models can be described by the conformal loop ensemble (CLE), such conjectures can be formulated as exact statements on CLE observables. In this paper, we prove Delfino and Viti's conjecture on percolation as well as a conjecture of Ikhlef, Jacobsen and Saleur (2015) on the nesting loop statistics of CLE. Our proof is based on the coupling between CLE and Liouville quantum gravity on the sphere, and is inspired by the fact that after reparametrization, the imaginary DOZZ formula is the reciprocal of the three-point function of Liouville CFT. Recently, Nivesvivat, Jacobsen and Ribault systematically studied a CFT with a large class of CLE observables as its correlation functions, including the ones from these two conjectures. We believe that our framework admits sufficient flexibility to exactly solve the three-point functions for CLE observables with natural geometric interpretations, including those from this CFT. As a demonstration, we solve the case corresponding to three points lying on the same loop, where the answer is a variant of the imaginary DOZZ formula.</description>

Abstract: More then 35 approaches to the Dirac equation derivation are presented. The various physical principles and mathematical methods are used. A review of well-known and not enough known contributions to the problem is given, the unexpected and unconventional derivations are presented as well. Three original approaches to the problem suggested by the author are considered as well. They are (i) the generalization of H. Sallhofer derivation, (ii) the obtaining of the massless Dirac equation from the Maxwell equations in maximally symmetrical form, (iii) the derivation of the Dirac equation with nonzero mass from the relativistic canonical quantum mechanics of the fermion-antifermion spin s=1/2 doublet. Today we are able to demonstrate new features of our derivations given in original papers. In some sense the important role of the Dirac equation in contemporary theoretical physics is demonstrated. A criterion for the usefulness of one or another derivation of the Dirac equation has been established</description>

Abstract: One key aspect of quantum metrology, measurement incompatibility, is evident only through the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters. The symmetric logarithmic derivative Cram\'er-Rao bound (SLDCRB), gives the attainable precision, if the optimal measurements for estimating each individual parameter commute. When the optimal measurements do not commute, the SLDCRB is not necessarily attainable. In this regard, the Holevo Cram\'er-Rao bound (HCRB) plays a fundamental role, providing the ultimate attainable precisions when one allows simultaneous measurements on infinitely many copies of a quantum state. For practical purposes, the Nagaoka Cram\'er-Rao bound (NCRB) is more relevant, applying when restricted to measuring quantum states individually. The interplay between these three bounds dictates how rapidly the ultimate metrological precisions can be approached through collective measurements on finite copies of the probe state. We first consider two parameter estimation and prove that if the HCRB cannot be saturated with a single copy of the probe state, then it cannot be saturated for any finite number of copies of the probe state. With this, we show that it is impossible to saturate the HCRB for several physically motivated problems. For estimating any number of parameters, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the attainability of the SLDCRB with separable measurements. We further prove that if the SLDCRB cannot be reached with a single copy of the probe state, it cannot be reached with collective measurements on any finite number of copies of the probe state. These results together provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the attainability of the SLDCRB for any finite number of copies of the probe state. This solves a significant generalisation of one of the five problems recently highlighted by [P.Horodecki et al, Phys. Rev. X Quantum 3, 010101 (2022)].</description>

      <title>Critical loop models are exactly solvable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional critical loop models, including the $O(n)$ and Potts models, the spectrum is exactly known, as are a few structure constants or ratios thereof. Using numerical conformal bootstrap methods, we study $235$ of the simplest 4-point structure constants. For each structure constant, we find an analytic expression as a product of two factors: 1) a universal function of conformal dimensions, built from Barnes' double Gamma function, and 2) a polynomial function of loop weights, whose degree obeys a simple upper bound. We conjecture that all structure constants are of this form.
  For a few 4-point functions, we build corresponding observables in a lattice loop model. From numerical lattice results, we extract amplitude ratios that depend neither on the lattice size nor on the lattice coupling. These ratios agree with the corresponding ratios of 4-point structure constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting non-equilibrium systems are of great fundamental interest, yet their inherent complexity make then notoriously hard to analyze. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model, which by itself evades solvability, can be solved exactly at any interaction strength in the presence of loss tuned to a rate matching the hopping amplitude. Remarkably, the full solvability of the corresponding Liouvillian, and the integrability of the pertinent effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, survives the addition of disorder and generic boundary conditions. By analyzing the Bethe ansatz solutions we find that even weak interactions change the qualitative features of the system, leading to an intricate dynamical phase diagram featuring non-Hermitian Mott-skin effects, disorder induced localization, highly degenerate exceptional points, and a Bose glass-like phase of fragmented condensates. We discuss realistic implementations of this model with cold atoms.</description>

Abstract: Hebbian learning theory is rooted in Pavlov's Classical Conditioning. While mathematical models of the former have been proposed and studied in the past decades, especially in spin glass theory, only recently it has been numerically shown that it is possible to write neural and synaptic dynamics that mirror Pavlov conditioning mechanisms and also give rise to synaptic weights that correspond to the Hebbian learning rule.
  In this paper, we show that the same dynamics can be derived with equilibrium statistical mechanics tools and basic and motivated modeling assumptions. Then, we show how to study the resulting system of coupled stochastic differential equations assuming the reasonable separation of neural and synaptic timescale. In particular, we analytically demonstrate that this synaptic evolution converges to the Hebbian learning rule in various settings and compute the variance of the stochastic process. Finally, drawing from evidence on pure memory reinforcement during sleep stages, we show how the proposed model can simulate neural networks that undergo sleep-associated memory consolidation processes, thereby proving the compatibility of Pavlovian learning with dreaming mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a purely geometric formulation for two different measures addressed to quantify the entanglement between different parts of a tripartite qubit system. Our approach considers the entanglement-polytope defined by the smallest eigenvalues of the reduced density matrices of the qubit-components. The measures identify global and genuine entanglement, and are respectively associated with the projection and rejection of a given point of the polytope on the corresponding biseparable segments. Solving the so called `inverse problem', we also discuss a way to force the system to behave in a particular form, which opens the possibility of controlling and manipulating entanglement for practical purposes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The survival probability for a periodic non-autonomous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is calculated analytically using two different methods. The first uses an asymptotic approach. We treat the associated Kolmogorov Backward Equation with an absorbing boundary by dividing the domain into an interior region, centered around the origin, and a "boundary layer" near the absorbing boundary. In each region we determine the leading-order analytical solutions, and construct a uniformly valid solution over the entire domain using asymptotic matching. In the second method we examine the integral relationship between the probability density function and the mean first passage time probability density function. These allow us to determine approximate analytical forms for the exit rate. The validity of the solutions derived from both methods is assessed numerically, and we find the asymptotic method to be superior.</description>

      <title>The CFT of SLE loop measures and the Kontsevich--Suhov conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates the study of the conformal field theory of the SLE$_\kappa$ loop measure $\nu$ for $\kappa\in(0,4]$, the range where the loop is almost surely simple. First, we construct two commuting representations $(\mathbf{L}_n,\bar{\mathbf{L}}_n)_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}$ of the Virasoro algebra with central charge $c_\mathrm{M}=1-6(\frac{2}{\sqrt{\kappa}}-\frac{\sqrt{\kappa}}{2})^2\leq1$ as (unbounded) first order differential operators on $L^2(\nu)$. Second, we introduce highest-weight representations and characterise their structure: in particular, we prove the existence of vanishing singular vectors at arbitrary levels on the Kac table. Third, we prove an integration by parts formula for the SLE loop measure, and use it to define the Shapovalov form of the representation, a non degenerate (but \emph{not} positive definite) Hermitian form $\mathcal{Q}$ on $L^2(\nu)$ with a remarkably simple geometric expression. The fact that $\mathcal{Q}$ differs from the $L^2(\nu)$-inner product is a manifestation of non-unitarity. Finally, we write down a spectral resolution of $\mathcal{Q}$ using the joint diagonalisation of $\mathbf{L}_0$ and $\bar{\mathbf{L}}_0$. As an application of these results, we provide the first proof of the uniqueness of restriction measures, as conjectured by Kontsevich and Suhov.
  Our results lay the groundwork for an in-depth study of the CFT of SLE: in forthcoming works, we will define correlation functions on Riemann surfaces, and prove conformal Ward identities, BPZ equations, and conformal bootstrap formulas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for every complex simple Lie algebra, the equations of Schubert divisors on the flag variety give a complete integrable system of the minimal nilpotent orbit. The approach is motivated by the integrable system on Coulomb branch. We give explicit computations of these Hamiltonian functions, using Chevalley basis and a so-called Heisenberg algebra basis. For classical Lie algebras we rediscover the lower order terms of the celebrated Gelfand-Zeitlin system. For exceptional types we computed the number of Hamiltonian functions associated to each vertex of Dynkin diagram. They should be regarded as analogs of Gelfand-Zeitlin functions on exceptional type Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Black hole scattering amplitudes via analytic small-frequency expansion and monodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We utilize three complementary approaches to pinpoint the exact form of scattering amplitudes in Schwarzschild spacetime. First, we solve the Regge-Wheeler equation perturbatively in the small-frequency regime. We use the obtained solutions to determine the monodromy in the near-spatial infinity region, which leads to a specific partial differential equation on the elements of the scattering matrix. As a result, it can be written in terms of the elements of the infinitesimal generator of the monodromy transformation and an integration constant. This constant is further related to the Nekrasov-Shatashvili free energy through the resummation of infinitely many instantons. The quasinormal mode frequencies are also studied in the small-frequency approximation.</description>

      <title>Basics of Multiple Polyexponential Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a set of special functions called multiple polyexponential integrals, defined as iterated integrals of the exponential integral $\text{Ei}(z)$. These functions arise in certain perturbative expansions of the local solutions of second-order ODEs around an irregular singularity. In particular, their recursive definition describes the asymptotic behavior of these local solutions. To complement the study of the multiple polyexponential integrals on the entire complex plane, we relate them with two other sets of special functions - the undressed and dressed multiple polyexponential functions - which are characterized by their Taylor series expansions around the origin.</description>

      <title>The Weakly Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation in Higher Dimensions with Quasi-periodic Initial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, under the exponential/polynomial decay condition in Fourier space, we prove that the nonlinear solution to the quasi-periodic Cauchy problem for the weakly nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in higher dimensions will asymptotically approach the associated linear solution within a specific time scale. The proof is based on a combinatorial analysis method present through diagrams. Our results and methods apply to {\em arbitrary} space dimensions and general power-law nonlinearities of the form $\pm|u|^{2p}u$, where $1\leq p\in\mathbb N$.</description>

      <title>On string functions of the generalized parafermionic theories, mock theta functions, and false theta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kac and Wakimoto introduced the admissible highest weight representations in order to classify all modular invariant representations of the Kac-Moody algebras. Ahn, Chung, and Tye studied the string functions of the admissible highest weight representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and realized them as the characters of the generalized parafermionic theories. These string functions are allowed to have certain positive and negative rational levels, for integer levels they reduce to the well-studied string functions of the integrable highest weight representations of Kac and Peterson. In this paper we demonstrate that the mock modular part of $1/2$-level string functions can be evaluated in terms of Ramanujan's mock theta functions by using recent Hecke-type double-sum formulas of positive discriminant (Mortenson and Zwegers, 2023). We also present elegant mock theta conjecture-like identities and mixed mock modular properties for certain examples of $1/2$-level string functions. In addition, we show that the negative level string functions can be evaluated in terms of false theta functions by using recent Hecke-type double-sum formulas of negative discriminant (Mortenson, 2024).</description>

      <title>Quantum K-Rings of Partial Flag Varieties, Coulomb Branches, and the Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a purely geometric explanation of the coincidence between the Coulomb Branch equations for the 3D GLSM describing the quantum $K$-theory of a flag variety, and the Bethe Ansatz equations of the 5-vertex lattice model. In doing so, we prove an explicit presentation for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving a conjecture of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou. We also give an identification of the ring with the Bethe algebra of the 5-vertex lattice model, which proves that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic. This isomorphism also provides a more explicit description of the quantum tautological bundles that appear in the latter ring.</description>
