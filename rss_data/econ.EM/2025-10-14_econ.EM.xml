      <title>Estimating Variances for Causal Panel Data Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies variance estimators in panel data settings. There has been a recent surge in research on panel data models with a number of new estimators proposed. However, there has been less attention paid to the quantification of the precision of these estimators. Of the variance estimators that have been proposed, their relative merits are not well understood. In this paper we develop a common framework for comparing some of the proposed variance estimators for generic point estimators. We reinterpret three commonly used approaches as targeting different conditional variances under an exchangeability assumption. We find that the estimators we consider are all valid on average, but that their performance in terms of power differs substantially depending on the heteroskedasticity structure of the data. Building on these insights, we propose a new variance estimator that flexibly accounts for heteroskedasticity in both the unit and time dimensions, and delivers superior statistical power in realistic panel data settings.</description>

      <title>L2-relaxation for Economic Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage an ensemble of many regressors, the number of which can exceed the sample size, for economic prediction. An underlying latent factor structure implies a dense regression model with highly correlated covariates. We propose the L2-relaxation method for estimating the regression coefficients and extrapolating the out-of-sample (OOS) outcomes. This framework can be applied to policy evaluation using the panel data approach (PDA), where we further establish inference for the average treatment effect. In addition, we extend the traditional single unit setting in PDA to allow for many treated units with a short post-treatment period. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that our approach exhibits excellent finite sample performance for both OOS prediction and policy evaluation. We illustrate our method with two empirical examples: (i) predicting China's producer price index growth rate and evaluating the effect of real estate regulations, and (ii) estimating the impact of Brexit on the stock returns of British and European companies.</description>

      <title>Optimal break tests for large linear time series models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a class of optimal tests for a structural break occurring at an unknown date in infinite and growing-order time series regression models, such as AR($\infty$), linear regression with increasingly many covariates, and nonparametric regression. Under an auxiliary i.i.d. Gaussian error assumption, we derive an average power optimal test, establishing a growing-dimensional analog of the exponential tests of Andrews and Ploberger (1994) to handle identification failure under the null hypothesis of no break. Relaxing the i.i.d. Gaussian assumption to a more general dependence structure, we establish a functional central limit theorem for the underlying stochastic processes, which features an extra high-order serial dependence term due to the growing dimension. We robustify our test both against this term and finite sample bias and illustrate its excellent performance and practical relevance in a Monte Carlo study and a real data empirical example.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Identification and Estimation of Spatial Treatment Effect Boundaries: Evidence from 42 Million Pollution Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a nonparametric framework for identifying and estimating spatial boundaries of treatment effects in settings with geographic spillovers. While atmospheric dispersion theory predicts exponential decay of pollution under idealized assumptions, these assumptions -- steady winds, homogeneous atmospheres, flat terrain -- are systematically violated in practice. I establish nonparametric identification of spatial boundaries under weak smoothness and monotonicity conditions, propose a kernel-based estimator with data-driven bandwidth selection, and derive asymptotic theory for inference. Using 42 million satellite observations of NO$_2$ concentrations near coal plants (2019-2021), I find that nonparametric kernel regression reduces prediction errors by 1.0 percentage point on average compared to parametric exponential decay assumptions, with largest improvements at policy-relevant distances: 2.8 percentage points at 10 km (near-source impacts) and 3.7 percentage points at 100 km (long-range transport). Parametric methods systematically underestimate near-source concentrations while overestimating long-range decay. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a natural experiment validating the framework's temporal sensitivity: NO$_2$ concentrations dropped 4.6\% in 2020, then recovered 5.7\% in 2021. These results demonstrate that flexible, data-driven spatial methods substantially outperform restrictive parametric assumptions in environmental policy applications.</description>

      <title>Almost Dominance: Inference and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a general framework for inference on three types of almost dominances: almost Lorenz dominance, almost inverse stochastic dominance, and almost stochastic dominance. We first generalize almost Lorenz dominance to almost upward and downward Lorenz dominances. We then provide a bootstrap inference procedure for the Lorenz dominance coefficients, which measure the degrees of almost Lorenz dominance. Furthermore, we propose almost upward and downward inverse stochastic dominances and provide inference on the inverse stochastic dominance coefficients. We also show that our results can easily be extended to almost stochastic dominance. Simulation studies demonstrate the finite sample properties of the proposed estimators and the bootstrap confidence intervals. This framework can be applied to economic analysis, particularly in the areas of social welfare, inequality, and decision making under uncertainty. As an empirical example, we apply the methods to the inequality growth in the United Kingdom and find evidence for almost upward inverse stochastic dominance.</description>

      <title>Finite-Sample Distortion in Kernel Specification Tests: A Perturbation Analysis of Empirical Directional Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a new theoretical lens for understanding the finite-sample performance of kernel-based specification tests, such as the Kernel Conditional Moment (KCM) test. Rather than introducing a fundamentally new test, we isolate and rigorously analyze the finite-sample distortion arising from the discrepancy between the empirical and population eigenspaces of the kernel operator. Using perturbation theory for compact operators, we demonstrate that the estimation error in directional components is governed by local eigengaps: components associated with small eigenvalues are highly unstable and contribute primarily noise rather than signal under fixed alternatives. Although this error vanishes asymptotically under the null, it can substantially degrade power in finite samples. This insight explains why the effective power of omnibus kernel tests is often concentrated in a low-dimensional subspace. We illustrate how truncating unstable high-frequency components--a natural consequence of our analysis--can improve finite-sample performance, but emphasize that the core contribution is the diagnostic understanding of \textit{why} and \textit{when} such instability occurs. The analysis is largely non-asymptotic and applies broadly to reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based inference.</description>

      <title>Interactive, Grouped and Non-separable Fixed Effects: A Practitioner's Guide to the New Panel Data Econometrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The past 20 years have brought fundamental advances in modeling unobserved heterogeneity in panel data. Interactive Fixed Effects (IFE) proved to be a foundational framework, generalizing the standard one-way and two-way fixed effects models by allowing the unit-specific unobserved heterogeneity to be interacted with unobserved time-varying common factors, allowing for more general forms of omitted variables. The IFE framework laid the theoretical foundations for other forms of heterogeneity, such as grouped fixed effects (GFE) and non-separable two-way fixed effects (NSTW). The existence of IFE, GFE or NSTW has significant implications for identification, estimation, and inference, leading to the development of many new estimators for panel data models. This paper provides an accessible review of the new estimation methods and their associated diagnostic tests, and offers a guide to empirical practice. In two separate empirical investigations we demonstrate that there is empirical support for the new forms of fixed effects and that the results can differ significantly from those obtained using traditional fixed effects estimators.</description>

      <title>Utilitarian or Quantile-Welfare Evaluation of Health Policy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers quantile-welfare evaluation of health policy as an alternative to utilitarian evaluation. Manski (1988) originally proposed and studied maximization of quantile utility as a model of individual decision making under uncertainty, juxtaposing it with maximization of expected utility. That paper's primary motivation was to exploit the fact that maximization of quantile utility requires only an ordinal formalization of utility, not a cardinal one. This paper transfers these ideas from analysis of individual decision making to analysis of social planning. We begin by summarizing basic theoretical properties of quantile welfare in general terms rather than related specifically to health policy. We then turn attention to health policy and propose a procedure to nonparametrically bound the quantile welfare of health states using data from binary-choice time-tradeoff (TTO) experiments of the type regularly performed by health economists. After this we assess related econometric considerations concerning measurement, using the EQ-5D framework to structure our discussion.</description>

      <title>The Power of Prognosis: Improving Covariate Balance Tests with Outcome Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scholars frequently use covariate balance tests to test the validity of natural experiments and related designs. Unfortunately, when measured covariates are unrelated to potential outcomes, balance is uninformative about key identification conditions. We show that balance tests can then lead to erroneous conclusions. To build stronger tests, researchers should identify covariates that are jointly predictive of potential outcomes; formally measure and report covariate prognosis; and prioritize the most individually informative variables in tests. Building on prior research on ``prognostic scores," we develop bootstrap balance tests that upweight covariates associated with the outcome. We adapt this approach for regression-discontinuity designs and use simulations to compare weighting methods based on linear regression and more flexible methods, including machine learning. The results show how prognosis weighting can avoid both false negatives and false positives. To illustrate key points, we study empirical examples from a sample of published studies, including an important debate over close elections.</description>
