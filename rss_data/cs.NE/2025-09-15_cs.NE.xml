      <title>Predator-Prey Model: Driven Hunt for Accelerated Grokking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A machine learning method is proposed using two agents that simulate the biological behavior of a predator and a prey. In this method, the predator and the prey interact with each other - the predator chases the prey while the prey runs away from the predator - to perform an optimization on the landscape. This method allows, for the case of a ravine landscape (i.e., a landscape with narrow ravines and with gentle slopes along the ravines) to avoid getting optimization stuck in the ravine. For this, in the optimization over a ravine landscape the predator drives the prey along the ravine. Thus we also call this approach, for the case of ravine landscapes, the driven hunt method. For some examples of grokking (i.e., delayed generalization) problems we show that this method allows for achieving up to a hundred times faster learning compared to the standard learning procedure.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Component Auto-Configuration of Differential Evolution Algorithm for Constrained Optimization: A Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant efforts to manually design high-performance evolutionary algorithms, their adaptability remains limited due to the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of real-world problems. The "no free lunch" theorem highlights that no single algorithm performs optimally across all problems. While online adaptation methods have been proposed, they often suffer from inefficiency, weak convergence, and limited generalization on constrained optimization problems (COPs).
  To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework for automated component configuration in Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to address COPs, powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Specifically, we propose SuperDE, a foundation model that dynamically configures DE's evolutionary components based on real-time evolution. Trained offline through meta-learning across a wide variety of COPs, SuperDE is capable of recommending optimal per-generation configurations for unseen problems in a zero-shot manner. Utilizing a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN), SuperDE adapts its configuration strategies in response to the evolving population states during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that SuperDE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark test suites, achieving superior generalization and optimization performance.</description>

      <title>Application of Machine Learning for Correcting Defect-induced Neuromorphic Circuit Inference Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to correct inference errors caused by stuck-at faults in fully analog ReRAM-based neuromorphic circuits. Using a Design-Technology Co-Optimization (DTCO) simulation framework, we model and analyze six spatial defect types-circular, circular-complement, ring, row, column, and checkerboard-across multiple layers of a multi-array neuromorphic architecture. We demonstrate that the proposed correction method, which employs a lightweight neural network trained on the circuit's output voltages, can recover up to 35% (from 55% to 90%) inference accuracy loss in defective scenarios. Our results, based on handwritten digit recognition tasks, show that even small corrective networks can significantly improve circuit robustness. This method offers a scalable and energy-efficient path toward enhanced yield and reliability for neuromorphic systems in edge and internet-of-things (IoTs) applications. In addition to correcting the specific defect types used during training, our method also demonstrates the ability to generalize-achieving reasonable accuracy when tested on different types of defects not seen during training. The framework can be readily extended to support real-time adaptive learning, enabling on-chip correction for dynamic or aging-induced fault profiles.</description>

      <title>Time to Play: Simulating Early-Life Animal Dynamics Enhances Robotics Locomotion Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developmental changes in body morphology profoundly shape locomotion in animals, yet artificial agents and robots are typically trained under static physical parameters. Inspired by ontogenetic scaling of muscle power in biology, we propose Scaling Mechanical Output over Lifetime (SMOL), a novel curriculum that dynamically modulates robot actuator strength to mimic natural variations in power-to-weight ratio during growth and ageing. Integrating SMOL into the MAP-Elites quality-diversity framework, we vary the torque in standard robotics tasks to mimic the evolution of strength in animals as they grow up and as their body changes. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that the SMOL schedule consistently elevates both performance and diversity of locomotion behaviours across varied control scenarios, by allowing agents to leverage advantageous physics early on to discover skills that act as stepping stones when they reach their final standard body properties. Based on studies of the total power output in humans, we also implement the SMOL-Human schedule that models isometric body variations due to non-linear changes like puberty, and study its impact on robotics locomotion.</description>

      <title>Visual Evolutionary Optimization on Graph-Structured Combinatorial Problems with MLLMs: A Case Study of Influence Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06850v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-structured combinatorial problems in complex networks are prevalent in many domains, and are computationally demanding due to their complexity and non-linear nature. Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs), while robust, often face obstacles due to content-shallow encoding limitations and lack of structural awareness, necessitating hand-crafted modifications for effective application. In this work, we introduce an original framework, visual evolutionary optimization (VEO), leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as the backbone evolutionary optimizer in this context. Specifically, we propose a context-aware encoding scheme, representing the solution of the network as an image. In this manner, we can utilize MLLMs' image processing capabilities to intuitively comprehend network configurations, thus enabling machines to solve these problems in a human-like way. We develop MLLM-based operators tailored for various evolutionary optimization stages, including initialization, crossover, and mutation. Furthermore, we propose that graph sparsification can effectively enhance the applicability and scalability of VEO on large-scale networks, owing to the scale-free nature of real-world networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a well-known task in complex networks, influence maximization, and validate it on eight different real-world networks of various structures. The results confirm VEO's reliability and enhanced effectiveness compared to traditional evolutionary optimization.</description>

      <title>REMS: a unified solution representation, problem modeling and metaheuristic algorithm design for general combinatorial optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) with discrete variables and finite search space are critical across numerous fields, and solving them in metaheuristic algorithms is popular. However, addressing a specific COP typically requires developing a tailored and handcrafted algorithm. Even minor adjustments, such as constraint changes, may necessitate algorithm redevelopment. Therefore, establishing a framework for formulating diverse COPs into a unified paradigm and designing reusable metaheuristic algorithms is valuable. A COP can be typically viewed as the process of giving resources to perform specific tasks, subjecting to given constraints. Motivated by this, a resource-centered modeling and solving framework (REMS) is introduced for the first time. We first extract and define resources and tasks from a COP. Subsequently, given predetermined resources, the solution structure is unified as assigning tasks to resources, from which variables, objectives, and constraints can be derived and a problem model is constructed. To solve the modeled COPs, several fundamental operators are designed based on the unified solution structure, including the initial solution, neighborhood structure, destruction and repair, crossover, and ranking. These operators enable the development of various metaheuristic algorithms. Specially, 4 single-point-based algorithms and 1 population-based algorithm are configured herein. Experiments on 10 COPs, covering routing, location, loading, assignment, scheduling, and graph coloring problems, show that REMS can model these COPs within the unified paradigm and effectively solve them with the designed metaheuristic algorithms. Furthermore, REMS is more competitive than GUROBI and SCIP in tackling large-scale instances and complex COPs, and outperforms OR-TOOLS on several challenging COPs.</description>

      <title>Plastic Arbor: a modern simulation framework for synaptic plasticity -- from single synapses to networks of morphological neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arbor is a software library designed for efficient simulation of large-scale networks of biological neurons with detailed morphological structures. It combines customizable neuronal and synaptic mechanisms with high-performance computing, supporting multi-core CPU and GPU systems. In humans and other animals, synaptic plasticity processes play a vital role in cognitive functions, including learning and memory. Recent studies have shown that intracellular molecular processes in dendrites significantly influence single-neuron dynamics. However, for understanding how the complex interplay between dendrites and synaptic processes influences network dynamics, computational modeling is required.
  To enable the modeling of large-scale networks of morphologically detailed neurons with diverse plasticity processes, we have extended the Arbor library to support simulations of a large variety of spike-driven plasticity paradigms. To showcase the features of the extended framework, we present examples of computational models, beginning with single-synapse dynamics, progressing to multi-synapse rules, and finally scaling up to large recurrent networks. While cross-validating our implementations by comparison with other simulators, we show that Arbor allows simulating plastic networks of multi-compartment neurons at nearly no additional cost in runtime compared to point-neuron simulations. In addition, we demonstrate that Arbor is highly efficient in terms of runtime and memory use as compared to other simulators. Using the extended framework, as an example, we investigate the impact of dendritic structures on network dynamics across a timescale of several hours, finding a relation between the length of dendritic trees and the ability of the network to efficiently store information. By our extension of Arbor, we aim to provide a valuable tool that will support future studies on the impact of synaptic plasticity, especially, in conjunction with neuronal morphology, in large networks.</description>

      <title>Simplified derivations for high-dimensional convex learning problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01110v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical-physics calculations in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience often involve lengthy derivations that obscure physical interpretation. Here, we give concise, non-replica derivations of several key results and highlight their underlying similarities. In particular, using a cavity approach, we analyze three high-dimensional learning problems: perceptron classification of points, perceptron classification of manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure--a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables--enabling a unified analysis. Furthermore, for perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a naive method.</description>

      <title>Fast Fourier Transform-Based Spectral and Temporal Gradient Filtering for Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as a key framework for protecting sensitive data in machine learning, but standard DP-SGD often suffers from significant accuracy loss due to injected noise. To address this limitation, we introduce the FFT-Enhanced Kalman Filter (FFTKF), a differentially private optimization method that improves gradient quality while preserving $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP guarantees. FFTKF applies frequency-domain filtering to shift privacy noise into less informative high-frequency components, preserving the low-frequency gradient signals that carry most learning information. A scalar-gain Kalman filter with a finite-difference Hessian approximation further refines the denoised gradients. The method has per-iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(d \log d)$ and achieves higher test accuracy than DP-SGD and DiSK on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with CNNs, Wide ResNets, and Vision Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that FFTKF ensures equivalent privacy while delivering a stronger privacy--utility trade-off through reduced variance and controlled bias.</description>
