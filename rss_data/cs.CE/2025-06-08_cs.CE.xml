      <title>Applying Informer for Option Pricing: A Transformer-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate option pricing is essential for effective trading and risk management in financial markets, yet it remains challenging due to market volatility and the limitations of traditional models like Black-Scholes. In this paper, we investigate the application of the Informer neural network for option pricing, leveraging its ability to capture long-term dependencies and dynamically adjust to market fluctuations. This research contributes to the field of financial forecasting by introducing Informer's efficient architecture to enhance prediction accuracy and provide a more adaptable and resilient framework compared to existing methods. Our results demonstrate that Informer outperforms traditional approaches in option pricing, advancing the capabilities of data-driven financial forecasting in this domain.</description>

      <title>MTPNet: Multi-Grained Target Perception for Unified Activity Cliff Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Activity cliff prediction is a critical task in drug discovery and material design. Existing computational methods are limited to handling single binding targets, which restricts the applicability of these prediction models. In this paper, we present the Multi-Grained Target Perception network (MTPNet) to incorporate the prior knowledge of interactions between the molecules and their target proteins. Specifically, MTPNet is a unified framework for activity cliff prediction, which consists of two components: Macro-level Target Semantic (MTS) guidance and Micro-level Pocket Semantic (MPS) guidance. By this way, MTPNet dynamically optimizes molecular representations through multi-grained protein semantic conditions. To our knowledge, it is the first time to employ the receptor proteins as guiding information to effectively capture critical interaction details. Extensive experiments on 30 representative activity cliff datasets demonstrate that MTPNet significantly outperforms previous approaches, achieving an average RMSE improvement of 18.95% on top of several mainstream GNN architectures. Overall, MTPNet internalizes interaction patterns through conditional deep learning to achieve unified predictions of activity cliffs, helping to accelerate compound optimization and design.

      <title>A Neural Network Model of Spatial and Feature-Based Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual attention is a mechanism closely intertwined with vision and memory. Top-down information influences visual processing through attention. We designed a neural network model inspired by aspects of human visual attention. This model consists of two networks: one serves as a basic processor performing a simple task, while the other processes contextual information and guides the first network through attention to adapt to more complex tasks. After training the model and visualizing the learned attention response, we discovered that the model's emergent attention patterns corresponded to spatial and feature-based attention. This similarity between human visual attention and attention in computer vision suggests a promising direction for studying human cognition using neural network models.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Stabilization Protocol for Cross-Chain Digital Assets Using Adaptor Signatures and AI-Driven Arbitrage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stablecoins face an unresolved trilemma of balancing decentralization, stability, and regulatory compliance. We present a hybrid stabilization protocol that combines crypto-collateralized reserves, algorithmic futures contracts, and cross-chain liquidity pools to achieve robust price adherence while preserving user privacy. At its core, the protocol introduces stabilization futures contracts (SFCs), non-collateralized derivatives that programmatically incentivize third-party arbitrageurs to counteract price deviations via adaptor signature atomic swaps. Autonomous AI agents optimize delta hedging across decentralized exchanges (DEXs), while zkSNARKs prove compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations without exposing identities or transaction details. Our cryptographic design reduces cross-chain liquidity concentration (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index: 2,400 vs. 4,900 in single-chain systems) and ensures atomicity under standard cryptographic assumptions. The protocol's layered architecture encompassing incentive-compatible SFCs, AI-driven market making, and zero-knowledge regulatory proofs. It provides a blueprint for next-generation decentralized financial infrastructure.</description>

      <title>FlowOE: Imitation Learning with Flow Policy from Ensemble RL Experts for Optimal Execution under Heston Volatility and Concave Market Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal execution in financial markets refers to the process of strategically transacting a large volume of assets over a period to achieve the best possible outcome by balancing the trade-off between market impact costs and timing or volatility risks. Traditional optimal execution strategies, such as static Almgren-Chriss models, often prove suboptimal in dynamic financial markets. This paper propose flowOE, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow matching models, to address these limitations. FlowOE learns from a diverse set of expert traditional strategies and adaptively selects the most suitable expert behavior for prevailing market conditions. A key innovation is the incorporation of a refining loss function during the imitation process, enabling flowOE not only to mimic but also to improve upon the learned expert actions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply flow matching models in a stochastic optimal execution problem. Empirical evaluations across various market conditions demonstrate that flowOE significantly outperforms both the specifically calibrated expert models and other traditional benchmarks, achieving higher profits with reduced risk. These results underscore the practical applicability and potential of flowOE to enhance adaptive optimal execution.</description>

      <title>EqCollide: Equivariant and Collision-Aware Deformable Objects Neural Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating collisions of deformable objects is a fundamental yet challenging task due to the complexity of modeling solid mechanics and multi-body interactions. Existing data-driven methods often suffer from lack of equivariance to physical symmetries, inadequate handling of collisions, and limited scalability. Here we introduce EqCollide, the first end-to-end equivariant neural fields simulator for deformable objects and their collisions. We propose an equivariant encoder to map object geometry and velocity into latent control points. A subsequent equivariant Graph Neural Network-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equation models the interactions among control points via collision-aware message passing. To reconstruct velocity fields, we query a neural field conditioned on control point features, enabling continuous and resolution-independent motion predictions. Experimental results show that EqCollide achieves accurate, stable, and scalable simulations across diverse object configurations, and our model achieves 24.34% to 35.82% lower rollout MSE even compared with the best-performing baseline model. Furthermore, our model could generalize to more colliding objects and extended temporal horizons, and stay robust to input transformed with group action.</description>

      <title>FinanceReasoning: Benchmarking Financial Numerical Reasoning More Credible, Comprehensive and Challenging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce FinanceReasoning, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs) in financial numerical reasoning problems. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work provides three key advancements. (1) Credibility: We update 15.6% of the questions from four public datasets, annotating 908 new questions with detailed Python solutions and rigorously refining evaluation standards. This enables an accurate assessment of the reasoning improvements of LRMs. (2) Comprehensiveness: FinanceReasoning covers 67.8% of financial concepts and formulas, significantly surpassing existing datasets. Additionally, we construct 3,133 Python-formatted functions, which enhances LRMs' financial reasoning capabilities through refined knowledge (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 91.6% for GPT-4o). (3) Challenge: Models are required to apply multiple financial formulas for precise numerical reasoning on 238 Hard problems. The best-performing model (i.e., OpenAI o1 with PoT) achieves 89.1% accuracy, yet LRMs still face challenges in numerical precision. We demonstrate that combining Reasoner and Programmer models can effectively enhance LRMs' performance (e.g., 83.2% $\rightarrow$ 87.8% for DeepSeek-R1). Our work paves the way for future research on evaluating and improving LRMs in domain-specific complex reasoning tasks.</description>

      <title>Design Tasks and Their Complexity for the European Train Control System with Hybrid Train Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02572v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Railway networks have become increasingly important in recent times, especially in moving freight and public transportation from road traffic and planes to more environmentally friendly trains. Since expanding the global railway network is time- and resource-consuming, maximizing the rail capacity of the existing infrastructure is desirable. However, simply running more trains is infeasible as certain constraints enforced by the train control system must be satisfied. The capacity of a network depends (amongst others) on the distance between trains allowed by this safety system. While most signaling systems rely on fixed blocks defined by costly hardware, new specifications provided by Level 2 with Hybrid Train Detection of the European Train Control System (ETCS L2 HTD), formerly known as ETCS Hybrid Level 3, allow the usage of virtual subsections. This additional degree of freedom allows for shorter train following times and, thus, more trains on existing railway tracks. On the other hand, new design tasks arise on which automated methods might be helpful for designers of modern railway networks. However, although first approaches exist that solve design problems arising within ETCS L2 HTD, neither formal descriptions nor results on the computational complexity of the corresponding design tasks exist. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a formal description of design tasks for ETCS L2 HTD and proof that these tasks are NP-complete or NP-hard, respectively. By that, we are providing a solid basis for the future development of methods to solve those tasks, which will be integrated into the Munich Train Control Toolkit available open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/cda-tum/mtct.</description>

      <title>Accurate and efficient predictions of keyhole dynamics in laser materials processing using machine learning-aided simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The keyhole phenomenon has been widely observed in laser materials processing, including laser welding, remelting, cladding, drilling, and additive manufacturing. Keyhole-induced defects, primarily pores, dramatically affect the performance of final products, impeding the broad use of these laser-based technologies. The formation of these pores is typically associated with the dynamic behavior of the keyhole. So far, the accurate characterization and prediction of keyhole features, particularly keyhole depth, as a function of time, has been a challenging task. In situ characterization of keyhole dynamic behavior using the synchrotron X-ray technique is informative but complicated and expensive. Current simulations are generally hindered by their poor accuracy and generalization abilities in predicting keyhole depths due to the lack of accurate laser absorptance data. In this study, we develop a machine learning-aided simulation method that accurately predicts keyhole dynamics, especially in keyhole depth fluctuations, over a wide range of processing parameters. In two case studies involving titanium and aluminum alloys, we achieve keyhole depth prediction with a mean absolute percentage error of 10%, surpassing those simulated using the ray-tracing method with an error margin of 30%, while also reducing computational time. This exceptional fidelity and efficiency empower our model to serve as a cost-effective alternative to synchrotron experiments. Our machine learning-aided simulation method is affordable and readily deployable for a large variety of materials, opening new doors to eliminate or reduce defects for a wide range of laser materials processing techniques.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Financial Equity Research Reports -- Identification of the Most Frequently Asked Questions in Financial Analyst Reports to Automate Equity Research Using Llama 3 and GPT-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research dissects financial equity research reports (ERRs) by mapping their content into categories. There is insufficient empirical analysis of the questions answered in ERRs. In particular, it is not understood how frequently certain information appears, what information is considered essential, and what information requires human judgment to distill into an ERR. The study analyzes 72 ERRs sentence-by-sentence, classifying their 4940 sentences into 169 unique question archetypes. We did not predefine the questions but derived them solely from the statements in the ERRs. This approach provides an unbiased view of the content of the observed ERRs. Subsequently, we used public corporate reports to classify the questions' potential for automation. Answers were labeled "text-extractable" if the answers to the question were accessible in corporate reports. 78.7% of the questions in ERRs can be automated. Those automatable question consist of 48.2% text-extractable (suited to processing by large language models, LLMs) and 30.5% database-extractable questions. Only 21.3% of questions require human judgment to answer. We empirically validate using Llama-3-70B and GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09 that recent advances in language generation and information extraction enable the automation of approximately 80% of the statements in ERRs. Surprisingly, the models complement each other's strengths and weaknesses well. The research confirms that the current writing process of ERRs can likely benefit from additional automation, improving quality and efficiency. The research thus allows us to quantify the potential impacts of introducing large language models in the ERR writing process. The full question list, including the archetypes and their frequency, will be made available online after peer review.</description>

      <title>Risk and Reward of Transitioning from a National to a Zonal Electricity Market in Great Britain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: More spatially granular electricity wholesale markets promise more efficient operation and better asset siting in highly renewable power systems. Great Britain is considering moving from its current single-price national wholesale market to a zonal design. Existing studies reach varying and difficult-to-reconcile conclusions about the desirability of a zonal market in GB, partly because they rely on models that vary in their transparency and assumptions about future power systems. Using a novel open-source electricity market model, calibrated to match observed network behaviour, this article quantifies consumer savings, unit-level producer surplus impacts, and broader socioeconomic benefits that would have arisen had a six-zone market operated in Great Britain during 2022-2024. In the absence of mitigating policies, it is estimated that during those three years GB consumers would save approximately {\pounds}9.4/MWh (equalling an average of more than {\pounds}2.3B per year), but generators in northern regions would experience revenue reductions of 30-40\%. Policy interventions can restore these units' national market revenues to up to 97\% while still preserving around {\pounds}3.1/MWh in consumer savings (about {\pounds}750M per year). It is further estimated that the current system could achieve approximately {\pounds}380-{\pounds}770 million in annual welfare gain during 2022-2024 through improved operational efficiency alone. The drivers behind these benefits, notably wind curtailment volumes, are expected to become more pronounced towards 2030, suggesting that purely operationally achieved annual benefits of around {\pounds}1-2 billion beyond 2029 are likely. It is found that the scale of these benefits would outweigh the potential downsides related to increases in the cost of capital that have been estimated elsewhere.</description>
