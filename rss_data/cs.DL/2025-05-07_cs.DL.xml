      <title>The Shift Towards Preprints in AI Policy Research: A Comparative Study of Preprint Trends in the U.S., Europe, and South Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of open science has quickly changed how artificial intelligence (AI) policy research is distributed globally. This study examines the regional trends in the citation of preprints, specifically focusing on the impact of two major disruptive events: the COVID-19 pandemic and the release of ChatGPT, on research dissemination patterns in the United States, Europe, and South Korea from 2015 to 2024. Using bibliometrics data from the Web of Science, this study tracks how global disruptive events influenced the adoption of preprints in AI policy research and how such shifts vary by region. By marking the timing of these disruptive events, the analysis reveals that while all regions experienced growth in preprint citations, the magnitude and trajectory of change varied significantly. The United States exhibited sharp, event-driven increases; Europe demonstrated institutional growth; and South Korea maintained consistent, linear growth in preprint adoption. These findings suggest that global disruptions may have accelerated preprint adoption, but the extent and trajectory are shaped by local research cultures, policy environments, and levels of open science maturity. This paper emphasizes the need for future AI governance strategies to consider regional variability in research dissemination and highlights opportunities for further longitudinal and comparative research to deepen our understanding of open-access adoption in AI policy development.</description>

      <title>Integrating Large Citation Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores methods for building a comprehensive citation graph using big data techniques to evaluate scientific impact more accurately. Traditional citation metrics have limitations, and this work investigates merging large citation datasets to create a more accurate picture. Challenges of big data, like inconsistent data formats and lack of unique identifiers, are addressed through deduplication efforts, resulting in a streamlined and reliable merged dataset with over 119 million records and 1.4 billion citations. We demonstrate that merging large citation datasets builds a more accurate citation graph facilitating a more robust evaluation of scientific impact.</description>

      <title>A Computational Analysis and Visualization of In-Text Reference Networks Across Philosophical Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We applied computational methods to analyze references across 2,245 philosophical texts, spanning from approximately 550 BCE to 1940 AD, in order to measure patterns in how philosophical ideas have spread over time. Using natural language processing and network analysis, we mapped over 294,970 references between authors, classifying each reference into subdisciplines of philosophy based on its surrounding context. We then constructed a graph, with authors as nodes and textual references as edges, to empirically validate, visualize, and quantify intellectual lineages as they are understood within philosophical scholarship. For instance, we find that Plato and Aristotle alone account for nearly 10% of all references from authors in our dataset, suggesting that their influence may still be underestimated. As another example, we support the view that St. Thomas Aquinas served as a synthesizer between Aristotelian and Christian philosophy by analyzing the network structures of Aquinas, Aristotle, and Christian theologians. Our results are presented through an interactive visualization tool, allowing users to dynamically explore these networks, alongside a mathematical analysis of the network's structure. Our methodology demonstrates the value of applying network analysis with textual references to study a large collection of historical works.</description>
