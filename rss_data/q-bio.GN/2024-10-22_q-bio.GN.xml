      <title>DNA Language Model and Interpretable Graph Neural Network Identify Genes and Pathways Involved in Rare Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identification of causal genes and pathways is a critical step for understanding the genetic underpinnings of rare diseases. We propose novel approaches to gene prioritization and pathway identification using DNA language model, graph neural networks, and genetic algorithm. Using HyenaDNA, a long-range genomic foundation model, we generated dynamic gene embeddings that reflect changes caused by deleterious variants. These gene embeddings were then utilized to identify candidate genes and pathways. We validated our method on a cohort of rare disease patients with partially known genetic diagnosis, demonstrating the re-identification of known causal genes and pathways and the detection of novel candidates. These findings have implications for the prevention and treatment of rare diseases by enabling targeted identification of new drug targets and therapeutic pathways.</description>

      <title>Embed-Search-Align: DNA Sequence Alignment using Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11087v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA sequence alignment involves assigning short DNA reads to the most probable locations on an extensive reference genome. This process is crucial for various genomic analyses, including variant calling, transcriptomics, and epigenomics. Conventional methods, refined over decades, tackle this challenge in 2 steps: genome indexing followed by efficient search to locate likely positions for given reads. Building on the success of Large Language Models in encoding text into embeddings, where the distance metric captures semantic similarity, recent efforts have explored whether the same Transformer architecture can produce embeddings for DNA sequences. Such models have shown early promise in classifying short DNA sequences, such as detecting coding/non-coding regions, and enhancer, promoter sequences. However, performance at sequence classification tasks does not translate to sequence alignment, where it is necessary to search across the genome to align each read, a significantly longer-range task. We bridge this gap by framing the Sequence Alignment task for Transformer models as an "Embed-Search-Align" task. In this framework, a novel Reference-Free DNA Embedding model generates embeddings of reads and reference fragments, which are projected into a shared vector space where the read-fragment distance is used as a surrogate for alignment. Technical contributions include: (1) Contrastive loss for self-supervised training of DNA sequence representations, facilitating rich reference-free, sequence-level embeddings, and (2) a DNA vector store to enable search across fragments on a global scale. DNA-ESA is 99% accurate when aligning 250-length reads onto a human genome (3gb), rivaling conventional methods such as Bowtie and BWA-Mem. DNA-ESA exceeds the performance of 6 Transformer model baselines such as Nucleotide Transformer, Hyena-DNA, and shows task transfer across chromosomes and species.</description>
