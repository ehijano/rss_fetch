      <title>Stokes' phenomenon in continuous limits of discrete Painlev\'{e} I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use exponential asymptotic analysis to identify the relevance of Stokes' phenomenon to integrability in discrete systems. We study Stokes' phenomenon in two discrete problems with the same (leading-order) continuous limit, a finite-difference discretisation of the first continuous Painlev\'{e} equation and the first discrete Painlev\'{e} equation, as well as a family of differential equation associated with each discrete problem. This analysis reveals two important observations. Firstly, the orderly behaviour that characterises Stokes' phenomenon in discrete equations emerges naturally from corresponding continuous differential equations as the order of the latter increases, although this is not apparent at low orders. Secondly, Stokes' phenomenon vanishes in the continuum limit of the integrable discrete equation, but not the non-integrable discrete equation. This means that subdominant exponentials do not appear in the integrable equation, and therefore do not cause moveable singularities to form in the solution. The results are clarified further by consideration of one-parameter family of difference equations that interpolates between the two considered in detail.</description>

      <title>Reducing of system of partial differential equations and generalized symmetry of ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry reductions of systems of two nonlinear partial differential equations are studied. We find ansatzes reducing system of partial differential equations to system of ordinary differential equations. The method is applied to system related to Korteweg -- de Vries (KdV) equation, and reaction-diffusion equations. We have also shown the possibility of constructing solution to system of non-evolutionary equations, which contains one or two arbitrary functions.</description>

      <title>Non-Integrability of the Sasano System of Type $D_5^{(1)}$ and Stokes Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2006, Y. Sasano proposed higher-order Painlev\'e systems, which admit affine Weyl group symmetry of type $D^{(1)}_l$, $l=4, 5, 6, \dots$. In this paper, we study the integrability of a four-dimensional Painlev\'e system, which has symmetry under the extended affine Weyl group $\widetilde{W}\bigl(D^{(1)}_5\bigr)$ and which we call the Sasano system of type $D^{(1)}_5$. We prove that one family of the Sasano system of type $D^{(1)}_5$ is not integrable by rational first integrals. We describe Stokes phenomena relative to a subsystem of the second normal variational equations. This approach allows us to compute in an explicit way the corresponding differential Galois group and therefore to determine whether the connected component of its unit element is not Abelian. Applying the Morales-Ramis-Sim\'o theory, we establish a non-integrable result.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of McMillan mappings I. McMillan multipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider two dynamical systems: the McMillan sextupole and octupole integrable mappings, originally proposed by Edwin McMillan. Both represent the simplest symmetric McMillan maps, characterized by a single intrinsic parameter. While these systems find numerous applications across various domains of mathematics and physics, some of their dynamical properties remain unexplored. We aim to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive description of all stable trajectories, including the parametrization of invariant curves, Poincar\'e rotation numbers, and canonical action-angle variables.
  In the second part, we establish connections between these maps and general chaotic maps in standard form. Our investigation reveals that the McMillan sextupole and octupole serve as first-order approximations of the dynamics around the fixed point, akin to the linear map and quadratic invariant (known as the Courant-Snyder invariant in accelerator physics), which represents zeroth-order approximations (referred to as linearization). Furthermore, we propose a novel formalism for nonlinear Twiss parameters, which accounts for the dependence of rotation number on amplitude. This stands in contrast to conventional betatron phase advance used in accelerator physics, which remains independent of amplitude. Notably, in the context of accelerator physics, this new formalism demonstrates its capability in predicting dynamical aperture around low-order resonances for flat beams, a critical aspect in beam injection/extraction scenarios.</description>

      <title>Mixed radix numeration bases: Horner's rule, Yang-Baxter equation and Furstenberg's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed radix bases in numeration is a very old notion but it is rarely studied on its own or in relation with concrete problems related to number theory. Starting from the natural question of the conversion of a basis to another for integers as well as polynomials, we use mixed radix bases to introduce two-dimensional arrays with suitable filling rules. These arrays provide algorithms of conversion which uses only a finite number of euclidean division to convert from one basis to another; it is interesting to note that these algorithms are generalizations of the well-known Horner's rule of quick evaluation of polynomials. The two-dimensional arrays with local transformations are reminiscent from statistical mechanics models: we show that changes between three numeration basis are related to the set-theoretical Yang-Baxter equation and this is, up to our knowledge, the first time that such a structure is described in number theory. As an illustration, we reinterpret well-known results around Furstenberg's conjecture in terms of Yang-Baxter transformations between mixed radix bases, hence opening the way to alternative approaches.</description>
