      <title>Readout Optimization of Multi-Amplifier Sensing Charge-Coupled Devices for Single-Quantum Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-destructive readout capability of the Skipper Charge Coupled Device (CCD) has been demonstrated to reduce the noise limitation of conventional silicon devices to levels that allow single-photon or single-electron counting. The noise reduction is achieved by taking multiple measurements of the charge in each pixel. These multiple measurements come at the cost of extra readout time, which has been a limitation for the broader adoption of this technology in particle physics, quantum imaging, and astronomy applications. This work presents recent results of a novel sensor architecture that uses multiple non-destructive floating-gate amplifiers in series to achieve sub-electron readout noise in a thick, fully-depleted silicon detector to overcome the readout time overhead of the Skipper-CCD. This sensor is called the Multiple-Amplifier Sensing Charge-Coupled Device (MAS-CCD) can perform multiple independent charge measurements with each amplifier, and the measurements from multiple amplifiers can be combined to further reduce the readout noise. We will show results obtained for sensors with 8 and 16 amplifiers per readout stage in new readout operations modes to optimize its readout speed. The noise reduction capability of the new techniques will be demonstrated in terms of its ability to reduce the noise by combining the information from the different amplifiers, and to resolve signals in the order of a single photon per pixel. The first readout operation explored here avoids the extra readout time needed in the MAS-CCD to read a line of the sensor associated with the extra extent of the serial register. The second technique explore the capability of the MAS-CCD device to perform a region of interest readout increasing the number of multiple samples per amplifier in a targeted region of the active area of the device.</description>

      <title>Image Pre-Processing Framework for Time-Domain Astronomy in the Artificial Intelligence Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of image analysis methods in time-domain astronomy, particularly those leveraging AI algorithms, has highlighted efficient image pre-processing as a critical bottleneck affecting algorithm performance. Image pre-processing, which involves standardizing images for training or deployment of various AI algorithms, encompasses essential steps such as image quality evaluation, alignment, stacking, background extraction, gray-scale transformation, cropping, source detection, astrometry, and photometry. Historically, these algorithms were developed independently by different research groups, primarily based on CPU architecture for small-scale data processing. This paper introduces a novel framework for image pre-processing that integrates key algorithms specifically modified for GPU architecture, enabling large-scale image pre-processing for different algorithms. To prepare for the new algorithm design paradigm in the AI era, we have implemented two operational modes in the framework for different application scenarios: Eager mode and Pipeline mode. The Eager mode facilitates real-time feedback and flexible adjustments, which could be used for parameter tuning and algorithm development. The pipeline mode is primarily designed for large scale data processing, which could be used for training or deploying of artificial intelligence models. We have tested the performance of our framework using simulated and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances image pre-processing speed while maintaining accuracy levels comparable to CPU based algorithms. To promote accessibility and ease of use, a Docker version of our framework is available for download in the PaperData Repository powered by China-VO, compatible with various AI algorithms developed for time-domain astronomy research.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the celestial phenomena in the hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray band(20 keV--1 MeV) is very intriguing but also very difficult to be performed with the needed sensitivity. In this review I will discuss the astrophysical importance of the soft gamma-ray astronomy, its difficulties to solve its issues with the current instrumentation, and a possible solution achievable using focusing Laue lens. Concerning these instruments, I will discuss their functioning principle, how to achieve a high reflection efficiency, their imaging properties, the current feasibility studies, the technological developments and observation prospects.</description>

      <title>The X-ray Integral Field Unit at the end of the Athena reformulation phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Athena mission entered a redefinition phase in July 2022, driven by the imperative to reduce the mission cost at completion for the European Space Agency below an acceptable target, while maintaining the flagship nature of its science return. This notably called for a complete redesign of the X-ray Integral Field Unit (X-IFU) cryogenic architecture towards a simpler active cooling chain. Passive cooling via successive radiative panels at spacecraft level is now used to provide a 50 K thermal environment to an X-IFU owned cryostat. 4.5 K cooling is achieved via a single remote active cryocooler unit, while a multi-stage Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerator ensures heat lift down to the 50 mK required by the detectors. Amidst these changes, the core concept of the readout chain remains robust, employing Transition Edge Sensor microcalorimeters and a SQUID-based Time-Division Multiplexing scheme. Noteworthy is the introduction of a slower pixel. This enables an increase in the multiplexing factor (from 34 to 48) without compromising the instrument energy resolution, hence keeping significant system margins to the new 4 eV resolution requirement. This allows reducing the number of channels by more than a factor two, and thus the resource demands on the system, while keeping a 4' field of view (compared to 5' before). In this article, we will give an overview of this new architecture, before detailing its anticipated performances. Finally, we will present the new X-IFU schedule, with its short term focus on demonstration activities towards a mission adoption in early 2027.</description>

      <title>Observable-based reformulation of time-delay interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spaceborne gravitational-wave observatories utilize a post-processing technique known as time-delay interferometry (TDI) to reduce the otherwise overwhelming laser frequency noise by around eight orders of magnitude. While, in its traditional form, TDI considers the spacecraft as point masses, recent studies have enhanced this simplified scenario by incorporating more realistic metrology chain models, which include onboard optical, electronic, and digital delays. These studies have updated the TDI algorithm to include onboard delays obtained from pre-launch and in-flight calibrations. Conversely, the processing scheme presented in this article naturally treats onboard delays as part of the TDI combinations: instead of having separate calibration stages, it directly expresses all delays appearing in the algorithm in terms of onboard measurements, especially pseudo-random-noise ranging (PRNR) measurements. The only onboard delays that need to be corrected in our processing scheme are PRNR delays in the digital domain, which are determined by commandable digital-signal-processing parameters; hence, they can be easily managed in post-processing. Furthermore, our processing scheme does not require a prior interspacecraft clock synchronization, and it automatically corrects for potential relative drifts between the clocks driving local phase measurement systems. The proposed observable-based processing scheme significantly strengthens the bond between TDI and the real metrology system.</description>

      <title>Single-Impulse Reachable Set in Arbitrary Dynamics Using Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a method to determine the reachable set (RS) of spacecraft after a single velocity impulse with an arbitrary direction, which is appropriate for the RS in both the state and observation spaces under arbitrary dynamics, extending the applications of current RS methods from two-body to arbitrary dynamics. First, the single-impulse RS model is generalized as a family of two-variable parameterized polynomials in the differential algebra scheme. Then, using the envelope theory, the boundary of RS is identified by solving the envelope equation. A framework is proposed to reduce the complexity of solving the envelope equation by converting it to the problem of searching the root of a one-variable polynomial. Moreover, a high-order local polynomial approximation for the RS envelope is derived to improve computational efficiency. The method successfully determines the RSs of two near-rectilinear halo orbits in the cislunar space. Simulation results show that the RSs in both state and observation spaces can be accurately approximated under the three-body dynamics, with relative errors of less than 0.0658%. In addition, using the local polynomial approximation, the computational time for solving the envelope equation is reduced by more than 84%.</description>

      <title>Effect of Numerically Controlled Oscillator Bit Width in Phase Meters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projects aiming to detect gravitational waves (GWs) in space in the millihertz range will utilize interferometers to measure the separations between free-falling test masses. The phasemeter measures the phase changes of the interference signals caused by the test masses' relative movements. The measurement sensitivity of the phasemeter is one of the key factors in the detection. In this work, we reviewed the core metrology of the phasemeter and evaluated the ultra-low noise performance of the phasemeter with analog signals. Frequency readout noise related to the bit width of the numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) inside the phasemeter is identified as one of the main noise sources of phase measurement theoretically and experimentally. After increasing the NCO bit widths, the single-channel phase noise of the phasemeter reached 2.0 {\mu}rad/Hz^{1/2} at 6 mHz, and the differential phase noise reached 0.4 {\mu}rad/Hz^{1/2} at 6 mHz. The phase noise performances remained consistent within the carrier frequency range of 4.9 MHz to 25.1 MHz.</description>

      <title>Connecting Earth and Moon via the L1 Lagrangian point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renewed global interest in lunar exploration requires new orbital strategies to ensure flight safety which can benefit extended lunar missions and service a plethora of planned instruments in the lunar orbit and surface. We investigate here the equivalent fuel consumption cost to transfer from (to) a given orbit and enter (leave) at any point of an invariant manifold associated with a Lyapunov orbit around the Earth-Moon $L_1$ Lagrangian point using bi-impulsive maneuvers. Whereas solving this type of transfer is generally computationally expensive, we simulate here tens of millions of transfers orbits, for different times of flight, Jacobi constants and spatial location on the manifold. We are able to reduce computational cost by taking advantage of the efficient procedure given by the Theory of Functional Connections for solving boundary value problems, represented with special constraints created to the purposes of this work. We develop here the methodology for constructing these transfers, and apply it to find a low-cost transfer from an orbit around the Earth to a stable manifold and another low-cost transfer from an unstable manifold to an orbit around the Moon. In the end, we obtain an innovative Earth-to-Moon transfer that involves a gravity assist maneuver with the Moon and allows a long stationed stage at the Lyapunov orbit around $L_1$ which can be used for designing multi-purpose missions for extended periods of time with low fuel costs. This is paramount to optimize new exploration concepts.</description>

      <title>The Ultraviolet Type Ia Supernova CubeSat (UVIa): Science Motivation &amp; Mission Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ultraviolet (UV) Type Ia Supernova CubeSat (UVIa) is a CubeSat/SmallSat mission concept that stands to test critical space-borne UV technology for future missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) while elucidating long-standing questions about the explosion mechanisms of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). UVIa will observe whether any SNe Ia emit excess UV light shortly after explosion to test progenitor/explosion models and provide follow-up over many days to characterize their UV and optical flux variations over time, assembling a comprehensive multi-band UV and optical low-redshift anchor sample for upcoming high-redshift SNe Ia surveys (e.g., Euclid, Vera Rubin Observatory, Nancy Roman Space Telescope). UVIa's mission profile requires it to perform rapid and frequent visits to newly discovered SNe Ia, simultaneously observing each SNe Ia in two UV bands (FUV: 1500-1800A and NUV: 1800-2400A) and one optical band (u-band: 3000-4200A). In this study, we describe the UVIa mission concept science motivation, mission design, and key technology development.</description>

      <title>Determination of Hubble constant from Megamaser Cosmology Project using Profile Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Megamaser Cosmology Project inferred a value for the Hubble constant given by $H_0=73.9 \pm 3.0 $ km/sec/Mpc. This value was obtained using Bayesian inference by marginalizing over six nuisance parameters, corresponding to the velocities of the megamaser galaxy systems. We obtain an independent estimate of the Hubble constant with the same data using frequentist inference. For this purpose, we use profile likelihood to dispense with the aforementioned nuisance parameters. The frequentist estimate of the Hubble constant is given by $H_0=73.5^{+3.0}_{-2.9}$ km/sec/Mpc and agrees with the Bayesian estimate to within $0.2\sigma$, and both approaches also produce consistent confidence/credible intervals. Therefore, this analysis provides a proof of principle application of profile likelihood in dealing with nuisance parameters in Cosmology, which is complementary to Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>High-Power Test of a C-band Linear Accelerating Structure with an RFSoC-based LLRF System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normal conducting linear particle accelerators consist of multiple rf stations with accelerating structure cavities. Low-level rf (LLRF) systems are employed to set the phase and amplitude of the field in the accelerating structure, and to compensate the pulse-to-pulse fluctuation of the rf field in the accelerating structures with a feedback loop. The LLRF systems are typically implemented with analogue rf mixers, heterodyne based architectures and discrete data converters. There are multiple rf signals from each of rf station, so the number of rf channels required increases rapidly with multiple rf stations. With many rf channels, the footprint, component cost and system complexity of the LLRF hardware increase significantly. To meet the design goals to be compact and affordable for future accelerators, we have designed the next generation LLRF (NG-LLRF) with higher integration level based on RFSoC technology. The NG-LLRF system samples rf signals directly and performs the rf mixing digitally. The NG-LLRF has been characterized in a loopback mode to evaluate the performance of the system and tested with a standing-wave accelerating structure, a prototype for the Cool Copper Collider (C3) with peak rf power up to 16.45 MW. The loopback test demonstrated amplitude fluctuation below 0.15% and phase fluctuation below 0.15 degree, which are considerably better than the requirements of C3. The rf signals from the different stages of accelerating structure at different power levels are measured by the NG-LLRF, which will be critical references for the control algorithm designs. The NG-LLRF also offers flexibility in waveform modulation, so we have used rf pulses with various modulation schemes which could be useful for controlling some of rf stations in accelerators. In this paper, the high-power test results at different stages of the test setup will be summarized, analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the roles general relativistic assumptions play in simulations used in recent observations of black holes including LIGO-Virgo and the Event Horizon Telescope. In both experiments simulations play an ampliative role, enabling the extraction of more information from the data than would be possible otherwise. This comes at a cost of theory-ladenness. We discuss the issue of inferential circularity, which arises in some applications; classify some of the epistemic strategies used to reduce the extent of theory-ladenness; and discuss ways in which these strategies are model independent.</description>

      <title>A Compact Low-level RF Control System for Advanced Concept Compact Electron Linear Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compact low-level RF (LLRF) control system based on RF system-on-chip (RFSoC) technology has been designed for the Advanced Concept Compact Electron Linear-accelerator (ACCEL) program, which has challenging requirements in both RF performance and size, weight and power consumption (SWaP). The compact LLRF solution employs the direct RF sampling technique of RFSoC, which samples the RF signals directly without any analogue up and down conversion. Compared with the conventional heterodyne based architecture used for LLRF system of linear accelerator (LINAC), the elimination of analogue mixers can significantly reduce the size and weight of the system, especially with LINAC requires a larger number of RF channels. Based on the requirements of ACCEL, a prototype LLRF platform has been developed, and the control schemes have been proposed. The prototype LLRF system demonstrated magnitude and phase fluctuation levels below 1% and 1 degree, on the flat top of a 2 microseconds RF pulse. The LLRF control schemes proposed for ACCEL are implemented with a prototype hardware platform. This paper will introduce the new compact LLRF solution and summarize a selection of experimental test results of the prototype itself and with the accelerating structure cavities designed for ACCEL.</description>

      <title>FEASTS Combined with Interferometry. III. The Low-column-density HI Around M51 and Possibility of Turbulent-mixing Gas Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a new joint-deconvolution pipeline, we combine the single-dish and interferometric atomic hydrogen (HI) data of M51 observed by the FAST (FEASTS program) and VLA (THINGS). The product data cube has a typical line width of $13\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ and a $2\sigma$ line-of-sight (LOS) sensitivity of HI column density $N_\text{HI}\sim3.2\times10^{18}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$ at a spatial resolution of ${\sim}18''$ (${\sim}0.7\,\text{kpc}$). Among the HI-detected LOSs extending to ${\sim}50\,\text{kpc}$, ${\sim}89\%$ consist of diffuse HI only, which is missed by previous VLA observations. The distribution of dense HI is reproduced by previous hydrodynamical simulations of this system, but the diffuse component is not, likely due to unresolved physics related to the interaction between the circumgalactic and interstellar media. With simple models, we find that these low-$N_\text{HI}$ structures could survive the background ultraviolet photoionization, but are susceptible to the thermal evaporation. We find a positive correlation between LOS velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) and $N_\text{HI}$ with a logarithmic index of ${\sim}0.5$. Based on existing turbulent mixing layer (TML) theories and simulations, we propose a scenario of hot gas cooling and accreting onto the disk through a TML, which could reproduce the observed power index of ${\sim}0.5$. We estimate the related cooling and accretion rates to be roughly $1/3$ to $2/3$ of the star-formation rate. A typical column density of diffuse HI (${\sim}10^{19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$) can be accreted within $300\,\text{Myr}$, the interaction time scale previously estimated for the system. Such a gas accretion channel has been overlooked before, and may be important for gas-rich interacting systems and for high redshift galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Solving Online Resource-Constrained Scheduling for Follow-Up Observation in Astronomy: a Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the astronomical observation field, determining the allocation of observation resources of the telescope array and planning follow-up observations for targets of opportunity (ToOs) are indispensable components of astronomical scientific discovery. This problem is computationally challenging, given the online observation setting and the abundance of time-varying factors that can affect whether an observation can be conducted. This paper presents ROARS, a reinforcement learning approach for online astronomical resource-constrained scheduling. To capture the structure of the astronomical observation scheduling, we depict every schedule using a directed acyclic graph (DAG), illustrating the dependency of timing between different observation tasks within the schedule. Deep reinforcement learning is used to learn a policy that can improve the feasible solution by iteratively local rewriting until convergence. It can solve the challenge of obtaining a complete solution directly from scratch in astronomical observation scenarios, due to the high computational complexity resulting from numerous spatial and temporal constraints. A simulation environment is developed based on real-world scenarios for experiments, to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed scheduling approach. The experimental results show that ROARS surpasses 5 popular heuristics, adapts to various observation scenarios and learns effective strategies with hindsight.</description>

Abstract: We report the discovery of GJ 2126 b, a highly eccentric (e = 0.85) Jupiter-like planet orbiting its host star every 272.7 days. The planet was detected and characterized using 112 radial velocity (RV) measurements from HARPS (High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher), provided by HARPS-RVBank. This planet orbits a low-mass star and ranks among the most eccentric exoplanets discovered, placing it in a unique region of the parameter space of the known exoplanet population. This makes it a valuable addition to the exoplanet demographics, helping to refine our understanding of planetary formation and evolution theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TianQin is a future space-based gravitational wave observatory targeting the frequency window of $10^{-4}$ Hz $\sim 1$ Hz. A large variety of gravitational wave sources are expected in this frequency band, including the merger of massive black hole binaries, the inspiral of extreme/intermediate mass ratio systems, stellar-mass black hole binaries, Galactic compact binaries, and so on. TianQin will consist of three Earth orbiting satellites on nearly identical orbits with orbital radii of about $10^5$ km. The satellites will form a normal triangle constellation whose plane is nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. The TianQin project has been progressing smoothly following the ``0123" technology roadmap. In step ``0", the TianQin laser ranging station has been constructed and it has successfully ranged to all the five retro-reflectors on the Moon. In step ``1", the drag-free control technology has been tested and demonstrated using the TianQin-1 satellite. In step ``2", the inter-satellite laser interferometry technology will be tested using the pair of TianQin-2 satellites. The TianQin-2 mission has been officially approved and the satellites will be launched around 2026. In step ``3", i.e., the TianQin-3 mission, three identical satellites will be launched around 2035 to form the space-based gravitational wave detector, TianQin, and to start gravitational wave detection in space.</description>

Abstract: Detached eclipsing binary stars (dEBs) are a key source of data on fundamental stellar parameters. While there is a vast source of candidate systems in the light curve databases of survey missions such as Kepler and TESS, published catalogues of well-characterised systems fall short of reflecting this abundance. We seek to improve the efficiency of efforts to process these data with the development of a machine learning model to inspect dEB light curves and predict the input parameters for subsequent formal analysis by the jktebop code.</description>

      <title>SFTs: a scalable data-analysis framework for long-duration gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework based on Short-time Fourier Transforms (SFTs) to analyze long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binaries. Targeted systems include binary neutron stars observed by third-generation ground-based detectors and massive black-hole binaries observed by the LISA space mission. In short, ours is an extremely fast, scalable, and parallelizable implementation of the gravitational-wave inner product, a core operation of gravitational-wave matched filtering. By operating on disjoint data segments, SFTs allow for efficient handling of noise non-stationarities, data gaps, and detector-induced signal modulations. We present a pilot application to early warning problems in both ground- and space-based next-generation detectors. Overall, SFTs reduce the computing cost of evaluating an inner product by three to five orders of magnitude, depending on the specific application, with respect to a standard approach. We release public tools to operate using the SFT framework, including a vectorized and hardware-accelerated re-implementation of a time-domain waveform. The inner product is the key building block of all gravitational-wave data treatments; by speeding up this low-level element so massively, SFTs provide an extremely promising solution for current and future gravitational-wave data-analysis problem</description>

      <title>Searching for Low-Mass Exoplanets Amid Stellar Variability with a Fixed Effects Linear Model of Line-by-Line Shape Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radial velocity (RV) method, also known as Doppler spectroscopy, is a powerful technique for exoplanet discovery and characterization. In recent years, progress has been made thanks to the improvements in the quality of spectra from new extreme precision RV spectrometers. However, detecting the RV signals of Earth-like exoplanets remains challenging, as the spectroscopic signatures of low-mass planets can be obscured or confused with intrinsic stellar variability. Changes in the shapes of spectral lines across time can provide valuable information for disentangling stellar activity from true Doppler shifts caused by low-mass exoplanets. In this work, we present a fixed effects linear model to estimate RV signals that controls for changes in line shapes by aggregating information from hundreds of spectral lines. Our methodology incorporates a wild-bootstrap approach for modeling uncertainty and cross-validation to control for overfitting. We evaluate the model's ability to remove stellar activity using solar observations from the NEID spectrograph, as the sun's true center-of-mass motion is precisely known. Including line shape-change covariates reduces the RV root-mean-square errors by approximately 70% (from 1.919 m s$^{-1}$ to 0.575 m s$^{-1}$) relative to using only the line-by-line Doppler shifts. The magnitude of the residuals is significantly less than that from traditional CCF-based RV estimators and comparable to other state-of-the-art methods for mitigating stellar variability.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme gravitational lensing and relativistic frequency shifts, combined together, imply that radiation emitted from a black hole's vicinity can echo at different frequencies and times, leading to spectrotemporal correlations in observed signals. If such correlations are uncovered by future observations, they could provide a probe of the spacetime geometry in the strong-field region near black holes. Here, motivated by these prospects, we numerically compute the two-point correlation function of specific flux fluctuations in a simple model of line emission by a hotspot in an equatorial circular orbit. We make use of the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code to generate the light curves we then correlate. Our results for the correlation maps show a clear decomposition into direct emission-dominated, and lensing-dominated contributions. The computation transcends past analytical approximations, studying the main contribution to the correlation function, which is not deep in the universal regime. We compute correlation maps for many combinations of black hole mass, spin, inclination, hotspot width, and orbital radius, and study their dependence on these parameters. The correlation maps are then used to train convolutional neural networks which can be used to estimate source parameters, achieving promisingly low evaluation errors within the model. Our results could be relevant for future X-ray spectroscopic missions, offering insights into black hole parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Sampling the full hierarchical population posterior distribution in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related variances.</description>

      <title>Beam Measurements of Full Stokes Parameters for the FAST L-band 19-beam Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) has been fully operational since 11 January 2020. We present a comprehensive analysis of the beam structure for each of the 19 feed horns on FAST's L-band receiver across the Stokes I, Q, U, and V parameters. Using an on-the-fly mapping pattern, we conducted simultaneous sky mapping using all 19 beams directed towards polarization calibrators J1407+2827 and J0854+2006 from 2020 to 2022. Electromagnetic simulations were also performed to model the telescope's beam patterns in all Stokes parameters. Our findings reveal a symmetrical Gaussian pattern in the Stokes I parameter of the central beam without strong sidelobes, while the off-center beams exhibit significant asymmetrical shapes that can be fitted using a combination of log-normal and Gaussian distributions. The inner beams have higher relative beam efficiencies and smaller beam sizes compared to those of the outer beams. The sidelobes of the inner beams contribute approximately 2% of the total flux in the main lobe, increasing to 5% for outer beams, with a peak at 6.8%. In Stokes U, a distinct four-lobed cloverleaf beam squash structure is observed, with similar intensity levels in both inner and outer beams. In Stokes V, a two-lobed beam squint structure is observed in the central beam, along with a secondary eight-lobed structure. The highest squint peak in Stokes V is about 0.3% of the Stokes I in the outer beams. These results align closely with the simulations, providing valuable insights for the design of radio multi-beam observations.</description>

      <title>A differentiable binary microlensing model using adaptive contour integration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present microlux, which is a Jax-based code that can compute the binary microlensing light curve and its derivatives both efficiently and accurately. The key feature of microlux is the implementation of a modified version of the adaptive sampling algorithm that was originally proposed by V. Bozza to account for the finite-source effect most efficiently. The efficiency and accuracy of microlux have been verified across the relevant parameter space for binary microlensing. As a differentiable code, microlux makes it possible to apply gradient-based algorithms to the search and posterior estimation of the microlensing modeling. As an example, we use microlux to model a real microlensing event and infer the model posterior via both Fisher information matrix and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, neither of which would have been possible without the access to accurate model gradients.</description>

      <title>Innovative Web Tool for Remote Data Acquisition and Analysis: Customized for SKA Low frequency Beamforming Test Bed LPDA Array at Gauribidanur Radio Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the evolution of radio astronomy, related education and training, the demand for scalable, efficient, and remote systems in data acquisition, storage, and analysis has significantly increased. Addressing this need, we have developed a web interface for a log-periodic dipole antenna (LPDA) array integral to the SKA Test activities at the Gauribidanur Radio Observatory (77.428 E, 13.603 N). This interface, employing Python-based technologies such as Streamlit and PyVISA, along with SCPI commands, offers a seamless and user-friendly experience. Our solution introduces a unique data acquisition approach, employing SCPI through Python to communicate with the setup's Data Acquisition System (DAS). The web interface, accessible remotely via a secure WLAN network or VPN, facilitates user-initiated observations and comprehensive logging and offers advanced features like manual RFI masking, transit plotting, and fringe plot analysis. Additionally, it acts as a data hub, allowing for the remote downloading of observational data. These capabilities significantly enhance the user's ability to conduct detailed post-observation data analysis. The effectiveness of this interface is further demonstrated through a successful solar transit observation, validating its utility and accuracy in real-world astronomical applications. The applications of this web tool are expandable and can be tailored according to the Observatory's Goals and Instrumentation as well as for the growing radio astronomy instrumentation and observing facilities coming up at various educational institutions.</description>

      <title>Extract cleaned Swift/UVOT UV grism spectra with uvotpy package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultraviolet/optical telescope (UVOT) onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory is capable of imaging with 7 lenticular filters and of taking slitless spectra with 2 grisms. Both image and grism data have been widely used to study gamma-ray bursts, supernovae and other ultraviolet/optical transients, and proved UVOT is a powerful instrument in time-domain astronomy. However, the second order contamination, for blue sources, strongly limits the red end of ultraviolet (UV) grism spectra. This, in turn, reduces the valid wavelength range to only about 33% of the total. However, to explore the broadband spectral energy distribution of GRBs at the early stage, a larger valid wavelength range is required. Hence based on the uvotpy package, we propose a method to remove the second order contamination from UV grism spectra (nominal mode) up to about 4000\AA, i.e., about 70% of the full wavelength range. The 1-sigma systematic uncertainty of this method is about 11.2%. In addition, if a source is red enough, the red end of the valid range could reach about 5000\AA. The source code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Photon Counting Interferometry to Detect Geontropic Space-Time Fluctuations with GQuEST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GQuEST (Gravity from the Quantum Entanglement of Space-Time) experiment uses tabletop-scale Michelson laser interferometers to probe for fluctuations in space-time. We present a practicable interferometer design featuring a novel photon counting readout method that provides unprecedented sensitivity, as it is not subject to the interferometric standard quantum limit. We evaluate the potential of this design to measure space-time fluctuations motivated by recent `geontropic' quantum gravity models. The accelerated accrual of Fisher information offered by the photon counting readout enables GQuEST to detect the predicted quantum gravity phenomena within measurement times at least 100 times shorter than equivalent conventional interferometers. The GQuEST design thus enables a fast and sensitive search for signatures of quantum gravity in a laboratory-scale experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Xenoscope is a demonstrator for a next-generation xenon-based observatory for astroparticle physics, as proposed by the XLZD (XENON-LUX-ZEPLIN-DARWIN) collaboration. It houses a 2.6 m tall, two-phase xenon time projection chamber (TPC), in a cryostat filled with $\sim$ 360 kg of liquid xenon. The main goals of the facility are to demonstrate electron drift in liquid xenon over this distance, to measure the electron cloud transversal and longitudinal diffusion, as well as the optical properties of the medium. In this work, we describe in detail the construction and commissioning of the TPC and report on the observation of light and charge signals with cosmic muons.</description>

      <title>Searching for stellar-origin binary black holes in LISA Data Challenge 1b: Yorsh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the first search for stellar-origin binary black holes within the LISA Data Challenges (LDC). The search algorithm and the \Yorsh{} LDC datasets, both previously described elsewhere, are only summarized briefly; the primary focus here is to present the results of applying the search to the challenge of data. The search employs a hierarchical approach, leveraging semi-coherent matching of template waveforms to the data using a variable number of segments, combined with a particle swarm algorithm for parameter space exploration. The computational pipeline is accelerated using graphical processing unit (GPU) hardware. The results of two searches using different models of the LISA response are presented. The most effective search finds all five sources in the data challenge with injected signal-to-noise ratios $\gtrsim 12$. Rapid parameter estimation is performed for these sources.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Filamentary Nebula of NGC 1275 with Multiwavelength SITELLE Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The filamentary nebula encompassing the central galaxy of the Perseus Cluster, NGC 1275, is a complex structure extending dozens of kiloparsecs from NGC 1275. Decades of previous works have focused on establishing the primary formation and ionization mechanisms in different filaments. These studies have pointed to a lack of star formation in the majority of the filaments, the importance of magnetic fields and turbulence in several regions, and the role of interactions between the intercluster medium (ICM) and the cool gas in the filaments, as well as the role of interaction between the central radio source, 3C84, and the filaments. In this paper, we present multi-filter observations of the entire filamentary system that cover the optical bandpass, using the SITELLE instrument at the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope. Here, we use the data analysis software, \href{https://crhea93.github.io/LUCI/index.html}{\texttt{LUCI}}, to produce flux maps of the prominent emission lines present in the filters: \oii{}$\lambda$3726/3729, \oiii{}$\lambda$5007, H$\beta$, \nii{}$\lambda$6548, \nii{}$\lambda$6583, and H$\alpha$. We use these maps to produce BPT and WHAN diagrams to study the ionization mechanisms at play in each distinct region of the filamentary nebula. First, we confirm the absence of \oiii{}$\lambda$5007 in the extended filaments, although we detect this line in the central core, revealing a compact region where photoionization by the AGN might affect local conditions. Our findings corroborate previous claims that the ionization in the extended filaments could be caused by the cooling ICM via collisional excitation and/or mixing. Moreover, they support the conclusion that magnetic fields play an important role in the formation and continued existence of the filaments.</description>
