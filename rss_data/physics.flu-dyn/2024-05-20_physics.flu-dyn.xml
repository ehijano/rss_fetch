      <title>Run-away transition to turbulent strong-field dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets and stars are able to generate coherent large-scale magnetic fields by helical convective motions in their interiors. This process, known as hydromagnetic dynamo, involves nonlinear interaction between the flow and magnetic field. Nonlinearity facilitates existence of bi-stable dynamo branches: a weak field branch where the magnetic field is not strong enough to enter into the leading order force balance in the momentum equation at large flow scales, and a strong field branch where the field enters into this balance. The transition between the two with enhancement of convection can be either subcritical or supercritical, depending on the strength of magnetic induction. In both cases, it is accompanied by topological changes in velocity field across the system; however, it is yet unclear how these changes are produced. In this work, we analyse transitions between the weak and strong dynamo regimes using a data-driven approach, separating different physical effects induced by dynamically active flow scales. Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition, we decompose the dynamo data from direct numerical simulations into different components (modes), identify the ones relevant for transition, and estimate relative magnitudes of their contributions Lorentz force and induction term. Our results suggest that subcritical transition to a strong dynamo is facilitated by a subharmonic instability, allowing for a more efficient mode of convection, and provide a modal basis for reduced-order models of this transition.</description>

      <title>Spectral Difference method with a posteriori limiting: II- Application to low Mach number flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar convection poses two main gargantuan challenges for astrophysical fluid solvers: low-Mach number flows and minuscule perturbations over steeply stratified hydrostatic equilibria. Most methods exhibit excessive numerical diffusion and are unable to capture the correct solution due to large truncation errors. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the Spectral Difference (SD) method under these extreme conditions using an arbitrarily high-order shock capturing scheme with a posteriori limiting. We include both a modification to the HLLC Riemann solver adapted to low Mach number flows (L-HLLC) and a well-balanced scheme to properly evolve perturbations over steep equilibrium solutions. We evaluate the performance of our method using a series of test tailored specifically for stellar convection. We observe that our high-order SD method is capable of dealing with very subsonic flows without necessarily using the modified Riemann solver. We find however that the well-balanced framework is unavoidable if one wants to capture accurately small amplitude convective and acoustic modes. Analyzing the temporal and spatial evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy, we show that our fourth-order SD scheme seems to emerge as an optimal variant to solve this difficult numerical problem.</description>

      <title>Beyond Linear Decomposition: a Nonlinear Eigenspace Decomposition for a Moist Atmosphere with Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear decomposition of states underpins many classical systems. This is the case of the Helmholtz decomposition, used to split vector fields into divergence-free and potential components, and of the dry Boussinesq system in atmospheric dynamics, where identifying the slow and fast components of the flow can be viewed as a decomposition. The dry Boussinesq system incorporates two leading ingredients of mid-latitude atmospheric motion: rotation and stratification. In both cases the leading order dynamics are linear so we can rely on an eigendecomposition to decompose states.
  Here we study the extension of dry Boussinesq to incorporate another important ingredient in the atmosphere: moisture and clouds. The key challenge with this system is that nonlinearities are present at leading order due to phase boundaries at cloud edge. Therefore standard tools of linear algebra, relying on eigenvalues and eigenvectors, are not applicable. The question we address in this paper is this: in spite of the nonlinearities, can we find a decomposition for this moist Boussinesq system?
  We identify such a decomposition adapted to the nonlinear balances arising from water phase boundaries. This decomposition combines perspectives from partial differential equations (PDEs), the geometry, and the conserved energy. Moreover it sheds light on two aspects of previous work. First, this decomposition shows that the nonlinear elliptic PDE used for potential vorticity and moisture inversion can be used outside the limiting system where it was first derived. Second, we are able to rigorously justify, and interpret geometrically, an existing numerical method for this elliptic PDE. This decomposition may be important in applications because, like its linear counterparts, it may be used to analyze observational data. Moreover, by contrast with previous decompositions, it may be used even in the presence of clouds.</description>

      <title>Centralized Gradient-Based Reconstruction for Wall Modelled Large Eddy Simulations of Hypersonic Boundary Layer Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a robust central Gradient-Based Reconstruction (GBR) scheme for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The method leverages transformation to characteristic space, allowing selective treatment of waves from the compressible Euler equations. By averaging left- and right-biased state interpolations, a central scheme is achieved for all but the acoustic waves, which require upwinding for stability. Distinct differences were observed between transformations using either primitive or conservative variables. We evaluated the method's robustness and superiority using benchmark problems, including the two-dimensional shock entropy problem, two-dimensional viscous shock tube, and three-dimensional inviscid Taylor-Green vortex. Subsequently, we assessed the method in the context of Wall Modelled Large Eddy Simulations (WMLES), where coarse grids are used to reduce computational cost but also introduce substantial numerical dissipation. Using WMLES, we simulated oblique shock impingement on a Mach 6 disturbed boundary layer and a Mach 7.7 flow over a $15^{\circ}$ compression ramp. Our findings reveal that: 1) transformation to characteristic space using conservative variables leads to more accurate results; 2) minimizing numerical dissipation through centralized interpolation is crucial. In the compression ramp case, boundary layer separation was shifted slightly upstream, and there was an over-prediction of wall heating, likely attributable to the equilibrium-assuming wall model. Overall, this work showcases the method's potential in accurately capturing complex flow dynamics with reduced numerical dissipation.</description>

      <title>Probing double distribution function models in the lattice Boltzmann method for highly compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double distribution function approach is an efficient route towards extension of kinetic solvers to compressible flows. With a number of realizations available, an overview and comparative study in the context of high speed compressible flows is presented. We discuss the different variants of the energy partition, analyses of hydrodynamic limits and a numerical study of accuracy and performance with the particles on demand realization. Out of three considered energy partition strategies, it is shown that the non-translational energy split requires a higher-order quadrature for proper recovery of the Navier--Stokes--Fourier equations. The internal energy split on the other hand, while recovering the correct hydrodynamic limit with fourth-order quadrature, comes with a non-local --both in space and time-- source term which contributes to higher computational cost and memory overhead. Based on our analysis, the total energy split demonstrates the optimal overall performance.</description>

      <title>Godunov Loss Functions for Modelling of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques are being used as an alternative to traditional numerical discretization methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to fluid flow. Whilst numerical methods are higher fidelity, they are computationally expensive. Machine learning methods on the other hand are lower fidelity but provide significant speed-ups. The emergence of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in fluid dynamics has allowed scientists to directly use PDEs for evaluating loss functions in an unsupervised manner. The downfall of this approach is that the differential form of systems is invalid at regions of shock inherent in hyperbolic PDEs such as the compressible Euler equations. To circumvent this problem we propose a modification to PDE-based PINN losses by using a finite volume-based loss function that incorporates the flux of Godunov-type methods. These Godunov-type methods are also known as approximate Riemann solvers and evaluate intercell fluxes in an entropy-satisfying manner, yielding more physically accurate shocks. Our approach increases fidelity compared to using regularized PDE-based PINN losses, as tested on the 2D Riemann problem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The projection method is the standard approach for numerically integrating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation initial-boundary-value problem. Typical boundary conditions specify either the velocity or the gradient velocity on the boundary. Here, we consider the pressure-tangential-velocity boundary condition in which the tangential components of the velocity and the pressure at the boundary are specified.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of vapor-rich bubble in ethanol/water mixtures and enhanced flow around the bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of microbubbles generated by the local heating of an ethanol/water mixture and the surrounding flow. The mixture is photothermally heated by focusing a continuous-wave laser on a FeSi$_2$ thin film. Although the liquid is not degassed, vapor-rich bubbles are stably generated in an ethanol concentration range of 1.5-50 wt% The vapor-rich bubbles absorb the air dissolved in the surrounding liquid and exhale it continuously as air-rich bubbles $\sim$ 1 {\mu}m in diameter. For the same ethanol concentration range, the solutal-Marangoni force becomes dominant relative to the thermal-Marangoni force, and the air-rich bubbles are pushed away from the high-temperature region in the fluid toward the low-temperature region. Further, it was experimentally demonstrated that Marangoni forces do not significantly affect the surface of vapor-rich bubbles generated in ethanol/water mixtures, and they produce a flow from the high-temperature to the low-temperature region on the vapor-rich bubbles, which moves the exhaled air-rich bubbles away from the vapor-rich bubbles near the heat source. These effects prevent the vapor-rich and exhaled air-rich bubbles from recombining, thereby resulting in the long-term stability of the former. Moreover, the flow produced by the vapor-rich bubbles in the non-degassed 0-20 wt% ethanol/water mixture was stronger than that in degassed water. The maximum flow speed is achieved for an ethanol concentration of 5 wt%, which is 6-11 times higher than that when degassed water is utilized. The ethanol/water mixture produces vapor-rich bubbles without a degassing liquid and enhances the flow speed generated by the vapor-rich bubbles. This flow is expected to apply to driving and mixing microfluids.</description>

      <title>Influence of preferential diffusion on the distribution of species in lean H2-air laminar premixed flames at different equivalence ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of equivalence ratio on preferential diffusion effects and the resulting changes in the distributions of major species and their reaction rates have been analysed based on 2D simulations of lean ${\mathrm{H_2}}$-air laminar premixed flames, at $\phi=0.4$ and $0.7$. The enhancements of burning rate, flame surface area, and stretch factor increase with decreasing equivalence ratio with the increase in stretch factor particularly prominent when the burning rate and flame area are evaluated based on normalised mass fraction variation of ${\mathrm{H_2}}$. The preferential diffusion effects have been demonstrated to lead to significant deviations of mass fractions of major species and their reaction rates from the corresponding 1D unstretched laminar premixed flame solution and local variations of equivalence ratio. This tendency is particularly strong for ${\mathrm{H_2}}$ among all the major species. Moreover, mass fractions of ${\mathrm{O_2}}$ and ${\mathrm{H_2O}}$ are found to assume super-adiabatic values at the super-adiabatic temperature zones and this trend is particularly strong for the $\phi=0.4$ case. It has been demonstrated that the deviations of major species mass fractions and their reaction rates from their corresponding 1D unstretched laminar premixed flame values arise principally due to preferential diffusion effects induced by relative focussing/defocussing of species and heat at the positively and negatively curved regions with the nature of the deviations being opposite to each other depending on the sign of the curvature. The variations of normalised species mass fractions of $\mathrm{O_2}$ and $\mathrm{H_2O}$ are found to be significantly affected by the local equivalence ratio within the 2D laminar flame with $\phi=0.4$ but these effects weaken with an increase in global equivalence ratio.</description>

      <title>Lifetime Characterization of Extreme Wave Localizations in Crossing Seas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rogue waves (RWs) can form on the ocean surface due to quasi-four wave resonant interaction or superposition principle. Both mechanisms have been acutely studied. The first of the two is known as the nonlinear focusing mechanism and leads to an increased probability of rogue waves when wave conditions are favourable, i.e., when unidirectionality and high narrowband energy of the wave field are satisfied. This work delves into the dynamics of extreme wave focusing in crossing seas, revealing a distinct type of nonlinear RWs, characterized by a decisive longevity compared to those generated by the dispersive focusing mechanism. In fact, through fully nonlinear hydrodynamic numerical simulations, we show that the interactions between two crossing unidirectional wave beams can trigger fully localized and robust development of RWs. These coherent structures, characterized by a typical spectral broadening then spreading in the form of dual bimodality and recurrent wave group focusing, not only defy the weakening expectation of quasi-four wave resonant interaction in directionally spread wave fields, but also differ from classical focusing mechanisms already mentioned. This has been determined following a rigorous lifespan-based statistical analysis of extreme wave events in our fully nonlinear simulations. Utilizing the coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger framework, we also show that such intrinsic focusing dynamics can also be captured by weakly nonlinear wave evolution equations. This opens new research avenues for further explorations of these complex and intriguing wave phenomena in hydrodynamics as well as other nonlinear and dispersive multi-wave systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the flow evolution past a pitching NACA0012 airfoil undergoing deep dynamic stall using a wall-resolved large eddy simulation approach. Numerical results are validated against experimental data from Lee and Gerontakos at Reynolds number Re = 135 000 and a reduced frequency k = 0.1. A comprehensive analysis of the computational grid span size is presented, highlighting the critical requirement for a span-to-chord ratio of at least one. Furthermore, a comparative assessment with state-of-the-art RANS and hybrid RANS/LES turbulence models is conducted to identify the sources of potential discrepancies between the numerical simulations and the experimental data. All the numerical models demonstrate the same behavior and exhibit similar differences with the experiments.</description>

      <title>A deep-water closure model for surface waves on axisymmetric swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the propagation of linear gravity waves on the free surface of steady, axisymmetric flows with purely azimuthal velocity. We propose a two-dimensional set of governing equations for surface waves valid in the deep-water limit. These equations come from a closure condition at the free surface that reduces the three-dimensional Euler equations in the bulk of the fluid to a set of two-dimensional equations applied only at the free surface. Since the closure condition is not obtained rigorously, it is validated numerically through comparisons with full three-dimensional calculations for vortex flows, including for a Lamb--Oseen vortex. The model presented here overcomes three limitations of existing models, namely: it is not restricted to potential base flows; it does not assume the base flow to have a flat free surface; and it does not require the use of infinite-order differential operators (such as $\tanh(\nabla)$) in the governing equations. The model can be applied in the case of rapid swirl (large Froude number) where the base free surface is substantially deformed. Since the model contains only derivatives of finite order, it is readily amenable to standard numerical study.</description>

      <title>Persistence of large scale coherent structures in a turbulent pipe flow through an improved lattice Boltzmann approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulated a turbulent pipe flow within the Lattice Boltzmann Method using a multiple-relaxation-time collision operator with Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution expanded, for the sake of a more accurate description, up to the sixth order in Hermite polynomials. The moderately turbulent flow ($Re_{\tau} \approx 181.3$) is able to reproduce up to the fourth statistical moment with great accuracy, compared with other numerical schemes and with experimental data. A coherent structure identification was performed based on the most energetic streamwise turbulent mode, which revealed a surprising memory effect related to the large scale forcing scheme used to trigger the turbulent state in the pipe. We observe that the existence of large scale motions which are out of the pipe's stationary regime do not affect the detailed single-point statistical features of the flow. Furthermore, the transitions between the coherent structures of different topological modes were analyzed as a stochastic process. We find that for finely resolved data the transitions are effectively Markovian, but for larger decimation time lags, due to topological mode degeneracy, non-Markovian behavior emerges, in agreement with previous experimental studies.</description>

Abstract: An experimental investigation was carried out to study heat transfer rates in a high-temperature, high-pressure region generated using the shock focusing technique. A shock tube test facility with a specially designed spherically converging test section was used in the present study. Two test cases, a shock of initial strength Mach 2 and Mach 4, were investigated. An in-house 10 developed K -type thermocouple was used in the present investigations, and the measured heat transfer rates were of the order of KW/cm2.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Edge Modes and Fragile Surface States of Symmetry Protected Integer Quantum Hall Effect of Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt the fluid description of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) states, as seen in (arXiv:2203.06516), to model a system of interacting two-component bosons. This system represents the simplest physical realization of an interacting bosonic Symmetry-Protected Topological (SPT) phase, also known as the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) of bosons. In particular, we demonstrate how the fluid dynamical boundary conditions of no-penetration and no-stress at a hard wall naturally give rise to the two counter-propagating boundary modes expected in these SPT phases. Moreover, we identify energy-conserving hydro boundary conditions that can either create a gap in these edge modes or completely isolate the edge states from the bulk, as described in (Physical Review X 14, 011057 (2024)), where they are termed fragile surface states. These fragile surface states are typically absent in K-matrix edge theories and require bulk dynamics to manifest. By leveraging insights from hydrodynamical boundary dynamics, we can further elucidate the intricate surface properties of SPTs beyond the usual topological quantum field theory based approaches.</description>

      <title>A study of the reconnection of antiparallel vortices in the infinitely thin case and in the finite thickness case</title>

Abstract: The simplest case is the reconnection of a pair of antiparallel line vortices, e.g., condensation trails of an aircraft. The vortices first undergo long wave deformation (Crow waves), and then reconnect to form coherent structures. Although the behavior of the vortices before and after the reconnection can be clearly observed, what happens during the reconnection still needs to be explained. One of the challenges is related to the fact that the vortices have finite thickness, and therefore, the time and the point of the reconnection cannot be determined. Moreover, the smallest scale of coherent structures that can be observed also depends on the vortex thickness. In this paper, we consider an infinitely thin vortex approximation to study the reconnection process. We show that, in this case, the behavior after the reconnection is quasi-periodic, with the quasi-period being independent of the angle between the vortices at the time of the reconnection. We also show that, in the Fourier transform of the trajectory of the reconnection point, the frequencies that correspond to squares of integers are dominating in a similar way as in the evolution of a polygonal vortex under the localized induction approximation. At the end, we compare the results with a solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for the reconnection of a pair of antiparallel vortices with finite thickness. We use the fluid impulse to determine the reconnection time, the reconnection point, and the quasi-period for this case.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov's dissipation number and determining wavenumber for dyadic models</title>

Abstract: We study some dyadic models for incompressible magnetohydrodynamics and Navier-Stokes equation. The existence of fixed point and stability of the fixed point are established. The scaling law of Kolmogorov's dissipation wavenumber arises from heuristic analysis. In addition, a time-dependent determining wavenumber is shown to exist; moreover, the time average of the determining wavenumber is proved to be bounded above by Kolmogorov's dissipation wavenumber. Additionally, based on the knowledge of the fixed point and stability of the fixed point, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the energy spectrum in the inertial range below Kolmogorov's dissipation wavenumber.</description>

      <title>Non-equivalence of quasilinear dynamical systems and their statistical closures</title>

Abstract: It is widely believed that statistical closure theories for dynamical systems provide statistics equivalent to those of the governing dynamical equations from which the former are derived. Here, we demonstrate counterexamples in the context of the widely used mean-field quasilinear (QL) approximation applied to 2D fluid dynamical systems. We compare statistics of QL numerical simulations with those obtained by direct statistical simulation via a cumulant expansion closed at second order (CE2). We observe that, though CE2 is an exact statistical closure for QL dynamics, its predictions disagree with the statistics of the QL solution for identical parameter values. These disagreements are attributed to instabilities, which we term rank instabilities, of the second cumulant dynamics within CE2 that are unavailable in the QL equations.</description>

      <title>A Vortex Damping Outflow Forcing for Multiphase Flows with Sharp Interfacial Jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outflow boundaries play an important role in multiphase fluid dynamics simulations that involve transition between liquid and vapor phases. These flows are dominated by low Weber numbers and a sharp jump in pressure, velocity, and temperature. Inadequate treatment of these jumps at the outlet generates undesirable fluid disturbances that propagate upstream and lead to instabilities within the computational domain. To mitigate these disturbances, we introduce a forcing term that can be applied to incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to enforce stability in the numerical solution. The forcing term acts as a damping mechanism to control vortices that are generated by droplet/bubbles in multiphase flows, and is designed to be a general formulation that can be coupled with a fixed pressure outflow boundary condition to simulate a variety of multiphase flow problems. We demonstrate its applicability to simulate pool and flow boiling problems, where bubble-induced vortices during evaporation and condensation present a challenge at the outflow. Validation and verification cases are chosen to quantify accuracy and stability of the proposed method in comparison to established benchmarks and reference solutions, along with detailed performance analysis for three-dimensional simulations on leadership supercomputing platforms. Computational experiments are performed using Flash-X, which is a composable open-source software instrument designed for multiscale fluid dynamics simulations on heterogeneous architectures.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and frictional dissipation from treading in the puddle</title>

Abstract: It was recently established that dogs share the same lapping technique as cats by flicking their tongue against the water surface and then yanking it back, dragging up a column of water. This liquid column appears frequently in daily life and industrial applications, such as walking through a puddle and roller printing. While governed by the Navier-Stokes equation, its dynamics are often studied by numerical means, which hinders a full understanding of the rich mixture of physics behind, for instance, the competition of surface and potential energies, and how the pinch-off is affected by the kinetic energy and water jet when a large cylinder is used. Combined with simple models, we elucidate the mechanism that drives the change of morphology and derive analytic expressions for the critical height and upper radius for the liquid column when transiting between three stages. Stage I is characterized by a static and reversible profile for the column whose upper radius r_t equals that of the cylinder. The column becomes irreversible and $r_t$ starts shrinking upon entering stage II. It is not until r_t stops shrinking that the column neck accelerates its contraction and descends toward the pool, the quantitative behavior of which is among the successful predictions of our theory. Pinch-off dominates the second half of stage III without its usual signature of self-similarity. This is discussed and explained with an interesting incident involving a water jet similar to that made by a dropping stone.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Computational Fluid Dynamics: Physics and Machine Learning Based Approaches</title>

Abstract: Turbulent flow has been extensively studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations since turbulent flow regime is so frequently encountered in both academic and engineering applications. The high-fidelity simulation of the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) requires a sufficiently fine mesh to resolve the smallest Kolmogorov length scale of turbulent motion, which requires a tremendous amount of computational resources, and hence usually prohibited in engineering applications. At the current state of computational power we can only execute DNS simulations for small sections of an aircraft wing at high Reynolds numbers. Even though large-eddy simulation (LES) has reduced the computational overheads by only resolving the large-scale eddies with the small-scale eddies being modelled. However, for extremely high Reynolds number and complex geometry flows LES is still restricted to academic studies. As the result, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based turbulence models have significantly reduced the computational overheads by modeling all scales of turbulent motion. Unlike DNS and LES which are dedicated to representing the true physics of turbulent flows, RANS approach uses simplifying modeling assumptions to describe both lower order and higher order quantities. This makes RANS still remain the most widely used CFD method in engineering applications; however, simplifying assumptions also introduces sources uncertainties during simulation.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Physics-Informed Neural Networks: A Digital Twin Perspective</title>

Abstract: This study explores the potential of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the realization of digital twins (DT) from various perspectives. First, various adaptive sampling approaches for collocation points are investigated to verify their effectiveness in the mesh-free framework of PINNs, which allows automated construction of virtual representation without manual mesh generation. Then, the overall performance of the data-driven PINNs (DD-PINNs) framework is examined, which can utilize the acquired datasets in DT scenarios. Its scalability to more general physics is validated within parametric Navier-Stokes equations, where PINNs do not need to be retrained as the Reynolds number varies. In addition, since datasets can be often collected from different fidelity/sparsity in practice, multi-fidelity DD-PINNs are also proposed and evaluated. They show remarkable prediction performance even in the extrapolation tasks, with $42\sim62\%$ improvement over the single-fidelity approach. Finally, the uncertainty quantification performance of multi-fidelity DD-PINNs is investigated by the ensemble method to verify their potential in DT, where an accurate measure of predictive uncertainty is critical. The DD-PINN frameworks explored in this study are found to be more suitable for DT scenarios than traditional PINNs from the above perspectives, bringing engineers one step closer to seamless DT realization.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a viscoelastic resistive force theory and applications to swimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a simple model for the evolution of an immersed, inextensible filament which incorporates linear viscoelastic effects of the surrounding fluid. The model is a closed-form system of equations along the curve only which includes a `memory' term due to viscoelasticity. For a planar filament, given a forcing in the form of a preferred curvature, we prove well-posedness of the fiber evolution as well as the existence of a unique time-periodic solution in the case of time-periodic forcing. Moreover, we obtain an expression for the swimming speed of the filament in terms of the preferred curvature. The swimming speed depends in a complicated way on the viscoelastic parameters corresponding to the fluid relaxation time and additional polymeric viscosity. We study this expression in detail, accompanied by numerical simulations, and show that this simple model can capture complex effects of viscoelasticity on swimming. In particular, the viscoelastic swimmer is shown to be faster than its Newtonian counterpart in some situations and slower in others. Strikingly, we even find an example where viscoelastic effects may lead to a reversal in swimming direction from the Newtonian setting, although this occurs when the displacement for both the Newtonian and viscoelastic swimmers is practically negligible.</description>
