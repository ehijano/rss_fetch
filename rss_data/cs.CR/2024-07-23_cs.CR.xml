      <title>DefTesPY: Cyber defense model with enhanced data modeling and analysis for Tesla company via Python Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several types of cyber-attacks on automobiles and business firms keep on rising as we are preparing to counter cybercrimes with several new technologies and defense models. Cyber defense (also, counter intelligence) is a computer network defense mechanism that involves response to activities, critical infrastructure protection, and information assurance for corporations, government bodies, and other conceivable networks. Cyber defense focuses on preventing, detecting, and responding to assaults or threats in a timely manner so that no infrastructure or information is compromised. With the increasing volume and complexity of cyber threats, most companies need cyber defense to protect sensitive information and assets. We can control attacker actions by utilizing firewalls at different levels, an intrusion detection system (IDS), with the intrusion prevention system (IPS) which can be installed independently or in combination with other protection approaches. Tesla is an American clean energy and automotive company in Austin, Texas, USA. The recent data breach at Tesla affected over 75,000 individuals as the company pinpoints two former employees as the offender revealing more than 23,000 internal files from 2015 to 2022. In this work, we will emphasize data modeling and data analysis using cyber defense model and python with a survey of the Tesla company. We have proposed a defense model, DefTesPY, with enhanced data modeling and data analysis based on the encountered cyber-attacks and cybercrimes for Tesla company till date.</description>

      <title>WiFaKey: Generating Cryptographic Keys from Face in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deriving a unique cryptographic key from biometric measurements is a challenging task due to the existing noise gap between the biometric measurements and error correction coding. Additionally, privacy and security concerns arise as biometric measurements are inherently linked to the user. Biocryptosystems represent a key branch of solutions aimed at addressing these issues. However, many existing bio-cryptosystems rely on handcrafted feature extractors and error correction codes (ECC), often leading to performance degradation. To address these challenges and improve the reliability of biometric measurements, we propose a novel biometric cryptosystem named WiFaKey, for generating cryptographic keys from face in unconstrained settings. Speciffcally, WiFaKey ffrst introduces an adaptive random masking-driven feature transformation pipeline, AdaMTrans. AdaMTrans effectively quantizes and binarizes realvalued features and incorporates an adaptive random masking scheme to align the bit error rate with error correction requirements, thereby mitigating the noise gap. Besides, WiFaKey incorporates a supervised learning-based neural decoding scheme called Neural-MS decoder, which delivers a more robust error correction performance with less iteration than non-learning decoders, thereby alleviating the performance degradation. We evaluated WiFaKey using widely adopted face feature extractors on six large unconstrained and two constrained datasets. On the LFW dataset, WiFaKey achieved an average Genuine Match Rate of 85.45% and 85.20% at a 0% False Match Rate for MagFace and AdaFace features, respectively. Our comprehensive comparative analysis shows a signiffcant performance improvement of WiFaKey. The source code of our work is available at github.com/xingbod/WiFaKey.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Generation Integrated Large Language Models in Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has been accompanied by substantial financial losses due to smart contract vulnerabilities, underscoring the critical need for effective security auditing. With attacks becoming more frequent, the necessity and demand for auditing services has escalated. This especially creates a financial burden for independent developers and small businesses, who often have limited available funding for these services. Our study builds upon existing frameworks by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs), specifically employing GPT-4-1106 for its 128k token context window. We construct a vector store of 830 known vulnerable contracts, leveraging Pinecone for vector storage, OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 for embeddings, and LangChain to construct the RAG-LLM pipeline. Prompts were designed to provide a binary answer for vulnerability detection. We first test 52 smart contracts 40 times each against a provided vulnerability type, verifying the replicability and consistency of the RAG-LLM. Encouraging results were observed, with a 62.7% success rate in guided detection of vulnerabilities. Second, we challenge the model under a "blind" audit setup, without the vulnerability type provided in the prompt, wherein 219 contracts undergo 40 tests each. This setup evaluates the general vulnerability detection capabilities without hinted context assistance. Under these conditions, a 60.71% success rate was observed. While the results are promising, we still emphasize the need for human auditing at this time. We provide this study as a proof of concept for a cost-effective smart contract auditing process, moving towards democratic access to security.</description>

Abstract: Here is a more detailed description of the algorithm proposed in [1]. This algorithm simultaneously uses two cryptographic procedures: encryption using a generalization of the Markovski algorithm [2] and encryption using a system of orthogonal operations.

      <title>From Ad Identifiers to Global Privacy Control: The Status Quo and Future of Opting Out of Ad Tracking on Android</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Apps and their integrated third party libraries often collect a variety of data from people to show them personalized ads. This practice is often privacy-invasive. Since 2013, Google has therefore allowed users to limit ad tracking on Android via system settings. Further, under the 2018 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), apps must honor opt-outs from ad tracking under the Global Privacy Control (GPC). The efficacy of these two methods to limit ad tracking has not been studied in prior work. Our legal and technical analysis details how the GPC applies to mobile apps and how it could be integrated directly into Android, thereby developing a reference design for GPC on Android. Our empirical analysis of 1,896 top-ranked Android apps shows that both the Android system-level opt-out and the GPC signal rarely restrict ad tracking. In our view, deleting the AdID and opting out under the CCPA has the same meaning. Thus, the current AdID setting and APIs should be evolved towards GPC and integrated into Android's Privacy Sandbox.</description>

      <title>Requiem for a drone: a machine-learning based framework for stealthy attacks against unmanned autonomous vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a space of uncertainty in the modeling of vehicular dynamics of autonomous systems due to noise in sensor readings, environmental factors or modeling errors. We present Requiem, a software-only, blackbox approach that exploits this space in a stealthy manner causing target systems, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to significantly deviate from their mission parameters. Our system achieves this by modifying sensor values, all while avoiding detection by onboard anomaly detectors (hence, "stealthy"). The Requiem framework uses a combination of multiple deep learning models (that we refer to as "surrogates" and "spoofers") coupled with extensive, realistic simulations on a software-in-the-loop quadrotor UAV system. Requiem makes no assumptions about either the (types of) sensors or the onboard state estimation algorithm(s) -- it works so long as the latter is "learnable".
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system using various attacks across multiple missions as well as multiple sets of statistical analyses. We show that Requiem successfully exploits the modeling errors (i.e., causes significant deviations from planned mission parameters) while remaining stealthy (no detection even after {tens of meters of deviations}) and are generalizable (Requiem has potential to work across different attacks and sensor types).</description>

      <title>AGORA: Open More and Trust Less in Binary Verification Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary verification plays a pivotal role in software security, yet building a verification service that is both open and trustworthy poses a formidable challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel binary verification service, AGORA, scrupulously designed to overcome the challenge. At the heart of this approach lies a strategic insight: certain tasks can be delegated to untrusted entities, while the corresponding validators are securely housed within the trusted computing base (TCB). AGORA can validate untrusted assertions generated for versatile policies. Through a novel blockchain-based bounty task manager, it also utilizes crowdsourcing to remove trust in theorem provers. These synergistic techniques successfully ameliorate the TCB size burden associated with two procedures: binary analysis and theorem proving. The design of AGORA allows untrusted parties to participate in these complex processes. Moreover, based on running the optimized TCB within trusted execution environments and recording the verification process on a blockchain, the public can audit the correctness of verification results. By implementing verification workflows for software-based fault isolation policy and side-channel mitigation, our evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of AGORA.</description>

      <title>SeqMIA: Sequential-Metric Based Membership Inference Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing membership inference attacks (MIAs) utilize metrics (e.g., loss) calculated on the model's final state, while recent advanced attacks leverage metrics computed at various stages, including both intermediate and final stages, throughout the model training. Nevertheless, these attacks often process multiple intermediate states of the metric independently, ignoring their time-dependent patterns. Consequently, they struggle to effectively distinguish between members and non-members who exhibit similar metric values, particularly resulting in a high false-positive rate.
  In this study, we delve deeper into the new membership signals in the black-box scenario. We identify a new, more integrated membership signal: the Pattern of Metric Sequence, derived from the various stages of model training. We contend that current signals provide only partial perspectives of this new signal: the new one encompasses both the model's multiple intermediate and final states, with a greater emphasis on temporal patterns among them. Building upon this signal, we introduce a novel attack method called Sequential-metric based Membership Inference Attack (SeqMIA). Specifically, we utilize knowledge distillation to obtain a set of distilled models representing various stages of the target model's training. We then assess multiple metrics on these distilled models in chronological order, creating distilled metric sequence. We finally integrate distilled multi-metric sequences as a sequential multiformat and employ an attention-based RNN attack model for inference. Empirical results show SeqMIA outperforms all baselines, especially can achieve an order of magnitude improvement in terms of TPR @ 0.1% FPR. Furthermore, we delve into the reasons why this signal contributes to SeqMIA's high attack performance, and assess various defense mechanisms against SeqMIA.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Data-Use Auditing of ML Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditing the use of data in training machine-learning (ML) models is an increasingly pressing challenge, as myriad ML practitioners routinely leverage the effort of content creators to train models without their permission. In this paper, we propose a general method to audit an ML model for the use of a data-owner's data in training, without prior knowledge of the ML task for which the data might be used. Our method leverages any existing black-box membership inference method, together with a sequential hypothesis test of our own design, to detect data use with a quantifiable, tunable false-detection rate. We show the effectiveness of our proposed framework by applying it to audit data use in two types of ML models, namely image classifiers and foundation models.</description>

      <title>SNNGX: Securing Spiking Neural Networks with Genetic XOR Encryption on RRAM-based Neuromorphic Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biologically plausible Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by spike sparsity, are growing tremendous attention over intellectual edge devices and critical bio-medical applications as compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, there is a considerable risk from malicious attempts to extract white-box information (i.e., weights) from SNNs, as attackers could exploit well-trained SNNs for profit and white-box adversarial concerns. There is a dire need for intellectual property (IP) protective measures. In this paper, we present a novel secure software-hardware co-designed RRAM-based neuromorphic accelerator for protecting the IP of SNNs. Software-wise, we design a tailored genetic algorithm with classic XOR encryption to target the least number of weights that need encryption. From a hardware perspective, we develop a low-energy decryption module, meticulously designed to provide zero decryption latency. Extensive results from various datasets, including NMNIST, DVSGesture, EEGMMIDB, Braille Letter, and SHD, demonstrate that our proposed method effectively secures SNNs by encrypting a minimal fraction of stealthy weights, only 0.00005% to 0.016% weight bits. Additionally, it achieves a substantial reduction in energy consumption, ranging from x59 to x6780, and significantly lowers decryption latency, ranging from x175 to x4250. Moreover, our method requires as little as one sample per class in dataset for encryption and addresses hessian/gradient-based search insensitive problems. This strategy offers a highly efficient and flexible solution for securing SNNs in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>A Learning-Based Attack Framework to Break SOTA Poisoning Defenses in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel client-server distributed learning framework that can protect data privacy. However, recent works show that FL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks. Many defenses with robust aggregators (AGRs) are proposed to mitigate the issue, but they are all broken by advanced attacks. Very recently, some renewed robust AGRs are designed, typically with novel clipping or/and filtering strate-gies, and they show promising defense performance against the advanced poisoning attacks. In this paper, we show that these novel robust AGRs are also vulnerable to carefully designed poisoning attacks. Specifically, we observe that breaking these robust AGRs reduces to bypassing the clipping or/and filtering of malicious clients, and propose an optimization-based attack framework to leverage this observation. Under the framework, we then design the customized attack against each robust AGR. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and threat models verify our proposed optimization-based attack can break the SOTA AGRs. We hence call for novel defenses against poisoning attacks to FL.

      <title>Minimizing the Number of Roles in Bottom-Up Role-Mining using Maximal Biclique Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bottom-up role-mining is the determination of a set of roles given as input a set of users and the permissions those users possess. It is well-established in the research literature, and in practice, as an important problem in information security. A natural objective that has been explored in prior work is for the set of roles to be of minimum size. We address this problem for practical inputs while reconciling foundations, specifically, that the problem is \cnph. We first observe that an approach from prior work that exploits a sufficient condition for an efficient algorithm, while a useful first step, does not scale to more recently proposed benchmark inputs. We propose a new technique: the enumeration of maximal bicliques. We point out that the number of maximal bicliques provides a natural measure of the hardness of an input. We leverage the enumeration of maximal bicliques in two different ways. Our first approach addresses more than half the benchmark inputs to yield exact results. The other approach is needed for hard instances; in it, we identify and adopt as roles those that correspond to large maximal bicliques. We have implemented all our algorithms and carried out an extensive empirical assessment, which suggests that our approaches are promising. Our code is available publicly as open-source.</description>

      <title>A Solution toward Transparent and Practical AI Regulation: Privacy Nutrition Labels for Open-source Generative AI-based Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development and widespread adoption of Generative Artificial Intelligence-based (GAI) applications have greatly enriched our daily lives, benefiting people by enhancing creativity, personalizing experiences, improving accessibility, and fostering innovation and efficiency across various domains. However, along with the development of GAI applications, concerns have been raised about transparency in their privacy practices. Traditional privacy policies often fail to effectively communicate essential privacy information due to their complexity and length, and open-source community developers often neglect privacy practices even more. Only 12.2% of examined open-source GAI apps provide a privacy policy. To address this, we propose a regulation-driven GAI Privacy Label and introduce Repo2Label, a novel framework for automatically generating these labels based on code repositories. Our user study indicates a common endorsement of the proposed GAI privacy label format. Additionally, Repo2Label achieves a precision of 0.81, recall of 0.88, and F1-score of 0.84 based on the benchmark dataset, significantly outperforming the developer self-declared privacy notices. We also discuss the common regulatory (in)compliance of open-source GAI apps, comparison with other privacy notices, and broader impacts to different stakeholders. Our findings suggest that Repo2Label could serve as a significant tool for bolstering the privacy transparency of GAI apps and make them more practical and responsible.</description>

      <title>Decoding BACnet Packets: A Large Language Model Approach for Packet Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Industrial Control System (ICS) environment encompasses a wide range of intricate communication protocols, posing substantial challenges for Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts tasked with monitoring, interpreting, and addressing network activities and security incidents. Conventional monitoring tools and techniques often struggle to provide a clear understanding of the nature and intent of ICS-specific communications. To enhance comprehension, we propose a software solution powered by a Large Language Model (LLM). This solution currently focused on BACnet protocol, processes a packet file data and extracts context by using a mapping database, and contemporary context retrieval methods for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The processed packet information, combined with the extracted context, serves as input to the LLM, which generates a concise packet file summary for the user. The software delivers a clear, coherent, and easily understandable summary of network activities, enabling SOC analysts to better assess the current state of the control system.</description>

      <title>Fast computation of 2-isogenies in dimension 4 and cryptographic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimension 4 isogenies have first been introduced in cryptography for the cryptanalysis of Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) and have been used constructively in several schemes, including SQIsignHD, a derivative of SQIsign isogeny based signature scheme. Unlike in dimensions 2 and 3, we can no longer rely on the Jacobian model and its derivatives to compute isogenies. In dimension 4 (and higher), we can only use theta-models. Previous works by Romain Cosset, David Lubicz and Damien Robert have focused on the computation of $\ell$-isogenies in theta-models of level $n$ coprime to $\ell$ (which requires to use $n^g$ coordinates in dimension $g$). For cryptographic applications, we need to compute chains of $2$-isogenies, requiring to use $\geq 3^g$ coordinates in dimension $g$ with state of the art algorithms.
  In this paper, we present algorithms to compute chains of $2$-isogenies between abelian varieties of dimension $g\geq 1$ with theta-coordinates of level $n=2$, generalizing a previous work by Pierrick Dartois, Luciano Maino, Giacomo Pope and Damien Robert in dimension $g=2$. We propose an implementation of these algorithms in dimension $g=4$ to compute endomorphisms of elliptic curve products derived from Kani's lemma with applications to SQIsignHD and SIDH cryptanalysis. We are now able to run a complete key recovery attack on SIDH when the endomorphism ring of the starting curve is unknown within a few seconds on a laptop for all NIST SIKE parameters.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Transferable Preemptive Adversarial Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning technology has brought convenience and advanced developments but has become untrustworthy because of its sensitivity to inconspicuous perturbations (i.e., adversarial attacks). Attackers utilize this sensitivity to slightly manipulate transmitted messages. To defend against such attacks, we have devised a strategy for "attacking" the message before it is attacked. This strategy, dubbed Fast Preemption, provides an efficient transferable preemptive defense by using different models for labeling inputs and learning crucial features. A forward-backward cascade learning algorithm is used to compute protective perturbations, starting with forward propagation optimization to achieve rapid convergence, followed by iterative backward propagation learning to alleviate overfitting. This strategy offers state-of-the-art transferability and protection across various systems. With the running of only three steps, our Fast Preemption framework outperforms benchmark training-time, test-time, and preemptive adversarial defenses. We have also devised the first to our knowledge effective white-box adaptive reversion attack and demonstrate that the protection added by our defense strategy is irreversible unless the backbone model, algorithm, and settings are fully compromised. This work provides a new direction to developing active defenses against adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Learning for Anomaly Detection in Blockchain-based Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain-based supply chain (BSC) systems have tremendously been developed recently and can play an important role in our society in the future. In this study, we develop an anomaly detection model for BSC systems. Our proposed model can detect cyber-attacks at various levels, including the network layer, consensus layer, and beyond, by analyzing only the traffic data at the network layer. To do this, we first build a BSC system at our laboratory to perform experiments and collect datasets. We then propose a novel semi-supervised DAE-MLP (Deep AutoEncoder-Multilayer Perceptron) that combines the advantages of supervised and unsupervised learning to detect anomalies in BSC systems. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for anomaly detection within BSCs, achieving a detection accuracy of 96.5%. Moreover, DAE-MLP can effectively detect new attacks by improving the F1-score up to 33.1% after updating the MLP component.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Penetration Testing using A3C, Q-learning and DQN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Penetration testing is the process of searching for security weaknesses by simulating an attack. It is usually performed by experienced professionals, where scanning and attack tools are applied. By automating the execution of such tools, the need for human interaction and decision-making could be reduced. In this work, a Network Attack Simulator (NASim) was used as an environment to train reinforcement learning agents to solve three predefined security scenarios. These scenarios cover techniques of exploitation, post-exploitation and wiretapping. A large hyperparameter grid search was performed to find the best hyperparameter combinations. The algorithms Q-learning, DQN and A3C were used, whereby A3C was able to solve all scenarios and achieve generalization. In addition, A3C could solve these scenarios with fewer actions than the baseline automated penetration testing. Although the training was performed on rather small scenarios and with small state and action spaces for the agents, the results show that a penetration test can successfully be performed by the RL agent.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Fast and Early Detection of IoT Botnet Threats: A Comprehensive Network Traffic Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber threats targeting the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, and in light of the surge in botnet-driven Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and brute force attacks, this study focuses on the early detection of IoT bots. It specifically addresses the detection of stealth bot communication that precedes and orchestrates attacks. This study proposes a comprehensive methodology for analyzing IoT network traffic, including considerations for both unidirectional and bidirectional flow, as well as packet formats. It explores a wide spectrum of network features critical for representing network traffic and characterizing benign IoT traffic patterns effectively. Moreover, it delves into the modeling of traffic using various semi-supervised learning techniques. Through extensive experimentation with the IoT-23 dataset - a comprehensive collection featuring diverse botnet types and traffic scenarios - we have demonstrated the feasibility of detecting botnet traffic corresponding to different operations and types of bots, specifically focusing on stealth command and control (C2) communications. The results obtained have demonstrated the feasibility of identifying C2 communication with a 100% success rate through packet-based methods and 94% via flow based approaches, with a false positive rate of 1.53%.</description>

      <title>A Life-long Learning Intrusion Detection System for 6G-Enabled IoV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of 6G technology into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) promises to revolutionize connectivity with ultra-high data rates and seamless network coverage. However, this technological leap also brings significant challenges, particularly for the dynamic and diverse IoV landscape, which must meet the rigorous reliability and security requirements of 6G networks. Furthermore, integrating 6G will likely increase the IoV's susceptibility to a spectrum of emerging cyber threats. Therefore, it is crucial for security mechanisms to dynamically adapt and learn new attack patterns, keeping pace with the rapid evolution and diversification of these threats - a capability currently lacking in existing systems. This paper presents a novel intrusion detection system leveraging the paradigm of life-long (or continual) learning. Our methodology combines class-incremental learning with federated learning, an approach ideally suited to the distributed nature of the IoV. This strategy effectively harnesses the collective intelligence of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and edge computing capabilities to train the detection system. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to synergize class-incremental learning with federated learning specifically for cyber attack detection. Through comprehensive experiments on a recent network traffic dataset, our system has exhibited a robust adaptability in learning new cyber attack patterns, while effectively retaining knowledge of previously encountered ones. Additionally, it has proven to maintain high accuracy and a low false positive rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new distinguisher for alternant and Goppa codes, whose complexity is subexponential in the code length. It does not suffer from the strong regime limitations of the previous distinguishers or structure recovery algorithms: in particular, it applies to the codes used in the Classic McEliece candidate for postquantum cryptography standardization. The invariants that allow us to distinguish are graded Betti numbers of the homogeneous coordinate ring of a shortening of the dual code.
  Since its introduction in 1978, this is the first time an analysis of the McEliece cryptosystem breaks the exponential barrier.</description>

      <title>MoRSE: Bridging the Gap in Cybersecurity Expertise with Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MoRSE (Mixture of RAGs Security Experts), the first specialised AI chatbot for cybersecurity. MoRSE aims to provide comprehensive and complete knowledge about cybersecurity. MoRSE uses two RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems designed to retrieve and organize information from multidimensional cybersecurity contexts. MoRSE differs from traditional RAGs by using parallel retrievers that work together to retrieve semantically related information in different formats and structures. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely on Parametric Knowledge Bases, MoRSE retrieves relevant documents from Non-Parametric Knowledge Bases in response to user queries. Subsequently, MoRSE uses this information to generate accurate answers. In addition, MoRSE benefits from real-time updates to its knowledge bases, enabling continuous knowledge enrichment without retraining. We have evaluated the effectiveness of MoRSE against other state-of-the-art LLMs, evaluating the system on 600 cybersecurity specific questions. The experimental evaluation has shown that the improvement in terms of relevance and correctness of the answer is more than 10\% compared to known solutions such as GPT-4 and Mixtral 7x8.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LLMmap, a first-generation fingerprinting attack targeted at LLM-integrated applications. LLMmap employs an active fingerprinting approach, sending carefully crafted queries to the application and analyzing the responses to identify the specific LLM model in use. With as few as 8 interactions, LLMmap can accurately identify LLMs with over 95% accuracy. More importantly, LLMmap is designed to be robust across different application layers, allowing it to identify LLMs operating under various system prompts, stochastic sampling hyperparameters, and even complex generation frameworks such as RAG or Chain-of-Thought.</description>

      <title>Building Call Graph of WebAssembly Programs via Abstract Semantics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WebAssembly is a binary format for code that is gaining popularity thanks to its focus on portability and performance. Currently, the most common use case for WebAssembly is execution in a browser. It is also being increasingly adopted as a stand-alone application due to its portability. The binary format of WebAssembly, however, makes it prone to being used as a vehicle for malicious software. For instance, one could embed a cryptocurrency miner in code executed by a browser. As a result, there is substantial interest in developing tools for WebAssembly security verification, information flow control, and, more generally, for verifying behavioral properties such as correct API usage. In this document, we address the issue of building call graphs for WebAssembly code. This is important because having or computing a call graph is a prerequisite for most inter-procedural verification tasks. In this paper, we propose a formal solution based on the theory of Abstract Interpretation. We compare our approach to the state-of-the-art by predicting how it would perform against a set of specifically crafted benchmark programs.</description>

      <title>Risks of uncertainty propagation in Al-augmented security pipelines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of AI technologies is percolating into the secure development of software-based systems, with an increasing trend of composing AI-based subsystems (with uncertain levels of performance) into automated pipelines. This presents a fundamental research challenge and poses a serious threat to safety-critical domains (e.g., aviation). Despite the existing knowledge about uncertainty in risk analysis, no previous work has estimated the uncertainty of AI-augmented systems given the propagation of errors in the pipeline. We provide the formal underpinnings for capturing uncertainty propagation, develop a simulator to quantify uncertainty, and evaluate the simulation of propagating errors with two case studies. We discuss the generalizability of our approach and present policy implications and recommendations for aviation. Future work includes extending the approach and investigating the required metrics for validation in the aviation domain.</description>

Abstract: Since the advent of generative artificial intelligence, every company and researcher has been rushing to develop their own generative models, whether commercial or not. Given the large number of users of these powerful new tools, there is currently no intrinsically verifiable way to explain from the ground up what happens when LLMs (large language models) learn. For example, those based on automatic speech recognition systems, which have to rely on huge and astronomical amounts of data collected from all over the web to produce fast and efficient results, In this article, we develop a backdoor attack called MarketBackFinal 2.0, based on acoustic data poisoning, MarketBackFinal 2.0 is mainly based on modern stock market models. In order to show the possible vulnerabilities of speech-based transformers that may rely on LLMs.</description>

Abstract: The healthcare industry is currently experiencing an unprecedented wave of cybersecurity attacks, impacting millions of individuals. With the discovery of thousands of vulnerabilities each month, there is a pressing need to drive the automation of vulnerability assessment processes for medical devices, facilitating rapid mitigation efforts. Generative AI systems have revolutionized various industries, offering unparalleled opportunities for automation and increased efficiency. This paper presents a solution leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn from historical evaluations of vulnerabilities for the automatic assessment of vulnerabilities in the medical devices industry. This approach is applied within the portfolio of a single manufacturer, taking into account device characteristics, including existing security posture and controls. The primary contributions of this paper are threefold. Firstly, it provides a detailed examination of the best practices for training a vulnerability Language Model (LM) in an industrial context. Secondly, it presents a comprehensive comparison and insightful analysis of the effectiveness of Language Models in vulnerability assessment. Finally, it proposes a new human-in-the-loop framework to expedite vulnerability evaluation processes.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy with Multiple Selections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the setting where a user with sensitive features wishes to obtain a recommendation from a server in a differentially private fashion. We propose a ``multi-selection'' architecture where the server can send back multiple recommendations and the user chooses one from these that matches best with their private features. When the user feature is one-dimensional -- on an infinite line -- and the accuracy measure is defined w.r.t some increasing function $\mathfrak{h}(.)$ of the distance on the line, we precisely characterize the optimal mechanism that satisfies differential privacy. The specification of the optimal mechanism includes both the distribution of the noise that the user adds to its private value, and the algorithm used by the server to determine the set of results to send back as a response and further show that Laplace is an optimal noise distribution. We further show that this optimal mechanism results in an error that is inversely proportional to the number of results returned when the function $\mathfrak{h}(.)$ is the identity function.</description>

      <title>Data Poisoning: An Overlooked Threat to Power Grid Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the complexities of Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems increase, preserving their resilience becomes more challenging. For instance, maintaining power grid resilience is becoming increasingly complicated due to the growing number of stochastic variables (such as renewable outputs) and extreme weather events that add uncertainty to the grid. Current optimization methods have struggled to accommodate this rise in complexity. This has fueled the growing interest in data-driven methods used to operate the grid, leading to more vulnerability to cyberattacks. One such disruption that is commonly discussed is the adversarial disruption, where the intruder attempts to add a small perturbation to input data in order to "manipulate" the system operation. During the last few years, work on adversarial training and disruptions on the power system has gained popularity. In this paper, we will first review these applications, specifically on the most common types of adversarial disruptions: evasion and poisoning disruptions. Through this review, we highlight the gap between poisoning and evasion research when applied to the power grid. This is due to the underlying assumption that model training is secure, leading to evasion disruptions being the primary type of studied disruption. Finally, we will examine the impacts of data poisoning interventions and showcase how they can endanger power grid resilience.</description>

      <title>Universally Harmonizing Differential Privacy Mechanisms for Federated Learning: Boosting Accuracy and Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) is a promising technique for collaborative model training while ensuring provable privacy for clients. However, optimizing the tradeoff between privacy and accuracy remains a critical challenge. To our best knowledge, we propose the first DP-FL framework (namely UDP-FL), which universally harmonizes any randomization mechanism (e.g., an optimal one) with the Gaussian Moments Accountant (viz. DP-SGD) to significantly boost accuracy and convergence. Specifically, UDP-FL demonstrates enhanced model performance by mitigating the reliance on Gaussian noise. The key mediator variable in this transformation is the R\'enyi Differential Privacy notion, which is carefully used to harmonize privacy budgets. We also propose an innovative method to theoretically analyze the convergence for DP-FL (including our UDP-FL ) based on mode connectivity analysis. Moreover, we evaluate our UDP-FL through extensive experiments benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, demonstrating superior performance on both privacy guarantees and model performance. Notably, UDP-FL exhibits substantial resilience against different inference attacks, indicating a significant advance in safeguarding sensitive data in federated learning environments.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy of Cross-Attention with Provable Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-attention has become a fundamental module nowadays in many important artificial intelligence applications, e.g., retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), system prompt, guided stable diffusion, and many so on. Ensuring cross-attention privacy is crucial and urgently needed because its key and value matrices may contain sensitive information about companies and their users, many of which profit solely from their system prompts or RAG data. In this work, we design a novel differential privacy (DP) data structure to address the privacy security of cross-attention with a theoretical guarantee. In detail, let $n$ be the input token length of system prompt/RAG data, $d$ be the feature dimension, $0 &lt; \alpha \le 1$ be the relative error parameter, $R$ be the maximum value of the query and key matrices, $R_w$ be the maximum value of the value matrix, and $r,s,\epsilon_s$ be parameters of polynomial kernel methods. Then, our data structure requires $\widetilde{O}(ndr^2)$ memory consumption with $\widetilde{O}(nr^2)$ initialization time complexity and $\widetilde{O}(\alpha^{-1} r^2)$ query time complexity for a single token query. In addition, our data structure can guarantee that the user query is $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP with $\widetilde{O}(n^{-1} \epsilon^{-1} \alpha^{-1/2} R^{2s} R_w r^2)$ additive error and $n^{-1} (\alpha + \epsilon_s)$ relative error between our output and the true answer. Furthermore, our result is robust to adaptive queries in which users can intentionally attack the cross-attention system. To our knowledge, this is the first work to provide DP for cross-attention. We believe it can inspire more privacy algorithm design in large generative models (LGMs).</description>

      <title>Flatness-aware Sequential Learning Generates Resilient Backdoors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, backdoor attacks have become an emerging threat to the security of machine learning models. From the adversary's perspective, the implanted backdoors should be resistant to defensive algorithms, but some recently proposed fine-tuning defenses can remove these backdoors with notable efficacy. This is mainly due to the catastrophic forgetting (CF) property of deep neural networks. This paper counters CF of backdoors by leveraging continual learning (CL) techniques. We begin by investigating the connectivity between a backdoored and fine-tuned model in the loss landscape. Our analysis confirms that fine-tuning defenses, especially the more advanced ones, can easily push a poisoned model out of the backdoor regions, making it forget all about the backdoors. Based on this finding, we re-formulate backdoor training through the lens of CL and propose a novel framework, named Sequential Backdoor Learning (SBL), that can generate resilient backdoors. This framework separates the backdoor poisoning process into two tasks: the first task learns a backdoored model, while the second task, based on the CL principles, moves it to a backdoored region resistant to fine-tuning. We additionally propose to seek flatter backdoor regions via a sharpness-aware minimizer in the framework, further strengthening the durability of the implanted backdoor. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive empirical experiments on several benchmark datasets in the backdoor domain.

      <title>Operationalizing a Threat Model for Red-Teaming Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating secure and resilient applications with large language models (LLM) requires anticipating, adjusting to, and countering unforeseen threats. Red-teaming has emerged as a critical technique for identifying vulnerabilities in real-world LLM implementations. This paper presents a detailed threat model and provides a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of red-teaming attacks on LLMs. We develop a taxonomy of attacks based on the stages of the LLM development and deployment process and extract various insights from previous research. In addition, we compile methods for defense and practical red-teaming strategies for practitioners. By delineating prominent attack motifs and shedding light on various entry points, this paper provides a framework for improving the security and robustness of LLM-based systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Intrusion Detection: Combining $\chi^2$ Feature Selection with CNN-BiLSTM on the UNSW-NB15 Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have played a significant role in the detection and prevention of cyber-attacks in traditional computing systems. It is not surprising that this technology is now being applied to secure Internet of Things (IoT) networks against cyber threats. However, the limited computational resources available on IoT devices pose a challenge for deploying conventional computing-based IDSs. IDSs designed for IoT environments must demonstrate high classification performance, and utilize low-complexity models. Developing intrusion detection models in the field of IoT has seen significant advancements. However, achieving a balance between high classification performance and reduced complexity remains a challenging endeavor. In this research, we present an effective IDS model that addresses this issue by combining a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). Additionally, we employ feature selection techniques to minimize the number of features inputted into the model, thereby reducing its complexity. This approach renders the proposed model highly suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices, ensuring it meets their computation capability requirements. Creating a model that meets the demands of IoT devices and attains enhanced precision is a challenging task. However, our suggested model outperforms previous works in the literature by attaining a remarkable accuracy rate of 97.90% within a prediction time of 1.1 seconds for binary classification. Furthermore, it achieves an accuracy rate of 97.09% within a prediction time of 2.10 seconds for multiclassification.</description>

      <title>Arondight: Red Teaming Large Vision Language Models with Auto-generated Multi-modal Jailbreak Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend and enhance the perceptual abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite offering new possibilities for LLM applications, these advancements raise significant security and ethical concerns, particularly regarding the generation of harmful content. While LLMs have undergone extensive security evaluations with the aid of red teaming frameworks, VLMs currently lack a well-developed one. To fill this gap, we introduce Arondight, a standardized red team framework tailored specifically for VLMs. Arondight is dedicated to resolving issues related to the absence of visual modality and inadequate diversity encountered when transitioning existing red teaming methodologies from LLMs to VLMs. Our framework features an automated multi-modal jailbreak attack, wherein visual jailbreak prompts are produced by a red team VLM, and textual prompts are generated by a red team LLM guided by a reinforcement learning agent. To enhance the comprehensiveness of VLM security evaluation, we integrate entropy bonuses and novelty reward metrics. These elements incentivize the RL agent to guide the red team LLM in creating a wider array of diverse and previously unseen test cases. Our evaluation of ten cutting-edge VLMs exposes significant security vulnerabilities, particularly in generating toxic images and aligning multi-modal prompts. In particular, our Arondight achieves an average attack success rate of 84.5\% on GPT-4 in all fourteen prohibited scenarios defined by OpenAI in terms of generating toxic text. For a clearer comparison, we also categorize existing VLMs based on their safety levels and provide corresponding reinforcement recommendations. Our multimodal prompt dataset and red team code will be released after ethics committee approval. CONTENT WARNING: THIS PAPER CONTAINS HARMFUL MODEL RESPONSES.</description>

      <title>SNIP: Speculative Execution and Non-Interference Preservation for Compiler Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of preserving non-interference across compiler transformations under speculative semantics. We develop a proof method that ensures the preservation uniformly across all source programs. The basis of our proof method is a new form of simulation relation. It operates over directives that model the attacker's control over the micro-architectural state, and it accounts for the fact that the compiler transformation may change the influence of the micro-architectural state on the execution (and hence the directives). Using our proof method, we show the correctness of dead code elimination. When we tried to prove register allocation correct, we identified a previously unknown weakness that introduces violations to non-interference. We have confirmed the weakness for a mainstream compiler on code from the libsodium cryptographic library. To reclaim security once more, we develop a novel static analysis that operates on a product of source program and register-allocated program. Using the analysis, we present an automated fix to existing register allocation implementations. We prove the correctness of the fixed register allocations with our proof method.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Deep Reinforcement Learning Backdoors in the Neural Activation Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the threat of backdoors in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent policies and proposes a novel method for their detection at runtime. Our study focuses on elusive in-distribution backdoor triggers. Such triggers are designed to induce a deviation in the behaviour of a backdoored agent while blending into the expected data distribution to evade detection. Through experiments conducted in the Atari Breakout environment, we demonstrate the limitations of current sanitisation methods when faced with such triggers and investigate why they present a challenging defence problem. We then evaluate the hypothesis that backdoor triggers might be easier to detect in the neural activation space of the DRL agent's policy network. Our statistical analysis shows that indeed the activation patterns in the agent's policy network are distinct in the presence of a trigger, regardless of how well the trigger is concealed in the environment. Based on this, we propose a new defence approach that uses a classifier trained on clean environment samples and detects abnormal activations. Our results show that even lightweight classifiers can effectively prevent malicious actions with considerable accuracy, indicating the potential of this research direction even against sophisticated adversaries.</description>

      <title>Back-in-Time Diffusion: Unsupervised Detection of Medical Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in generative models has made it easier for a wide audience to edit and create image content, raising concerns about the proliferation of deepfakes, especially in healthcare. Despite the availability of numerous techniques for detecting manipulated images captured by conventional cameras, their applicability to medical images is limited. This limitation stems from the distinctive forensic characteristics of medical images, a result of their imaging process.
  In this work we propose a novel anomaly detector for medical imagery based on diffusion models. Normally, diffusion models are used to generate images. However, we show how a similar process can be used to detect synthetic content by making a model reverse the diffusion on a suspected image. We evaluate our method on the task of detecting fake tumors injected and removed from CT and MRI scans. Our method significantly outperforms other state of the art unsupervised detectors with an increased AUC of 0.9 from 0.79 for injection and of 0.96 from 0.91 for removal on average.</description>

      <title>When Do Universal Image Jailbreaks Transfer Between Vision-Language Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of new modalities into frontier AI systems offers exciting capabilities, but also increases the possibility such systems can be adversarially manipulated in undesirable ways. In this work, we focus on a popular class of vision-language models (VLMs) that generate text outputs conditioned on visual and textual inputs. We conducted a large-scale empirical study to assess the transferability of gradient-based universal image "jailbreaks" using a diverse set of over 40 open-parameter VLMs, including 18 new VLMs that we publicly release. Overall, we find that transferable gradient-based image jailbreaks are extremely difficult to obtain. When an image jailbreak is optimized against a single VLM or against an ensemble of VLMs, the jailbreak successfully jailbreaks the attacked VLM(s), but exhibits little-to-no transfer to any other VLMs; transfer is not affected by whether the attacked and target VLMs possess matching vision backbones or language models, whether the language model underwent instruction-following and/or safety-alignment training, or many other factors. Only two settings display partially successful transfer: between identically-pretrained and identically-initialized VLMs with slightly different VLM training data, and between different training checkpoints of a single VLM. Leveraging these results, we then demonstrate that transfer can be significantly improved against a specific target VLM by attacking larger ensembles of "highly-similar" VLMs. These results stand in stark contrast to existing evidence of universal and transferable text jailbreaks against language models and transferable adversarial attacks against image classifiers, suggesting that VLMs may be more robust to gradient-based transfer attacks.</description>

      <title>PUFFLE: Balancing Privacy, Utility, and Fairness in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training and deploying Machine Learning models that simultaneously adhere to principles of fairness and privacy while ensuring good utility poses a significant challenge. The interplay between these three factors of trustworthiness is frequently underestimated and remains insufficiently explored. Consequently, many efforts focus on ensuring only two of these factors, neglecting one in the process. The decentralization of the datasets and the variations in distributions among the clients exacerbate the complexity of achieving this ethical trade-off in the context of Federated Learning (FL). For the first time in FL literature, we address these three factors of trustworthiness. We introduce PUFFLE, a high-level parameterised approach that can help in the exploration of the balance between utility, privacy, and fairness in FL scenarios. We prove that PUFFLE can be effective across diverse datasets, models, and data distributions, reducing the model unfairness up to 75%, with a maximum reduction in the utility of 17% in the worst-case scenario, while maintaining strict privacy guarantees during the FL training.</description>

      <title>Poisoning with A Pill: Circumventing Detection in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Without direct access to the client's data, federated learning (FL) is well-known for its unique strength in data privacy protection among existing distributed machine learning techniques. However, its distributive and iterative nature makes FL inherently vulnerable to various poisoning attacks. To counteract these threats, extensive defenses have been proposed to filter out malicious clients, using various detection metrics. Based on our analysis of existing attacks and defenses, we find that there is a lack of attention to model redundancy. In neural networks, various model parameters contribute differently to the model's performance. However, existing attacks in FL manipulate all the model update parameters with the same strategy, making them easily detectable by common defenses. Meanwhile, the defenses also tend to analyze the overall statistical features of the entire model updates, leaving room for sophisticated attacks. Based on these observations, this paper proposes a generic and attack-agnostic augmentation approach designed to enhance the effectiveness and stealthiness of existing FL poisoning attacks against detection in FL, pointing out the inherent flaws of existing defenses and exposing the necessity of fine-grained FL security. Specifically, we employ a three-stage methodology that strategically constructs, generates, and injects poison (generated by existing attacks) into a pill (a tiny subnet with a novel structure) during the FL training, named as pill construction, pill poisoning, and pill injection accordingly. Extensive experimental results show that FL poisoning attacks enhanced by our method can bypass all the popular defenses, and can gain an up to 7x error rate increase, as well as on average a more than 2x error rate increase on both IID and non-IID data, in both cross-silo and cross-device FL systems.</description>

      <title>Imposter.AI: Adversarial Attacks with Hidden Intentions towards Aligned Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, both their vast applications and potential vulnerabilities have come to the forefront. While developers have integrated multiple safety mechanisms to mitigate their misuse, a risk remains, particularly when models encounter adversarial inputs. This study unveils an attack mechanism that capitalizes on human conversation strategies to extract harmful information from LLMs. We delineate three pivotal strategies: (i) decomposing malicious questions into seemingly innocent sub-questions; (ii) rewriting overtly malicious questions into more covert, benign-sounding ones; (iii) enhancing the harmfulness of responses by prompting models for illustrative examples. Unlike conventional methods that target explicit malicious responses, our approach delves deeper into the nature of the information provided in responses. Through our experiments conducted on GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and Llama2, our method has demonstrated a marked efficacy compared to conventional attack methods. In summary, this work introduces a novel attack method that outperforms previous approaches, raising an important question: How to discern whether the ultimate intent in a dialogue is malicious?</description>

      <title>Weights Shuffling for Improving DPSGD in Transformer-based Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms, especially in high-dimensional settings, often face the challenge of maintaining privacy without compromising the data utility. This work introduces an innovative shuffling mechanism in Differentially-Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) to enhance the utility of large models at the same privacy guarantee of the unshuffled case. Specifically, we reveal that random shuffling brings additional randomness to the trajectory of gradient descent while not impacting the model accuracy by the permutation invariance property -- the model can be equivalently computed in both forward and backward propagations under permutation. We show that permutation indeed improves the privacy guarantee of DPSGD in theory, but tracking the exact privacy loss on shuffled model is particularly challenging. Hence we exploit the approximation on sum of lognormal distributions to derive the condition for the shuffled DPSGD to meet the DP guarantee. Auditing results show that our condition offers a DP guarantee quite close to the audited privacy level, demonstrating our approach an effective estimation in practice. Experimental results have verified our theoretical derivation and illustrate that our mechanism improves the accuracy of DPSGD over the state-of-the-art baselines on a variety of models and tasks.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Image Learning: Preserving Performance and Preventing Membership Inference Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has transformed the generation of synthetic data, providing innovative solutions to challenges like data scarcity and privacy, which are particularly critical in fields such as medicine. However, the effective use of this synthetic data to train high-performance models remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses this issue by introducing Knowledge Recycling (KR), a pipeline designed to optimise the generation and use of synthetic data for training downstream classifiers. At the heart of this pipeline is Generative Knowledge Distillation (GKD), the proposed technique that significantly improves the quality and usefulness of the information provided to classifiers through a synthetic dataset regeneration and soft labelling mechanism. The KR pipeline has been tested on a variety of datasets, with a focus on six highly heterogeneous medical image datasets, ranging from retinal images to organ scans. The results show a significant reduction in the performance gap between models trained on real and synthetic data, with models based on synthetic data outperforming those trained on real data in some cases. Furthermore, the resulting models show almost complete immunity to Membership Inference Attacks, manifesting privacy properties missing in models trained with conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Training Data From Real World Models Trained with Transfer Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current methods for reconstructing training data from trained classifiers are restricted to very small models, limited training set sizes, and low-resolution images. Such restrictions hinder their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel approach enabling data reconstruction in realistic settings for models trained on high-resolution images. Our method adapts the reconstruction scheme of arXiv:2206.07758 to real-world scenarios -- specifically, targeting models trained via transfer learning over image embeddings of large pre-trained models like DINO-ViT and CLIP. Our work employs data reconstruction in the embedding space rather than in the image space, showcasing its applicability beyond visual data. Moreover, we introduce a novel clustering-based method to identify good reconstructions from thousands of candidates. This significantly improves on previous works that relied on knowledge of the training set to identify good reconstructed images. Our findings shed light on a potential privacy risk for data leakage from models trained using transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Under-confidence Backdoors Are Resilient and Stealthy Backdoors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By injecting a small number of poisoned samples into the training set, backdoor attacks aim to make the victim model produce designed outputs on any input injected with pre-designed backdoors. In order to achieve a high attack success rate using as few poisoned training samples as possible, most existing attack methods change the labels of the poisoned samples to the target class. This practice often results in severe over-fitting of the victim model over the backdoors, making the attack quite effective in output control but easier to be identified by human inspection or automatic defense algorithms.
  In this work, we proposed a label-smoothing strategy to overcome the over-fitting problem of these attack methods, obtaining a \textit{Label-Smoothed Backdoor Attack} (LSBA). In the LSBA, the label of the poisoned sample $\bm{x}$ will be changed to the target class with a probability of $p_n(\bm{x})$ instead of 100\%, and the value of $p_n(\bm{x})$ is specifically designed to make the prediction probability the target class be only slightly greater than those of the other classes. Empirical studies on several existing backdoor attacks show that our strategy can considerably improve the stealthiness of these attacks and, at the same time, achieve a high attack success rate. In addition, our strategy makes it able to manually control the prediction probability of the design output through manipulating the applied and activated number of LSBAs\footnote{Source code will be published at \url{https://github.com/v-mipeng/LabelSmoothedAttack.git}}.</description>

      <title>Split Learning without Local Weight Sharing to Enhance Client-side Data Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Split learning (SL) aims to protect user data privacy by distributing deep models between client-server and keeping private data locally. In SL training with multiple clients, the local model weights are shared among the clients for local model update. This paper first reveals data privacy leakage exacerbated from local weight sharing among the clients in SL through model inversion attacks. Then, to reduce the data privacy leakage issue, we propose and analyze privacy-enhanced SL (P-SL) (or SL without local weight sharing). We further propose parallelized P-SL to expedite the training process by duplicating multiple server-side model instances without compromising accuracy. Finally, we explore P-SL with late participating clients and devise a server-side cache-based training method to address the forgetting phenomenon in SL when late clients join. Experimental results demonstrate that P-SL helps reduce up to 50% of client-side data leakage, which essentially achieves a better privacy-accuracy trade-off than the current trend by using differential privacy mechanisms. Moreover, P-SL and its cache-based version achieve comparable accuracy to baseline SL under various data distributions, while cost less computation and communication. Additionally, caching-based training in P-SL mitigates the negative effect of forgetting, stabilizes the learning, and enables practical and low-complexity training in a dynamic environment with late-arriving clients.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the RSA Algorithm: An Intuitive Introduction for Novices in Cybersecurity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the escalating importance of cybersecurity, it becomes increasingly beneficial for a diverse community to comprehend fundamental security mechanisms. Among these, the RSA algorithm stands out as a crucial component in public-key cryptosystems. However, understanding the RSA algorithm typically entails familiarity with number theory, modular arithmetic, and related concepts, which can often exceed the knowledge base of beginners entering the field of cybersecurity. In this study, we present an intuitively crafted, student-oriented introduction to the RSA algorithm. We assume that our readers possess only a basic background in mathematics and cybersecurity. Commencing with the three essential goals of public-key cryptosystems, we provide a step-by-step elucidation of how the RSA algorithm accomplishes these objectives. Additionally, we employ a toy example to further enhance practical understanding. Our assessment of student learning outcomes, conducted across two sections of the same course, reveals a discernible improvement in grades for the students.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Accuracy-Privacy Trade-off in Differentially Private Split Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Split learning (SL) aims to protect user data privacy by distributing deep models between client-server and keeping private data locally. Only processed or `smashed' data can be transmitted from the clients to the server during the SL process. However, recently proposed model inversion attacks can recover the original data from the smashed data. In order to enhance privacy protection against such attacks, a strategy is to adopt differential privacy (DP), which involves safeguarding the smashed data at the expense of some accuracy loss. This paper presents the first investigation into the impact on accuracy when training multiple clients in SL with various privacy requirements. Subsequently, we propose an approach that reviews the DP noise distributions of other clients during client training to address the identified accuracy degradation. We also examine the application of DP to the local model of SL to gain insights into the trade-off between accuracy and privacy. Specifically, findings reveal that introducing noise in the later local layers offers the most favorable balance between accuracy and privacy. Drawing from our insights in the shallower layers, we propose an approach to reduce the size of smashed data to minimize data leakage while maintaining higher accuracy, optimizing the accuracy-privacy trade-off. Additionally, a smaller size of smashed data reduces communication overhead on the client side, mitigating one of the notable drawbacks of SL. Experiments with popular datasets demonstrate that our proposed approaches provide an optimal trade-off for incorporating DP into SL, ultimately enhancing training accuracy for multi-client SL with varying privacy requirements.</description>

      <title>DPI: Ensuring Strict Differential Privacy for Infinite Data Streaming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Streaming data, crucial for applications like crowdsourcing analytics, behavior studies, and real-time monitoring, faces significant privacy risks due to the large and diverse data linked to individuals. In particular, recent efforts to release data streams, using the rigorous privacy notion of differential privacy (DP), have encountered issues with unbounded privacy leakage. This challenge limits their applicability to only a finite number of time slots (''finite data stream'') or relaxation to protecting the events (''event or $w$-event DP'') rather than all the records of users. A persistent challenge is managing the sensitivity of outputs to inputs in situations where users contribute many activities and data distributions evolve over time. In this paper, we present a novel technique for Differentially Private data streaming over Infinite disclosure (DPI) that effectively bounds the total privacy leakage of each user in infinite data streams while enabling accurate data collection and analysis. Furthermore, we also maximize the accuracy of DPI via a novel boosting mechanism. Finally, extensive experiments across various streaming applications and real datasets (e.g., COVID-19, Network Traffic, and USDA Production), show that DPI maintains high utility for infinite data streams in diverse settings. Code for DPI is available at https://github.com/ShuyaFeng/DPI.</description>

      <title>The Dark Side of NFTs: A Large-Scale Empirical Study of Wash Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) have seen significant growth since they first captured public attention in 2021. However, the NFT market is plagued by fake transactions and economic bubbles, e.g., NFT wash trading. Wash trading typically refers to a transaction involving the same person or two colluding individuals, and has become a major threat to the NFT ecosystem. Previous studies only detect NFT wash trading from the financial aspect, while the real-world wash trading cases are much more complicated (e.g., not aiming at inflating the market value). There is still a lack of multi-dimension analysis to better understand NFT wash trading. Therefore, we present the most comprehensive study of NFT wash trading, analyzing 8,717,031 transfer events and 3,830,141 sale events from 2,701,883 NFTs. We first optimize the dataset collected via the OpenSea API. Next, we identify three types of NFT wash trading and propose identification algorithms. Our experimental results reveal 824 transfer events and 5,330 sale events (accounting for a total of \$8,857,070.41) and 370 address pairs related to NFT wash trading behaviors, causing a minimum loss of \$3,965,247.13. Furthermore, we provide insights from six aspects, i.e., marketplace design, profitability, NFT project design, payment token, user behavior, and NFT ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Advancing TTP Analysis: Harnessing the Power of Large Language Models with Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) outline the methods attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities. The interpretation of TTPs in the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework can be challenging for cybersecurity practitioners due to presumed expertise and complex dependencies. Meanwhile, advancements with Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to recent surge in studies exploring its uses in cybersecurity operations. It is, however, unclear how LLMs can be used in an efficient and proper way to provide accurate responses for critical domains such as cybersecurity. This leads us to investigate how to better use two types of LLMs: small-scale encoder-only (e.g., RoBERTa) and larger decoder-only (e.g., GPT-3.5) LLMs to comprehend and summarize TTPs with the intended purposes (i.e., tactics) of a cyberattack procedure. This work studies and compares the uses of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of encoder-only LLMs vs. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for decoder-only LLMs (without fine-tuning). Both SFT and RAG techniques presumably enhance the LLMs with relevant contexts for each cyberattack procedure. Our studies show decoder-only LLMs with RAG achieves better performance than encoder-only models with SFT, particularly when directly relevant context is extracted by RAG. The decoder-only results could suffer low `Precision' while achieving high `Recall'. Our findings further highlight a counter-intuitive observation that more generic prompts tend to yield better predictions of cyberattack tactics than those that are more specifically tailored.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Countermeasures Against Static Power Side-Channel Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel defense strategy against static power side-channel attacks (PSCAs), a critical threat to cryptographic security. Our method is based on (1) carefully tuning high-Vth versus low-Vth cell selection during synthesis, accounting for both security and timing impact, and (2), at runtime, randomly switching the operation between these cells. This approach serves to significantly obscure static power patterns, which are at the heart of static PSCAs. Our experimental results on a commercial 28nm node show a drastic increase in the effort required for a successful attack, namely up to 96 times more traces. When compared to prior countermeasures, ours incurs little cost, making it a lightweight defense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reviews and ratings by users form a central component in several widely used products today (e.g., product reviews, ratings of online content, etc.), but today's platforms for managing such reviews are ad-hoc and vulnerable to various forms of tampering and hijack by fake reviews either by bots or motivated paid workers. We define a new metric called 'hijack-resistance' for such review platforms, and then present TrustRate, an end-to-end decentralized, hijack-resistant platform for authentic, anonymous, tamper-proof reviews. With a prototype implementation and evaluation at the scale of thousands of nodes, we demonstrate the efficacy and performance of our platform, towards a new paradigm for building products based on trusted reviews by end users without having to trust a single organization that manages the reviews.</description>

      <title>Constrained Decoding for Secure Code Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have been increasingly used by developers to boost productivity, but they often generate vulnerable code. Thus, there is an urgent need to ensure that code generated by Code LLMs is correct and secure. Previous research has primarily focused on generating secure code, overlooking the fact that secure code also needs to be correct. This oversight can lead to a false sense of security. Currently, the community lacks a method to measure actual progress in this area, and we need solutions that address both security and correctness of code generation.
  This paper introduces a new benchmark, CodeGuard+, along with two new metrics, to measure Code LLMs' ability to generate both secure and correct code. Using our new evaluation methods, we show that the state-of-the-art defense technique, prefix tuning, may not be as strong as previously believed, since it generates secure code but sacrifices functional correctness. We also demonstrate that different decoding methods significantly affect the security of Code LLMs.
  Furthermore, we explore a new defense direction: constrained decoding for secure code generation. We propose new constrained decoding techniques to generate secure code. Our results reveal that constrained decoding is more effective than prefix tuning to improve the security of Code LLMs, without requiring a specialized training dataset. Moreover, our evaluations over eight state-of-the-art Code LLMs show that constrained decoding has strong performance to improve the security of Code LLMs, and our technique outperforms GPT-4.</description>

      <title>Secure Inference for Vertically Partitioned Data Using Multiparty Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a secure inference protocol for a distributed setting involving a single server node and multiple client nodes. We assume that the observed data vector is partitioned across multiple client nodes while the deep learning model is located at the server node. Each client node is required to encrypt its portion of the data vector and transmit the resulting ciphertext to the server node. The server node is required to collect the ciphertexts and perform inference in the encrypted domain. We demonstrate an application of multi-party homomorphic encryption (MPHE) to satisfy these requirements. We propose a packing scheme, that enables the server to form the ciphertext of the complete data by aggregating the ciphertext of data subsets encrypted using MPHE. While our proposed protocol builds upon prior horizontal federated training protocol~\cite{sav2020poseidon}, we focus on the inference for vertically partitioned data and avoid the transmission of (encrypted) model weights from the server node to the client nodes.</description>

Abstract: Human mobility data offers valuable insights for many applications such as urban planning and pandemic response, but its use also raises privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce the Hierarchical and Multi-Resolution Network (HRNet), a novel deep generative model specifically designed to synthesize realistic human mobility data while guaranteeing differential privacy. We first identify the key difficulties inherent in learning human mobility data under differential privacy. In response to these challenges, HRNet integrates three components: a hierarchical location encoding mechanism, multi-task learning across multiple resolutions, and private pre-training. These elements collectively enhance the model's ability under the constraints of differential privacy. Through extensive comparative experiments utilizing a real-world dataset, HRNet demonstrates a marked improvement over existing methods in balancing the utility-privacy trade-off.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM watermarking, which embeds imperceptible yet algorithmically detectable signals in model outputs to identify LLM-generated text, has become crucial in mitigating the potential misuse of large language models. However, the abundance of LLM watermarking algorithms, their intricate mechanisms, and the complex evaluation procedures and perspectives pose challenges for researchers and the community to easily experiment with, understand, and assess the latest advancements. To address these issues, we introduce MarkLLM, an open-source toolkit for LLM watermarking. MarkLLM offers a unified and extensible framework for implementing LLM watermarking algorithms, while providing user-friendly interfaces to ensure ease of access. Furthermore, it enhances understanding by supporting automatic visualization of the underlying mechanisms of these algorithms. For evaluation, MarkLLM offers a comprehensive suite of 12 tools spanning three perspectives, along with two types of automated evaluation pipelines. Through MarkLLM, we aim to support researchers while improving the comprehension and involvement of the general public in LLM watermarking technology, fostering consensus and driving further advancements in research and application.

      <description>arXiv:2407.06911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of differential privacy in the context of graph cuts, specifically focusing on the minimum $k$-cut and multiway cut problems. We introduce edge-differentially private algorithms that achieve nearly optimal performance for these problems.
  For the multiway cut problem, we first provide a private algorithm with a multiplicative approximation ratio that matches the state-of-the-art non-private algorithm. We then present a tight information-theoretic lower bound on the additive error, demonstrating that our algorithm on weighted graphs is near-optimal for constant $k$. For the minimum $k$-cut problem, our algorithms leverage a known bound on the number of approximate $k$-cuts, resulting in a private algorithm with optimal additive error $O(k\log n)$ for fixed privacy parameter. We also establish a information-theoretic lower bound that matches this additive error. Additionally, we give an efficient private algorithm for $k$-cut even for non-constant $k$, including a polynomial-time 2-approximation with an additive error of $\widetilde{O}(k^{1.5})$.</description>

      <title>TAPI: Towards Target-Specific and Adversarial Prompt Injection against Code LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) have been widely and successfully used to simplify and facilitate code programming. With these tools, developers can easily generate desired complete functional codes based on incomplete code and natural language prompts. However, a few pioneering works revealed that these Code LLMs are also vulnerable, e.g., against backdoor and adversarial attacks. The former could induce LLMs to respond to triggers to insert malicious code snippets by poisoning the training data or model parameters, while the latter can craft malicious adversarial input codes to reduce the quality of generated codes. However, both attack methods have underlying limitations: backdoor attacks rely on controlling the model training process, while adversarial attacks struggle with fulfilling specific malicious purposes.
  To inherit the advantages of both backdoor and adversarial attacks, this paper proposes a new attack paradigm, i.e., target-specific and adversarial prompt injection (TAPI), against Code LLMs. TAPI generates unreadable comments containing information about malicious instructions and hides them as triggers in the external source code. When users exploit Code LLMs to complete codes containing the trigger, the models will generate attacker-specified malicious code snippets at specific locations. We evaluate our TAPI attack on four representative LLMs under three representative malicious objectives and seven cases. The results show that our method is highly threatening (achieving an attack success rate of up to 98.3%) and stealthy (saving an average of 53.1% of tokens in the trigger design). In particular, we successfully attack some famous deployed code completion integrated applications, including CodeGeex and Github Copilot. This further confirms the realistic threat of our attack.</description>

      <title>A2E: Attribute-based Anonymity-Enhanced Authentication for Accessing Driverless Taxi Service</title>

Abstract: Driverless vehicle as a taxi is gaining more attention due to its potential to enhance urban transportation efficiency. However, both unforeseen incidents led by unsupervised physical users' driverless taxi (DT) rides and personalized needs of users when riding in a DT necessitate the authentication of user identity and attributes. Moreover, safeguarding user identity privacy and quickly tracing malicious users if necessary to enhance the adoption of DTs remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel Attribute-based Anonymity Enhanced (A2E) authentication scheme for users to access DT service. From the security aspect, A2E has attribute verifiability, which is achieved by designing a user attribute credential based on redactable signature. Meanwhile, this attribute credential also satisfies unlinkability and unforgeability. In addition, A2E has enhanced anonymity, which is achieved by designing a decentralized credential issuance mechanism utilizing ring signature and secret sharing, safeguarding user attributes from association with anonymous identities. Moreover, this mechanism provides traceability and non-frameability to users. From the performance aspect, A2E causes low overhead when tracing malicious users and updating credentials. Besides, both scalability and lightweight are satisfied, which contributes to A2E's practicability. We conduct security analysis and performance evaluation to the security and performance capabilities of A2E.</description>

      <title>INTELLECT: Adapting Cyber Threat Detection to Heterogeneous Computing Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of cloud computing, edge, and IoT has increased the attack surface for cyber threats. This is due to the large-scale deployment of often unsecured, heterogeneous devices with varying hardware and software configurations. The diversity of these devices attracts a wide array of potential attack methods, making it challenging for individual organizations to have comprehensive knowledge of all possible threats. In this context, powerful anomaly detection models can be developed by combining data from different parties using Federated Learning. FL enables the collaborative development of ML-based IDSs without requiring the parties to disclose sensitive training data, such as network traffic or sensor readings. However, deploying the resulting models can be challenging, as they may require more computational resources than those available on target devices with limited capacity or already allocated for other operations. Training device-specific models is not feasible for an organization because a significant portion of the training data is private to other participants in the FL process. To address these challenges, this paper introduces INTELLECT, a novel solution that integrates feature selection, model pruning, and fine-tuning techniques into a cohesive pipeline for the dynamic adaptation of pre-trained ML models and configurations for IDSs. Through empirical evaluation, we analyze the benefits of INTELLECT's approach in tailoring ML models to the specific resource constraints of an organization's devices and measure variations in traffic classification accuracy resulting from feature selection, pruning, and fine-tuning operations. Additionally, we demonstrate the advantages of incorporating knowledge distillation techniques while fine-tuning, enabling the ML model to consistently adapt to local network patterns while preserving historical knowledge.</description>

      <title>A Decentralised Digital Token Architecture for Public Transport</title>

Abstract: Digitisation is often viewed as beneficial to a user. Whereas traditionally, people would physically have to identify to a service, pay for a ticket in cash, or go into a library to access a book, people can now achieve all of this through a click of a button. Such actions may seem functionally identical to their analogue counterparts, but in the digital case, a user's actions are automatically recorded. The recording of user's interactions presents a problem because once the information is collected, it is outside of the control of the person whom it concerns. This issue is only exacerbated by the centralisation of the authentication mechanisms underpinning the aforementioned services, permitting the aggregation and analysis of even more data. This work aims to motivate the need and establish the feasibility of the application of a privacy-enhancing digital token management service to public transit. A proof-of-concept implementation is developed, building upon a design proposed by Goodell and Aste. This implementation was optimised for the public transport use case. Its performance is tested in a local environment to better understand the technical challenges and assess the technical feasibility of the system in a production setting. It was observed that for loads between one and five requests per second the proof-of-concept performs comparably to other contactless payment systems, with a maximum median response time less than two seconds. Due to hardware bottlenecks, reliable throughput in our test environment was limited to five requests per second. The demonstrated throughput and latency indicate that the system can feasibly compete with solutions currently in use. Yet, further work is needed to demonstrate their performance characteristics in an environment similar to that experienced in production.</description>

      <title>Selective Amnesia: On Efficient, High-Fidelity and Blind Suppression of Backdoor Effects in Trojaned Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a simple yet surprisingly effective technique to induce "selective amnesia" on a backdoored model. Our approach, called SEAM, has been inspired by the problem of catastrophic forgetting (CF), a long standing issue in continual learning. Our idea is to retrain a given DNN model on randomly labeled clean data, to induce a CF on the model, leading to a sudden forget on both primary and backdoor tasks; then we recover the primary task by retraining the randomized model on correctly labeled clean data. We analyzed SEAM by modeling the unlearning process as continual learning and further approximating a DNN using Neural Tangent Kernel for measuring CF. Our analysis shows that our random-labeling approach actually maximizes the CF on an unknown backdoor in the absence of triggered inputs, and also preserves some feature extraction in the network to enable a fast revival of the primary task. We further evaluated SEAM on both image processing and Natural Language Processing tasks, under both data contamination and training manipulation attacks, over thousands of models either trained on popular image datasets or provided by the TrojAI competition. Our experiments show that SEAM vastly outperforms the state-of-the-art unlearning techniques, achieving a high Fidelity (measuring the gap between the accuracy of the primary task and that of the backdoor) within a few minutes (about 30 times faster than training a model from scratch using the MNIST dataset), with only a small amount of clean data (0.1% of training data for TrojAI models).</description>

      <title>BAFFLE: A Baseline of Backpropagation-Free Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a general principle for decentralized clients to train a server model collectively without sharing local data. FL is a promising framework with practical applications, but its standard training paradigm requires the clients to backpropagate through the model to compute gradients. Since these clients are typically edge devices and not fully trusted, executing backpropagation on them incurs computational and storage overhead as well as white-box vulnerability. In light of this, we develop backpropagation-free federated learning, dubbed BAFFLE, in which backpropagation is replaced by multiple forward processes to estimate gradients. BAFFLE is 1) memory-efficient and easily fits uploading bandwidth; 2) compatible with inference-only hardware optimization and model quantization or pruning; and 3) well-suited to trusted execution environments, because the clients in BAFFLE only execute forward propagation and return a set of scalars to the server. Empirically we use BAFFLE to train deep models from scratch or to finetune pretrained models, achieving acceptable results. Code is available in https://github.com/FengHZ/BAFFLE.</description>

      <title>Improving the Accuracy-Robustness Trade-Off of Classifiers via Adaptive Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12554v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While prior research has proposed a plethora of methods that build neural classifiers robust against adversarial robustness, practitioners are still reluctant to adopt them due to their unacceptably severe clean accuracy penalties. This paper significantly alleviates this accuracy-robustness trade-off by mixing the output probabilities of a standard classifier and a robust classifier, where the standard network is optimized for clean accuracy and is not robust in general. We show that the robust base classifier's confidence difference for correct and incorrect examples is the key to this improvement. In addition to providing intuitions and empirical evidence, we theoretically certify the robustness of the mixed classifier under realistic assumptions. Furthermore, we adapt an adversarial input detector into a mixing network that adaptively adjusts the mixture of the two base models, further reducing the accuracy penalty of achieving robustness. The proposed flexible method, termed "adaptive smoothing", can work in conjunction with existing or even future methods that improve clean accuracy, robustness, or adversary detection. Our empirical evaluation considers strong attack methods, including AutoAttack and adaptive attack. On the CIFAR-100 dataset, our method achieves an 85.21% clean accuracy while maintaining a 38.72% $\ell_\infty$-AutoAttacked ($\epsilon = 8/255$) accuracy, becoming the second most robust method on the RobustBench CIFAR-100 benchmark as of submission, while improving the clean accuracy by ten percentage points compared with all listed models. The code that implements our method is available at https://github.com/Bai-YT/AdaptiveSmoothing.</description>

      <title>Augment then Smooth: Reconciling Differential Privacy with Certified Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are susceptible to a variety of attacks that can erode trust, including attacks against the privacy of training data, and adversarial examples that jeopardize model accuracy. Differential privacy and certified robustness are effective frameworks for combating these two threats respectively, as they each provide future-proof guarantees. However, we show that standard differentially private model training is insufficient for providing strong certified robustness guarantees. Indeed, combining differential privacy and certified robustness in a single system is non-trivial, leading previous works to introduce complex training schemes that lack flexibility. In this work, we present DP-CERT, a simple and effective method that achieves both privacy and robustness guarantees simultaneously by integrating randomized smoothing into standard differentially private model training. Compared to the leading prior work, DP-CERT gives up to a 2.5% increase in certified accuracy for the same differential privacy guarantee on CIFAR10. Through in-depth persample metric analysis, we find that larger certifiable radii correlate with smaller local Lipschitz constants, and show that DP-CERT effectively reduces Lipschitz constants compared to other differentially private training methods. The code is available at github.com/layer6ailabs/dp-cert.</description>

      <title>Watermarks in the Sand: Impossibility of Strong Watermarking for Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking generative models consists of planting a statistical signal (watermark) in a model's output so that it can be later verified that the output was generated by the given model. A strong watermarking scheme satisfies the property that a computationally bounded attacker cannot erase the watermark without causing significant quality degradation. In this paper, we study the (im)possibility of strong watermarking schemes. We prove that, under well-specified and natural assumptions, strong watermarking is impossible to achieve. This holds even in the private detection algorithm setting, where the watermark insertion and detection algorithms share a secret key, unknown to the attacker. To prove this result, we introduce a generic efficient watermark attack; the attacker is not required to know the private key of the scheme or even which scheme is used. Our attack is based on two assumptions: (1) The attacker has access to a "quality oracle" that can evaluate whether a candidate output is a high-quality response to a prompt, and (2) The attacker has access to a "perturbation oracle" which can modify an output with a nontrivial probability of maintaining quality, and which induces an efficiently mixing random walk on high-quality outputs. We argue that both assumptions can be satisfied in practice by an attacker with weaker computational capabilities than the watermarked model itself, to which the attacker has only black-box access. Furthermore, our assumptions will likely only be easier to satisfy over time as models grow in capabilities and modalities. We demonstrate the feasibility of our attack by instantiating it to attack three existing watermarking schemes for large language models: Kirchenbauer et al. (2023), Kuditipudi et al. (2023), and Zhao et al. (2023). The same attack successfully removes the watermarks planted by all three schemes, with only minor quality degradation.</description>

      <title>Temporal Persistence and Intercorrelation of Embeddings Learned by an End-to-End Deep Learning Eye Movement-driven Biometrics Pipeline</title>

Abstract: What qualities make a feature useful for biometric performance? In prior research, pre-dating the advent of deep learning (DL) approaches to biometric analysis, a strong relationship between temporal persistence, as indexed by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and biometric performance (Equal Error Rate, EER) was noted. More generally, the claim was made that good biometric performance resulted from a relatively large set of weakly intercorrelated features with high ICC. The present study aimed to determine whether the same relationships are found in a state-of-the-art DL-based eye movement biometric system (``Eye-Know-You-Too''), as applied to two publicly available eye movement datasets. To this end, we manipulate various aspects of eye-tracking signal quality, which produces variation in biometric performance, and relate that performance to the temporal persistence and intercorrelation of the resulting embeddings. Data quality indices were related to EER with either linear or logarithmic fits, and the resulting model R^2 was noted. As a general matter, we found that temporal persistence was an important predictor of DL-based biometric performance, and also that DL-learned embeddings were generally weakly intercorrelated.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Sparse Teacher: Defense Against Distillation-Based Model Stealing Attacks Using Adversarial Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Adversarial Sparse Teacher (AST), a robust defense method against distillation-based model stealing attacks. Our approach trains a teacher model using adversarial examples to produce sparse logit responses and increase the entropy of the output distribution. Typically, a model generates a peak in its output corresponding to its prediction. By leveraging adversarial examples, AST modifies the teacher model's original response, embedding a few altered logits into the output while keeping the primary response slightly higher. Concurrently, all remaining logits are elevated to further increase the output distribution's entropy. All these complex manipulations are performed using an optimization function with our proposed Exponential Predictive Divergence (EPD) loss function. EPD allows us to maintain higher entropy levels compared to traditional KL divergence, effectively confusing attackers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that AST outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing effective defense against model stealing while preserving high accuracy. The source codes will be made publicly available here soon.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Federated Analytics: Taxonomy, Enabling Techniques, Applications and Open Issues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating influx of data generated by networked edge devices, coupled with the growing awareness of data privacy, has restricted the traditional data analytics workflow, where the edge data are gathered by a centralized server to be further utilized by data analysts. To continue leveraging vast edge data to support various data-incentive applications, a transformative shift is promoted in computing paradigms from centralized data processing to privacy-preserved distributed data processing. The need to perform data analytics on private edge data motivates federated analytics (FA), an emerging technique to support collaborative data analytics among diverse data owners without centralizing the raw data. Despite the wide applications of FA in industry and academia, a comprehensive examination of existing research efforts in FA has been notably absent. This survey aims to bridge this gap by first providing an overview of FA, elucidating key concepts, and discussing its relationship with similar concepts. We then conduct a thorough examination of FA, including its key challenges, taxonomy, and enabling techniques. Diverse FA applications, including statistical metrics, frequency-related applications, database query operations, FL-assisting FA tasks, and other wireless network applications are then carefully reviewed. We complete the survey with several open research issues, future directions, and a comprehensive lessons learned part. This survey intends to provide a holistic understanding of the emerging FA techniques and foster the continued evolution of privacy-preserving distributed data processing in the emerging networked society.</description>

      <title>DP-DyLoRA: Fine-Tuning Transformer-Based Models On-Device under Differentially Private Federated Learning using Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing their local data with a server. However, clients' contributions to the server can still leak sensitive information. Differential privacy (DP) addresses such leakage by providing formal privacy guarantees, with mechanisms that add randomness to the clients' contributions. The randomness makes it infeasible to train large transformer-based models, common in modern federated learning systems. In this work, we empirically evaluate the practicality of fine-tuning large scale on-device transformer-based models with differential privacy in a federated learning system. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various system properties for tasks spanning a multitude of domains: speech recognition, computer vision (CV) and natural language understanding (NLU). Our results show that full fine-tuning under differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) generally leads to huge performance degradation which can be alleviated by reducing the dimensionality of contributions through parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Our benchmarks of existing DP-PEFT methods show that DP-Low-Rank Adaptation (DP-LoRA) consistently outperforms other methods. An even more promising approach, DyLoRA, which makes the low rank variable, when naively combined with FL would straightforwardly break differential privacy. We therefore propose an adaptation method that can be combined with differential privacy and call it DP-DyLoRA. Finally, we are able to reduce the accuracy degradation and word error rate (WER) increase due to DP to less than 2% and 7% respectively with 1 million clients and a stringent privacy budget of $\epsilon=2$.</description>

      <title>LabObf: A Label Protection Scheme for Vertical Federated Learning Through Label Obfuscation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Split Neural Network, as one of the most common architectures used in vertical federated learning, is popular in industry due to its privacy-preserving characteristics. In this architecture, the party holding the labels seeks cooperation from other parties to improve model performance due to insufficient feature data. Each of these participants has a self-defined bottom model to learn hidden representations from its own feature data and uploads the embedding vectors to the top model held by the label holder for final predictions. This design allows participants to conduct joint training without directly exchanging data. However, existing research points out that malicious participants may still infer label information from the uploaded embeddings, leading to privacy leakage. In this paper, we first propose an embedding extension attack manipulating embeddings to undermine existing defense strategies, which rely on constraining the correlation between the embeddings uploaded by participants and the labels. Subsequently, we propose a new label obfuscation defense strategy, called `LabObf', which randomly maps each original integer-valued label to multiple real-valued soft labels with values intertwined, significantly increasing the difficulty for attackers to infer the labels. We conduct experiments on four different types of datasets, and the results show that LabObf significantly reduces the attacker's success rate compared to raw models while maintaining desirable model accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the input perturbations framework for differential privacy where noise is added to the input $A\in \mathcal{S}$ and the result is then projected back to the space of admissible datasets $\mathcal{S}$. Through this framework, we first design novel efficient algorithms to privately release pair-wise cosine similarities. Second, we derive a novel algorithm to compute $k$-way marginal queries over $n$ features. Prior work could achieve comparable guarantees only for $k$ even. Furthermore, we extend our results to $t$-sparse datasets, where our efficient algorithms yields novel, stronger guarantees whenever $t\le n^{5/6}/\log n\,.$ Finally, we provide a theoretical perspective on why \textit{fast} input perturbation algorithms works well in practice. The key technical ingredients behind our results are tight sum-of-squares certificates upper bounding the Gaussian complexity of sets of solutions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Encrypted Application Traffic through Cellular Radio Interface Protocol</title>

Abstract: Modern applications are end-to-end encrypted to prevent data from being read or secretly modified. 5G tech nology provides ubiquitous access to these applications without compromising the application-specific performance and latency goals. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that 5G radio communication becomes the side channel to precisely infer the user's applications in real-time. The key idea lies in observing the 5G physical and MAC layer interactions over time that reveal the application's behavior. The MAC layer receives the data from the application and requests the network to assign the radio resource blocks. The network assigns the radio resources as per application requirements, such as priority, Quality of Service (QoS) needs, amount of data to be transmitted, and buffer size. The adversary can passively observe the radio resources to fingerprint the applications. We empirically demonstrate this attack by considering four different categories of applications: online shopping, voice/video conferencing, video streaming, and Over-The-Top (OTT) media platforms. Finally, we have also demonstrated that an attacker can differentiate various types of applications in real-time within each category.</description>

      <title>Optimal Defender Strategies for CAGE-2 using Causal Modeling and Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CAGE-2 challenge is considered a standard benchmark to compare methods for autonomous cyber defense. Current state-of-the-art methods evaluated against this benchmark are based on model-free (offline) reinforcement learning, which does not provide provably optimal defender strategies. We address this limitation and present a formal (causal) model of CAGE-2 together with a method that produces a provably optimal defender strategy, which we call Causal Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Planning (C-POMCP). It has two key properties. First, it incorporates the causal structure of the target system, i.e., the causal relationships among the system variables. This structure allows for a significant reduction of the search space of defender strategies. Second, it is an online method that updates the defender strategy at each time step via tree search. Evaluations against the CAGE-2 benchmark show that C-POMCP achieves state-of-the-art performance with respect to effectiveness and is two orders of magnitude more efficient in computing time than the closest competitor method.</description>
