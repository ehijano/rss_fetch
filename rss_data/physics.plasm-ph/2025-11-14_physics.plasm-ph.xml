      <title>The Data Fusion Labeler (dFL): Challenges and Solutions to Data Harmonization, Labeling, and Provenance in Fusion Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fusion energy research increasingly depends on the ability to integrate heterogeneous, multimodal datasets from high-resolution diagnostics, control systems, and multiscale simulations. The sheer volume and complexity of these datasets demand the development of new tools capable of systematically harmonizing and extracting knowledge across diverse modalities. The Data Fusion Labeler (dFL) is introduced as a unified workflow instrument that performs uncertainty-aware data harmonization, schema-compliant data fusion, and provenance-rich manual and automated labeling at scale. By embedding alignment, normalization, and labeling within a reproducible, operator-order-aware framework, dFL reduces time-to-analysis by greater than 50X (e.g., enabling &gt;200 shots/hour to be consistently labeled rather than a handful per day), enhances label (and subsequently training) quality, and enables cross-device comparability. Case studies from DIII-D demonstrate its application to automated ELM detection and confinement regime classification, illustrating its potential as a core component of data-driven discovery, model validation, and real-time control in future burning plasma devices.</description>

      <title>Plasma hydrodynamics from mean force kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean force kinetic theory is used to evaluate the electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, electrothermal coefficient, thermoelectric coefficient, and shear viscosity of a two-component (ion-electron) plasma. Results are compared with molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations are made possible by assuming a repulsive Coulomb force for all interactions. Good agreement is found for all coefficients up to a Coulomb coupling strength of $\Gamma \approx 20$. This is over 100-times larger than the coupling strength at which traditional theories break down. It is concluded that mean force kinetic theory provides a means to extend hydrodynamics to dense plasmas.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Hydrodynamic Transport Coefficients in Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to calculate transport coefficients in a two-component plasma interacting through a repulsive Coulomb potential. The thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, electrothermal coefficient, thermoelectric coefficient, and shear viscosity are computed using the Green-Kubo formalism over a broad range of Coulomb coupling strength, $0.01 \leq \Gamma \leq 140$. Emphasis is placed on testing standard results of the Chapman-Enskog solution in the weakly coupled regime ($\Gamma \ll 1$) using these first-principles simulations. As expected, the results show good agreement for $\Gamma \lesssim 0.1$. However, this agreement is only possible if careful attention is paid to the definitions of linear constitutive relations in each of the theoretical models, a point that is often overlooked. For example, the standard Green-Kubo expression for thermal conductivity is a linear combination of thermal conductivity, electrothermal and thermoelectric coefficients computed in the Chapman-Enskog formalism. Meaningful results for electrical conductivity are obtained over the full range of coupling strengths explored, but it is shown that potential and virial components of the other transport coefficients diverge in the strongly coupled regime ($\Gamma \gg 1$). In this regime, only the kinetic components of the transport coefficients are meaningful for a classical plasma.</description>

      <title>$\pi$-PIC: a framework for modular particle-in-cell developments and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently proposed modifications of the standard particle-in-cell (PIC) method resolve long-standing limitations such as exact preservation of physically conserved quantities and unbiased ensemble down-sampling. Such advances pave the way for next-generation PIC codes capable of using lower resolution and fewer particles per cell, enabling interactive studies on personal computers and facilitating large-scale parameter scans on supercomputers. Here, we present a Python-controlled framework designed to stimulate the dissemination and adoption of novel PIC developments by providing unified interfaces for accommodation, cross-testing, and comparison of PIC solvers and extensions written in Python or low-level languages like C++ and Fortran. To demonstrate flexibility of proposed interfaces we present and test implementations of several PIC solvers, as well as of extensions that is capable of managing QED processes, moving-window, and tight focusing of laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Tailored Three Dimensional Betatron Dynamics in UltraStable Hybrid Laser Plasma RF Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detailed theoretical and numerical investigation of hybrid laser plasma RF accelerators, elucidating the mechanisms governing transverse beam dynamics, betatron polarization, and radiation reaction in ultra-relativistic electron bunches is presented. This framework combines analytical models of spatiotemporal plasma wakefield modulation, phase-dependent RF-driven oscillations, and quantum-corrected Landau Lifshitz radiation reaction with fully self-consistent 3D particle in cell simulations using EPOCH. The results demonstrate that RF amplitude, frequency, and phase enable precise control over transverse focusing strengths, betatron oscillation amplitudes, and polarization states. Resonant alignment between RF fields and natural betatron frequencies amplifies transverse excursions while damping parasitic oscillations through enhanced focusing gradients and radiation reaction, yielding reductions in emittance and mitigation of synchrotron-like energy losses. Stability maps and 3D force landscapes reveal strong phase sensitivity, where initial conditions and RF component ratios govern the temporal evolution of betatron amplitudes, and longitudinal field gradients modulate {\gamma} growth rates. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of nonlinear, resonant, and damping phenomena in hybrid laser plasma RF systems, highlighting the full spectrum of controllable transverse, longitudinal, and polarization dynamics in ultra relativistic electron beams.</description>

      <title>Microscopy X-ray Imaging enriched with Small Angle X-ray Scattering for few nanometer resolution reveals shock waves and compression in intense short pulse laser irradiation of solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how laser pulses compress solids into high-energy-density states requires diagnostics that simultaneously resolve macroscopic geometry and nanometer-scale structure. Here we present a combined X-ray imaging (XRM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) approach that bridges this diagnostic gap. Using the Matter in Extreme Conditions end station at LCLS, we irradiated 25-micrometer copper wires with 45-fs, 0.9-J, 800-nm pulses at 3.5e19 W/cm2 while probing with 8.2-keV XFEL pulses. XRM visualizes the evolution of ablation, compression, and inward-propagating fronts with about 200-nm resolution, while SAXS quantifies their nanometer-scale sharpness through the time-resolved evolution of scattering streaks. The joint analysis reveals that an initially smooth compression steepens into a nanometer-sharp shock front after roughly 18 ps, consistent with an analytical steepening model and hydrodynamic simulations. The front reaches a velocity of about 25 km/s and a lateral width of several tens of micrometers, demonstrating for the first time the direct observation of shock formation and decay at solid density with few-nanometer precision. This integrated XRM-SAXS method establishes a quantitative, multiscale diagnostic of laser-driven shocks in dense plasmas relevant to inertial confinement fusion, warm dense matter, and planetary physics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven multi-species heat flux closures for two-stream-unstable plasmas with nonlinear sparse regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dual aims of accuracy and computational efficiency in computational plasma physics lend themselves well to the use of fluid models. The first of these goals, however, is only satisfied for such models insofar as the utilized closure can capture the neglected kinetic physics -- something which has proven challenging for multi-scale collisionless processes. In a recent article [E. R. Ingelsten et al. (2025) J. Plasma Phys. 91 E64], we used the data-driven method of sparse regression to discover a novel heat flux closure for electrostatic phenomena. Here, we generalize the six-term closure model found in that work from single- to multi-species modeling. Using data from OSIRIS particle-in-cell simulations over a range of initial conditions, we then demonstrate how the unknown coefficients in front of the three most important terms in the closure can be estimated from box-averaged fluid quantities. Both neural networks and a newly developed framework for nonlinear sparse regression are showcased. The resulting models predict the heat flux for each species with a typical accuracy of 80-90 % and regularly account for 85-95 % of the rate of change in the pressure. The models are also compared with results from multi-species linear collisionless theory.</description>

      <title>Self-organisation through layering of $\beta$-plane like turbulence in plasmas and geophysical fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Staircase formation and layering is studied in simplified, potential vorticity conserving models of plasmas and geophysical fluids, by investigating turbulent self-organisation and nonlinear saturation with different mechanisms of free energy production -- forcing or linear instability -- and with standard or modified zonal flow responses. To this end, staircase formation in both the standard and modified Charney-Hasegawa-Mima equations with stochastic forcing, along with two different simple instability driven models -- one from a plasma and from a geophysical context -- are studied and compared. In these studies, it is observed that $\beta$-plane turbulence that does not distinguish between zonal and non-zonal perturbations (i.e., standard zonal response) gradually forms large-scale, elliptic zonal structures that merge progressively, regardless of whether it is driven by forcing (though it should be slow enough to allow wave couplings) or by the baroclinic instability, using for example a two-layer model. Conversely, the plasma system, with its modified zonal response, can rapidly form straight, stationary jets of well-defined size, again regardless of the way it is driven: by stochastic forcing or by the dissipative drift instability. Furthermore, the instability-driven plasma system exhibits a phase transition between a zonal flow dominated state and an eddy dominated state. In both states, saturation is possible without large-scale friction.</description>

      <title>Electron Heat Flux and Whistler Instability in the Earth's Magnetosheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite heat flux's role in regulating energy conversion in collisionless plasmas, its properties and evolution in the magnetosheath downstream of the Earth's bow shock are scarcely explored. We use MMS in situ measurements to quantify and characterize the electron heat flux in the magnetosheath. We find that the heat flux is shaped by the magnetosheath magnetic field as it drapes around the magnetosphere. While it is affected by solar wind upstream conditions and increases with magnetic field strength, it is not substantially changed by local magnetosheath processes. Also, the heat flux is limited by whistler instability thresholds.</description>

      <title>Collisional and magnetic effects on the polarization of the solar oxygen infrared triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: The scattering polarization of the infrared (IR) triplet of neutral oxygen (O\,\textsc{i}) near 777\,nm provides a powerful diagnostic of solar atmospheric conditions. However, interpreting such polarization requires a rigorous treatment of isotropic depolarizing collisions between O\,\textsc{i} atoms and neutral hydrogen.
  Aims: We aim to investigate the combined effects of collisional and magnetic depolarization in shaping the alignment of O\,\textsc{i} levels (and thus the polarization of the O\,\textsc{i} IR triplet).
  Methods: We compute, for the first time, a comprehensive set of collisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the relevant O\,\textsc{i} energy levels. These rates are incorporated into a multi-level atomic model, and the statistical equilibrium equations (SEE) are solved to quantify the impact of collisions and magnetic fields on atomic alignment.
  Results: Our calculations indicate that elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen, together with the Hanle effect of turbulent magnetic fields stronger than about 20 G, efficiently suppress the bulk of the atomic alignment in deep photospheric conditions where hydrogen densities exceed $n_{\mathrm{H}} \sim 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$. In the chromosphere, however, the lower hydrogen density weakens collisional depolarization, allowing polarization to persist.
  Conclusions: Our results are consistent with a chromospheric origin for the linear polarization signals of the O I IR triplet. Future studies should combine accurate non-LTE radiative transfer with reliable collisional rates in order to achieve fully consistent modeling.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric Gyrokinetic Simulation of ASDEX-Upgrade Scrape-off Layer Using a Conservative Implicit BGK Collision Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisions play an important role in turbulence and transport of fusion plasmas. For kinetic simulations, as the collisionality increases in the domain of interest, the size of the time step to resolve the collisional physics can become overly restrictive in an explicit time integration scheme, leading to high computational cost. With the aim of overcoming such restriction, we have implemented an implicit Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator for use in the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) full-f gyrokinetic solver within the Gkeyll framework, which, when combined with Gkeyll's traditional explicit time integrator for collisionless advection, can significantly increase the time step in gyrokinetic simulations of highly collisional regimes. To ensure conservation of density, momentum, and energy, we utilize an iterative scheme to correct the discretized approximation to the equilibrium Maxwellian distribution to which the BGK collision operator relaxes. We have further generalized the BGK infrastructure, both the implicit scheme and the correction routine, to handle cross species collisions. This improved implicit and conservative BGK operator is benchmarked against the more accurate but more computationally expensive Lenard-Bernstein-Dougherty (LBD) operator which has been utilized in prior studies with Gkeyll. The implicit BGK operator enables 2D axisymmetric simulations of the ASDEX-Upgrade scrape-off layer to run 56 times faster to completion than the simulations with the LBD operator, because the BGK operator is more robust and converges at a lower resolution than is required by the LBD operator. Additionally, in this more collisional limit, we demonstrate that the results of our simulations utilizing the implicit BGK operator agreed well with simulations utilizing the more computationally expensive LBD operator.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field-Line Curvature and Its Role in Particle Acceleration by Magnetically Dominated Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ first-principles, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate magnetic field-line curvature in magnetically dominated turbulent plasmas and its role in particle acceleration through curvature-drift motion along the motional electric field. By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\kappa$ tails for $\delta B_0/B_0 \gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\delta B_0/B_0 \ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\bf v}_E \cdot {\bf \kappa}$, with ${\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\bf\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.</description>
