      <title>Block Decomposable Methods for Large-Scale Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation explores block decomposable methods for large-scale optimization problems. It focuses on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) schemes and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods. Specifically, it introduces a new proximal ADMM algorithm and proposes two BCD methods. The first part of the research presents a new proximal ADMM algorithm. This method is adaptive to all problem parameters and solves the proximal augmented Lagrangian (AL) subproblem inexactly. This adaptiveness facilitates the highly efficient application of the algorithm to a broad swath of practical problems. The inexact solution of the proximal AL subproblem overcomes many key challenges in the practical applications of ADMM. The resultant algorithm obtains an approximate solution of an optimization problem in a number of iterations that matches the state-of-the-art complexity for the class of proximal ADMM schemes. The second part of the research focuses on an inexact proximal mapping for the class of block proximal gradient methods. Key properties of this operator is established, facilitating the derivation of convergence rates for the proposed algorithm. Under two error decreases conditions, the algorithm matches the convergence rate of its exactly computed counterpart. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithm under a dynamic error regime over a fixed one. The dissertation concludes by providing convergence guarantees for the randomized BCD method applied to a broad class of functions, known as H\"older smooth functions. Convergence rates are derived for non-convex, convex, and strongly convex functions. These convergence rates match those furnished in the existing literature for the Lipschtiz smooth setting.</description>

      <title>An Inexact Weighted Proximal Trust-Region Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [R. J. Baraldi and D. P. Kouri, Math. Program., 201:1 (2023), pp. 559-598], the authors introduced a trust-region method for minimizing the sum of a smooth nonconvex and a nonsmooth convex function, the latter of which has an analytical proximity operator. While many functions satisfy this criterion, e.g., the $\ell_1$-norm defined on $\ell_2$, many others are precluded by either the topology or the nature of the nonsmooth term. Using the $\delta$-Fr\'echet subdifferential, we extend the definition of the inexact proximity operator and enable its use within the aforementioned trust-region algorithm. Moreover, we augment the analysis for the standard trust-region convergence theory to handle proximity operator inexactness with weighted inner products. We first introduce an algorithm to generate a point in the inexact proximity operator and then apply the algorithm within the trust-region method to solve an optimal control problem constrained by Burgers' equation.</description>

      <title>Delay and Memory-Type Null Controllability for Heat Equations in Finite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study null controllability for linear heat-type systems in finite dimensions that incorporate both memory and time-delay effects. A strengthened notion of controllability, referred to as delay and memory-type null controllability, is introduced, which requires the state, the memory functional, and the delayed history to vanish at the terminal time. Using a duality approach, we establish an augmented observability inequality for the adjoint system and show its equivalence to controllability. In the finite-dimensional setting, this leads to sharp necessary and sufficient algebraic rank conditions extending the classical Kalman criterion to systems with memory and delay.</description>

      <title>System Availability Optimization: Integrating Quantity Discounts and Delivery Lead Time Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The model allocates the system components orders to the suppliers to minimize the parts price and the system construction delay penalties and maximize the system availability during its use. It considers the quantity-based discount and variation of delivery lead time by ordering similar components. The model also reflects the prerequisite relationships between construction activities and calculates the delay penalty resulting from parts delivery lead time. Design/methodology/approach: This research presents a model for selecting suppliers of components of an industrial series-parallel multi-state system. A nonlinear binary mathematical program uses the Markov process results to select system components. It minimizes the total system construction phase costs, including the components' price, and the system construction delay penalty, and the system exploitation phase costs, including the system shutdown and working at half capacity. Findings: The model allocates the optimal orders for a typical industrial system's components, composing four elements. The proposed approach combines the nonlinear binary program and the Markov process results to optimize the system life cycle parameters, including the system construction cost and operational availability. Originality/value: Using the Markov chain results in binary nonlinear mathematical programming, this study attempts to strike the right balance between the construction phase's objectives and an industrial unit's operation phase.</description>

      <title>On the Identification of Latent Objectives in Stochastic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variational formulation of an inverse problem in continuous-time stochastic control, aimed at identifying control costs consistent with a given distribution over trajectories. The formulation is based on minimizing the suboptimality gap of observed behavior. We establish a connection between the inverse problem and a generalized dynamic Schr\"odinger problem, showing that their optimal values coincide. This result links inverse stochastic control with stochastic optimal transport, offering a new conceptual viewpoint on inverse inference in controlled diffusions.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of McKean-Vlasov systems under partial observation and hidden Markov switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of mean-field control problems under partial observation. The controlled dynamics are of McKean-Vlasov type and are subject to regime switching driven by a hidden Markov chain. The observation process depends on the control and on the joint distribution of the state and control, which prevents the direct application of standard filtering techniques. The main contribution of this paper is to show how this distribution dependence can be handled within a change-of-probability framework, leading to a well-posed separated control problem. We derive a Zakai equation with a specific structure for the unnormalized filter, and show that the corresponding value function satisfies a dynamic programming principle. This yields a Bellman equation posed on a convex subset of a Wasserstein space, characterizing the optimal control problem under partial observation.</description>

      <title>A Canonical Internal Model for Disturbance Rejection for a Class of Nonlinear Systems Subject to Trigonometric-Polynomial Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for disturbance rejection in a class of nonautonomous nonlinear systems affected by trigonometric-polynomial disturbances. The core of our approach is the design of a canonical internal model that directly converts the disturbance rejection problem into an adaptive stabilization problem for an augmented system. Unlike conventional methods, this internal model is synthesized directly from the given nonlinear plant and the knowledge of the exosystem, without relying on the solution of the regulator equations. This makes the approach applicable to a significantly broader class of nonautonomous nonlinear systems. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive disturbance observer comprising the canonical nonlinear internal model, a Luenberger-type state observer, and a parameter adaptation law. This observer ensures global asymptotic convergence of the disturbance estimate to the true disturbance without requiring persistent excitation (PE). Under the PE condition, both the disturbance estimation error and the parameter estimation error converge exponentially. By incorporating the disturbance estimate as a feedforward compensation signal, we establish sufficient conditions for achieving global trajectory tracking and asymptotic disturbance rejection. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a numerical simulation of a flexible-joint robotic manipulator.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study two semilinear systems describing a monotubular and a two-stream heat exchanger. Neither system is exactly controllable; however, for each we specify a subspace of the state space with respect to which the system is exactly controllable, thus establishing partial exact controllability.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for the Laplacian torsional rigidity with negative Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by pioneering works of Bandle and Wagner, given a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^d$ with $d\ge3$, we consider the Robin-Laplacian torsional rigidity $\tau_\alpha(\Omega)$ with negative boundary parameter $\alpha$ and we show that sharp inequalities for $\tau_\alpha(\Omega)$ hold if $|\alpha|$ is small enough. In particular, we prove that, if $|\alpha|$ is smaller than the first non-trivial Steklov-Laplacian eigenvalue, then the ball maximises $\tau_\alpha(\Omega)$ among all convex domains under perimeter or volume constraints.This solves an open problem raised by Bandle and Wagner. We also prove the result in the planar case among simply connected sets and under perimeter constraint.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Average Impulse and Singular Control of a Growth Model with Two Revenue Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes and explicitly solves a class of long-term average impulse control problems and a related class of singular control problems. The underlying process is a general one-dimensional diffusion with appropriate boundary behavior. The model is motivated by applications such as the optimal long-term management of renewable resources and financial portfolio management. A large class of admissible policies is identified over which the agent seeks to maximize her long-term average reward, consisting of a running reward and income from either discrete impulses or singular actions. The long-term expected total reward and its relation to overtaking optimality is also considered. Sensitivity analysis with regard to the parameters of the impulse control model are performed. Key connections between the impulse and singular control problems are displayed.</description>

      <title>SCaLE: Switching Cost aware Learning and Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the fundamental problem of unbounded metric movement costs in bandit online convex optimization, by considering high-dimensional dynamic quadratic hitting costs and $\ell_2$-norm switching costs in a noisy bandit feedback model. For a general class of stochastic environments, we provide the first algorithm SCaLE that provably achieves a distribution-agnostic sub-linear dynamic regret, without the knowledge of hitting cost structure. En-route, we present a novel spectral regret analysis that separately quantifies eigenvalue-error driven regret and eigenbasis-perturbation driven regret. Extensive numerical experiments, against online-learning baselines, corroborate our claims, and highlight statistical consistency of our algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We develop a data-driven framework for identifying non-Markovian dynamical equations of motion for open quantum systems. Starting from the Nakajima--Zwanzig formalism, we vectorize the reduced density matrix into a four-dimensional state vector and cast the dynamics as a Volterra integro-differential equation with an operator-valued memory kernel. The learning task is then formulated as a constrained optimization problem over the admissible operator space, where correlation functions are approximated by rational functions using Pad\'e approximants.

      <title>Boundary adaptive observer design for semilinear hyperbolic rolling contact ODE-PDE systems with uncertain friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive observer design for semilinear hyperbolic rolling contact ODE-PDE systems with uncertain friction characteristics parameterized by a matrix of unknown coefficients appearing in the nonlinear (and possibly non-smooth) PDE source terms. Under appropriate assumptions of forward completeness and boundary sensing, an adaptive observer is synthesized to simultaneously estimate the lumped and distributed states, as well as the uncertain friction parameters, using only boundary measurements. The observer combines a finite-dimensional parameter estimator with an infinite-dimensional description of the state error dynamics, and achieves exponential convergence under persistent excitation. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated in simulation by considering a relevant example borrowed from road vehicle dynamics.</description>

      <title>Terminally constrained flow-based generative models from an optimal control perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of sampling from terminally constrained distributions with pre-trained flow-based generative models through an optimal control formulation. Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling. Across all settings, TOCFlow improves constraint satisfaction over Euclidean guidance and projection baselines while preserving the reference model's generative quality.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic match classification model for sports tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing match classification models in the tournament design literature have two major limitations: a contestant is considered indifferent only if uncertain future results do never affect its prize, and competitive matches are not distinguished with respect to the incentives of the contestants. We propose a probabilistic framework to address both issues. For each match, our approach relies on simulating all other matches played simultaneously or later to compute the qualifying probabilities under the three main outcomes (win, draw, loss), which allows the classification of each match into six different categories. The suggested model is applied to the previous group stage and the new incomplete round-robin league, introduced in the 2024/25 season of UEFA club competitions. An incomplete round-robin tournament is found to contain fewer stakeless matches where both contestants are indifferent, and substantially more matches where both contestants should play offensively. However, the robustly higher proportion of potentially collusive matches can threaten with serious scandals.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of a kinetic model describing social interactions on a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the optimal control of a kinetic model describing agents who migrate on a graph and interact within its nodes exchanging a physical quantity. As a prototype model, we consider the spread of an infectious disease on a graph, so that the exchanged quantity is the viral-load. The control, exerted on both the mobility and on the interactions separately, aims at minimising the average macroscopic viral-load.
  We prove that minimising the average viral-load weighted by the mass in each node is the most effective and convenient strategy. We consider two different interactions: in the first one the infection (gain) and the healing (loss) processes happen within the same interaction, while in the second case the infection and healing result from two different processes. With the appropriate controls, we prove that in the first case it is possible to stop the increase of the disease, but paying a very high cost in terms of control, while in the second case it is possible to eradicate the disease. We test numerically the role of each intervention and the interplay between the mobility and the interaction control strategies in each model.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Reformulation for Nonconvex Optimization: Tailoring Problems to Specialized Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in studying different ways to reformulate nonconvex optimization problems, especially those that involve binary variables. This interest surge is due to advancements in computing technologies, such as quantum and Ising devices, as well as improvements in quantum and classical optimization solvers that take advantage of particular formulations of nonconvex problems to tackle their solutions. Our research characterizes the equivalence between equality-constrained nonconvex optimization problems and their Lagrangian relaxation, enabling the aforementioned new technologies to solve these problems. In addition to filling a crucial gap in the literature, our results are readily applicable to many important situations in practice. To obtain these results, we bridge between specific optimization problem characteristics and broader, classical results on Lagrangian duality for general nonconvex problems. Further, our approach takes a comprehensive approach to the question of equivalence between problem formulations. We consider this question not only from the perspective of the problem's objective but also from the viewpoint of its solution. This perspective, often overlooked in existing literature, is particularly relevant for problems featuring continuous and binary variables.</description>

      <title>SPGD: Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms are pivotal in advancing various scientific and industrial fields but often encounter obstacles such as trapping in local minima, saddle points, and plateaus (flat regions), which makes the convergence to reasonable or near-optimal solutions particularly challenging. This paper presents the Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent (SPGD), a novel algorithm that innovatively combines the principles of the gradient descent method with periodic uniform perturbation sampling to effectively circumvent these impediments and lead to better solutions whenever possible. SPGD is distinctively designed to generate a set of candidate solutions and select the one exhibiting the steepest loss difference relative to the current solution. It enhances the traditional gradient descent approach by integrating a strategic exploration mechanism that significantly increases the likelihood of escaping sub-optimal local minima and navigating complex optimization landscapes effectively. Our approach not only retains the directed efficiency of gradient descent but also leverages the exploratory benefits of stochastic perturbations, thus enabling a more comprehensive search for global optima across diverse problem spaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPGD in solving the 3D component packing problem, an NP-hard challenge. Preliminary results show a substantial improvement over four established methods, particularly on response surfaces with complex topographies and in multidimensional non-convex continuous optimization problems. Comparative analyses with established 2D benchmark functions highlight SPGD's superior performance, showcasing its ability to navigate complex optimization landscapes. These results emphasize SPGD's potential as a versatile tool for a wide range of optimization problems.</description>

      <title>The Small-Gain Condition for Infinite Networks Modeled on $\ell^{\infty}$-Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03925v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, attempts have been made to extend nonlinear small-gain theorems for input-to-state stability (ISS) from finite networks to countably infinite networks with finite indegrees. Under specific assumptions about the interconnection gains and the ISS formulation, corresponding infinite-dimensional small-gain results have been proven. However, concerning these assumptions, the results are still too narrow to be considered a full extension of the state-of-the-art for finite networks. We take a step to closing this gap by developing a general technical framework within which the small-gain condition for both finite and infinite networks can be analyzed. This includes a thorough investigation of various monotone operators associated with a network and a specific ISS formulation. Our results extend and generalize the existing theory for finite networks, yield complete characterizations of the small-gain condition for specific ISS formulations, and show which obstacles still have to be overcome to obtain a complete theory for the most general infinite case.</description>

      <title>A Universally Optimal Primal-Dual Method for Minimizing Heterogeneous Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a universal algorithm for convex minimization problems of the composite form $g_0(x)+h(g_1(x),\dots, g_m(x)) + u(x)$. We allow each $g_j$ to independently range from being nonsmooth Lipschitz to smooth, from convex to strongly convex, described by notions of H\"older continuous gradients and uniform convexity. Note that, although the objective is built from a heterogeneous combination of such structured components, it does not necessarily possess smoothness, Lipschitzness, or any favorable structure overall other than convexity. Regardless, we provide a universal optimal method in terms of oracle access to (sub)gradients of each $g_j$. The key insight enabling our optimal universal analysis and a core technical contribution is the construction of two new constants, the Approximate Dualized Aggregate smoothness and strong convexity, which combine the benefits of each heterogeneous structure into single quantities amenable to analysis.
  As a key application, fixing $h$ as the nonpositive indicator function, this model readily captures functionally constrained minimization $g_0(x)+u(x)$ subject to $g_j(x)\leq 0$. In particular, our algorithm and analysis are directly inspired by the smooth constrained minimization method of Zhang and Lan and consequently recover and generalize their accelerated guarantees.</description>

      <title>Multiobjective Optimization under Uncertainties using Conditional Pareto Fronts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method to tackle the problem of multiobjective optimization under parameteric uncertainties, by considering the Conditional Pareto Sets and Conditional Pareto Fronts. Based on those quantities we can define the probability of coverage of the Conditional Pareto Set which can be interpreted as the probability for a design to be optimal in the Pareto sense. Due to the computational cost of such an approach, we introduce an Active Learning method based on Gaussian Process Regression in order to improve the estimation of this probability, which relies on a reformulation of the EHVI. We illustrate those methods on a few toy problems of moderate dimension, and on the problem of designing a cabin to highlight the differences in solutions brought by different formulations of the problem.</description>

      <title>On the smooth Lorentzian optimal transport problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we want to establish some general results in the Lorentzian optimal transport theory that have well-known Riemannian counterparts. As a first result, we will provide non-trivial assumptions on the measures to ensure strong (Kantorovich) duality, i.e. the existence of a maximizing pair in the dual optimal transport formulation. We will also show that, under suitable assumptions, optimality of a causal coupling is characterized by $c$-cyclical monotonicity. The second result deals with the regularity of $c$-convex functions and (weak) Kantorovich potentials. We show that, in general, regularity results known in the Riemannian context do not extend to the Lorentzian setting. Under suitable assumptions on the measures, we will prove nevertheless that these (weak) potentials are locally semconvex on an open set of full measure. As our last result, we will prove that, under quite general assumptions, for any two intermediates measures along a displacement interpolation, there exists a $C^{1,1}_{loc}$-regular maximizing pair in the dual formulation.</description>

      <title>Stability of vehicular admission control schemes in urban traffic networks under modelling uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban transportation networks face significant challenges due to traffic congestion, leading to adverse environmental and socioeconomic impacts. Vehicular admission control (VAC) strategies have emerged as a promising solution to alleviate congestion. By leveraging information and communication technologies, VAC strategies regulate vehicle entry into the network to optimize different traffic metrics of interest over space and time. Despite the significant development of VAC strategies, their stability at the presence of modelling uncertainty remains under-explored. This paper investigates the stability properties of a class of decentralized VAC schemes under modelling uncertainty. Specifically, we consider large-scale, heterogeneous urban traffic networks characterised by nonlinear dynamics and concave macroscopic fundamental diagrams with bounded uncertainty between flow, density, and speed. In this context, we examine a broad class of decentralized VAC dynamics, described by general nonlinear forms. Using passivity theory, we derive scalable, locally verifiable conditions on the design of VAC schemes, that enable stability guarantees in the presence of modelling uncertainty. Several examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed design framework. Our analytical results are validated through numerical simulations on a 6 and a 20-region system, demonstrating their effectiveness and practical relevance.</description>

      <title>Novel Dynamical Systems with Finite-Time and Predefined-Time Stability for Generalized Inverse Mixed Variational Inequality Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of generalized inverse mixed variational inequality problems (GIMVIPs), which consist in finding a vector $\overline{w}\in \R^d$ such that \[ F(\bar w)\in \Omega \quad \text{and} \quad \langle h(\bar w), v-F(\bar w) \rangle + g(v)-g(F(\bar w)) \ge 0, \quad \forall v\in \Omega, \] where \(h,F:\R^d\to\R^d\) are single-valued operators, \(g:\Omega\to\R\cup\{+\infty\}\) is a proper function, and \(\Omega\) is a closed convex set.
  Two novel continuous-time dynamical systems are proposed to study the finite-time and predefined-time stability of solutions to GIMVIPs in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Under suitable assumptions on the involved operators and model parameters, Lyapunov-based techniques are employed to establish finite-time and predefined-time convergence of the generated trajectories.
  Although both dynamical systems exhibit accelerated convergence, the settling time of the finite-time stable system depends on the initial condition, whereas the predefined-time stable system admits a uniform upper bound on the convergence time that is independent of the initial state and can be explicitly prescribed through user-selected parameters. Moreover, by applying a forward Euler discretization to the continuous-time dynamics, a proximal point-type iterative algorithm is derived, and its fixed-time convergence property is rigorously analyzed. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Free boundary regularity for a spectral optimal partition problem with volume and inclusion constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a complete characterization of the free boundary of all solutions to the following spectral $k$-partition problem with measure and inclusion constraints: \[ \inf \left\{\sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_1(\omega_i)\; : \; \omega_i \subset \Omega \mbox{ are nonempty open sets for all } i=1,\ldots, k,\;
  \omega_i \cap \omega_j = \emptyset \: \text{for all}\: i \not=j \mbox{ and } \sum_{i=1}^{k}|\omega_i| = a \right\}, \] where $\Omega$ is a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^N$, $a\in (0,|\Omega|)$. In particular, we prove free boundary conditions, classify contact points, characterize the regular and singular part of the free boundary (including branching points), and describe the interaction of the partition with the fixed boundary $\partial \Omega$.
  The proof is based on a perturbed version of the problem, combined with monotonicity formulas, blowup analysis and classification of blowups, suitable deformations of optimal sets and eigenfunctions, as well as the improvement of flatness of [Russ-Trey-Velichkov, CVPDE 58, 2019] for the one-phase points, and of [De Philippis-Spolaor-Velichkov, Invent. Math. 225, 2021] at two-phase points.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present differentially private (DP) algorithms for bilevel optimization, a problem class that received significant attention lately in various machine learning applications. These are the first algorithms for such problems under standard DP constraints, and are also the first to avoid Hessian computations which are prohibitive in large-scale settings. Under the well-studied setting in which the upper-level is not necessarily convex and the lower-level problem is strongly-convex, our proposed gradient-based $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP algorithm returns a point with hypergradient norm at most $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left((\sqrt{d_\mathrm{up}}/\epsilon n)^{1/2}+(\sqrt{d_\mathrm{low}}/\epsilon n)^{1/3}\right)$ where $n$ is the dataset size, and $d_\mathrm{up}/d_\mathrm{low}$ are the upper/lower level dimensions. Our analysis covers constrained and unconstrained problems alike, accounts for mini-batch gradients, and applies to both empirical and population losses. As an application, we specialize our analysis to derive a simple private rule for tuning a regularization hyperparameter.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization with Preference Exploration using a Monotonic Neural Network Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18792v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-world black-box optimization problems have multiple conflicting objectives. Rather than attempting to approximate the entire set of Pareto-optimal solutions, interactive preference learning allows to focus the search on the most relevant subset. However, few previous studies have exploited the fact that utility functions are usually monotonic. In this paper, we address the Bayesian Optimization with Preference Exploration (BOPE) problem and propose using a neural network ensemble as a utility surrogate model. This approach naturally integrates monotonicity and supports pairwise comparison data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits robustness to noise in utility evaluations. An ablation study highlights the critical role of monotonicity in enhancing performance.</description>

      <title>Integration Matters for Learning PDEs with Backward SDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE)-based deep learning methods provide an alternative to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), offering potential algorithmic advantages in settings such as stochastic optimal control, where the PDEs of interest are tied to an underlying dynamical system. However, standard BSDE-based solvers have empirically been shown to underperform relative to PINNs in the literature. In this paper, we identify the root cause of this performance gap as a discretization bias introduced by the standard Euler-Maruyama (EM) integration scheme applied to one-step self-consistency BSDE losses, which shifts the optimization landscape off target. We find that this bias cannot be satisfactorily addressed through finer step-sizes or multi-step self-consistency losses. To properly handle this issue, we propose a Stratonovich-based BSDE formulation, which we implement with stochastic Heun integration. We show that our proposed approach completely eliminates the bias issues faced by EM integration. Furthermore, our empirical results show that our Heun-based BSDE method consistently outperforms EM-based variants and achieves competitive results with PINNs across multiple high-dimensional benchmarks. Our findings highlight the critical role of integration schemes in BSDE-based PDE solvers, an algorithmic detail that has received little attention thus far in the literature.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum algorithms for permutation-based combinatorial problems: Optimal ansatz generation with applications to quadratic assignment problems and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quantum variational algorithm based on a novel circuit that generates all permutations that can be spanned by one- and two-qubits permutation gates. The construction of the circuits follows from group-theoretical results, most importantly the Bruhat decomposition of the group generated by the \(\mathtt{cx}\) gates. These circuits require a number of qubits that scale logarithmically with the permutation dimension, and are therefore employable in near-term applications. We further augment the circuits with ancilla qubits to enlarge their span, and with these we build ansatze to tackle permutation-based optimization problems such as quadratic assignment problems, and graph isomorphisms. The resulting quantum algorithm, \textsc{QuPer}, is competitive with respect to classical heuristics and we could simulate its behavior up to a problem with $256$ variables, requiring $20$ qubits.</description>

Abstract: This article presents an input convex neural network architecture using Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (ICKAN). Two specific networks are presented: the first is based on a low-order, linear-by-part, representation of functions, and a universal approximation theorem is provided. The second is based on cubic splines, for which only numerical results support convergence. We demonstrate on simple tests that these networks perform competitively with classical input convex neural networks (ICNNs). In a second part, we use the networks to solve some optimal transport problems needing a convex approximation of functions and demonstrate their effectiveness. Comparisons with ICNNs show that cubic ICKANs produce results similar to those of classical ICNNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the initial source identification problem for the heat equation, a notably ill-posed inverse problem characterized by exponential instability. Departing from classical Tikhonov regularization, we propose a novel approach based on moment analysis of the heat flow, transforming the problem into a more stable inverse moment formulation. By evolving the measured terminal time moments backward through their governing ODE system, we recover the moments of the initial distribution. We then reconstruct the source by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total variation of a measure subject to these moment constraints. This formulation naturally promotes sparsity, yielding atomic solutions that are sums of Dirac measures. Compared to existing methods, our moment-based approach reduces exponential error growth to polynomial growth with respect to the terminal time. We provide explicit error estimates on the recovered initial distributions in terms of moment order, terminal time, and measurement errors. In addition, we develop efficient numerical discretization schemes and demonstrate significant stability improvements of our approach through comprehensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>When do spectral gradient updates help in deep learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral gradient methods, such as the recently popularized Muon optimizer, are a promising alternative to standard Euclidean gradient descent for training deep neural networks and transformers, but it is still unclear in which regimes they are expected to perform better. We propose a simple layerwise condition that predicts when a spectral update yields a larger decrease in the loss than a Euclidean gradient step. This condition compares, for each parameter block, the squared nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio of the gradient to the stable rank of the incoming activations. To understand when this condition may be satisfied, we first prove that post-activation matrices have low stable rank at Gaussian initialization in random feature regression, feedforward networks, and transformer blocks. In spiked random feature models we then show that, after a short burn-in, the Euclidean gradient's nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio grows with the data dimension while the stable rank of the activations remains bounded, so the predicted advantage of spectral updates scales with dimension. We validate these predictions in synthetic regression experiments and in NanoGPT-scale language model training, where we find that intermediate activations have low-stable-rank throughout training and the corresponding gradients maintain large nuclear-to-Frobenius ratios. Together, these results identify conditions for spectral gradient methods, such as Muon, to be effective in training deep networks and transformers.</description>

      <title>When Indemnity Insurance Fails: Parametric Coverage under Binding Budget and Risk Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21973v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-risk environments, traditional indemnity insurance is often unaffordable or ineffective, despite its well-known optimality under expected utility. We compare excess-of-loss indemnity insurance with parametric insurance within a common mean-variance framework, allowing for fixed costs, heterogeneous premium loadings, and binding budget constraints. We show that, once these realistic frictions are introduced, parametric insurance can yield higher welfare for risk-averse individuals, even under the same utility objective and without relying on behavioral assumptions. The welfare advantage arises precisely when indemnity insurance becomes impractical, and disappears once both contracts are unconstrained. Our results help reconcile classical insurance theory with the growing use of parametric risk transfer in high-risk settings.</description>

      <title>Minimal Actuator Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selecting a few available actuators to ensure the controllability of a linear system is a fundamental problem in control theory. Previous works either focus on optimal performance, simplifying the controllability issue, or make the system controllable under structural assumptions, such as in graphs or when the input matrix is a design parameter. We generalize these approaches to offer a precise characterization of the general minimal actuator selection problem where a set of actuators is given, described by a fixed input matrix, and goal is to choose the fewest actuators that make the system controllable. We show that this problem can be equivalently cast as an integer linear program and, if actuation channels are sufficiently independent, as a set multicover problem under multiplicity constraints. The latter equivalence is always true if the state matrix has all distinct eigenvalues, in which case it simplifies to the set cover problem. Such characterizations hold even when a robust selection that tolerates a given number of faulty actuators is desired. Our established connection legitimates a designer to use algorithms from the rich literature on the set multicover problem to select the smallest subset of actuators, including exact solutions that do not require brute-force search.</description>
