      <title>Selective colloid transport across planar polymer brushes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer brushes are attractive as surface coatings for a wide range of applications, from fundamental research to everyday life, and also play important roles in biological systems. How colloids (e.g., functional nanoparticles, proteins, viruses) bind and move across polymer brushes is an important yet under-studied problem. We present a mean-field theoretical approach to analyze the binding and transport of colloids in planar polymer brushes. The theory explicitly considers the effect of solvent strength on brush conformation and of colloid-polymer affinity on colloid binding and transport. We derive the position-dependent free energy of the colloid insertion into the polymer brush which controls the rate of colloid transport across the brush. We show how the properties of the brush can be adjusted for brushes to be highly selective, effectively serving as tuneable gates with respect to colloid size and affinity to the brush-forming polymer. The most important parameter regime simultaneously allowing for high brush permeability and selectivity corresponds to a condition when the repulsive and attractive contributions to the colloid insertion free energy nearly cancel. Our theory should be useful to design sensing and purification devices with enhanced selectivity and to better understand mechanisms underpinning the functions of biopolymer brushes.</description>

      <title>Theory of polyelectrolyte dendrigrafts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mean-field approach is used to analyze equilibrium conformations of polyelectrolyte dendrigrafts comprising ionically charged dendrons attached by focal points to a flexible linear backbone. Power law dependences for local structural parameters, cross-sectional thickness and intergraft distance, are derived as a function of grafting density and degree of branching of the dendrons. The cases of quenched and pH-sensitive ionization of the dendrons are considered. The finite extensibility of the backbone is taken into account. It is demonstrated that an increase in the degree of branching of the dendrons leads to a decrease in the dendrigraft thickness compared with that of the polyelectrolyte molecular brush with the same degree of polymerization of the side chains, while intergraft distance either increases or stays close to counter length of fully extended backbone spacer. The analytical mean-field theory predictions are confirmed by results of numerical self-consistent field modelling.</description>

      <title>Micelle Formation of Diblock Copolymers Driven by Cononsolvency Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilizes self-consistent field theory to characterize various features of cononsolvency-driven spherical micelles formed by double hydrophilic block copolymers (DHBCs). Micelles are observed only at an intermediate cosolvent fraction, forming abruptly at a specific solvent/cosolvent mixing ratio and gradually disappearing with further cosolvent addition. A stronger core-block - cosolvent attractive interaction leads to a lower critical micelle concentration and a higher aggregation number. The density profile of cononsolvency-driven micelles is compared with that of conventional micelles, which form due to core-block - solvent repulsive interactions. In conventional micelles, the core is primarily occupied by polymer segments, whereas in cononsolvency-driven micelles, the core consists mainly of solvents and cosolvents. This fundamental difference can be explained through thermodynamic analysis. Conventional micelle formation is driven by the reduction of core-block - solvent contact due to repulsive interactions. In contrast, cononsolvency-driven micelle formation is governed by an increase in core-block - cosolvent contact area, playing the major role to minimize the total free energy-an essential distinction from conventional micelles.</description>

      <title>The strain-stiffening critical exponents in polymer networks and their universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered athermal biopolymer materials, such as collagen networks that constitute a major component in extracellular matrices and various connective tissues, are initially soft and compliant but stiffen dramatically under strain. Such network materials are topologically sub-isostatic and feature strong rigidity scale separation between the bending and stretching response of the constituent polymer fibers. Recently, a comprehensive scaling theory of the athermal strain-stiffening phase transition has been developed, providing predictions for all critical exponents characterising the transition in terms of the distance to the critical strain and of the small rigidity scales ratio. Here, we employ large-scale computer simulations, at and away from criticality, to test the analytic predictions. We find that all numerical critical exponents are in quantitative agreement with the analytically-predicted ones. Moreover, we find that all predicted exponents remain valid whether the driving strain is shear, i.e., volume-preserving, or dilation, and independent of the degree of the network's sub-isostaticity, thus establishing the universality of the strain-stiffening phase transition with respect to the symmetry of the driving strain and the network's topology.</description>

      <title>Topological sorting of magnetic colloidal bipeds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically nontrivial adiabatic loops of the orientation of a homogeneous external magnetic field drive the walking of paramagnetic colloidal bipeds above a deformed quasi-periodic magnetic square pattern. Depending on the topological properties of the loop we can simultaneously control the walking directions of colloidal bipeds as a function of their size and as a function of the size of a deformed unit cell of the pattern. The bipeds walk performing steps with their two feet alternatingly grounding one foot and lifting the other. The step width of the bipeds is given by a set of winding numbers $(w_x,w_{y})\in Z^2$ -- a set of topological invariants -- that can only change by integers as we continuously increase the length of the bipeds. We experimentally use this discrete size dependence for the robust sorting of bipeds according to their length.</description>

      <title>Topological defects in polar active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar active matter - including animal herds, aggregates of motile cells and active colloids - often forms coordinated migration patterns, such as flocking. This orderly motion can be disrupted by full-integer topological defects representing localized disturbances where polar alignment is lost. Such polar defects can serve as key organizing centers across scales, sustaining collective behavior, such as swirling motion and other large-scale coherent states. While significant progress in understanding active matter principles have been made in recent years, a quantitative understanding of how topological defects influence active polar matter is needed. We present a brief overview of recent experimental observations in synthetic active colloids and various biological systems. We describe how polar defects mediate dynamical transitions and contribute to the spontaneous emergence of large-scale coherent states. We also discuss theoretical advancements in physical modeling of coupled processes involving polar defects and collective behavior in active polar matter.</description>

      <title>Chemo-mechanical motility modes of partially wetting liquid droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a simple thermodynamically consistent model that captures the interplay between autocatalytically reacting surfactants, the Marangoni effect and wetting dynamics. An ambient bath of surfactant acts as a chemostat and provides the system with chemical fuel, thereby driving it away from thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that a positive feedback loop between the local reactions and the Marangoni effect induces surface tension gradients that allow for self-propelled droplets. Besides simple directional motion, we find crawling and shuttling droplets as well as droplets performing random walks, thus exploring the entire substrate. We study the occurring dynamics and show how the observed states emerge from local and global bifurcations. Due to the underlying generic thermodynamic structure, we expect that our results are relevant not only to directly related biomimetic droplet systems but also to structurally similar systems like chemically active phase separating mixtures.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical woven fibrillar structures in developing single gyroids in butterflies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nature offers a remarkable diversity of nanomaterials that have extraordinary functional and structural properties. Intrinsic to nature is the impressive ability to form complex ordered nanomaterials via self-organization. One particularly intriguing nanostructure is the Gyroid, a network-like structure exhibiting high symmetry and complex topology. Although its existence in cells and tissues across many biological kingdoms is well documented, how and why it forms remains elusive and uncovering these formation mechanisms will undoubtedly inform bioinspired designs. A beautiful example is the smooth single gyroid that is found in the wing scales of several butterflies, where it behaves as a photonic crystal generating a vibrant green colour. Here, we report that the gyroid structures of the Emerald-patched Cattleheart, Parides sesostris, develop as woven fibrillar structures, disputing the commonly held assumption that they form as smooth constructs. Ultramicroscopy of pupal tissue reveals that the gyroid geometry consists of helical weavings of fibres, akin to hyperbolic line patterns decorating the gyroid. Interestingly, despite their fibrillar nature, electron diffraction reveals the absence of crystalline order within this material. Similar fibrillar structures are also observed in the mature wing scales of P. sesostris specimens with surgically altered pupal development, leading to a blue colouration. Our findings not only introduce a fundamentally new variation of the gyroid in biology but also have significant implications for our understanding of its formation in nature.</description>

      <title>Elastic instability of wormlike micelle solution flow in serpentine channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wormlike micelle (WLM) solutions are abundant in energy, environmental, and industrial applications, which often rely on their flow through tortuous channels. How does the interplay between fluid rheology and channel geometry influence the flow behavior? Here, we address this question by experimentally visualizing and quantifying the flow of a semi-dilute WLM solution in millifluidic serpentine channels. At low flow rates, the base flow is steady and laminar, with strong asymmetry and wall slip. When the flow rate exceeds a critical threshold, the flow exhibits an elastic instability, producing spatially-heterogeneous, unsteady three-dimensional (3D) flow characterized by two notable features: (i) the formation and persistence of stagnant but strongly-fluctuating and multistable "dead zones" in channel bends, and (ii) intermittent 3D "twists" throughout the bulk flow. The geometry of these dead zones and twisting events can be rationalized by considering the minimization of local streamline curvature to reduce flow-generated elastic stresses. Altogether, our results shed new light into how the interplay between solution rheology and tortuous boundary geometry influences WLM flow behavior, with implications for predicting and controlling WLM flows in a broad range of complex environments.</description>

      <title>Transfer of active motion from medium to probe via the induced friction and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can activity be transmitted from smaller to larger scales? We report on such a transfer from a homogeneous active medium to a Newtonian spherical probe. The active medium consists of faster and dilute self-propelled particles, modeled as run-and-tumble particles in 1D or as active Brownian particles in 2D. We derive the reduced fluctuating dynamics of the probe valid for arbitrary probe velocity, characterized by a nonlinear friction and a velocity-dependent noise. There appear several distinct regimes: a standard regime where the probe exhibits passive Brownian motion, and peculiar active regimes where the probe becomes self-propelled with high persistence, and its velocity distribution begets peaks at nonzero values. The resulting propulsion speeds and their persistence are quantitatively obtained and are confirmed by numerical simulations of the joint probe-medium system. The emergence of active regimes depends not only on the far-from-equilibrium nature of the medium but also on the probe-medium coupling. In 1D, a soft coupling is necessary, whereas in 2D, more realistic interactions, such as Lennard-Jones, suffice. Our findings thus reveal how, solely via the induced friction and noise, persistence can cross different scales to transfer active motion.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation on Deformable Membranes: interplay of mechanical coupling and dynamic surface geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-organization of proteins into enriched compartments and the formation of complex patterns are crucial processes for life on the cellular level. Liquid-liquid phase separation is one mechanism for forming such enriched compartments. When phase-separating proteins are membrane-bound and locally disturb it, the mechanical response of the membrane mediates interactions between these proteins. How these membrane-mediated interactions influence the steady state of the protein density distribution is thus an important question to investigate in order to understand the rich diversity of protein and membrane-shape patterns present at the cellular level. This work starts with a widely used model for membrane-bound phase-separating proteins. We numerically solve our system to map out its phase space and perform a careful, systematic expansion of the model equations to characterize the phase transitions through linear stability analysis and free energy arguments. We observe that the membrane-mediated interactions, due to their long-range nature, are capable of qualitatively altering the equilibrium state of the proteins. This leads to arrested coarsening and length-scale selection instead of simple demixing and complete coarsening. In this study, we unambiguously show that long-range membrane-mediated interactions lead to pattern formation in a system that otherwise would not do so. This work provides a basis for further systematic study of membrane-bound pattern-forming systems.</description>

      <title>Dielectric permittivity of water confined in stacks of charged lipid layers: extracting profiles from molecular dynamics simulations using a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most organic and inorganic surfaces (e.g., glass, nucleic acids or lipid membranes) become charged in aqueous solutions. The resulting ionic distribution induces effective interactions between the charged surfaces. Stacks of like-charged lipid bilayers immersed in multivalent ion solutions exhibit strong coupling (SC) effects, where ion correlations cause counter-intuitive membrane attraction. A similar attraction observed with monovalent ions is explained by SC theory through reduced dielectric permittivity under confinement. To explore this phenomenon, we propose a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (mPB) model with spatially varying dielectric permittivity and explicit Born solvation energy for ions. We use the model to investigate the dielectric permittivity profile of confined water in molecular dynamics simulations of charged lipid layers stacks at varying hydration levels, and compare the results with alternative computational methods. The model captures a sharp decrease in permittivity as the system enters the attractive regime, converging to a plateau value that we attribute to lipid headgroups. The generic nature of the mPB framework allows application to other systems, such as other biological interfaces or solid walls, provided ions follow Boltzmann statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous injection of energy in a stationary gas creates a shock wave that propagates radially outwards. We study the hydrodynamics of this disturbance using event driven molecular dynamics of a hard sphere gas in two and three dimensions, the numerical solution of the Euler equation with a virial equation of state for the gas, and the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation, for the cases when the driving is localised in space and when it is uniform throughout the shock. We show that the results from the Euler equation do not agree with the data from hard sphere simulations when the driving is uniform and has singularities when the driving is localised. Including dissipative terms through the Navier-Stokes equation results in reasonably good description of the data, when the coefficients of dissipation are chose parametrically.</description>

Abstract: Relationships between plants and insects vitally underpin the health of global ecosystems and food production. Through co-evolution, insects have acquired a variety of senses in response to the emergence of floral cues such as scent, colour and shape. Therefore, the recent discovery of electroreception among terrestrial arthropods motivates the investigation of floral electrics as part of their wider sensory ecology. We examine how a flower's morphology and material properties produce and propagate detectable, ecologically relevant electrical signals in several biologically inspired scenarios. As the electrical field both interior and exterior to the flower must be solved for, we develop an extension of the two-dimensional AAA-least squares algorithm for solving such two-domain electrostatics problems. It is found that the electrical signals produced by the plant can reveal information to the insect about the flower shape, available pollen and the presence of other nearby arthropods. These results show good qualitative agreement with an equivalent three-dimensional scenario, computed using finite element methods. The extension of the AAA-least squares algorithm to two-domain problems provides a fast and accurate method for modelling electrostatic problems, with possible further application in fluid dynamics and magnetostatics. Biologically, our results highlight the significant role floral electrics may play in plant-pollinator and predator-prey relationships, unveiling previously unstudied facets of these key relationships.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of air invasion in one-dimensional compliant fluid networks</title>

Abstract: Vascular networks exhibit a remarkable diversity of architectures and transport mechanisms across biological systems. Inspired by embolism propagation in plant xylem - where air invades water-filled conduits under negative pressure - we study air penetration in compliant one-dimensional hydrodynamic networks experiencing mass loss by pervaporation. Using a theoretical framework grounded in biomimetic models, we show that embolism dynamics are shaped by the interplay between network compliance and viscous dissipation. In particular, the competition between two timescales - the pressure diffusion time, $\tau_\mathrm{diff}$, and the pervaporation time, $\tau_\mathrm{pv}$ - governs the emergence of complex, history-dependent behaviors. When these two timescales are comparable, we uncover previously unreported nonlinear feedback between the internal pressure field and the embolism front, leading to transient depressurization and delayed interface motion. These results offer a minimal framework for understanding embolism dynamics in slow-relaxing vascular systems and provide design principles for soft microfluidic circuits with tunable, nonlinear response.</description>
