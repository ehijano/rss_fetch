      <title>Toward Large-Scale Photonics-Empowered AI Systems: From Physical Design Automation to System-Algorithm Co-Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we identify three considerations that are essential for realizing practical photonic AI systems at scale: (1) dynamic tensor operation support for modern models rather than only weight-static kernels, especially for attention/Transformer-style workloads; (2) systematic management of conversion, control, and data-movement overheads, where multiplexing and dataflow must amortize electronic costs instead of letting ADC/DAC and I/O dominate; and (3) robustness under hardware non-idealities that become more severe as integration density grows. To study these coupled tradeoffs quantitatively, and to ensure they remain meaningful under real implementation constraints, we build a cross-layer toolchain that supports photonic AI design from early exploration to physical realization. SimPhony provides implementation-aware modeling and rapid cross-layer evaluation, translating physical costs into system-level metrics so architectural decisions are grounded in realistic assumptions. ADEPT and ADEPT-Z enable end-to-end circuit and topology exploration, connecting system objectives to feasible photonic fabrics under practical device and circuit constraints. Finally, Apollo and LiDAR provide scalable photonic physical design automation, turning candidate circuits into manufacturable layouts while accounting for routing, thermal, and crosstalk constraints.</description>

      <title>Democratizing Electronic-Photonic AI Systems: An Open-Source AI-Infused Cross-Layer Co-Design and Design Automation Toolflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonics is becoming a cornerstone technology for high-performance AI systems and scientific computing, offering unparalleled speed, parallelism, and energy efficiency. Despite this promise, the design and deployment of electronic-photonic AI systems remain highly challenging due to a steep learning curve across multiple layers, spanning device physics, circuit design, system architecture, and AI algorithms. The absence of a mature electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) toolchain leads to long, inefficient design cycles and limits cross-disciplinary innovation and co-evolution. In this work, we present a cross-layer co-design and automation framework aimed at democratizing photonic AI system development. We begin by introducing our architecture designs for scalable photonic edge AI and Transformer inference, followed by SimPhony, an open-source modeling tool for rapid EPIC AI system evaluation and design-space exploration. We then highlight advances in AI-enabled photonic design automation, including physical AI-based Maxwell solvers, a fabrication-aware inverse design framework, and a scalable inverse training algorithm for meta-optical neural networks, enabling a scalable EPDA stack for next-generation electronic-photonic AI systems.</description>

      <title>First-Return Statistics in Henyey-Greenstein Scattering: Colored Motzkin Polynomials and the Cauchy Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that first-return statistics in three-dimensional Henyey-Greenstein scattering are governed by colored Motzkin polynomials modulated by a Cauchy kernel. In our previous work, we established that first-return probabilities in 1D scattering expand in Catalan and Motzkin numbers. Extending this to 3D anisotropic scattering requires a Boundary Truncation Factor (BTF) that takes a Cauchy kernel form. Here we explain why. Projecting the 3D walk onto the depth-optical-path plane and applying the Central Limit Theorem yields Gaussian statistics; Beer-Lambert weighting shifts the Gaussian center linearly in scattering order n, producing a Cauchy-distributed ratio. The BTF has width parameter m*(g) = 4g/(1-g) and amplitude A(g) = 1 - g(1+g)/2. Monte Carlo confirms this to 1-2% for g &lt; 2/3. The integers 2 and 4 have geometric meaning: n=2 is the minimum scattering order for first return; the factor 4 combines exponential path-length statistics with first-passage geometry. New contributions include: (i) a projection formalism mapping 3D walks to two-dimensional phase space, (ii) a Central Limit Theorem derivation of the Cauchy BTF with explicit parameters, (iii) identification of a Poisson-Cauchy correspondence linking boundary-constrained exponential processes to heavy-tailed statistics, and (iv) generalization to oblique incidence through colored Motzkin polynomials.</description>

      <title>Generalized model of anisotropic thermo-optic response on thin-film lithium niobate platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermo-optic (TO) control is crucial for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic integrated circuits (PICs), offering a simple and practical method for low-frequency and DC tuning while remaining compatible with high-frequency electro-optic (EO) modulation. In x-cut TFLN, the TO response is inherently anisotropic, depending on both waveguide propagation angle and polarization due to the mode-specific overlap of the electric field with the ordinary and extraordinary refractive index axes of the crystal. Despite its significance, a systematic and quantitative analysis of this anisotropy has remained elusive. Here, we present the first generalized analytical model that describes the anisotropic TO response as a function of polarization and arbitrary waveguide orientation, and rigorously validate it through numerical simulations and experiments. This study provides foundational insight into anisotropic thermal tuning and enables new opportunities for engineering energy-efficient and scalable photonic design in next-generation TFLN PICs.</description>

      <title>Polar enhancement of optical nonlinearities and domain-driven second harmonic contrast in bismuth telluro-halide van der Waals crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BiTeX family of polar van der Waals (vdW) semiconductors offers a unique platform for exploring the interplay between polar crystalline structure and nonlinear optical phenomena. Here, we utilize second harmonic generation (SHG) polarimetry to demonstrate giant anisotropic optical nonlinearities in BiTeBr and BiTeI driven by contributions to the crystals' nonlinear polarizability originating from their permanent dipole moment. In addition, using SHG microscopy, we show that BiTeI displays a distinctive SHG spatial texture consisting of thread-like regions of reduced harmonic intensity. These features demark the boundaries between phase and anti-phase polar domains, confirmed via piezoresponse force microscopy and are attributable to disorder-driven restoration of inversion symmetry and concomitant optical interference effects. Our results unveil the power of polarization-resolved SHG microscopy in elucidating the intricate relationship between structure, symmetry, and nonlinear optical responses in polar vdW materials and highlight the promise of BiTeX as a material platform for domain-engineered nanoscale nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <title>A POD-DeepONet Framework for Forward and Inverse Design of 2D Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a reduced-order operator-learning framework for forward and inverse band-structure design of two-dimensional photonic crystals with binary, pixel-based $p4m$-symmetric unit cells. We construct a POD--DeepONet surrogate for the discrete band map along the standard high-symmetry path by coupling a POD trunk extracted from high-fidelity finite-element band snapshots with a neural branch network that predicts reduced coefficients. This architecture yields a compact and differentiable forward model that is tailored to the underlying Bloch eigenvalue discretization. We establish continuity of the discrete band map on the relaxed design space and prove a uniform approximation property of the POD--DeepONet surrogate, leading to a natural decomposition of the total surrogate error into POD truncation and network approximation contributions. Building on this forward surrogate, we formulate two end-to-end neural inverse design procedures, namely dispersion-to-structure and band-gap inverse design, with training objectives that combine data misfit, binarity promotion, and supervised regularization to address the intrinsic non-uniqueness of the inverse mapping and to enable stable gradient-based optimization in the relaxed space. Our numerical results show that the proposed framework achieves accurate forward predictions and produces effective inverse designs on practical high-contrast, pixel-based photonic layouts.</description>

      <title>Carrier Drift Modulation and the Hyperbolic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Carrier Drift Modulation - a new mechanism for creating temporal boundaries and enabling photonic time crystals. This approach opens a direct route to hyperbolic temporal metamaterials and, in particular, hyperbolic time crystals. We demonstrate that the very process responsible for time crystal formation can simultaneously compensate for intrinsic material losses in the supporting medium - overcoming one of the central challenges in nanophotonics. The realization of truly lossless hyperbolic media, long considered as one of the key challenges of nanophotonics, unlocks new possibilities for subwavelength light focusing, strong-field physics, and novel regimes of light-matter interaction. Crucially, the proposed approach can be implemented using existing materials and readily available light sources, making it both practical and transformative.</description>

      <title>Tabletop X-ray ghost video of moving objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray imaging is widely employed in clinical medicine, industrial inspection, and various scientific research fields. Unfortunately, most currently used X-ray two-dimensional (2D) detectors suffer from a fundamental trade-off between the number of pixels and readout time, making them unsuitable for fast moving objects imaging, as well as the readout dead time causes frame losses. X-ray ghost imaging (XGI) offers an alternative approach to image an object using only a highly sensitive single-pixel detector. However, a critical limitation of existing XGI methods is the excessive total acquisition time required, rendering it impractical for real applications. In this paper, we propose a rapid spatial modulation scheme based on random binary patterns encoded onto a fast-spinning mask. Clear X-ray visualization of moving objects is demonstrated with imaging rates up to 200 frames per second with a resolution of 225 um. For the first time, our method has greatly improved the XGI imaging speed and paves the way for X-ray imaging application of motion objects, such as the inspection of rotating aero-engines and in vivo medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Anti-reflection coatings for highly anisotropic materials in the mid infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and optimize thin anti-reflection coatings (ARCs) for highly anisotropic materials in the mid infrared. Unlike conventional ARCs that assume nearly isotropic refractive indices, this work fully integrates the anisotropic nature of materials into the design process. We describe two designs of thin ARCs for highly anisotropic materials: a single form-birefringent layer, and a planar bilayer. We realized the planar bilayer ARC experimentally, demonstrating excellent mid-infrared anti-reflectance across over a broad range of angles for all polarizations.</description>

      <title>Microwave vortex beam lasing via photonic time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave lasing carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) holds significant potential for advanced applications in fields such as high-capacity communications, precision sensing, and radar imaging. However, conventional approaches to masers fail to produce emission with embedded OAM. The recent emergence of photonic time crystals (PTCs)-artificially structured media with periodically varying electromagnetic properties in time-offers a paradigm shift toward resonance-free lasing without the need for gain media. Yet, pioneering PTC designs have been based on three-dimensional bulk structures, which lack a surface-emitting configuration, and do not possess the capability to modulate OAM, thus hindering the realization of surface-emitted PTC masing that carries OAM. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration of non-resonant, gain medium-free, and surface-emitted microwave vortex beam lasing OAM using ring-shaped PTCs. By developing a multiplier-driven time-varying metamaterial that achieves over 100% equivalent permittivity modulation depth, we establish momentum bandgaps (k gaps) with sufficient bandwidth to overcome intrinsic losses and enable self-sustained coherent microwave amplification. Furthermore, space-time modulation induces non-reciprocity between clockwise and counterclockwise k gap modes within the circularly symmetric PTC structure, facilitating the selective generation of microwave lasing carrying OAM-a capability beyond the reach of conventional maser technologies. Our work bridges PTC physics with coherent OAM-carrying microwave emission, establishing a transformative platform for next-generation wireless communications, advanced sensing systems, and OAM-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Video-rate holographic telepresence via single-shot, reference-free wavefront measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reference-free holographic telepresence system that directly captures and replays complex optical wavefronts from a single intensity speckle measurement. Using a pre-characterized geometric phase diffuser, the incident field self-interferes to form a speckle pattern, from which the wavefront is recovered via a speckle-correlation scattering-matrix approach and refined using smoothed amplitude flow with Nesterov acceleration. The reconstructed phase is directly projected onto a spatial light modulator for holographic replay. We demonstrate volumetric refocusing, dynamic three-dimensional reconstruction, and sustained video-rate operation at approximately 28 frames per second with modest communication bandwidth. The results highlight measurement-driven wavefront acquisition as a practical pathway toward compact and physically faithful holographic telepresence.</description>

      <title>Solar-pumped Radiation-balanced Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar-pumped lasers, predominantly based on neodymium gain media, offer a promising route to renewable laser-energy conversion and space-based photonics; however, their performance has been constrained by thermal loading and limited power scalability. Here, we propose and numerically investigate a solar-pumped ytterbium thin-disk gain medium in combination with a dome concentrator that enables multipass solar pumping and enhanced absorption. The design yields comparably low lasing thresholds for neodymium- and ytterbium-doped media, while ytterbium provides superior power scalability, enabling up to threefold higher output power. We further identify ytterbium-doped medium combined with a spherical concentrator as a viable solar-pumped, radiation-balanced configuration, achieving self-cooled lasing at solar pump intensities of 28.5 kW cm-2 within the 1020-1033 nm window of the solar spectrum. The spherical concentrator increases the averaged fluence of the solar pump while permitting anti-Stokes fluorescence to escape efficiently. These results establish multi-pass, solar-pumped thin-disk ytterbium lasers as a compact, scalable, and sustainable platform for high-performance solar-pumped lasers</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Microwave Engineering: Constructing Dispersion Relations and Enabling On-Demand Frequency-Momentum Transformations via Time-Switched Long-Distance Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal metamaterials (MTMs) have recently attracted significant research attention across different areas of wave physics, owing to their ability to translate long-range interactions among meta-atoms into a wide array of wavevector-dependent responses and functionalities. In this work, we introduce nonlocal transmission line metamaterials (TL MTMs) as a versatile platform to investigate and engineer nonlocality in the microwave frequency regime. We first establish a concise theoretical framework for nonlocal TL MTMs based on circuit and network theory, from which we derive the general dispersion relation for TL MTMs having arbitrarily complex nonlocal coupling configurations. Building upon this foundation, we demonstrate how such structures can be used to synthesize nearly arbitrary, even, dispersion functions within their first Brillouin zone, effectively linking nonlocal circuit parameters to prescribed dispersion profiles. Finally, we introduce time-switched nonlocal TL MTMs, a new class of metamaterials with time-varying nonlocality in which the nonlocal branches are dynamically activated as an electromagnetic pulse propagates through the structure. This platform enables complex, nearly arbitrary frequency-momentum transformations on a propagating pulse, as well as the simultaneous excitation of modes with positive, negative, and zero group velocity within the first Brillouin zone. Our results offer new physical insights into the behavior of nonlocal MTMs, a versatile platform to investigate the interplay of frequency dispersion, spatial dispersion and time modulation, and a general theoretical foundation for the design of more advanced nonlocal and time-varying electromagnetic and photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Polarizing Antiresonant Hollow-Core Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving robust single-polarization guidance in hollow-core fibers has remained a longstanding challenge, limiting their integration into precision photonic systems. Here, we report the first experimental realization of a low-loss, polarization filtering antiresonant hollow-core fiber (AR-HCF). Conventional AR-HCFs inherently support degenerate orthogonal polarization modes, making them vulnerable to polarization drift under environmental perturbations. Our dual-ring fiber design introduces polarization-selective resonant coupling to lossy cladding modes, enabling strong polarization filtering without compromising transmission efficiency. The fiber achieves a polarization extinction ratio exceeding 21 dB and a propagation loss as low as 0.15 dB m^-1 over a 10 m fiber length. The design is scalable across wavelength bands and maintains polarization discrimination under mechanical bending, making it highly suitable for applications in fiber-based gyroscopes, quantum optics, and polarization-sensitive nonlinear interactions. This work represents a significant step toward monolithic, polarization-selective hollow-core fiber systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the unique properties of PT-symmetric Topological Weyl Semimetals (TWS) within the framework of non-Hermitian physics, focusing on their potential for generating topological lasers. By exploring the role of spectral singularities and their relationship to exceptional points, we examine how these materials, characterized by Weyl nodes and topologically protected surface states, can support novel optical phenomena such as unidirectional propagation and enhanced lasing. Through a theoretical model based on the transfer matrix approach, we reveal how the interplay between the PT symmetry and the axion term introduces new dynamics, leading to 12 distinct topological laser configurations. The study also investigates the impact of the $\theta$-term on spectral singularities, showing how it quantizes the system's gain values and influences the topological properties of the lasers. By applying our model to the TaAs material, a known Weyl semimetal, we uncover previously unreported effects, demonstrating the potential of PT-symmetric TWS materials for advanced optoelectronic applications. We show that the axion-induced cyclotron-like Hall current in a PT-symmetric TWS medium, revealing its topological characteristics and distinct flow patterns in the gain and loss regions, which serve as indicators of the system's topological symmetry. Our findings open new avenues for the development of robust, tunable, and efficient topological lasers with applications in quantum information processing and beyond.</description>

      <title>Achieving Extraordinary Acoustic Transmission in a Single Slit by Boundary Impedance Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extraordinary acoustic transmission is commonly associated with periodic or multi-aperture structures. In this work, we show that a single subwavelength slit can support strongly enhanced transmission when its boundary response is described by an effective impedance. Using a reduced analytical model together with numerical calculations, we demonstrate that appropriate impedance tuning leads to efficient coupling between the incident field and the slit mode, resulting in transmission levels approaching unity. The observed enhancement is governed by impedance matching rather than geometric periodicity, highlighting a minimal mechanism for extraordinary transmission. This study establishes boundary impedance control as a versatile route for manipulating acoustic wave transport through deeply subwavelength apertures.</description>

      <title>Color symmetry breaking in a nonlinear optical microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to diverse phenomena across the natural sciences, from the Higgs mechanism in particle physics to superconductors and collective animal behavior. In photonic systems, the symmetry of light states can be broken when two optical fields interact through the Kerr nonlinearity, as shown in early demonstrations with counterpropagating and cross-polarized modes. Here, we report the first observation of color symmetry breaking in an integrated silicon nitride microring, where spontaneous power imbalance arises between optical mode at different wavelengths, mediated by the Kerr effect. The threshold power for this effect is as low as 19 mW. By examining the system's homogeneous states, we further demonstrate a Kerr-based nonlinear activation-function generator that produces sigmoid-, quadratic-, and leaky-ReLU-like responses. These findings reveal previously unexplored nonlinear dynamics in dual-pumped Kerr resonators and establish new pathways towards compact, all-optical neuromorphic circuits.</description>

      <title>Generation and characterization of coherent terahertz radiation from 100-TW laser-wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally characterized terahertz (THz) radiation emitted from laser-wakefield acceleration (LWFA) driven at 100-TW laser power. Simultaneous measurements of the laser energy, electron-bunch charge, and THz energy reveal a quadratic dependence of the THz energy on both charge and laser energy. This behavior indicates coherent collective emission in the generation process and provides a useful scaling law for THz output. Microbolometer-based beam profiling shows a relatively large THz beam divergence (~0.2 rad). Single-shot THz interferometry further shows that the emitted THz pulse is sub-picosecond in duration and broadband. Combining the beam-profile and interferometric measurements, the THz spectrum is expected to span approximately 1-20 THz. Together, these results support coherent acceleration radiation as the dominant mechanism for THz generation in 100-TW LWFA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the formation and collision of one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) Gaussian-shaped and flat-top (FT) solitons in the framework of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the cubic-quintic nonlinearity and two intersecting potential troughs. We find that Gaussian-Gaussian and Gaussian-FT collisions between the solitons, steered by the troughs, are quasi-elastic, while the collisions between FT solitons may be either quasi-elastic or inelastic, in the form of merger into a single FT soliton, thus spontaneously breaking the symmetry between the steering troughs. The Gaussian-FT collisions, being overall quasi-elastic, generate weak radiation fields.</description>

      <title>Multispectral UV Imaging on Capacitive CMOS Arrays Enabled by Solution-Processed Metal-Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultraviolet (UV) imagers are important for a variety of applications, such as quality inspection in the semiconductor industry, forensics and food quality inspection, but are often costly because they require dedicated semiconductor process flows. Here, an imaging chip is introduced that has been fabricated using standard 40 nm complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) technology. Instead of using a conventional charge-based photodetection principle, the imager uses a capacitive operation principle where UV-light causes capacitance changes via the photodielectric effect in a functionalization layer, which are measured by the underlying CMOS circuitry. This spin-coated or inkjet-printed functionalization layer consists of solution-processed, wide-bandgap, semiconducting metaloxide nanoparticles, and facilitates multispectral imaging. The sensors exhibit low noiseequivalent powers (17-138 fW Hz^-1/2) across the UV bands. Unlike conventional silicon CMOS imagers, the present capacitive-CMOS platform is inherently visible-blind, providing selective UV detection. This work positions late-functionalized capacitive-CMOS arrays as a route toward reducing the cost of UV imagers, which can lead to their more widespread implementation in consumer and low-volume application-specific products.</description>

      <title>Multistep quantum master equation theory for response functions in four wave mixing electronic spectroscopy of multichromophoric macromolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides an alternative derivation of third order response functions in four wave mixing spectroscopy of multichromophoric macromolecular systems considering only single exciton states. For the case of harmonic oscillator bath linearly and diagonally coupled to exciton states, closed form expressions showing all the explicit time dependences are derived. These expressions can provide more solid physical basis for understanding 2-dimensional electronic spectroscopy signals. For more general cases of system-bath coupling, the quantum master equation (QME) approach is employed for the derivation of multistep time evolution equations for Green function-like operators. Solution of these equations is feasible at the level of 2nd order non-Markovian QME, and the new approach can account for inter-exciton coupling, dephasing, relaxation, and non-Markovian effects in a consistent manner.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate quantum levitation controlled by Casimir forces acting between a polystyrene surface and a Teflon-coated metallic substrate immersed in a mixture of Toluene and magnetite particles. This system experiences repulsion-attraction transitions in the Casimir interaction for distances where the effect is measurable. This Casimir trapping can be controlled by clever choices of metallic and ferrofluid materials, which are directly linked to the emergence of the trapping effect. Thermal and quantum contributions are investigated in detail, showing how the optical and magnetic properties of the ferrofluid and other materials affect the magnitude of the trapping and its distance range of observability.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the band structure and topological phases of one- and two-dimensional bipartite atomic lattices mediated by long-range dissipative radiative coupling. By deriving an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for the single-excitation sector, we demonstrate that the low-energy dynamics of the system are governed by a Dirac equation with a complex Fermi velocity. We analyze the associated topological invariants for both the SSH and honeycomb models, utilizing synthetic gauge fields to break time-reversal symmetry in the latter. Finally, we explicitly verify the non-Hermitian bulk-edge correspondence by deriving analytical solutions for edge states localized at domain boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fluctuation-induced Casimir interactions between two parallel graphene sheets carrying steady-state drift currents. The graphene properties are modeled based on the shifted Fermi disk model to capture the non-equilibrium optical response of the system. We find that the drift current introduces a repulsive correction to the perpendicular to the layers Casimir interaction, thereby reducing the overall attractive force. Although the correction is repulsive, it does not overcome the underlying attraction between the layers. It also generates a lateral force that opposes the carrier flow direction. Both contributions are studied in terms of distance and drift velocity functionalities showing pathways for Casimir force control.</description>

      <title>Stimulation of surface ionization waves by pulsed laser irradiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inclusion of semiconducting material within a composite barrier enables the perfectly uniform propagation of surface ionization waves (SIW) in air at atmospheric pressure regardless of the polarity of the applied electric field, unlike surface discharges generated using purely dielectric barriers. We exploit the photonic properties of silicon to stimulate the SIW using external irradiation by a 2-ns pulsed laser at 532 nm, with a fluence of 1.3 mJ/cm$^2$ per pulse at the surface. No effect is observed when irradiation occurs more than 3 $\mu$s before plasma generation. This timescale is attributed to the ambipolar diffusion of photoexcited carriers away from the Si-SiO$_2$ interface. When this delay shortens to less than 3 $\mu$s, the SIW propagates farther and with more intense optical emission. Furthermore, the energy of the discharge increases by up to 7%. The sensitivity to the laser-plasma delay demonstrates that the observed stimulation of the SIW cannot be due to the desorption of surface charge by irradiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A defining quantity of a physical system is its energy which is represented by the Hamiltonian. In closed quantum mechanical or/and coherent wave-based systems the Hamiltonian is introduced as a Hermitian operator which ensures real energy spectrum and secures the decomposition of any state over a complete basis set spanning the space where the states live. Pseudo-Hermitian, or PT symmetric, systems are a special class of non-Hermitian ones. They describe open systems but may still have real energy spectrum. The eigenmodes are however not orthogonal in general. This qualitative difference to Hermitian physics has a range of consequences for the physical behaviour of the system in the steady state or when it is subjected to external perturbations. This overview reviews the recent progress in the field of pseudo-Hermitian physics as it unfolds when applied to low-energy excitations of magnetically ordered materials. The focus is mainly on long wave length spin excitations (spin waves) with magnons being the energy quanta of these excitations. Various setups including ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, magnonic crystals, and hybride structures with different types of coupling to the environments as well as spatio-temporally engineered systems will be discussed with a focus on the particular aspects that are brought about by the pseudo-Hermiticity such as mode amplifications, non-reciprocal propagation, magnon cloaking, non-Hermitian skin effect, PT-symmetric assisted Floquet engineering, topological energy transfer, and field-induced enhanced sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Effects of Donor-Acceptor Quantum Coherence and Non-Markovian Bath on the Distance Dependence of Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate information on the distance dependence of resonance energy transfer (RET) is crucial for its utilization as a spectroscopic ruler \re{of} nanometer scale distances. In this regard, understanding the effects of donor-acceptor quantum coherence and non-Markovian bath, which become significant at short distances, has significant implications. The present work investigates this issue theoretically by comparing results from a theory of coherent RET (CRET) with a nonequilibrium version of F\"{o}rster's RET (FRET) theory, both accounting for non-Markovian bath effects. Even for a model where the donor-acceptor electronic coupling is of transition dipole interaction form, it is shown that the RET rate in general deviates from the inverse sixth power distance dependence as opposed to the prediction of the original FRET. It is shown that the donor-acceptor quantum coherence makes the \re{distance} dependence steeper than the sixth power although detailed manner of enhancement is sensitive to specific values of parameters. On the other hand, the non-Markovian bath effects make the \re{distance} dependence more moderate than the sixth power for both CRET and nonueqilibrium FRET because finite time scale of the bath causes the rate to be smaller than the prediction of original FRET. While these effects are \re{demonstrated clearly} in the population dynamics at sub-picosecond time scales, their contributions to the conventional RET efficiency are relatively minor. This indicates that the actual detection of such effects through conventional RET efficiency measurement requires either high precision or utilization of a donor with fast spontaneous decay rate of excitation.</description>

Abstract: Light-in-flight (LiF) measurements enable the visualization of light paths through arbitrary, volumetric scenes, making light-matter interactions at ultrafast timescales visible. Traditionally, LiF measurements require specialized equipment, such as ultrashort pulse light sources and high-speed electronics, often limited by low spatial resolution. Herein, we introduce a novel computational approach,"Synthetic Light-in-Flight" (SLiF), that overcomes these constraints by relying solely on tunable, continuous wave (CW) lasers and off-the-shelf CMOS cameras. From multiple CW scene measurements at different optical wavelengths, we create multiple "synthetic fields," each at a "synthetic wavelength," which is the beat wave of two respective optical waves. These synthetic fields are robust to speckle and environmental fluctuations, enabling us to combine multiple synthetic fields into a "synthetic light pulse" that sections the volumetric scene. Additionally, we demonstrate that these complex synthetic pulse fields can be freely manipulated in the computer after their acquisition, allowing for spatial and temporal shaping of different sets of pulses from the same set of measurements to maximize the decoded information output for each scene. Finally, we show that the recovered time-of-flight information can be used to characterize physical scene properties, such as depth and refractive indices.</description>

      <title>Tamm Plasmon--Enhanced Widely Tunable Near-Infrared Nanolaser with Superior Efficiency and Output Power</title>

Abstract: Plasmonic resonances enable strong electromagnetic field confinement and have been widely exploited in plasmonic nanolasers, particularly through surface plasmon polaritons and localized surface plasmons. However, their performance is often limited by bidirectional output coupling and multimode far-field emission, primarily due to higher-order diffraction arising from these modes. In this work, we utilize the Tamm plasmon resonance to realize lasing in the NIR region with wide tunability. The optical Tamm states are excited at the metal-DBR interface by an incident pump pulse and their emission intensity is significantly enhanced via extraordinary optical transmission through a metallic nanohole array. The subwavelength periodicity of the nanohole array restricts the emission to the zeroth order, resulting in a highly directional far-field pattern with a full width at half maximum of approximately 0.631 degrees. To further improve performance, a second DBR is incorporated beneath the pump side, which substantially suppresses backward emission around the lasing wavelength and enhances forward lasing intensity by around 1.3 X 10^4 times, thus increasing the integrated emission power. The combination of Tamm plasmon excitation and dual-DBR feedback significantly improves the cavity's optical response and overall lasing efficiency. Additionally, we have demonstrated lasing at 870 nm with a reduced pump threshold of 2.8 X 10^7 V/m (energy of 0.0031 mJ/cm^2). Moreover, a broad tunability in lasing wavelength, spanning from 850 nm to 944.5 nm, is achieved. These results demonstrate a cost-effective and versatile strategy for plasmonic nanolasers with enhanced output power, low reflection-side loss, wide tunability, and strong integration potential for on-chip photonic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Resolution and Robustness Bounds for Reconstructive Spectrometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructive spectrometers are a promising emerging class of devices that combine complex light scattering with inference to enable compact, high-resolution spectrometry. Thus far, the physical determinants of these devices' performance remain under-explored. We show that under a broad range of conditions, the noise-induced error for spectral reconstruction is governed by the Fisher information. We then use random matrix theory to derive a closed-form relation linking the variance bound to a set of key physical parameters: the spectral correlation length, the mean transmittance, and the number of frequency and measurement channels. The analysis reveals certain fundamental trade-offs between these physical parameters, and establishes the conditions for a spectrometer to achieve ``super-resolution'' below the limit set by the spectral correlation length. Our theory is confirmed using numerical validations with a random matrix model as well as full-wave simulations. These results establish a physically-grounded framework for designing and analyzing performant and noise-robust reconstructive spectrometers.</description>

      <title>Generation of NIR and Visible Structured Light Beams with a Mechanical Long-Period Fiber Grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the tunable generation of vortex, vector, and flat-top 1060-nm NIR beams in a few-mode fiber with a mechanical long-period fiber grating. By the variation of applied force on the fiber grating, the core mode to higher-order mode excitation can be adjusted. The manipulation of the beam transformation is achieved through the polarization control of the fiber eigenmodes and mode coupling efficiency. By precisely tuning the intensity ratio between fundamental and doughnut modes, we arrive at the generation of propagation-invariant vector flat-top beams for more than 5 m. Transverse optical field of 532-nm green light from frequency-doubled Nd-doped yttrium vanadate laser is manipulated and coupled into various intensity distributions in a few-mode fiber by using a mechanically induced long-period fiber grating. We show that the doughnut beam, the Mexican-hat beam, and the crater-lake beam can be generated from the input Gaussian beam via the coupling of the fundamental core mode to a series of co-propagating higher-order modes with properly applied forces and polarizations.</description>

      <title>Hopf Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13012v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Lifshitz Theory for Cavity Modification of Ground-State Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theory for ground-state modifications of matter embedded in a Fabry-Perot cavity and whose excitations are described as harmonic oscillators is presented. Based on Lifshitz's theory for vacuum energy and employing a Lorentz model for the material permittivity, a nonperturbative macroscopic QED model that accounts for the infinite number of cavity modes with a continuum of their wavevectors was built. Differences from the commonly used single-mode Hopfield Hamiltonian are revealed. The nonresonant role of polaritons in the ground-state energy shift is also demonstrated, showing that the cavity effect is mainly caused by static screening occurring at very low frequencies. The theory allows for a straightforward incorporation of losses and temperature effects.</description>

      <title>Photon Blockade Mediated by Two-Photon Absorption in an Optical Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon blockade (PB) is a quantum effect in strongly nonlinear systems where a single photon prevents the system from being excited to a higher level, generating anti-bunched light fields. It enables the generation of single-photon sources for quantum information processing. Conventional photon blockade (CPB) leverages strong nonlinear interactions to generate an anharmonic energy spectrum. Unconventional photon blockade (UPB) utilizes destructive quantum interference between excitation pathways. Recently, environmentally induced photon blockade (EPB) has emerged as a novel approach, exploiting two-photon absorption (TPA) to realize photon blockade. In this work, we combine UPB and EPB together, considering the TPA effect in the optical parametric amplifier (OPA), thereby achieving a more stable PB with stronger suppression of multi-photon states.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic ultrafast edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ driven by broken crystal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directional photocurrents in two-dimensional materials arise from broken crystal symmetry, offering pathways to high-speed, bias-free photodetection beyond conventional devices. Tungsten ditelluride (WTe$_2$), a type-II Weyl semimetal, exhibits robust symmetry-breaking-induced edge photocurrents from competing nonlinear optical and photothermoelectric mechanisms, whose intrinsic dynamics have remained experimentally inaccessible. Here, we directly resolve sub-picosecond edge photocurrent dynamics in WTe$_2$ through ohmic contacts over temperatures from 300 K to 4 K. We demonstrate ultrafast optical-to-electrical conversion with a 3 dB bandwidth of $\sim$250 GHz and reveal picosecond-timescale switching of the net photocurrent direction below 150 K, linked to a Lifshitz transition. This transient bipolar response arises from non-equilibrium Seebeck effects due to asymmetric cooling of hot electrons and holes. These findings reveal previously hidden ultrafast dynamics in symmetry-engineered materials, offering new strategies to disentangle competing photocurrent mechanisms and enabling the development of self-powered, ultrafast optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Controlling Nonadiabatic Transitions Through Engineered Ultrafast Laser Fields at Conical Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate coherent control of nonadiabatic dynamics at a conical intersection (CI) using engineered ultrafast laser pulses. Within a model vibronic system, we tailor pulse chirp and temporal profile and compute the resulting wave-packet population and coherence dynamics using projections along the reaction coordinate. This approach allows us to resolve the detailed evolution of wave-packets as they traverse the degeneracy region with strong nonadiabatic coupling. By systematically varying pulse parameters, we demonstrate that both chirp and pulse duration modulate vibrational coherence and alter branching between competing pathways, leading to controlled changes in quantum yield. Our results elucidate the dynamical mechanisms underlying pulse-shaped control near conical intersections and establish a general framework for manipulating ultrafast nonadiabatic processes.</description>
