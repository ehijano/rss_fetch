      <title>Evolution of discordant edges in the voter model on random sparse digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the voter model dynamics on a directed random graph model ensemble (digraphs), given by the Directed Configuration Model. The voter model captures the evolution of opinions over time on a graph where each vertex represents an individual holding a binary opinion. Our primary interest lies in the density of discordant edges, defined as the fraction of edges connecting vertices with different opinions, and its asymptotic behavior as the graph size grows to infinity. This analysis provides valuable insights, not only into the consensus time behavior but also into how the process approaches this absorption time on shorter time scales. Our analysis is based on the study of certain annealed random walk processes evolving on out-directed, marked Galton-Watson trees, which describe the locally tree-like nature of the considered random graph model. Additionally, we employ innovative coupling techniques that exploit the classical stochastic dual process of coalescing random walks. We extend existing results on random regular graphs to the more general setting of heterogeneous and directed configurations, highlighting the role of graph topology in the opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Subadditivity and optimal matching of unbounded samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain new bounds for the optimal matching cost for empirical measures with unbounded support. For a large class of radially symmetric and rapidly decaying probability laws, we prove for the first time the asymptotic rate of convergence for the whole range of power exponents $p$ and dimensions $d$. Moreover we identify the exact prefactor when $p\le d$. We cover in particular the Gaussian case, going far beyond the currently known bounds. Our proof technique is based on approximate sub- and super-additivity bounds along a geometric decomposition adapted to some features the density, such as its radial symmetry and its decay at infinity.</description>

      <title>Mixing of metastable diffusion processes with Gibbs invariant distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the mixing properties of metastable diffusion processes which possess a Gibbs invariant distribution. For systems with multiple stable equilibria, so-called metastable transitions between these equilibria are required for mixing since the unique invariant distribution is concentrated on these equilibria. Consequently, these systems exhibit slower mixing compared to those with a unique stable equilibrium, as analyzed in Barrera and Jara (Ann. Appl. Probab. 30:1164-1208, 2020). . Our proof is based on the theory of metastability, which is a primary tool for studying systems with multiple stable equilibria. Within this framework, we compute the total variation distance between the distribution of the diffusion process and its invariant distribution for any time scale larger than $\epsilon^{-1}$. Finally, we derive precise asymptotics for the mixing time.</description>

      <title>A Kalman filter for linear systems driven by time-space Brownian sheet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a linear filtering problem where the signal and observation processes are described as solutions of linear stochastic differential equations driven by time-space Brownian sheets. We derive a stochastic integral equation for the conditional value of the signal given the observation, which can be considered a time-space analogue of the classical Kalman filter. The result is illustrated with examples of the filtering problem involving noisy observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown by constructing Rohlins canonical measures that for a strictly stationary, d-dimensional vector-valued process X there exists another strictly stationary d-dimensional process U with uniform one-dimensional marginals and with the same mixing properties as X, such that X is a finitary factor of U of coding length 1, and such that the projection map is order preserving in each coordinate. As an application this extends the a.s. approximation of the empirical distribution function of weakly dependent random vectors with continuous distribution function in [1] and [3] to the general case.</description>

      <title>Non co-adapted couplings of Brownian motions on free, step 2 Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the free, step $2$ Carnot groups of rank $n$ $\mathbb{G}_n$, the subRiemannian Brownian motion consists in a $\mathbb{R}^n$-Brownian motion together with its $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ L{\'e}vy areas. In this article we construct an explicit successful non co-adapted coupling of Brownian motions on $\mathbb{G}_n$. We use this construction to obtain gradient inequalities for the heat semi-group on all the homogeneous step $2$ Carnot groups. Comparing the first coupling time and the first exit time from a domain, we also obtain gradient inequalities for harmonic functions on $\mathbb{G}_n$. These results generalize the coupling strategy by Banerjee, Gordina and Mariano on the Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>A Fubini-type limit theorem for the integrated hyperuniform infinitely divisible moving averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note shows a limiting behavior of integrals of some centered antipersistent stationary infinitely divisible moving averages as the compact integration domain in $d\ge 1$ dimensions extends to the whole positive quadrant $\mathbb{R}^d_+$. Namely, the weak limit of their finite dimensional distributions is again a moving average with the same infinitely divisible purely jump integrator measure (i.e., possessing no Gaussian component), but with an integrated kernel function. The results apply equally to time series ($d=1$) as well as to random fields ($d&gt;1$). Apart from the existence of the expectation, no moment assumptions on the moving average are imposed allowing it to have an infinite variance as e.g. in the case of $\alpha$-stable moving averages with $\alpha\in(1,2)$ . If the field is additionally square integrable, its covariance integrates to zero (hyperuniformity).</description>

      <title>On the support of solutions to nonlinear stochastic heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the strict positivity and the compact support property of solutions to the one-dimensional nonlinear stochastic heat equation: $$\partial_t u(t,x) = \frac{1}{2}\partial^2_x u(t,x) + \sigma(u(t,x))\dot{W}(t,x), \quad (t,x)\in \mathbf{R}_+\times\mathbf{R},$$ with nonnegative and compactly supported initial data $u_0$, where $\dot{W}$ is the space-time white noise and $\sigma:\mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R} $ is a continuous function with $\sigma(0)=0$. We prove that (i) if $v/ \sigma(v)$ is sufficiently large near $v=0$, then the solution $u(t,\cdot)$ is strictly positive for all $t&gt;0$, and (ii) if $v/\sigma(v)$ is sufficiently small near $v= 0$, then the solution $u(t,\cdot)$ has compact support for all $t&gt;0$. These findings extend previous results concerning the strict positivity and the compact support property, which were analyzed only for the case $\sigma(u)\approx u^\gamma$ for $\gamma&gt;0$. Additionally, we establish the uniqueness of a solution and the weak comparison principle in case (i).</description>

      <title>Regularization by Nonlinear Noise for PDEs: Well-posedness and Finite Time Extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the global existence, uniqueness and the Feller property for a class of stochastic partial differential equations by adding a suitable nonlinear noise, while the corresponding deterministic equations may only have local solutions. In particular, we discover a new phenomenon that for a potentially explosive deterministic system, an appropriate intervention of nonlinear noise can not only prevent blow-up but also lead to the finite time extinction of the associated stochastic system.
  Furthermore, our main results have broad applications, including not only all locally monotone stochastic equations in the variational framework (cf. \cite{LR2,LR1,RSZ1}), but also several new models such as stochastic $p$-Laplace equations with heat sources, stochastic 3D Navier-Stokes equations, stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations and stochastic surface growth models, which provide positive answers to some longstanding open problems in this field.</description>

      <title>Persistence exponents via perturbation theory: MA(1)-processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the moving average process $X_n=\rho \xi_{n-1}+\xi_n$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, where $\rho\in\mathbb{R}$ and $(\xi_i)_{i\ge -1}$ is an i.i.d. sequence of normally distributed random variables, we study the persistence probabilities $\mathbb{P}(X_0\ge 0,\dots, X_N\ge 0)$, for $N\to\infty$. We exploit that the exponential decay rate $\lambda_\rho$ of that quantity, called the persistence exponent, is given by the leading eigenvalue of a concrete integral operator. This makes it possible to study the problem with purely functional analytic methods. In particular, using methods from perturbation theory, we show that the persistence exponent $\lambda_\rho$ can be expressed as a power series in $\rho$. Finally, we consider the persistence problem for the Slepian process, transform it into the moving average setup, and show that our perturbation results are applicable.</description>

      <title>Left-continuous random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ and the parity of its hitting times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When it comes to random walk on the integers $\mathbb{Z}$, the arguably first step of generalization beyond simple random walk is the class of one-sidedly continuous random walk, where the stepsize in only one direction is bounded by 1. Moreover, the time until state 0 is hit by left-continuous random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ has a direct connection to the total progeny in branching processes. In this article, the probability of left-continuous random walk to be negative at an even (resp.\ odd) time is derived and used to determine the probability of nearly left-continuous random walk to eventually become negative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the context of rough path analysis via fractional calculus, we show how the notion of variability can be used to prove the existence of integrals with respect to H\"older continuous multiplicative functionals in the case of Lipschitz coefficients with first order partial derivatives of bounded variation. We verify our condition for a class of Gaussian processes, including fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H\in (\frac13, \frac12]$ in one and two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Normality of Centroids of Random Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the asymptotic behavior of the centroids of random polygons constructed from regular polygons with vertices on the unit circle by extending the rays so that their lengths form a random permutation of the first \(n\) integers. Surprisingly, this question has connections to diverse mathematical contexts, including random matrix theory and discrete Fourier transforms. Through rigorous analysis, we establish that the sequence of the suitably rescaled centroids converges to a circularly-symmetric complex normal distribution with variance \(\frac{1}{12}\). This result is a manifestation of central limit behavior in a setting involving sums of heavily dependent random variables.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic classification of the cutoff phenomenon in Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cutoff phenomenon for Markov processes under information divergences such as $f$-divergences and R\'enyi divergences. We classify most common divergences into four types, namely $L^2$-type, $\mathrm{TV}$-type, separation-type and $\mathrm{KL}$ divergence, in which we prove that the cutoff phenomenon are equivalent and relate the cutoff time and window among members within each type. To justify that this classification is natural, we provide examples in which the family of Markov processes exhibit cutoff in one type but not in another. We also establish new product conditions in these settings for the processes to exhibit cutoff, along with new results in non-reversible or non-normal situations. The proofs rely on a functional analytic approach towards cutoff.</description>

      <title>Cumulants of threshold for Schensted row insertion into random tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schensted row insertion is a fundamental component of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) algorithm, a powerful tool in combinatorics and representation theory. This study examines the insertion of a deterministic number into a random tableau of a specified shape, focusing on the relationship between the value of the inserted number and the position of the new box created by the Schensted row insertion. Specifically, for a given tableau and a point on its boundary, we consider the threshold that separates values which, if inserted, would result in the new box being created above the point from those that would result in a new box below. We analyze a random tableau of fixed shape and study the corresponding random threshold value. Explicit combinatorial formulas for the cumulants of this random variable are provided, expressed in terms of Kerov's transition measure of the diagram. These combinatorial formulas involve summing over non-crossing alternating trees. As a first application of these results, we demonstrate that for random Young tableaux of prescribed large shape, the rightmost entry in the first row converges in distribution to an explicit Gaussian distribution.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a verification theorem, inspired by those existing in stochastic control, to demonstrate how a pair of progressively measurable controls can form a Nash equilibrium in a stochastic zero-sum differential game. Specifically, we suppose that a pathwise-type Isaacs condition is satisfied together with the existence of what is termed a quasi-strong solution to the Bellman-Isaacs (BI)equations. In that case we are able to show that the value of the game is achieved and corresponds exactly to the unique solution of the BI equations. Those have also been applied for improving a well-known verification theorem in stochastic control theory. In so doing, we have implemented new techniques of stochastic calculus via regularizations, developing specific chain rules.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Brownian motion with dependent components: turning angle analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion in one or more dimensions is extensively used as a stochastic process to model natural and engineering signals, as well as financial data. Most works dealing with multidimensional Brownian motion assume that each component is independent. In this article, we investigate a model of correlated Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the individual components are not necessarily independent. We explore various statistical properties of the process under consideration, going beyond the conventional analysis of the second moment. Our particular focus lies on investigating the distribution of turning angles. This distribution reveals particularly interesting characteristics for processes with dependent components that are relevant to applications in diverse physical systems. Theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets: the financial data of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor's 500, and trajectories of polystyrene beads in water. Finally, we show that the model can be readily extended to trajectories with correlations that change over time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a random probability measure on the profinite completion of the random tree of a branching process and introduce the canonical and grand canonical ensembles of random repelling particles on this random profinite completion at inverse temperature $\beta &gt; 0$. We think of this as a random spatial process of particles in a random tree, and we introduce the notion of the {\em mean} canonical and grand canonical partition functions where in this context `mean' means averaged over the random environment. We give a recursion for these mean partition functions and demonstrate that in certain instances, determined by the law for the branching process, these partition functions as a function of $\beta$ have algebraic properties which generalize those that appear in the non-random and $p$-adic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider solutions of the Cauchy problem for semilinear equations with (possibly) different L\'evy operators. We provide various results on their convergence under the assumption that symbols of the involved operators converge to the symbol of some L\'evy operator. Some results are proved for a more general class of pseudodifferential operators.</description>

      <title>Games played by Exponential Weights Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the last-iterate convergence properties of the exponential weights algorithm with constant learning rates.  We consider a repeated interaction in discrete time, where each player uses an exponential weights algorithm characterized by an initial mixed action and a fixed learning rate, so that the mixed action profile $p^t$ played at stage $t$ follows an homogeneous Markov chain. At first, we show that whenever a strict Nash equilibrium exists, the probability to play a strict Nash equilibrium at the next stage  converges almost surely to 0 or 1. Secondly, we show that the limit of $p^t$, whenever it exists, belongs to the set of ``Nash Equilibria with Equalizing Payoffs''. Thirdly, we show that in strong coordination games, where the payoff of a player is positive on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere, $p^t$ converges almost surely  to one of the strict Nash equilibria. We conclude with   open questions.</description>

      <title>Interior points and Lebesgue measure of overlapping Mandelbrot percolation sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a special one-parameter family of d-dimensional random, homogeneous self-similar iterated function systems (IFSs) satisfying the finite type condition. The object of our study is the positivity of Lebesgue measure and the existence of interior points in these random sets and in particular the existence of an interesting parameter interval where the attractor has positive Lebesgue measure, but empty interior almost surely conditioned on the attractor not being empty. We give a sharp bound on the critical probability for the case of positivity Lebesgue measure using the theory of multitype branching processes in random environments and in some special cases on the critical probability for the existence of interior points. Using a recent result of Tom Rush, we provide a family of such random sets where there exists a parameter interval for which the corresponding attractor has a positive Lebesgue measure, but empty interior almost surely conditioned on the attractor not being empty.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for Poisson learning to a Poisson equation with measure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove discrete to continuum convergence rates for Poisson Learning, a graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm that is based on solving the graph Poisson equation with a source term consisting of a linear combination of Dirac deltas located at labeled points and carrying label information. The corresponding continuum equation is a Poisson equation with measure data in a Euclidean domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. The singular nature of these equations is challenging and requires an approach with several distinct parts: (1) We prove quantitative error estimates when convolving the measure data of a Poisson equation with (approximately) radial function supported on balls. (2) We use quantitative variational techniques to prove discrete to continuum convergence rates on random geometric graphs with bandwidth $\varepsilon&gt;0$ for bounded source terms. (3) We show how to regularize the graph Poisson equation via mollification with the graph heat kernel, and we study fine asymptotics of the heat kernel on random geometric graphs. Combining these three pillars we obtain $L^1$ convergence rates that scale, up to logarithmic factors, like $O(\varepsilon^{\frac{1}{d+2}})$ for general data distributions, and $O(\varepsilon^{\frac{2-\sigma}{d+4}})$ for uniformly distributed data, where $\sigma&gt;0$. These rates are valid with high probability if $\varepsilon\gg\left({\log n}/{n}\right)^q$ where $n$ denotes the number of vertices of the graph and $q \approx \frac{1}{3d}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize several classes of continuous radial basis functions that can be employed to determine whether a interaction of a probability is zero or not. These functions encompass standard independence tests but also the Lancaster/Streitberg interactions, and are multivariate extensions of Bernstein functions. Addressing a gap in these two probability contexts of interactions, we introduce an indexed measure of independence that generalizes the Lancaster interaction. We present several examples of these functions derived from high-order completely monotone functions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stationary distributions in reducible state spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quasi-stationary distributions and quasi-limiting behavior of Markov chains in general reducible state spaces with absorption. We propose a set of assumptions dealing with particular situations where the state space can be decomposed into three subsets between which communication is only possible in a single direction. These assumptions allow us to characterize the exponential order of magnitude and the exact polynomial correction, called polynomial convergence parameter, for the leading order term of the semigroup for large time. They also provide explicit convergence speeds to this leading order term. We apply these results to general Markov chains with finitely or denumerably many communication classes using a specific induction over the communication classes of the chain. We are able to explicitely characterize the polynomial convergence parameter, to determine the complete set of quasistationary distributions and to provide explicit estimates for the speed of convergence to quasi-limiting distributions in the case of finitely many communication classes. We conclude with an application of these results to the case of denumerable state spaces, where we are able to prove that, in general, there is existence of a quasi-stationary distribution without assuming irreducibility before absorption. This actually holds true assuming only aperiodicity, the existence of a Lyapunov function and the existence of a point in the state space from which the return time is finite with positive probability.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics under demographic and environmental stochasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.08883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the study of the long term dynamics of diffusion processes modelling a single species that experiences both demographic and environmental stochasticity. In our setting, the long term dynamics of the diffusion process in the absence of demographic stochasticity is determined by the sign of $\Lambda_0$, the external Lyapunov exponent, as follows: $\Lambda_0&lt;0$ implies (asymptotic) extinction and $\Lambda_0&gt;0$ implies convergence to a unique positive stationary distribution $\mu_0$. If the system is of size $\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$ for small $\epsilon&gt;0$ (the intensity of demographic stochasticity), demographic effects will make the extinction time finite almost surely. This suggests that to understand the dynamics one should analyze the quasi-stationary distribution (QSD) $\mu_\epsilon$ of the system. The existence and uniqueness of the QSD is well-known under mild assumptions.
  We look at what happens when the population size is sent to infinity, i.e., when $\epsilon\to 0$. We show that the external Lyapunov exponent still plays a key role: 1) If $\Lambda_0&lt;0$, then $\mu_\epsilon\to \delta_0$, the mean extinction time is of order $|\ln \epsilon|$ and the extinction rate associated with the QSD $\mu_{\epsilon}$ has a lower bound of order $\frac{1}{|\ln\epsilon|}$; 2) If $\Lambda_0&gt;0$, then $\mu_\epsilon\to \mu_0$, the mean extinction time is polynomial in $\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}$ and the extinction rate is polynomial in $\epsilon^{2}$. Furthermore, when $\Lambda_0&gt;0$ we are able to show that the system exhibits multiscale dynamics: at first the process quickly approaches the QSD $\mu_\epsilon$ and then, after spending a polynomially long time there, it relaxes to the extinction state. We give sharp asymptotics in $\epsilon$ for the time spent close to $\mu_\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Metastability of Glauber dynamics with inhomogeneous coupling disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general class of mean-field-like spin systems with random couplings that comprises both the Ising model on inhomogeneous dense random graphs and the randomly diluted Hopfield model. We are interested in quantitative estimates of metastability in large volumes at fixed temperatures when these systems evolve according to a Glauber dynamics, i.e.\ where spins flip with Metropolis transition probabilities at inverse temperature $\beta$. We identify conditions ensuring that with high probability the system behaves like the corresponding system where the random couplings are replaced by their averages. More precisely, we prove that the metastability of the former system is implied with high probability by the metastability of the latter. Moreover, we consider relevant metastable hitting times of the two systems and find the asymptotic tail behaviour and the moments of their ratio. This work provides an extension of the results known for the Ising model on the Erd\H{o}s--R{\'e}nyi random graph. The proofs use the potential-theoretic approach to metastability in combination with concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>The central limit theorem on nilpotent Lie groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and establish the central limit theorem for products of i.i.d. random variables on arbitrary simply connected nilpotent Lie groups, allowing a possible bias. Two new phenomena arise in the presence of a bias: (a) the walk spreads out at a higher rate in the ambient group, (b) the limiting hypoelliptic diffusion process may not have full support. We study the limiting distribution, prove estimates on its density and describe its support. We also establish corresponding Berry-Esseen bounds under optimal moment assumptions, as well as an analogue of Donsker's invariance principle. Various examples of nilpotent Lie groups are treated in detail showing the variety of different behaviours. We also obtain a characterization of when the limiting distribution is an ordinary gaussian and answer a question of Tutubalin from the 1960s regarding asymptotically close distributions on nilpotent Lie groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03711v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, locally finite graph. We investigate the relation between supercritical, transient branching random walk and the Martin boundary of its underlying random walk. We show results regarding the typical asymptotic directions taken by the particles, and as a consequence we find a new connection between $t$-Martin boundaries and standard Martin boundaries. Moreover, given a subgraph $U$ we study two aspects of branching random walks on $U$: when the trajectories visit $U$ infinitely often (survival) and when they stay inside $U$ forever (persistence). We show that there are cases, when $U$ is not connected, where the branching random walk does not survive in $U$, but the random walk on $G$ converges to the boundary of $U$ with positive probability. In contrast, the branching random walk can survive in $U$ even though the random walk eventually exits $U$ almost surely. We provide several examples and counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Existence and asymptotic autonomous robustness of random attractors for three-dimensional stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations on unbounded domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss the existence and asymptotically autonomous robustness (AAR) (almost surely) of random attractors for 3D stochastic globally modified Navier-Stokes equations (SGMNSE) on Poincar\'e domains (which may be bounded or unbounded). Our aim is to investigate the existence and AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE when the time-dependent forcing converges to a time-independent function under the perturbation of linear multiplicative noise as well as additive noise. The main approach is to provide a way to justify that, on some uniformly tempered universe, the usual pullback asymptotic compactness of the solution operators is uniform across an infinite time-interval $(-\infty,\tau]$. The backward uniform ``tail-smallness'' and ``flattening-property'' of the solutions over $(-\infty,\tau]$ have been demonstrated to achieve this goal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish the existence as well as AAR of random attractors for 3D SGMNSE on unbounded domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a stochastic method for the simulation of Laplace's equation with a mixed boundary condition in planar domains that are polygonal or bounded by circular arcs. We call this method the Reflected Walk-on-Spheres algorithm. The method combines a traditional Walk-on-Spheres algorithm with use of reflections at the Neumann boundaries. We apply our algorithm to simulate numerical conformal mappings from certain quadrilaterals to the corresponding canonical domains, and to compute their conformal moduli. Finally, we give examples of the method on three dimensional polyhedral domains, and use it to simulate the heat flow on an L-shaped insulated polyhedron.</description>
