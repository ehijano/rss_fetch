      <title>Physical Modelling and Cancellation of External Passive Intermodulation in FDD MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the physical approach to model external (air-induced) passive intermodulation (PIM) is presented in a frequency-division duplexing (FDD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with an arbitrary number of transceiver chains. The external PIM is a special case of intermodulation distortion (IMD), mainly generated by metallic objects possessing nonlinear properties ("rusty bolt" effect). Typically, such sources are located in the near-field or transition region of the antenna array. PIM products may fall into the receiver band of the FDD system, negatively affecting the uplink signal. In contrast to other works, this one directly simulates the physical external PIM. The system includes models of a point-source external PIM, a finite-length dipole antenna, a MIMO antenna array, and a baseband multicarrier 5G NR OFDM signal. The Channel coefficients method for multi-PIM-source compensation is replicated to verify the proposed external PIM modelling approach. Simulation results of artificially generated PIM cancellation show similar performance as real-life experiments. Therefore, the proposed approach allows testing PIM compensation algorithms on large systems with many antennas and arbitrary array structures. This eliminates the need for experiments with real hardware at the development stage of the PIM cancellation algorithm.</description>

      <title>An additively optimal interpreter for approximating Kolmogorov prefix complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study practical approximations to Kolmogorov prefix complexity (K) using IMP2, a high-level programming language. Our focus is on investigating the interpreter optimality for this language as the reference machine for the Coding Theorem Method (CTM). A method advanced to deal with applications to algorithmic complexity different to the popular traditional lossless compression approach based on the principles of algorithmic probability. The chosen model of computation is proven to be suitable for this task and a comparison to other models and methods is performed. Our findings show that CTM approximations using our model do not always correlate with results from lower-level models of computation. This suggests some models may require a larger program space to converge to Levin's universal distribution. Furthermore, we compare CTM with an upper bound to Kolmogorov complexity and find a strong correlation, supporting CTM's validity as an approximation method with finer-grade resolution of K.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication in IRS-assisted High-Mobility Systems: Design, Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in high-mobility systems with the aid of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). To exploit the benefits of Delay-Doppler (DD) spread caused by high mobility, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)-based frame structure and transmission framework are proposed. {In such a framework,} we first design a low-complexity ratio-based sensing algorithm for estimating the velocity of mobile user. Then, we analyze the performance of sensing and communication in terms of achievable mean square error (MSE) and achievable rate, respectively, and reveal the impact of key parameters. Next, with the derived performance expressions, we jointly optimize the phase shift matrix of IRS and the receive combining vector at the base station (BS) to improve the overall performance of integrated sensing and communication. Finally, extensive simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in high-mobility systems.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Orbital Angular Momentum Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode multiplexing has the potential to achieve high spectrum-efficiency communications at the same time and frequency by using orthogonal mode resource. However, the vortex wave hollow divergence characteristic results in the requirement of the large-scale receive antenna, which makes users hardly receive the OAM signal by size-limited equipment. To promote the OAM application in the next 6G communications, this paper proposes the cooperative OAM wireless (COW) communication scheme, which can select the cooperative users (CUs) to form the aligned antennas by size-limited user equipment. First, we derive the feasible radial radius and selective waist radius to choose the CUs in the same circle with the origin at the base station. Then, based on the locations of CUs, the waist radius is adjusted to form the receive antennas and ensure the maximum intensity for the CUs. Finally, the cooperative formation probability is derived in the closed-form solution, which can depict the feasibility of the proposed COW communication scheme. Furthermore, OAM beam steering is used to expand the feasible CU region, thus achieving higher cooperative formation probability. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived cooperative formation probability in mathematical analysis is very close to the statistical probability of cooperative formation, and the proposed COW communication scheme can obtain higher spectrum efficiency than the traditional scheme due to the effective reception of the OAM signal.</description>

      <title>Joint Power Allocation and Placement Scheme for UAV-assisted IoT with QoS Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the disaster and remote regions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can assist the data acquisition for Internet of Things (IoT). How to cover massive IoT devices (IDs), which require diverse quality-of-service (QoS), is a crucial challenge. For UAV-assisted IoT, this paper studies the deployment scheme with QoS guarantee to place multiple UAVs for covering all ground IDs and maximizing the average data rate of UAVs. First, for the ground ID, we propose the QoS demand based power allocation (QDPA) algorithm to solve the diversity of QoS with respect to data rate demand. Then, the data rate maximization placement (DRMP) algorithm is proposed to optimize the placement of single UAV. Finally, based on QDPA and DRMP algorithms, we propose the joint power allocation and placement (JPAP) scheme with QoS guarantee, which can cover massive IDs, to deploy multiple UAVs for maximizing the average UAV data rate. Simulation experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of our proposed JPAP scheme, which can minimize the UAV number and maximize the average data rate of UAVs.</description>

      <title>Precoding Based Downlink OAM-MIMO Communications with Rate Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) and rate splitting (RS) are the potential key techniques for the future wireless communications. As a new orthogonal resource, OAM can achieve the multifold increase of spectrum efficiency to relieve the scarcity of the spectrum resource, but how to enhance the privacy performance imposes crucial challenge for OAM communications. RS technique divides the information into private and common parts, which can guarantee the privacies for all users. In this paper, we integrate the RS technique into downlink OAM-MIMO communications, and study the precoding optimization to maximize the sum capacity. First, the concentric uniform circular arrays (UCAs) are utilized to construct the downlink transmission framework of OAM-MIMO communications with RS. Particularly, users in the same user pair utilize RS technique to obtain the information and different user pairs use different OAM modes. Then, we derive the OAM-MIMO channel model, and formulate the sum capacity maximization problem. Finally, based on the fractional programming, the optimal precoding matrix is obtained to maximize the sum capacity by using quadratic transformation. Extensive simulation results show that by using the proposed precoding optimization algorithm, OAM-MIMO communications with RS can achieve higher sum capacity than the traditional communication schemes.</description>

      <title>Air-to-Ground Cooperative OAM Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For users in hotspot region, orbital angular momentum (OAM) can realize multifold increase of spectrum efficiency (SE), and the flying base station (FBS) can rapidly support the real-time communication demand. However, the hollow divergence and alignment requirement impose crucial challenges for users to achieve air-to-ground OAM communications, where there exists the line-of-sight path. Therefore, we propose the air-to-ground cooperative OAM communication (ACOC) scheme, which can realize OAM communications for users with size-limited devices. The waist radius is adjusted to guarantee the maximum intensity at the cooperative users (CUs). We derive the closed-form expression of the optimal FBS position, which satisfies the antenna alignment for two cooperative user groups (CUGs). Furthermore, the selection constraint is given to choose two CUGs composed of four CUs. Simulation results are provided to validate the optimal FBS position and the SE superiority of the proposed ACOC scheme.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the zero-error capacity of channels with memory. Motivated by the nuanced requirements of semantic communication that incorporate memory, we advance the classical enlightened dictator channel by introducing a new category known as the semantic channel. We analyze the zero-error capacity of the semantic channel using a comprehensive framework that accommodates multiple input and output memories. Our approach reveals a more sophisticated and detailed model compared to the classical memory channels, highlighting the impact of memory on achieving error-free communication.</description>

      <title>Private Collaborative Edge Inference via Over-the-Air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider collaborative inference at the wireless edge, where each client's model is trained independently on their local datasets. Clients are queried in parallel to make an accurate decision collaboratively. In addition to maximizing the inference accuracy, we also want to ensure the privacy of local models. To this end, we leverage the superposition property of the multiple access channel to implement bandwidth-efficient multi-user inference methods. Specifically, we propose different methods for ensemble and multi-view classification that exploit over-the-air computation. We show that these schemes perform better than their orthogonal counterparts with statistically significant differences while using fewer resources and providing privacy guarantees. We also provide experimental results verifying the benefits of the proposed over-the-air multi-user inference approach and perform an ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design choices. We share the source code of the framework publicly on Github to facilitate further research and reproducibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the third moment for functions on arbitrary compact Lie groups. We use techniques of representation theory to generalize the notion of band-limited functions in classical Fourier theory to functions on the compact groups $SU(n), SO(n), Sp(n)$. We then prove that for generic band-limited functions the third moment or, its Fourier equivalent, the bispectrum determines the function up to translation by a single unitary matrix. Moreover, if $G=SU(n)$ or $G=SO(2n+1)$ we prove that the third moment determines the $G$-orbit of a band-limited function. As a corollary we obtain a large class of finite-dimensional representations of these groups for which the third moment determines the orbit of a generic vector. When $G=SO(3)$ this gives a result relevant to cryo-EM which was our original motivation for studying this problem.</description>

      <title>Localization from structured distance matrices via low-rank matrix recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining the configuration of $n$ points by using their distances to $m$ nodes, referred to as anchor nodes. One sampling scheme is Nystrom sampling, which assumes known distances between the anchors and between the anchors and the $n$ points, while the distances among the $n$ points are unknown. For this scheme, a simple adaptation of the Nystrom method, which is often used for kernel approximation, is a viable technique to estimate the configuration of the anchors and the $n$ points. In this manuscript, we propose a modified version of Nystrom sampling, where the distances from every node to one central node are known, but all other distances are incomplete. In this setting, the standard Nystrom approach is not applicable, necessitating an alternative technique to estimate the configuration of the anchors and the $n$ points. We show that this problem can be framed as the recovery of a low-rank submatrix of a Gram matrix. Using synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can exactly recover configurations of points given sufficient distance samples. This underscores that, in contrast to methods that rely on global sampling of distance matrices, the task of estimating the configuration of points can be done efficiently via structured sampling with well-chosen reliable anchors. Finally, our main analysis is grounded in a specific centering of the points. With this in mind, we extend previous work in Euclidean distance geometry by providing a general dual basis approach for points centered anywhere.</description>

      <title>Error-Correction Performance of Regular Ring-Linear LDPC Codes over Lee Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most low-density parity-check (LDPC) code constructions are considered over finite fields. In this work, we focus on regular LDPC codes over integer residue rings and analyze their performance with respect to the Lee metric. Their error-correction performance is studied over two channel models, in the Lee metric. The first channel model is a discrete memoryless channel, whereas in the second channel model an error vector is drawn uniformly at random from all vectors of a fixed Lee weight. It is known that the two channel laws coincide in the asymptotic regime, meaning that their marginal distributions match. For both channel models, we derive upper bounds on the block error probability in terms of a random coding union bound as well as sphere packing bounds that make use of the marginal distribution of the considered channels. We estimate the decoding error probability of regular LDPC code ensembles over the channels using the marginal distribution and determining the expected Lee weight distribution of a random LDPC code over a finite integer ring. By means of density evolution and finite-length simulations, we estimate the error-correction performance of selected LDPC code ensembles under belief propagation decoding and a low-complexity symbol message passing decoding algorithm and compare the performances. The analysis developed in this paper may serve to design regular LDPC codes over integer residue rings for storage and cryptographic application.</description>

      <title>Non-Adaptive Multi-Stage Algorithm for Group Testing with Prior Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-stage algorithm for non-adaptive Group Testing (GT) with general correlated prior statistics. The proposed solution can be applied to any correlated statistical prior represented in trellis, e.g., finite state machines and Markov processes. We introduce a variation of List Viterbi Algorithm (LVA) to enable accurate recovery using much fewer tests than objectives, which efficiently gains from the correlated prior statistics structure. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed Multi-Stage GT (MSGT) algorithm can obtain the optimal Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) performance with feasible complexity in practical regimes, such as with COVID-19 and sparse signal recovery applications, and reduce in the scenarios tested the number of pooled tests by at least $25\%$ compared to existing classical low complexity GT algorithms. Moreover, we analytically characterize the complexity of the proposed MSGT algorithm that guarantees its efficiency.</description>

      <title>Sense-Then-Train: An Active-Sensing-Based Beam Training Design for Near-Field MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An active-sensing-based sense-then-train (STT) scheme is proposed for beam training in near-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Compared to conventional codebook-based schemes, the proposed STT scheme is capable of not only addressing the complex spherical-wave propagation but also effectively exploiting the additional degrees-of-freedoms (DoFs). The STT scheme is tailored for both single-beam and multi-beam cases. 1) For the single-beam case, the STT scheme first utilizes a sensing phase to estimate a low-dimensional representation of the near-field MIMO channel in the truncated wavenumber domain. Then, in the subsequent training phase, the neural network modules at transceivers are updated online to align beams, utilizing sequentially received ping-pong pilots. This approach can efficiently obtain the aligned beam pair without relying on predefined codebooks or training datasets. 2) For the multi-beam case, based on the single-beam STT, a Gram-Schmidt method is further utilized to guarantee the orthogonality between beams in the training phase. Numerical results unveil that 1) the proposed STT scheme can significantly enhance the beam training performance in the near field compared to the conventional far-field codebook-based schemes, and 2) the proposed STT scheme can perform fast and low-complexity beam training, while achieving a near-optimal performance without full channel state information in both cases.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Grouping Index Modulation Design for MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Index modulation (IM) significantly enhances the spectral efficiency of fluid antennas (FAs) enabled multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which is named FA-IM. However, due to the dense distribution of ports on the FA, the wireless channel exhibits a high spatial correlation, leading to severe performance degradation in the existing FA-IM-assisted MIMO systems. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel fluid antenna grouping index modulation (FA-GIM) scheme to mitigate the high correlation between the activated ports. Specifically, considering the characteristics of the FA two-dimensional (2D) surface structure and the spatially correlated channel model in FA-assisted MIMO systems, a block grouping method is adopted, where adjacent ports are assigned to the same group. Subsequently, different groups independently perform port index selection and constellation symbol mapping, with only one port being activated within each group during each transmission interval. Numerical results show that, compared to state-of-the-art schemes, the proposed FA-GIM scheme consistently achieves significant bit error rate (BER) performance gains under various conditions. It has also been confirmed that the proposed scheme is both efficient and robust, enhancing the performance of FA-assisted MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>K-Deep Simplex: Deep Manifold Learning via Local Dictionaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose K-Deep Simplex(KDS) which, given a set of data points, learns a dictionary comprising synthetic landmarks, along with representation coefficients supported on a simplex. KDS employs a local weighted $\ell_1$ penalty that encourages each data point to represent itself as a convex combination of nearby landmarks. We solve the proposed optimization program using alternating minimization and design an efficient, interpretable autoencoder using algorithm unrolling. We theoretically analyze the proposed program by relating the weighted $\ell_1$ penalty in KDS to a weighted $\ell_0$ program. Assuming that the data are generated from a Delaunay triangulation, we prove the equivalence of the weighted $\ell_1$ and weighted $\ell_0$ programs. We further show the stability of the representation coefficients under mild geometrical assumptions. If the representation coefficients are fixed, we prove that the sub-problem of minimizing over the dictionary yields a unique solution. Further, we show that low-dimensional representations can be efficiently obtained from the covariance of the coefficient matrix. Experiments show that the algorithm is highly efficient and performs competitively on synthetic and real data sets.</description>

      <title>A learning theory for quantum photonic processors and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03075v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the tasks of learning quantum states, measurements and channels generated by continuous-variable (CV) quantum circuits. This family of circuits is suited to describe optical quantum technologies and in particular it includes state-of-the-art photonic processors capable of showing quantum advantage. We define classes of functions that map classical variables, encoded into the CV circuit parameters, to outcome probabilities evaluated on those circuits. We then establish efficient learnability guarantees for such classes, by computing bounds on their pseudo-dimension or covering numbers, showing that CV quantum circuits can be learned with a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the circuit's size, i.e., the number of modes. Our results show that CV circuits can be trained efficiently using a number of training samples that, unlike their finite-dimensional counterpart, does not scale with the circuit depth.</description>

      <title>A dual basis approach to multidimensional scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical multidimensional scaling (CMDS) is a technique that embeds a set of objects in a Euclidean space given their pairwise Euclidean distances. The main part of CMDS involves double centering a squared distance matrix and using a truncated eigendecomposition to recover the point coordinates. In this paper, motivated by a study in Euclidean distance geometry, we explore a dual basis approach to CMDS. We give an explicit formula for the dual basis vectors and fully characterize the spectrum of an essential matrix in the dual basis framework. We make connections to a related problem in metric nearness.</description>

      <title>Green Edge AI: A Contemporary Survey</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have emerged as pivotal enablers across a multitude of industries largely due to their significant resurgence over the past decade. The transformative power of AI is primarily derived from the utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs), which require extensive data for training and substantial computational resources for processing. Consequently, DNN models are typically trained and deployed on resource-rich cloud servers. However, due to potential latency issues associated with cloud communications, deep learning (DL) workflows are increasingly being transitioned to wireless edge networks in proximity to end-user devices (EUDs). This shift is designed to support latency-sensitive applications and has given rise to a new paradigm of edge AI, which will play a critical role in upcoming sixth-generation (6G) networks to support ubiquitous AI applications. Despite its considerable potential, edge AI faces substantial challenges, mostly due to the dichotomy between the resource limitations of wireless edge networks and the resource-intensive nature of DL. Specifically, the acquisition of large-scale data, as well as the training and inference processes of DNNs, can rapidly deplete the battery energy of EUDs. This necessitates an energy-conscious approach to edge AI to ensure both optimal and sustainable performance. In this paper, we present a contemporary survey on green edge AI. We commence by analyzing the principal energy consumption components of edge AI systems to identify the fundamental design principles of green edge AI. Guided by these principles, we then explore energy-efficient design methodologies for the three critical tasks in edge AI systems, including training data acquisition, edge training, and edge inference. Finally, we underscore potential future research directions to further enhance the energy efficiency of edge AI.</description>

      <title>The syzygy distinguisher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new distinguisher for alternant and Goppa codes, whose complexity is subexponential in the error-correcting capability, hence better than that of generic decoding algorithms. Moreover it does not suffer from the strong regime limitations of the previous distinguishers or structure recovery algorithms: in particular, it applies to the codes used in the Classic McEliece candidate for postquantum cryptography standardization. The invariants that allow us to distinguish are graded Betti numbers of the homogeneous coordinate ring of a shortening of the dual code.
  Since its introduction in 1978, this is the first time an analysis of the McEliece cryptosystem breaks the exponential barrier.</description>

      <title>Application of the Lov\'asz-Schrijver Lift-and-Project Operator to Compact Stable Set Integer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lov\'asz theta function $\theta(G)$ provides a very good upper bound on the stability number of a graph $G$. It can be computed in polynomial time by solving a semidefinite program (SDP), which also turns out to be fairly tractable in practice. Consequently, $\theta(G)$ achieves a hard-to-beat trade-off between computational effort and strength of the bound. Indeed, several attempts to improve the theta bound are documented, mainly based on playing around the application of the $N_+(\cdot)$ lifting operator of Lov\'asz and Schrijver to the classical formulation of the maximum stable set problem. Experience shows that solving such SDP-s often struggles against practical intractability and requires highly specialized methods. We investigate the application of such an operator to two different linear formulations based on clique and nodal inequalities, respectively. Fewer inequalities describe these two and yet guarantee that the resulting SDP bound is at least as strong as $\theta(G)$. Our computational experience, including larger graphs than those previously documented, shows that upper bounds stronger than $\theta(G)$ can be accessed by a reasonable additional effort using the clique-based formulation on sparse graphs and the nodal-based one on dense graphs.</description>
