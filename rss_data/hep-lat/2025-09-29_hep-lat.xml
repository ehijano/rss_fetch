      <title>Quantum Simulation of Fermions in $AdS_2$ Black Hole: Chirality, Entanglement, and Spectral Crossovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider free Dirac fermions on a discretized $AdS_2$ black hole background, and analyze how curved space redshift, horizons, and the spin connection induced chiral gravitational effect shape spectral, transport, and scrambling phenomena. The system is discretized via staggered fermions followed by the Jordan-Wigner transform to encode the model in qubit degrees of freedom, whose Hamiltonian carries site dependent warp factors and bond chirality terms encoding the redshift and spin connection effects. We calculate the ground state and first excited states energies, their local charge profiles, and their half-chain entanglement entropies, showing how redshift and chirality affect the transition from criticality to a gapped regime. Probing operator growth via out-of-time-order correlators, we find that horizons and the chiral coupling accelerate scrambling, yet remain within a non-chaotic regime. Finally, we map out an integrable to ergodic crossover via level-spacing statistics and Brody fits, and introduce on-site disorder to drive a many body localization transition.</description>

      <title>The 2T-quoctit: a two-mode bosonic qudit for high energy physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a two-mode bosonic encoding of a quoctit inside a non-Abelian group-structured constellation of coherent states. This work is motivated by the importance of nonabelian symmetry in particle physics and the desire to have transversal nonabelian logical gates. We use the previously developed $2T$-constellation of states used to encode a so-called $2T$-qutrit. The fidelity of the $2T$-quoctit is benchmarked against other bosonic qudits for different noise models and find it compare favorably when power constraints are considered. This paves the way for the construction of higher-dimensional qudits (e.g. a quicosotetrit with $2T$ group structure) in bosonic systems with practical applications in quantum simulations of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Committing to Bubbles: Finding the Critical Configuration on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleation of bubbles in first-order phase transitions is traditionally characterised by the critical bubble: defined as the saddle-point solution of the Euclidean action that separates collapsing from expanding field configurations. While this picture is exact in the noiseless, zero-temperature limit, thermal fluctuations introduces stochasticity which can influence the behaviour of the field configuration. In this work, we develop a purely statistical criterion for identifying the critical bubble by leveraging the concept of the ``committor'' probability: the likelihood that a given local field configuration evolves to the true vacuum before returning to the false vacuum. Using ensembles of lattice simulations with controlled thermal noise, we extract the committor probability during the evolution of a bubble from sub- to super-criticality. We find this approach to be robust, accounts for finite-temperature effects, and allows independent verification of bounce-based predictions. To demonstrate this, we compare the average profile obtained via the committor probability method to standard theory for a given model and find strong agreement, particularly at the core of the bubble. Importantly, we also observe that the behaviour of the committor probability with time is smooth and well defined. This method establishes a robust, simulation-driven framework for studying nucleation dynamics in thermal field theories and may be especially applicable in cases where analytical control might be limited.</description>

      <title>Kinematically-enhanced interpolating operators for boosted hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to use interpolating operators for lattice quantum chromodyanmics (QCD) calculations of highly-boosted pions and nucleons with kinematically-enhanced ground-state overlap factors at large momentum. Because this kinematic enhancement applies to the signal but not the variance of the correlation function, these interpolating operators can achieve better signal-to-noise ratios at large momentum. We perform proof-of-principle calculations with boosted pions and nucleons using close-to-physical and larger quark masses to explore the utility of our proposal. Results for effective energies and matrix elements, as well as Lanczos ground-state energy estimators, are consistent with theoretical expectations for signal-to-noise improvement at large momenta.</description>

      <title>The nature of $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two decades ago the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ was discovered in the hadron spectrum with two heavy quarks. The discovery fueled a surge in experimental research, uncovering dozens of so called XYZ exotics states lying outside the conventional quark model, as well as theoretical investigations into new forms of matter, such as quark-gluon hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, with the potential of disclosing new information about the fundamental strong force. Among the XYZs, the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$ stand out for their striking characteristics and unlashed many discussions about their nature. Here, we address this question using the Born--Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory (BOEFT) and show how QCD settles the issue of their composition. Not only we describe well the main features of the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$ but obtain also predictions in the bottomonium sector. This opens the way to systematic applications of BOEFT to all XYZs.</description>

      <title>$\pi^0\rightarrow 2\gamma$ decay under strong magnetic fields in the NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the anomalous $\pi^0 \to \gamma\gamma$ decay under an external uniform magnetic field in the framework of a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. It is seen that the full decay width gets strongly reduced with the external field, and that the differential width is almost independent of the direction of the outgoing photons. We also find that the result for the total width can be very well approximated by a simple expression obtained at the lowest order in the chiral expansion, which is just a direct extension to finite magnetic fields of the well-known $B=0$ result that follows from the anomalous Wess-Zumino-Witten action. As a result, the magnetic suppression of the width can be understood in terms of the evolution of both the neutral pion mass and decay constant with the magnetic field.</description>
