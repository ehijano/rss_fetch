      <title>Functional limit theorems for Gaussian-fed queueing network in light and heavy traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a queueing network operating under a strictly upper-triangular routing matrix with per column at most one non-negative entry. The root node is fed by a Gaussian process with stationary increments. Our aim is to characterize the distribution of the multivariate stationary workload process under a specific scaling of the queue's service rates. In the main results of this paper we identify, under mild conditions on the standard deviation function of the driving Gaussian process, in both light and heavy traffic parameterization, the limiting law of an appropriately scaled version (in both time and space) of the joint stationary workload process. In particular, we develop conditions under which specific queueing processes of the network effectively decouple, i.e., become independent in the limiting regime.</description>

      <title>Random bipartite graphs with i.i.d. weights and applications to inhomogeneous random intersection graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a random bipartite graph with weights assigned to both parts of the vertex sets. Edges are formed independently with probabilities that depend on these weights. This bipartite graph naturally gives rise to a random intersection graph which has nontrivial clustering properties and inhomogeneous vertex degrees. We focus on the situation where the weights are themselves i.i.d. random variables. In the so-called moderate clustering regime, we identify three types of scaling limit for the large connected components in the graphs at criticality, depending on the tail behaviours of the weight distributions of both parts.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation property of neural stochastic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify various classes of neural networks that are able to approximate continuous functions locally uniformly subject to fixed global linear growth constraints. For such neural networks the associated neural stochastic differential equations can approximate general stochastic differential equations, both of It\^o diffusion type, arbitrarily well. Moreover, quantitative error estimates are derived for stochastic differential equations with sufficiently regular coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We establish upper and lower bounds for the expected Wasserstein distance between the random empirical measure and the uniform measure on the Boolean cube. Our analysis leverages techniques from Fourier analysis, following the framework introduced in \cite{bobkov2021simple}, as well as methods from large deviations theory.</description>

      <title>A variational problem to calculate probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the conditional expectation of an event $A$ given a $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{G}$ as a linear problem in the Lebesgue spaces $L^{p}$ associated with a probability space through the Riesz Representation Theorems. For the $L^{2}$ case, we state the Dirichlet's principle. Then, we extend this principle for specific values of $p$, framing the existence of the conditional expectation as a variational problem. We conclude with a proof of the law of total probability using these tools.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem and its application to the limiting distribution of volatility target index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limiting distribution of a volatility target index as the discretisation time step converges to zero. Two limit theorems (a strong law of large numbers and a central limit theorem) are established, and as an application, the exact limiting distribution is derived. We demonstrate that the volatility of the limiting distribution is consistently larger than the target volatility, and converges to the target volatility as the observation-window parameter $\lambda$ in the definition of the realised variance converges to $1$. Besides the exact formula for the drift and the volatility of the limiting distribution, their upper and lower bounds are derived. As a corollary of the exact limiting distribution, we obtain a vega conversion formula which converts the rho sensitivity of a financial derivative on the limiting diffusion to the vega sensitivity of the same financial derivative on the underlying of the volatility target index.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the construction of a stochastic process called ``diffusion house-moving'' and to explore its properties. We study the weak convergence of diffusion bridges conditioned to stay between two curves, and we refer to this limit as diffusion house-moving. Applying this weak convergence result, we give the sample path properties of diffusion house-moving.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G_1,\dots, G_m$ be independent identically distributed Bernoulli random subgraphs of the complete graph ${\cal K}_n$ having vertex sets of random sizes $X_1,\dots, X_m\in \{0,1,2,\dots\}$ and random edge densities $Q_1,\dots, Q_m\in [0,1]$. Assuming that each $G_i$ has a vertex of degree $1$ with positive probability, we establish the $k$-connectivity threshold as $n,m\to+\infty$ for the union $\cup_{i=1}^mG_i$ defined on the vertex set of ${\cal K}_n$.</description>

      <title>From Hyper Roughness to Jumps as $H \to -1/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the weak limit of the hyper-rough square-root process as the Hurst index $H$ goes to $-1/2\,$. This limit corresponds to the fractional kernel $t^{H - 1 / 2}$ losing integrability. We establish the joint convergence of the couple $(X, M)\,$, where $X$ is the hyper-rough process and $M$ the associated martingale, to a fully correlated Inverse Gaussian L\'evy jump process. This unveils the existence of a continuum between hyper-rough continuous models and jump processes, as a function of the Hurst index. Since we prove a convergence of continuous to discontinuous processes, the usual Skorokhod $J_1$ topology is not suitable for our problem. Instead, we obtain the weak convergence in the Skorokhod $M_1$ topology for $X$ and in the non-Skorokhod $S$ topology for $M$.</description>

      <title>High moments of 2d directed polymers up to quasi-criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional directed polymers in random environment in the sub-critical regime and in the quasi-critical regime introduced recently by Caravenna, Cottini and Rossi, arXiv:2307.02453v1. For $q\leq q_N$ with $q_N\to\infty$ diverging at a suitable rate with the size of the system, we obtain upper bound estimates on the $q$-moment of the partition function for general environments. In the sub-critical regime, our results improve the $q_N$-threshold obtained for Gaussian environment in Cosco, Zeitouni, Comm. Math. Phys (2023). As a corollary, we derive large deviation estimates with a Gaussian rate function.</description>

Abstract: We study the maximum $\phi_N^*$ of the partition function of the two dimensional (subcritical) Gaussian directed polymer over an $\sqrt N \times \sqrt N$ box. We show that $\phi_N^*/\log N$ converges towards a constant $\sigma^*$, which we identify to be the same as for the maximum of a branching random walk with a slowly varying variance profile as studied in Fang-Zeitouni, J. Stat. Phys. 2012 and (in the context of the generalized random energy model) in Bovier-Kurkova, Ann. Inst. H. Poincare 2004.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Kullback-Leibler Deviation Bounds for Dirichlet Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new and improved non-asymptotic deviation bounds for Dirichlet processes (DPs), formulated using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which is known for its optimal characterization of the asymptotic behavior of DPs. Our method involves incorporating a controlled perturbation within the KL bound, effectively shifting the base distribution of the DP in the upper bound. Our proofs rely on two independent approaches. In the first, we use superadditivity techniques to convert asymptotic bounds into non-asymptotic ones via Fekete's lemma. In the second, we carefully reduce the problem to the Beta distribution case. Some of our results extend similar inequalities derived for the Beta distribution, as presented in [27].</description>

      <title>Contact process for the spread of knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a natural variant of the contact process modeling the spread of knowledge on the integer lattice. Each site is characterized by its knowledge, measured by a real number ranging from 0 = ignorant to 1 = omniscient. Neighbors interact at rate $\lambda$, which results in both neighbors attempting to teach each other a fraction $\mu$ of their knowledge, and individuals die at rate one, which results in a new individual with no knowledge. Starting with a single omniscient site, our objective is to study whether the total amount of knowledge on the lattice converges to zero (extinction) or remains bounded away from zero (survival). The process dies out when $\lambda \leq \lambda_c$ and/or $\mu = 0$, where $\lambda_c$ denotes the critical value of the contact process. In contrast, we prove that, for all $\lambda &gt; \lambda_c$, there is a unique phase transition in the direction of $\mu$, and for all $\mu &gt; 0$, there is a unique phase transition in the direction of $\lambda$. Our proof of survival relies on block constructions showing more generally convergence of the knowledge to infinity, while our proof of extinction relies on martingale techniques showing more generally an exponential decay of the knowledge.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variational tail bound for norms of random vectors under moment assumptions on their one-dimensional marginals. We also propose a simplified version of the bound that parametrizes the ``aggregating'' distribution in the proposed variational bound by considering a certain pushforward of the Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method recovers some of the well-known bounds on norms of Gaussian random vectors, as well as a recent concentration inequality for the spectral norm of sum of independent and identically distributed positive semidefinite matrices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that critical parking trees conditioned to be fully parked converge in the scaling limits towards the Brownian growth-fragmentation tree, a self-similar Markov tree different from Aldous' Brownian tree recently introduced and studied by Bertoin, Curien and Riera. As a by-product of our study, we prove that positive non-linear polynomial equations involving a catalytic variable display a universal polynomial exponent $5/2$ at their singularity, confirming a conjecture by Chapuy, Schaeffer and Drmota &amp; Hainzl. Compared to previous analytical works on the subject, our approach is probabilistic and exploits an underlying random walk hidden in the random tree model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a modified Benamou-Brenier type approach leading to a Wasserstein type distance that allows global invariance, specifically, isometries, and we show that the problem can be summarized to orthogonal transformations. This distance is defined by penalizing the action with a costless movement of the particle that does not change the direction and speed of its trajectory. We show that for Gaussian distribution resume to measuring the Euclidean distance between their ordered vector of eigenvalues and we show a direct application in recovering Latent Gaussian distributions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Nonlinear Online Learning under Sequential Price Competition via s-Concavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon of $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices and subsequently observe their respective demand that is unobservable to competitors. The demand function for each seller depends on all sellers' prices through a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. To address this challenge, we propose a semi-parametric least-squares estimation of the nonlinear mean function, which does not require sellers to communicate demand information. We show that when all sellers employ our policy, their prices converge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers would reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of $O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution of our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained demand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret bounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration results for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings offer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and contribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Second Order Fully Nonlinear Mean Field Games with Degenerate Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the global-in-time well-posedness of second order mean field games (MFGs) with both nonlinear drift functions simultaneously depending on the state, distribution and control variables, and the diffusion term depending on both state and distribution. Besides, the diffusion term is allowed to be degenerate, unbounded and even nonlinear in the distribution, but it does not depend on the control. First, we establish the global well-posedness of the corresponding forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs), which arise from the maximum principle under a so-called $\beta$-monotonicity commonly used in the optimal control theory. The $\beta$-monotonicity admits more interesting cases, as representative examples including but not limited to the displacement monotonicity, the small mean field effect condition or the Lasry-Lions monotonicity; and ensures the well-posedness result in diverse non-convex examples. In our settings, we pose assumptions directly on the drift and diffusion coefficients and the cost functionals, rather than indirectly on the Hamiltonian, to make the conditions more visible. Our probabilistic method tackles the nonlinear dynamics with a linear but infinite dimensional version, and together with our recently proposed cone property for the adjoint processes, following in an almost straightforward way the conventional approach to the classical stochastic control problem, we derive a sufficiently good regularity of the value functional, and finally show that it is the unique classical solution to the MFG master equation. Our results require fairly few conditions on the functional coefficients for solution of the MFG, and a bit more conditions -- which are least stringent in the contemporary literature -- for classical solution of the MFG master equation.</description>

      <title>Malliavin-Bismut Score-based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework that employs Malliavin calculus to derive explicit expressions for the score function -- i.e., the gradient of the log-density -- associated with solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Our approach integrates classical integration-by-parts techniques with modern tools, such as Bismut's formula and Malliavin calculus, to address linear and nonlinear SDEs. In doing so, we establish a rigorous connection between the Malliavin derivative, its adjoint (the Malliavin divergence or the Skorokhod integral), Bismut's formula, and diffusion generative models, thus providing a systematic method for computing $\nabla \log p_t(x)$. For the linear case, we present a detailed study proving that our formula is equivalent to the actual score function derived from the solution of the Fokker--Planck equation for linear SDEs. Additionally, we derive a closed-form expression for $\nabla \log p_t(x)$ for nonlinear SDEs with state-independent diffusion coefficients. These advancements provide fresh theoretical insights into the smoothness and structure of probability densities and practical implications for score-based generative modelling, including the design and analysis of new diffusion models. Moreover, our findings promote the adoption of the robust Malliavin calculus framework in machine learning research. These results directly apply to various pure and applied mathematics fields, such as generative modelling, the study of SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion, and the Fokker--Planck equations associated with nonlinear SDEs.</description>

      <title>Martingale property and moment explosions in signature volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the martingale property and moment explosions of a signature volatility model, where the volatility process of the log-price is given by a linear form of the signature of a time-extended Brownian motion. Excluding trivial cases, we demonstrate that the price process is a true martingale if and only if the order of the linear form is odd and a correlation parameter is negative. The proof involves a fine analysis of the explosion time of a signature stochastic differential equation. This result is of key practical relevance, as it highlights that, when used for approximation purposes, the linear combination of signature elements must be taken of odd order to preserve the martingale property. Once martingality is established, we also characterize the existence of higher moments of the price process in terms of a condition on a correlation parameter.</description>

      <title>Throughput Maximizing Takeoff Scheduling for eVTOL Vehicles in On-Demand Urban Air Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) offers a solution to current traffic congestion by using electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles to provide on-demand air mobility in urban areas. Effective traffic management is crucial for efficient operation of UAM systems, especially for high-demand scenarios. In this paper, we present a centralized framework for conflict-free takeoff scheduling of eVTOLs in on-demand UAM systems. Specifically, we provide a scheduling policy, called VertiSync, which jointly schedules UAM vehicles for servicing trip requests and rebalancing, subject to safety margins and energy requirements. We characterize the system-level throughput of VertiSync, which determines the demand threshold at which the average waiting time transitions from being stable to being increasing over time. We show that the proposed policy maximizes throughput for sufficiently large fleet size and if the UAM network has a certain symmetry property. We demonstrate the performance of VertiSync through a case study for the city of Los Angeles, and show that it significantly reduces average passenger waiting time compared to a first-come first-serve scheduling policy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify the scaling limit of random intersection graphs inside their critical windows. The limit graphs vary according to the clustering regimes, and coincide with the continuum Erdos--Renyi graph in two out of the three regimes. Our approach to the scaling limit relies upon the close connection of random intersection graphs with binomial bipartite graphs, as well as a graph exploration algorithm on the latter. This further allows us to prove limit theorems for the number of triangles in the large connected components of the graphs.</description>

Abstract: Quantization for a Borel probability measure refers to the idea of estimating a given probability by a discrete probability with support containing a finite number of elements. If in the quantization some of the elements in the support are preselected, then the quantization is called a conditional quantization. In this paper, we investigate the conditional quantization for the uniform distributions defined on the unit line segments and $m$-sided regular polygons, where $m\geq 3$, inscribed in a unit circle.</description>

      <title>The Lamperti transformation in the infinite-dimensional setting and the genealogies of self-similar Markov processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a change in focus from the prevalent paradigm based on the branching property as a tool to analyze the structure of population models, to one based on the self-similarity property, which we also introduce for the first time in the setting of measure-valued processes. By extending the well-known Lamperti transformation for self-similar Markov processes to the Banach-valued case we are able to generalize celebrated results in population genetics that describe the frequency-process of measure-valued stable branching processes in terms of the subfamily of Beta-Fleming-Viot processes. In our work we describe the frequency process of populations whose total size evolves as any positive self-similar Markov process in terms of general $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot processes. Our results demonstrate the potential power of the self-similar perspective for the study of population models in which the reproduction dynamics of the individuals depend on the total population size, allowing for more complex and realistic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate for which Gaussian processes there do or do not exist reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) that contain almost all of their paths. In particular, we establish a new result that makes it possible to exclude the existence of such RKHSs in many cases. Moreover, we combine this negative result with some known techniques to establish positive results. Here it turns out that for many classical families of Gaussian processes we can fully characterize for which members of these families there exist RKHSs containing the paths. Similar characterizations are obtained for Gaussian processes, for which the RKHSs of their covariance functions are Sobolev spaces or Sobolev spaces of mixed smoothness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose an urn contains initially any number of balls of two colours. One ball is drawn randomly and then put back with $\alpha$ balls of the same colour and $\beta$ balls of the opposite colour. Both cases, $\beta=0$ and $\beta&gt;0$ are well known and correspond respectively to P\'olya's and Friedman's replacement schemes. We consider a mixture of both of these: with probability $p\in(0,1]$ balls are replaced according to Friedman's recipe and with probability $1-p$ according to the one by P\'olya. Independently of the initial urn composition and independently of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and the value of $p&gt;0$, we show that the proportion of balls of one colour converges almost surely to $\frac12$. The latter is the limit behaviour obtained by using Friedman's scheme alone, i.e. when $p=1$. Our result follows by adapting an argument due to D. S. Ornstein.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate Analysis of the Join-the-Shortest-Queue System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) policy is among the most widely used routing algorithms for load balancing systems and has been extensively studied. Despite its simplicity and optimality, exact characterization of the system remains challenging. Most prior research has focused on analyzing its performance in steady-state in certain asymptotic regimes such as the heavy-traffic regime. However, the convergence rate to the steady-state in these regimes is often slow, calling into question the reliability of analyses based solely on the steady-state and heavy-traffic approximations. To address this limitation, we provide a finite-time convergence rate analysis of a JSQ system with two symmetric servers. In sharp contrast to the existing literature, we directly study the original system as opposed to an approximate limiting system such as a diffusion approximation. Our results demonstrate that for such a system, the convergence rate to its steady-state, measured in the total variation distance, is $O \left(\frac{1}{(1-\rho)^3} \frac{1}{t} \right)$, where $\rho \in (0,1)$ is the traffic intensity.</description>

      <title>The Gaussian central limit theorem for a stationary time series with infinite variance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a borderline case: the central limit theorem for a strictly stationary time series with infinite variance but a Gaussian limit. In the iid case a well-known sufficient condition for this central limit theorem is regular variation of the marginal distribution with tail index $\alpha=2$. In the dependent case we assume the stronger condition of sequential regular variation of the time series with tail index $\alpha=2$. We assume that a sample of size $n$ from this time series can be split into $k_n$ blocks of size $r_n\to\infty$ such that $r_n/n\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$ and that the block sums are asymptotically independent. Then we apply classical central limit theory for row-wise iid triangular arrays. The necessary and sufficient conditions for such independent block sums will be verified by using large deviation results for the time series. We derive the central limit theorem for $m$-dependent sequences, linear processes, stochastic volatility processes and solutions to affine stochastic recurrence equations whose marginal distributions have infinite variance and are regularly varying with tail index $\alpha=2$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a stochastic control problem with the assumption that the system is controlled until the state process breaks the fixed barrier. Assuming some general conditions, it is proved that the resulting Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equations has smooth solution. The aforementioned result is used to solve the optimal dividend and consumption problem. In the proof we use a fixed point type argument, with an operator which is based on the stochastic representation for a linear equation.</description>

      <title>A new notion of commutativity for the algorithmic Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.05569v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma (LLL) is a powerful tool in probabilistic combinatorics which can be used to establish the existence of objects that satisfy certain properties. The breakthrough paper of Moser and Tardos and follow-up works revealed that the LLL has intimate connections with a class of stochastic local search algorithms for finding such desirable objects. In particular, it can be seen as a sufficient condition for this type of algorithms to converge fast.
  Besides conditions for existence of and fast convergence to desirable objects, one may naturally ask further questions regarding properties of these algorithms. For instance, "are they parallelizable?", "how many solutions can they output?", "what is the expected "weight" of a solution?", etc. These questions and more have been answered for a class of LLL-inspired algorithms called commutative. In this paper we introduce a new, very natural and more general notion of commutativity (essentially matrix commutativity) which allows us to show a number of new refined properties of LLL-inspired local search algorithms with significantly simpler proofs.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional genetic and evolution algebras generated by Gibbs measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genetic and evolution algebras arise naturally from applied probability and stochastic processes. Gibbs measures describe interacting systems commonly studied in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics with applications in several fields. Here, we consider that the algebras are determined by configurations of finite spins on a countable set with their associated Gibbs distributions. The model preserves properties of the finite-dimensional Gibbs algebras found in the literature and extend their results. We introduce infertility in the genetic dynamics when the configurations differ macroscopically. It induces a decomposition of the algebra into a direct sum of fertile ideals with genetic realization.
  The proposed infinite-dimensional algebras are commutative, non-associative, with uncountable basis and zero divisors. The properties of Gibbs measures allow us to deal with the difficulties arising from the algebraic structure and obtain the results presented in this article.</description>

      <title>An algebraic correspondence between stochastic differential equations and the Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of complex systems, dynamics is often modeled in terms of a non-linear, stochastic, ordinary differential equation (SDE) with either an additive or a multiplicative Gaussian white noise. In addition to a well-established collection of results proving existence and uniqueness of the solutions, it is of particular relevance the explicit computation of expectation values and correlation functions, since they encode the key physical information of the system under investigation. A pragmatically efficient way to dig out these quantities consists of the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) formalism which establishes a correspondence between a large class of SDEs and suitably constructed field theories formulated by means of a path integral approach. Despite the effectiveness of this duality, there is no corresponding, mathematically rigorous proof of such correspondence. We address this issue using techniques proper of the algebraic approach to quantum field theories which is known to provide a valuable framework to discuss rigorously the path integral formulation of field theories as well as the solution theory both of ordinary and of partial, stochastic differential equations. In particular, working in this framework, we establish rigorously, albeit at the level of perturbation theory, a correspondence between correlation functions and expectation values computed either in the SDE or in the MSR formalism.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel pricing methodology in general, possibly non-Markovian local stochastic volatility (LSV) models. We observe that by conditioning the LSV dynamics on the Brownian motion that drives the volatility, one obtains a time-inhomogeneous Markov process. Using tools from rough path theory, we describe how to precisely understand the conditional LSV dynamics and reveal their Markovian nature. The latter allows us to connect the conditional dynamics to so-called rough partial differential equations (RPDEs), through a Feynman-Kac type of formula. In terms of European pricing, conditional on realizations of one Brownian motion, we can compute conditional option prices by solving the corresponding linear RPDEs, and then average over all samples to find unconditional prices. Our approach depends only minimally on the specification of the volatility, making it applicable for a wide range of classical and rough LSV models, and it establishes a PDE pricing method for non-Markovian models. Finally, we present a first glimpse at numerical methods for RPDEs and apply them to price European options in several rough LSV models.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap bounds for reversible hybrid Gibbs chains</title>

Abstract: Hybrid Gibbs samplers represent a prominent class of approximated Gibbs algorithms that utilize Markov chains to approximate conditional distributions, with the Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm standing out as a well-known example. Despite their widespread use in both statistical and non-statistical applications, little is known about their convergence properties. This article introduces novel methods for establishing bounds on the convergence rates of certain reversible hybrid Gibbs samplers. In particular, we examine the convergence characteristics of hybrid random-scan Gibbs algorithms. Our analysis reveals that the absolute spectral gap of a hybrid Gibbs chain can be bounded based on the absolute spectral gap of the exact Gibbs chain and the absolute spectral gaps of the Markov chains employed for conditional distribution approximations. We also provide a convergence bound of similar flavors for hybrid data augmentation algorithms, extending existing works on the topic. The general bounds are applied to three examples: a random-scan Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler, random-scan Gibbs samplers with block updates, and a hybrid slice sampler.</description>

      <title>Separation capacity of linear reservoirs with random connectivity matrix</title>

Abstract: A natural hypothesis for the success of reservoir computing in generic tasks is the ability of the untrained reservoir to map different input time series to separable reservoir states - a property we term separation capacity. We provide a rigorous mathematical framework to quantify this capacity for random linear reservoirs, showing that it is fully characterised by the spectral properties of the generalised matrix of moments of the random reservoir connectivity matrix. Our analysis focuses on reservoirs with Gaussian connectivity matrices, both symmetric and i.i.d., although the techniques extend naturally to broader classes of random matrices. In the symmetric case, the generalised matrix of moments is a Hankel matrix. Using classical estimates from random matrix theory, we establish that separation capacity deteriorates over time and that, for short inputs, optimal separation in large reservoirs is achieved when the matrix entries are scaled with a factor $\rho_T/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the reservoir dimension and $\rho_T$ depends on the maximum input length. In the i.i.d.\ case, we establish that optimal separation with large reservoirs is consistently achieved when the entries of the reservoir matrix are scaled with the exact factor $1/\sqrt{N}$, which aligns with common implementations of reservoir computing. We further give upper bounds on the quality of separation as a function of the length of the time series. We complement this analysis with an investigation of the likelihood of this separation and its consistency under different architectural choices.</description>

      <title>Star decompositions and independent sets in random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $k$-star decomposition of a graph is a partition of its edges into $k$-stars (i.e., $k$ edges with a common vertex). The paper studies the following problem: for what values of $k&gt;d/2$ does the random $d$-regular graph have a $k$-star decomposition (asymptotically almost surely, provided that the number of edges is divisible by $k$)?
  Delcourt, Greenhill, Isaev, Lidick\'y, and Postle proposed the following conjecture. It is easy to see that a $k$-star decomposition necessitates the existence of an independent set of density $1-d/(2k)$. So let $k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$ be the largest $k$ for which the random $d$-regular graph a.a.s. contains an independent set of this density. Clearly, $k$-star decompositions cannot exist for $k&gt;k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$. The conjecture suggests that this is essentially the only restriction: there is a threshold $k^\star_d$ such that $k$-star decompositions exist if and only if $k \leq k^\star_d$, and it (basically) coincides with the other threshold, i.e., $k^\star_d \approx k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$.
  We confirm this conjecture for sufficiently large $d$ by showing that a $k$-star decomposition exists if $d/2&lt; k &lt; k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$. In fact, we prove the existence even if $k=k^{\mathrm{ind}}_d$ for degrees $d$ with asymptotic density $1$.</description>
