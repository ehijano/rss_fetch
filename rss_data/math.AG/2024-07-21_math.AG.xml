      <title>Thom polynomials. A primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Thom polynomial of a singularity $\eta$ expresses the cohomology class of the $\eta$-singularity locus of a map in terms of the map's simple invariants. In this informal survey -- based on two lectures given at the Isaac Newton Institute in 2024 -- we explore various Thom polynomial concepts with examples.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz geometry of complex surface germs via inner rates of primary ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X, 0)$ be a normal complex surface germ embedded in $(\mathbb{C}^n, 0)$, and denote by $\mathfrak{m}$ the maximal ideal of the local ring $\mathcal{O}_{X,0}$. In this paper, we associate to each $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal $I$ of $\mathcal{O}_{X,0}$ a continuous function $\mathcal{I}_I$ defined on the set of positive (suitably normalized) semivaluations of $\mathcal{O}_{X,0}$. We prove that the function $\mathcal{I}_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is determined by the outer Lipschitz geometry of the surface $(X, 0)$. We further demonstrate that for each $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal $I$, there exists a complex surface germ $(X_I, 0)$ with an isolated singularity whose normalization is isomorphic to $(X, 0)$ and $\mathcal{I}_I = \mathcal{I}_{\mathfrak{m}_I}$, where $\mathfrak{m}_I$ is the maximal ideal of $\mathcal{O}_{X_I,0}$. Subsequently, we construct an infinite family of complex surface germs with isolated singularities, whose normalizations are isomorphic to $(X,0)$ (in particular, they are homeomorphic to $(X,0)$) but have distinct outer Lipschitz types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the K-theory of the Hilbert scheme of points in the complex plane, which under McKay correspondence is isomorphic to the space of symmetric functions $\Lambda^n$. We prove a formula conjectured by Boissi\`ere for the endomorphism of $\Lambda^n$ induced by multiplication by the classes of the Adams powers of the tautological bundle. We describe the structure constants for the multiplication on $\Lambda^n$ induced by the tensor product in K-theory.</description>

      <title>The NIEP is solvable by reality and finitely many polynomial inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (NIEP) is shown to be solvable by the reality condition, spectrum equal to its conjugate, as well as by a finite union and intersection of polynomial inequalities. It is also shown that the symmetric NIEP and real NIEP form semi-algebraic sets and can therefore be solved just by a finite union and intersection of polynomial inequalities. An overview of ideas are given in how tools from real algebraic geometry may be applied to the NIEP and related sub-problems.</description>

      <title>Perfectoidness via Sen Theory and Applications to Shimura Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sen's theorem on the ramification of a $p$-adic analytic Galois extension of $p$-adic local fields shows that its perfectoidness is equivalent to the non-vanishing of its arithmetic Sen operator. By developing $p$-adic Hodge theory for general valuation rings, we establish a geometric analogue of Sen's criterion for any $p$-adic analytic Galois extension of $p$-adic varieties: its (Riemann-Zariski) stalkwise perfectoidness is necessary for the non-vanishing of the geometric Sen operators. As the latter is verified for general Shimura varieties by Pan and Camargo, we obtain the perfectoidness of every completed stalk of general Shimura varieties at infinite level at $p$. As an application, we prove that the integral completed cohomology groups vanish in higher degrees, verifying a conjecture of Calegari-Emerton for general Shimura varieties.</description>

      <title>Higher a-numbers in $\mathbf{Z}_p$-towers via Counting Lattice Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Booher, Cais, Kramer-Miller and Upton study a class of $\mathbf{Z}_p$-tower of curves in characteristic $p$ with ramification controlled by an integer $d$. In the special case that $d$ divides $p-1$, they prove a formula for the higher $a$-numbers of these curves involving the number of lattice points in a complicated region of the plane. Booher and Cais had previously conjectured that for $n$ sufficiently large the higher $a$-numbers of the $n$th curve are given by formulae of the form $\alpha(n) p^{2n} + \beta(n) p^n + \lambda_r(n) n + \nu(n) $ for $n$ sufficiently large, where $\alpha,\beta,\nu,\lambda_r$ are periodic functions of $n$. This is an example of a new kind of Iwasawa theory. We establish this conjecture by carefully studying these lattice points.</description>

      <title>A generalized Saito freeness criterion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish generalizations of Saito's criterion for the freeness of divisors in projective spaces that apply both to sequences of several homogeneous polynomials and to divisors on other complete varieties. As an application, the new criterion is applied to several examples, including sequences whose polynomials depend on disjoint sets of variables, some sequences that are equivariant for the action of a linear group, blow-ups of divisors, and certain sequences of polynomials in positive characteristics.</description>

      <title>Galois representations are surjective for almost all Drinfeld modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article advances the results of Duke on the average surjectivity of Galois representations for elliptic curves to the context of Drinfeld modules over function fields. Let $F$ be the rational function field over a finite field. I establish that for Drinfeld modules of rank $r \geq 2$, the $T$-adic Galois representation: $\widehat{\rho}_{\phi, T}: Gal(F^{sep}/F) \rightarrow GL_r(\mathbb{F}_q[[T]])$ is surjective for a density $1$ set of such modules. The proof utilizes Hilbert irreducibility (over function fields), Drinfeld's uniformization theory and sieve methods.</description>

      <title>On the Berkovich double residue fields and birational models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.03610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Just as a residue field can be considered for a point of an algebraic variety, we can also consider a residue field for a point of a Berkovich analytic space. This residue field is a valuation field in the algebraic sense. Then we can consider its residue field as a valuation field. We call it the Berkovich double residue field at the point. In this paper, we consider a point $x$ of the Berkovich analytification of an algebraic variety and identify the Berkovich double residue field at $x$ with the union of the residue fields at the center of $x$ in birational models. Besides, we concretely compute the Berkovich double residue field for any quasi monomial valuation.</description>

      <title>The tropical non-properness set of a polynomial map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.00989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study some discrete invariants of Newton non-degenerate polynomial maps $f : \mathbb{K}^n \to \mathbb{K}^n$ defined over an algebraically closed field of Puiseux series $\mathbb{K}$, equipped with a non-trivial valuation. It is known that the set $\mathcal{S}(f)$ of points at which $f$ is not finite forms an algebraic hypersurface in $\mathbb{K}^n$. The coordinate-wise valuation of $\mathcal{S}(f)\cap (\mathbb{K}^*)^n$ is a piecewise-linear object in $\mathbb{R}^n$, which we call the tropical non-properness set of $f$. We show that the tropical polynomial map corresponding to $f$ has fibers satisfying a particular combinatorial degeneracy condition exactly over points in the tropical non-properness set of $f$. We then use this description to outline a polyhedral method for computing this set, and to recover the fan dual to the Newton polytope of the set at which a complex polynomial map is not finite. The proofs rely on classical correspondence and structural results from tropical geometry, combined with a new description of $\mathcal{S}(f)$ in terms of multivariate resultants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08638v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new algebraic winding number and prove that it computes the number of complex roots of a polynomial in a rectangle, including roots on edges or vertices with appropriate counting. The definition makes sense for the algebraic closure C = R[i] of a real closed field R, and the root counting result also holds in this case. We study in detail the properties of the algebraic winding number defined in [3] with respect to complex root counting in rectangles. We extend both winding numbers to rational functions, obtaining then algebraic versions of the argument principle for rectangles.</description>

      <title>Crepant resolutions of stratified varieties via gluing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07539v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a variety with a stratification $\mathcal{S}$ into smooth locally closed subvarieties such that $X$ is locally a product along each stratum (e.g., a symplectic singularity). We prove that assigning to each open subset $U \subset X$ the set of isomorphism classes of locally projective crepant resolutions of $U$ defines an $\mathcal{S}$-constructible sheaf of sets. Thus, for each stratum $S$ and basepoint $s \in S$, the fundamental group acts on the set of germs of projective crepant resolutions at $s$, leaving invariant the germs extending to the entire stratum. Global locally projective crepant resolutions correspond to compatible such choices for all strata. For example, if the local projective crepant resolutions are unique, they automatically glue uniquely.
  We give criteria for a locally projective crepant resolution $\rho: \tilde X \to X$ to be globally projective. We show that the sheafification of the presheaf $U \mapsto \text{Pic}(\rho^{-1}(U)/U)$ of relative Picard classes is also constructible. The resolution is globally projective only if there exist local relatively ample bundles whose classes glue to a global section of this sheaf. The obstruction to lifting this section to a global ample line bundle is encoded by a gerbe on the singularity $X$. We show the gerbes are automatically trivial if $X$ is a symplectic quotient singularity. Our main results hold in the more general setting of partial crepant resolutions, that need not have smooth source. We apply the theory to symmetric powers and Hilbert schemes of surfaces with du Val singularities, finite quotients of tori, multiplicative and Nakajima quiver varieties, as well as to canonical threefold singularities.</description>

      <title>Degree of the Grassmannian as an affine variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The degree of the Grassmannian with respect to the Pl\"ucker embedding is well-known. However, the Pl\"ucker embedding, while ubiquitous in pure mathematics, is almost never used in applied mathematics. In applied mathematics, the Grassmannian is usually embedded as projection matrices $\operatorname{Gr}(k,\mathbb{R}^n) \cong \{P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} : P^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} = P = P^2,\; \operatorname{tr}(P) = k\}$ or as involution matrices $\operatorname{Gr}(k,\mathbb{R}^n) \cong \{X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} : X^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} = X,\; X^2 = I,\; \operatorname{tr}(X)=2k - n\}$. We will determine an explicit expression for the degree of the Grassmannian with respect to these embeddings. In so doing, we resolved a conjecture of Devriendt--Friedman--Sturmfels about the degree $\operatorname{Gr}(2, \mathbb{R}^n)$ and in fact generalized it to $\operatorname{Gr}(k, \mathbb{R}^n)$. We also proved a set theoretic variant of another conjecture of Devriendt--Friedman--Sturmfels about the limit of $\operatorname{Gr}(k,\mathbb{R}^n)$ in the sense of Gr\"obner degneration.</description>

      <title>Almost commuting scheme of symplectic matrices and quantum Hamiltonian reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Losev introduced the scheme $X$ of almost commuting elements (i.e., elements commuting upto a rank one element) of $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sp}(V)$ for a symplectic vector space $V$ and discussed its algebro-geometric properties. We construct a Lagrangian subscheme $X^{nil}$ of $X$ and show that it is a complete intersection of dimension $\text{dim}(\mathfrak{g})+\frac{1}{2}\text{dim}(V)$ and compute its irreducible components.
  We also study the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the algebra $\mathcal{D}(\mathfrak{g})$ of differential operators on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ tensored with the Weyl algebra with respect to the action of the symplectic group, and show that it is isomorphic to the spherical subalgebra of a certain rational Cherednik algebra of Type $C$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study queen's graphs, which encode the moves by a queen on an $n\times m$ chess board, through the lens of chip-firing games. We prove that their gonality is equal to $nm$ minus the independence number of the graph, and give a one-to-one correspondence between maximum independent sets and classes of positive rank divisors achieving gonality. We also prove an identical result for toroidal queen's graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this paper new Steiner systems $S(2,6,121)$, $S(2,6,126)$ are introduced. Also some non-existence results for line lengths $7..9$ are presented. There is no solid proof that presented algorithm is exhaustive or correct, but it produces same results on already known difference families for line lengths $3..5$. Due to calculation-based approach this paper probably won't be published, but will be submitted to arxiv as it contains some new results</description>
