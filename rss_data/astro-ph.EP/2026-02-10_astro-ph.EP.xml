      <title>A New Strategy for Using Spectroscopic Phase Curves to Characterize Non-Transiting Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new time-series analysis strategy for combined-light exoplanet spectroscopic phase curves called the Variable Planetary Infrared Excess (VPIE) method. VPIE can be used to extract information about the planetary flux contribution without the need for the planet to transit, or use of a stellar spectral model. VPIE utilizes a linear combination of a small set of individual spectra to produce an empirical model of the stellar contribution at each time step, thereby normalizing each spectrum and leaving only an imprint of the planet's flux in the residual data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VPIE through simulated James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of three known exoplanet orbiting late-type M stars: the warm giant TOI-519 b, the warm sub-Neptune GJ 876 d, and the temperate super-Earth Proxima Centauri b. Our results indicate that though VPIE loses sensitivity for very high redistribution values, it can successfully distinguish between various atmospheric circulation regimes (zero, moderate, or high heat redistribution) and constrain planetary radii for non-unity day-night temperature ratios. While performance for cooler targets may be limited by JWST spectroscopic capabilities at longer wavelengths, future VPIE improvements or new instrumentation could enable characterization of potentially habitable planets. VPIE offers a promising new framework for pulling back the veil on the population of non-transiting planets around nearby M-stars that are otherwise inaccessible to current techniques.</description>

      <title>Coma Volatile Composition and Thermal Physics in Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) Measured Near Closest Approach to Earth with NASA-IRTF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2023 perihelion passage of comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) afforded an opportunity to measure the abundances and spatial distributions of coma volatiles in an Oort cloud comet at high spatial resolution near its close approach to Earth ($\Delta_\mathrm{min}\sim 0.28$ au on UT February 1). We conducted near-infrared spectroscopic observations of C/2022 E3 (ZTF) using iSHELL at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on UT 2023 February 9. Our measurements securely detected fluorescent emission from H$_2$O, CO, OCS, CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_2$H$_2$, and HCN. For each instrumental setting we took exposures with the slit oriented parallel and also perpendicular to the projected Sun-comet vector, thereby enabling a test of the spatial distributions of these molecules. We report rotational temperatures, production rates, and abundance ratios (i.e., mixing ratios) for all sampled species. Our measurements found that molecular abundances in C/2022 E3 were depleted compared to their average values in Oort cloud comets with the exception of OCS, which was consistent. The H$_2$O production rate varied significantly and was likely tied to nucleus rotation effects. Measurements at the two slit orientations showed distinct column density and rotational temperature profiles for H$_2$O. Peak temperatures occurred off-nucleus and slower cooling was present in the anti-sunward hemisphere, consistent with the presence of icy grain sublimation in the coma.</description>

      <title>A tension between dust and gas radii: the role of substructures and external photoevaporation in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disk substructures are thought to play a crucial role in disk evolution and planet formation. Population studies of disks large-sample size surveys show that substructures, and their rapid formation, are needed to reproduce the observed spectral indices. Moreover, they enable the simultaneous reproduction of the observed spectral index and size-luminosity distributions. This study aims to investigate the necessity of substructures and predict their characteristics to reproduce gas-to-dust size ratios observed in the Lupus star-forming region. We performed a population synthesis study of gas and dust evolution in disks using a two-population model (two-pop-py) and the DustPy code. We considered the effects of viscous evolution, dust growth, fragmentation, transport, and external photoevaporation. The simulated population distributions were obtained by post-processing the resulting disk profiles of surface density, maximum grain size, and disk temperature. Although substructures help reduce the discrepancy between simulated and observed disk gas-to-dust size ratios; even when accounting for external photoevaporation, they do not fully resolve it. Only specific initial conditions in disks undergoing viscous evolution with external photoevaporation can reproduce the observations, highlighting a fine-tuning problem. While substructured disks reproduce dust size and spectral index, they tend to overestimate gas radii. The results ultimately highlight the main challenge of simultaneously reproducing gas and dust sizes. One possible explanation is that the outermost substructure is linked to the disk truncation radius, which determines the gas radius, or that substructures are frequent enough to always be near the gas outer radius.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Mass Constraints on Transition Disk Perturbers with the G23H Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present dynamical mass constraints on perturbers in 11 transition disk systems using a novel combination of calibrated Hipparcos and Gaia absolute astrometry data. Out of the sample of 11, we find support for companions in seven systems, with significant detections in three. These systems are: HD 142527, where we clearly detect the known low-mass stellar companion HD 142527 B; AB Aurigae, where we detect a low-mass stellar or sub-stellar companion; and MWC 758, where we detect a likely sub-stellar companion. We also find strong evidence of companions to HD 97048 and UX Tau A, and moderate evidence for companions to HD 100546 and CQ Tau. In the four systems with non-detections, we find no evidence for companions more massive than $\sim$6 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ with a semi-major axis greater than 3 au for HD 100453, nor for companions more massive than $\sim$2 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ with a semi-major axis greater than 2 au for TW Hya. We also find no evidence for stellar mass companions with semi-major axes between $\sim$3 and $\sim$25 au for both HD 34282 and RY Lup. In addition to our fiducial model, we perform cross validation between astrometry sources. By comparing results across models, we find tentative evidence of a short timescale excess astrometric noise that may impact some protoplanetary disk systems. We conclude with predictions for the prospects of making dynamical mass constraints on protoplanets in protoplanetary disk systems with Gaia data release 4 using detailed simulations of Gaia DR4 data of PDS 70 and WISPIT 2.</description>

      <title>Impact of embedded circumplanetary winds on the circumstellar disk: I. Reshaping the local accretion environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of winds is among the uncertainties related to the growth of giant planets. Such circumplanetary outflows have been proposed to explain kinematic and chemical structures in protoplanetary disks. We investigate the immediate impact of circumplanetary outflows on the circumstellar disk environment, the planetary vicinity, and planetary growth. We performed three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using \texttt{FARGO3D}, implementing a parametric wind launched from the vicinity of an embedded planet. Although the imposed configurations for the outflows do not significantly alter the global structure of the disk, they do substantially redistribute material in the vicinity of the embedded planet. In particular, the wind redirects accretion flows from polar to equatorial latitudes, resulting in variable accretion patterns over time. Although the mass accretion rate variations depend on the efficiency of the outflows, their presence diminishes the accretion rate over time and the total mass reservoir within the Hill sphere and the planet's direct vicinity, potentially slowing or limiting planetary growth.</description>

      <title>JWST spectral retrieval of cold directly imaged planet WD0806 b and the first measurement of altitude-dependent K$_{zz}$ in exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WD0806 b is a rare exoplanet companion orbiting a white dwarf, currently with a projected orbital distance of 2500 au. The Spitzer mid-IR photometry suggests that the temperature is as cold as 350K, making it one of the coldest directly imaged exoplanets. In this paper, we present the Near-infrared Camera (NIRCam) F150W2, F200W, F356W, and F444W broadband photometry and a 3--5\um Near-Infrared spectroscopy (NIRSpec) G395M spectrum obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We develop a new retrieval framework based on the open-source PICASO software that includes additive and multiplicative systematic parameters. Our retrieval results reveal bounded abundances of H$_2$S, CO$_2$, CO, NH$_3$, H$_2$O, and CH$_4$. We present a new chemical analysis framework that utilizes retrieved abundances to measure altitude-dependent eddy diffusion coefficients (K$_{\mathrm zz}$) at multiple quenched pressures. We find that the eddy diffusion coefficients decrease from around $10^4$ to $10^2$ $\rm cm^2/s$ as the atmospheric pressure decreases from from 50 to 20 bars. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report altitude-dependent vertical mixing (or, equivalently, quenched-species-dependent vertical mixing) based on the measured molecular abundances of CO, CH$_4$, and CO$_2$. With the 1--21\um NIRCam, NIRSpec and the previously published MIRI data, we measure the bolometric luminosity to be log(L/L$_{\odot}$) = $-6.75\pm0.01$ and derive the mass to be $8\pm 1 \mathrm{M_J}$. The retrieval results suggest that \target has an elevated C/O ratio of 0.76, or 1.3$\times$ solar, sub-solar metallicity ([M/H ]= -0.25), and a nearly solar C/S ratio (1.17x solar).</description>

      <title>NovaMoon: A Strategic Lunar Reference Station for Positioning, Timing, and Largely Enhanced Science in the Earth-Moon System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08432v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renewed interest in lunar exploration and the development of future lunar communication and navigation services highlight the need for a precise, stable, and interoperable geodetic and timing infrastructure on the Moon. NovaMoon, proposed as a scientific and navigation payload for ESA's Argonaut lander, is designed as a lunar-based local differential, geodetic, and timing station supporting both operational needs in the Moon's south polar region and a broad range of scientific investigations. The payload integrates a lunar laser retroreflector, a Very Long Baseline Interferometry transmitter, a receiver for navigation signals compatible with LunaNet standards, high-stability atomic clocks, and direct-to-Earth radio links -- making it the first lunar station to co-locate multiple ranging, tracking, and timing techniques. NovaMoon will enable sub-metre to decimetre positioning, provide local differential corrections for lunar users, and ensure an accurate and stable realisation of position and time. Preliminary simulation studies show that this multi-technique dataset improves the lunar reference frame, orientation and ephemerides, and estimates of interior parameters like tidal response and core properties. NovaMoon will also provide the first long-duration physical realisation of a lunar time reference. Beyond its primary goals, it supports improved cartography, precise surface geolocation, and higher-resolution topography, contributing to safer landings and operations. It also enables new tests of fundamental physics, including constraints on relativity and possible deviations from classical gravity.</description>

      <title>The Nysa family as the main source of unequilibrated LL ordinary chondrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The origin of the petrologic diversity observed in ordinary chondrites (OCs), the most common meteorites on Earth, remains debated. Competing models invoke either depth-dependent sampling of a single thermally stratified ("onion-shell") parent body or contributions from multiple distinct parent bodies. Aims. We aim to determine which of the two models is preferred for LL chondrites. These are unique among OCs in exhibiting a bimodal petrologic distribution, with most meteorites being LL3 or LL6. Methods. We compare the spectral and mineralogical properties of LL chondrites and corresponding LL-chondrite-like near-Earth objects (NEOs) with their possible sources in the main asteroid belt. We also model the thermal histories of the proposed parent bodies, based on revised estimates of parent-body sizes. Results. The spectral and mineralogical diversity of LL chondrites is consistent with contributions from the bright, S-type component of the Nysa family (NysaS) and the Flora family, with NysaS supplying mainly low-petrologic-type material and Flora higher-grade material. Unequilibrated, LL3 chondrites appear to originate exclusively from NysaS. Similarly, LL-chondrite-like NEOs form two distinct subpopulations consistent with origins in these same families. Conclusions. Our results favour multiple parent bodies for LL chondrites. The petrologic differences between the NysaS and Flora parent bodies indicate that planetesimal accretion within the OC reservoir extended over 0.5-0.7 Myr.</description>

      <title>RedDots: Multiplanet system around M dwarf GJ 887 in the solar neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08929v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GJ 887 is a bright M dwarf in the solar neighborhood with two currently reported nontransiting exoplanets with periods of $9~\mathrm{d}$ and $21~\mathrm{d,}$ along with an additional unconfirmed signal at $50~\mathrm{d}$. We reanalyzed the system with 101 new HARPS and 12 new ESPRESSO radial velocities (RVs) secured with a cadence to confirm or refute the origin of the $50~\mathrm{d}$ signal. To do so, we searched for signals related to stellar activity in photometric data and spectroscopic indicators. We modeled the stellar activity in the RVs with Gaussian processes (GPs). With the Bayesian analysis, we confirmed a four-planet model, including the two previously known planets at periods of $9.2619\pm0.0005~\mathrm{d}$ and $21.784\pm0.004~\mathrm{d,}$ as well as two newly confirmed exoplanets: an Earth-mass planet, with a $4.42490\pm0.00014~\mathrm{d}$ period and a sub-meter-per-second amplitude, and a super-Earth with a $50.77\pm0.05~\mathrm{d}$ period located in the habitable zone (HZ). This super-Earth is the second closest planet in the HZ, after Proxima Cen b. We found an additional signal in a 2:1 resonance with the $4.4~\mathrm{d}$ planet at $2.21661\pm0.00010~\mathrm{d}$ with an amplitude of $0.37\pm0.09~\mathrm{m/s}$, which could be related to an additional planet. However, other explanations of its origin are also plausible. This signal remains a candidate, as further investigation is required to confirm its true nature. If the signal is caused by a planet, its minimum mass would be half that of Earth. We measured the stellar rotation period with the characteristic periodic timescale of the GP. We found a period of $38.7\pm0.5~\mathrm{d}$, which is consistent with the rotation period determined from photometry and other activity indices.</description>

      <title>Two Robust Interstellar Meteor Candidates in the Post-2018 CNEOS Fireball Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the identification of two previously unrecognized interstellar meteor candidates in the NASA CNEOS fireball database. Using the empirically calibrated low-discrepancy uncertainty model of Pe\~na-Asensio et al.\ (2025) for post-2018 CNEOS velocity accuracy (1$\sigma$: speed 0.55~km~s$^{-1}$, right ascension 1.35$^\circ$, declination 0.84$^\circ$), we transform CNEOS velocity vectors to heliocentric orbits and assess interstellar candidacy via $10^{6}$-draw Monte Carlo simulations. Two post-2018 events have heliocentric speeds robustly exceeding the Solar System escape speed. CNEOS-22 (2022-07-28; 6.0$^\circ$S, 86.9$^\circ$W; eastern tropical Pacific) has $v_{\rm hel}=46.98$~km~s$^{-1}$, exceeding escape by $\Delta = 5.18 \pm 0.60$~km~s$^{-1}$ ($z_{\Delta}=8.7\sigma$), with interstellar speed $v_{\infty,\odot}=21.5$~km~s$^{-1}$. CNEOS-25 (2025-02-12; 73.4$^\circ$N, 49.3$^\circ$E; Barents Sea) has $v_{\rm hel}=45.63$~km~s$^{-1}$, exceeding escape by $\Delta = 3.22 \pm 0.58$~km~s$^{-1}$ ($z_{\Delta}=5.5\sigma$), with $v_{\infty,\odot}=16.9$~km~s$^{-1}$. For both events, none of $10^{6}$ realizations yield a gravitationally bound orbit ($p_{\rm bound} &lt; 3\times 10^{-6}$). The adopted error model would need to underestimate the true uncertainties by factors of 5--9 for either candidate to be marginally bound.</description>

      <title>Indications of Rapid Dust Formation in the Inner Region of a Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a significant increase in mid-infrared emission $\leq10$ $\mu$m in a transitional disk. The 2024 JWST/MIRI observation of the disk around CVSO 1942 reveals flux increase by a factor of two at $\lambda\leq10$ $\mu$m, compared to the near photospheric flux level observed with Spitzer/IRS in 2005. No significant change in flux at $\gtrsim15$ $\mu$m is detected in the spectra. Comparing the MIRI/MRS spectrum and NEOWISE photometry, we found that this $\leq10$ $\mu$m flux increase occurs on a timescale of 2 weeks and is consistent with the presence of warm (1,400 K), optically thick, large ($\gtrsim1$ $\mu$m) dust grains near the dust sublimation radius. We propose that this rapid dust appearance may indicate in situ dust formation, possibly from planetesimal collisions in the inner disk.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Ready Data Sets for the Analysis and Nowcasting of Atmospheric Radiation at Aviation Altitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowcasting and forecasting of the radiation environment in the Earth's lower atmosphere are critical for the safety of aircraft and spacecraft crews and passengers. Currently, this problem is addressed by employing statistical and physics-based models that take into account particle transport and precipitation. However, given the increased number of radiation measurements available to the community, it is possible to start developing data-driven approaches. We prepared Machine Learning-ready (ML-ready) datasets to nowcast the effective dose rates at aviation altitudes. The presented datasets contain 92,476 individual measurements from 589 flights obtained by the Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) experiment from 2013 to 2023. The ARMAS measurements are augmented with the properties of the Geospace environment, such as solar soft X-ray and proton fluxes, solar wind properties, secondary cosmic ray neutrons, space weather indexes, and global solar activity indicators (such as daily sunspot number). ARMAS data are separated into three partitions, ensuring that (1) the data points from a single flight remain within the same partition, and (2) each partition samples the flight locations and Geospace environment conditions equally. Several versions of the datasets allow predictions based on point-in-time measurements and use up to 24 hours of Geospace parameter history. The test of the use case demonstrates a possibility of nowcasting ARMAS measurements with accuracies slightly better than the considered physics-based models. The publicly available ML-ready datasets could serve as the first step in data preparation for ML-driven nowcasting and forecasting of the radiation environment.</description>

      <title>SOLO: wide-field asteroid light curve monitoring system for SPHEREx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Solar system Objects Light curve Observatory (SOLO), a wide-field, high-cadence optical survey system designed to obtain absolutely calibrated asteroid light curves, converted to the Gaia G-band photometric system, in support of the SPHEREx Solar System Object Catalog (SSOC). SOLO was installed at the Sierra Remote Observatories (SRO) in California, USA, in July 2025 and is optimized for continuous, multi-night monitoring of asteroid brightness variations. We describe the system configuration, remote operation, and data reduction pipeline, and evaluate its optical and photometric performance using commissioning data. SOLO achieves stable photometric calibration across the 11.6 deg^2 field of view and reaches a 10-sigma limiting magnitude of G ~ 17.5 for a 180 sec exposure. Sample asteroid light curves obtained over multiple nights demonstrate consistent absolute photometry at the same rotational phase, validating the estimated performance. Finally, we outline the planned operational use of SOLO in connection with NASA's SPHEREx mission. Full science operations of SOLO are scheduled to begin in January 2026. Using these data, we aim to obtain on the order of 10^3 absolutely calibrated asteroid light curves per year in the Gaia G-band, which will be used to support the construction and scientific utilization of the SPHEREx SSOC.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Y Dwarf Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global circulation regime of the coolest brown dwarfs, the Y dwarfs, remains largely unexplored. We investigate the interplay between convection, rotation, and cloud thermal feedback using a selected sample of Y dwarf atmospheric models. We explore effective temperatures $400~\mathrm{K} \leq T_{\mathrm{eff}} \leq 600~\mathrm{K}$ and rotation periods $P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 2.5 \text{--} 20\ \mathrm{h}$, where salt and sulfide condensates are expected. We include $\mathrm{KCl,~Na_{2}S}$, and $\mathrm{MnS}$ clouds to assess their atmospheric impact and identify circulation regimes across parameter space. We run twelve general circulation models (GCMs) spanning this grid and develop additional physics modules for the THOR GCM to model brown dwarf atmospheres. The dynamical core is coupled to interior thermal perturbations near the radiative-convective boundary, a mixing-length convection scheme, gray two-stream radiative transfer with Rosseland-mean opacities, and simple cloud tracers including thermal feedback and scattering. All simulations exhibit a radiative-forcing-dominated regime with weak winds, minimal horizontal temperature contrasts, and no persistent jets. Convection controls vertical mixing and sets the extent of salt and sulfide cloud layers below the photosphere. Thermal structures equilibrate quickly and cloud radiative feedback remains insignificant, with limited variability. Within the gray radiative transfer framework adopted here, Y dwarf atmospheres in this parameter space are controlled by interior thermal radiation. Rotation sets modest variability, while clouds play a secondary role. Because our single-band approach does not capture spectral windows that could probe deeper cloud layers, our constraints on cloud radiative feedback are likely conservative, and we outline pathways toward more active regimes.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian accelerations of a Mercury orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic modeling of spacecraft motion in Mercury's post-Newtonian local coordinates. This investigation is motivated by the fact that Mercury's post-Newtonian gravitational field (as well as that of any other planet) admits an expansion in terms of multipole moments, which are most appropriately defined in the local reference system. The equations of motion in the Mercury-centric local frame include relativistic local perturbations, given by the Schwarzschild term, Lense-Thirring precession, and the acceleration due to the quadrupole moment, and relativistic third-body perturbations, which are the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic accelerations, along with a coupling term between Mercury and other solar system bodies. The relativistic third-body perturbations are usually neglected in all practical applications. In this study, we analyze the magnitude of the post-Newtonian terms of the equations of motion formulated in the Mercury-centric frame, evaluating them along the trajectories of the two BepiColombo spacecrafts. Based on this analysis, we provide a practical approach for constructing a high-accuracy relativistic orbital model suitable for a Mercury orbiter.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability with Anisotropic Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurs in multiple heliospheric (solar-wind stream interfaces, planetary magnetospheres, cometary tails, heliopause flanks) and interstellar (protoplanetary disks, relativistic jets, neutron star accretion disks) environments. While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause).</description>

      <title>Free-floating Planets Produced by Planet-Planet Scatterings: Ejection Velocity and Survival Rate of Their Moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of numerous free-floating planets (FFPs) has intensified interest in their origins and dynamical histories. A leading formation mechanism is planet-planet scatterings in unstable multi-planetary systems, which can naturally lead to planetary ejections. If these planets originally host moons, it remains an open question whether such satellites can remain gravitationally bound to FFPs after ejection. In this work, we investigate both the ejection velocity of FFPs produced by planet-planet scatterings and the survival rate of their potential moons; we estimate the latter by determining the statistics of the minimum planet-planet distance prior to planet ejection, and comparing it to the initial orbital radius of the moon relative to its host planet. Using the circular restricted three-body framework, we derive an analytical boundary for the ejection velocity based on Jacobi energy conservation, which agrees with the results of integrations. We also identify a minimum planetary mass required for successful ejection. For two-planet systems with finite planetary masses, we use simulations and analytical arguments to determine how the ejection velocity scales with the planetary mass and initial semi-major axis. We contrast our results to the ejection of planets around binaries in unstable orbits. Extending our analysis to three-planet systems yields similar results, reinforcing the robustness of our conclusions. These findings offer insights into the property of FFPs and inform future efforts to search for exomoons around them.</description>

      <title>ExoJAX Retrievals of VLT/CRIRES Spectra of Luhman 16AB: C/O Ratios and Systematic Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present atmospheric retrievals of the benchmark brown dwarf binary Luhman 16AB using high-resolution VLT/CRIRES spectra and the differentiable framework ExoJAX. We derive elemental abundances and temperature-pressure ($T$-$P$) profiles while explicitly testing the robustness of the results against major sources of systematic uncertainty. We first perform retrievals with a power-law $T$-$P$ profile and assess the sensitivity of inferred molecular abundances and C/O ratios to different CO line lists (ExoMol, HITEMP with air- and H2-broadening). We then introduce a flexible Gaussian process-based $T$-$P$ profile, allowing a non-parametric characterization of the thermal structure and a more conservative treatment of uncertainties. For both components, we infer C/O ratios of about 0.67, slightly above solar, with line list systematics at the 7 percent level emerging as the dominant source of uncertainty, whereas assumptions about $T$-$P$ parameterization or photometric variability play a lesser role. The retrieved $T$-$P$ profiles and molecular abundances are broadly consistent with atmospheric models and equilibrium chemistry. Our results establish Luhman 16AB as a key anchor for substellar C/O measurements, demonstrate the utility of flexible $T$-$P$ modeling in high-resolution retrievals, and highlight the importance of systematic tests -- particularly line list uncertainties -- for robust comparisons between brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Pre-Perihelion Mapping of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, and $\mathrm{CO}$ in Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From 01- to 15-Aug-2025UT, the SPHEREx spacecraft observed interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. Using $R=40-130$ spectrophotometry at $\lambda=0.7-5$ $\mu$m, light curves, spectra, and imaging of ATLAS were obtained. From these, robust detections of water gas emission at $2.7-2.8$ $\mu$m and $CO_2$ gas at $4.23-4.27$ $\mu$m plus tentative detections of $^{13}CO_2$ and $CO$ gas were found. A slightly extended $H_2O$ coma was detected, and a huge $CO_2$ atmosphere of extending out to at least $4.2 \times 10^{5}$ km was discovered. Gas production rates and 1$\sigma$ errors for $H_2O$, $^{12}CO_2$, $^{13}CO_2$, and $CO$ were $Q_{gas} = 3.2 \times 10^{26} \pm 20\%$, $1.6 \times 10^{27} \pm 10\%$, $1.3 \times 10^{25} \pm 25\%$, and $1.0 \times 10^{26} \pm 25\%$, respectively. Co-addition of all $\lambda = 1.0-1.5$ $\mu$m scattered light continuum images from produced a high SNR image consistent with an unresolved source. The scattered light lightcurve showed $\lesssim 15\%$ variability over the observation period. The absolute brightness of ATLAS at $1.0-1.5$ $\mu$m is consistent with a $&lt; 2.5$ km radius nucleus surrounded by a 100 times brighter coma. The $1.5-4.0$ $\mu$m continuum structure shows a strong feature commensurate with water ice absorption seen in KBOs and distant comets. The observed cometary behavior of ATLAS, including its preponderance of $CO_2$ emission, lack of $CO$ output, small size, and predominance of large icy chunks of material in a flux-dominant coma is similar to the behavior of short period comet 103P/Hartley 2, the ''hyperactive comet'' flyby target of the NASA Deep Impact extended mission in 2010. This correspondence suggests that ISOs can be significantly thermally processed before ejection into the ISM, and by comparison to 1I and 2I, can be widely variable in their physical outcome.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration of Kernel Phase Interferometry on JWST/MIRI: Prospects for Future Planet Searches Around Post Main Sequence Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel phase interferometry (KPI) is a post-processing technique that treats a conventional telescope as an interferometer by accurately modeling a telescope pupil as an array of virtual subapertures. KPI provides angular resolution within the diffraction limit by eliminating instrumental phase errors to first order. It has been successfully demonstrated to boost angular resolution on both space- and ground-based observatories, and is especially useful for enhancing space telescopes, as their diameters are smaller than the largest ground-based facilities. Here we present the first demonstration of KPI on JWST/MIRI data at 7.7 microns, 10 microns, and 15 microns. We generate contrast curves for 16 white dwarfs from the MIRI Exoplanets Orbiting White dwarfs (MEOW) Survey, finding significantly deeper contrast at small angular separations compared to traditional imaging with JWST/MIRI, down to within $\lambda$/D. Additionally, we use our KPI setup to successfully recover four known companions orbiting white dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This analysis shows that at these wavelengths KPI can uniquely access the orbital parameter space where inward-migrating post-main-sequence giant exoplanets are now thought to exist. We discuss the prospects for applying KPI to a larger sample of white dwarfs observed with JWST, increasing the volume of directly imaged close-in post-main-sequence exoplanets.</description>
