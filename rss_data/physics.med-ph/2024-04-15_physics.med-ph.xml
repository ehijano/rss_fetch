      <title>Self-Supervised k-Space Regularization for Motion-Resolved Abdominal MRI Using Neural Implicit k-Space Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural implicit k-space representations have shown promising results for dynamic MRI at high temporal resolutions. Yet, their exclusive training in k-space limits the application of common image regularization methods to improve the final reconstruction. In this work, we introduce the concept of parallel imaging-inspired self-consistency (PISCO), which we incorporate as novel self-supervised k-space regularization enforcing a consistent neighborhood relationship. At no additional data cost, the proposed regularization significantly improves neural implicit k-space reconstructions on simulated data. Abdominal in-vivo reconstructions using PISCO result in enhanced spatio-temporal image quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Automatic Quantification of Serial PET/CT Images for Pediatric Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients Using a Longitudinally-Aware Segmentation Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\textbf{Purpose}$: Automatic quantification of longitudinal changes in PET scans for lymphoma patients has proven challenging, as residual disease in interim-therapy scans is often subtle and difficult to detect. Our goal was to develop a longitudinally-aware segmentation network (LAS-Net) that can quantify serial PET/CT images for pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma patients. $\textbf{Materials and Methods}$: This retrospective study included baseline (PET1) and interim (PET2) PET/CT images from 297 patients enrolled in two Children's Oncology Group clinical trials (AHOD1331 and AHOD0831). LAS-Net incorporates longitudinal cross-attention, allowing relevant features from PET1 to inform the analysis of PET2. Model performance was evaluated using Dice coefficients for PET1 and detection F1 scores for PET2. Additionally, we extracted and compared quantitative PET metrics, including metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) in PET1, as well as qPET and $\Delta$SUVmax in PET2, against physician measurements. We quantified their agreement using Spearman's $\rho$ correlations and employed bootstrap resampling for statistical analysis. $\textbf{Results}$: LAS-Net detected residual lymphoma in PET2 with an F1 score of 0.606 (precision/recall: 0.615/0.600), outperforming all comparator methods (P&lt;0.01). For baseline segmentation, LAS-Net achieved a mean Dice score of 0.772. In PET quantification, LAS-Net's measurements of qPET, $\Delta$SUVmax, MTV and TLG were strongly correlated with physician measurements, with Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.78, 0.80, 0.93 and 0.96, respectively. The performance remained high, with a slight decrease, in an external testing cohort. $\textbf{Conclusion}$: LAS-Net achieved high performance in quantifying PET metrics across serial scans, highlighting the value of longitudinal awareness in evaluating multi-time-point imaging datasets.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of PET-enabled dual-energy CT imaging: First physical phantom and patient results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) in PET/CT is commonly operated with a single energy, resulting in a limitation of lacking tissue composition information. Dual-energy (DE) spectral CT enables material decomposition by using two different x-ray energies and may be combined with PET for improved multimodality imaging, but would either require hardware upgrade or increase radiation dose due to the added second x-ray CT scan. Recently proposed PET-enabled DECT method allows dual-energy spectral imaging using a conventional PET/CT scanner without the need for a second x-ray CT scan. A gamma-ray CT (gCT) image at 511 keV can be generated from the existing time-of-flight PET data with the maximum-likelihood attenuation and activity (MLAA) approach and is then combined with the low-energy x-ray CT image to form dual-energy spectral imaging. To improve the image quality of gCT, a kernel MLAA method was further proposed by incorporating x-ray CT as a priori information. The concept of this PET-enabled DECT has been validated using simulation studies, but not yet with 3D real data. In this work, we developed a general open-source implementation for gCT reconstruction from PET data and use this implementation for the first real data validation with both a physical phantom study and a human subject study on a uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system. These results have demonstrated the feasibility of this method for spectral imaging and material decomposition.</description>
