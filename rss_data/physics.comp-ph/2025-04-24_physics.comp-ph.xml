      <title>Scalable Data-Driven Basis Selection for Linear Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provide an effective approach for accurately and efficiently modeling atomic interactions, expanding the capabilities of atomistic simulations to complex systems. However, a priori feature selection leads to high complexity, which can be detrimental to both computational cost and generalization, resulting in a need for hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate the benefits of active set algorithms for automated data-driven feature selection. The proposed methods are implemented within the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework. Computational tests conducted on a variety of benchmark datasets indicate that sparse ACE models consistently enhance computational efficiency, generalization accuracy and interpretability over dense ACE models. An added benefit of the proposed algorithms is that they produce entire paths of models with varying cost/accuracy ratio.</description>

      <title>Towards a Generalized Theory of Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a formal framework for understanding and unifying the concept of observers across physics, computer science, philosophy, and related fields. Building on cybernetic feedback models, we introduce an operational definition of minimal observers, explore their role in shaping foundational concepts, and identify what remains unspecified in their absence. Drawing upon insights from quantum gravity, digital physics, second-order cybernetics, and recent ruliological and pregeometric approaches, we argue that observers serve as indispensable reference points for measurement, reference frames, and the emergence of meaning. We show how this formalism sheds new light on debates related to consciousness, quantum measurement, and computational boundaries; by way of theorems on observer equivalences and complexity measures. This perspective opens new avenues for investigating how complexity and structure arise in both natural and artificial systems.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Simulated Noisy Quantum Data Collection by Orders of Magnitude Using Pre-Trajectory Sampling with Batched Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classically simulating quantum systems is challenging, as even noiseless $n$-qubit quantum states scale as $2^n$. The complexity of noisy quantum systems is even greater, requiring $2^n \times 2^n$-dimensional density matrices. Various approximations reduce density matrix overhead, including quantum trajectory-based methods, which instead use an ensemble of $m \ll 2^n$ noisy states. While this method is dramatically more efficient, current implementations use unoptimized sampling, redundant state preparation, and single-shot data collection. In this manuscript, we present the Pre-Trajectory Sampling technique, increasing the efficiency and utility of trajectory simulations by tailoring error types, batching sampling without redundant computation, and collecting error information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both a mature statevector simulation of a 35-qubit quantum error-correction code and a preliminary tensor network simulation of 85 qubits, yielding speedups of up to $10^6$x and $16$x, as well as generating massive datasets of one trillion and one million shots, respectively.</description>

      <title>PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</description>

      <title>Least-Squares-Embedded Optimization for Accelerated Convergence of PINNs in Acoustic Wavefield Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs), including the frequency-domain Helmholtz equation. However, standard training of PINNs using gradient descent (GD) suffers from slow convergence and instability, particularly for high-frequency wavefields. For scattered acoustic wavefield simulation based on Helmholtz equation, we derive a hybrid optimization framework that accelerates training convergence by embedding a least-squares (LS) solver directly into the GD loss function. This formulation enables optimal updates for the linear output layer. Our method is applicable with or without perfectly matched layers (PML), and we provide practical tensor-based implementations for both scenarios. Numerical experiments on benchmark velocity models demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and improved stability compared to conventional PINN training. In particular, our results show that the LS-enhanced method converges rapidly even in cases where standard GD-based training fails. The LS solver operates on a small normal matrix, ensuring minimal computational overhead and making the method scalable for large-scale wavefield simulations.</description>

      <title>Simple and accurate nonlinear pendulum motion for the full range of amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple closed-form formula for the period of a pendulum with finite amplitude is proposed. It reproduces the exact analytical forms both in the small and large amplitude limits, while in the mid-amplitude range maintains average error of 0.06% and maximum error of 0.17%. The accuracy should be sufficient for typical engineering applications. Its unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires trackable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss a finite amplitude pendulum. A simple and formally exact solution of angular displacement for the full range of amplitudes is illustrated.</description>

      <title>Energy Variational Modeling and Numerical Simulation of Open Membranes in Stokes Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lipid bilayer membranes are fundamental biological structures that serve as cellular boundaries, mediating transport, signaling, and maintaining structural integrity. This study introduces a novel mathematical model for open membranes immersed in Stokes flows, accounting for membrane elasticity, line tension at the open edge, and fluid-membrane interactions. The model is derived from an energy functional that incorporates Helfrich bending energy and a line energy associated with the open edge. By balancing dissipation in both the bulk fluid and the membrane surface, following the maximal dissipation principle, we derive the governing equations within an energy variational framework. Assuming axisymmetry and employing a boundary integral reduction, we transform the 3D problem into an effectively 1D problem, for which we develop a finite element-based numerical method to solve the resulting moving boundary problem. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the model and compare the results with existing studies.</description>

      <title>General method for solving nonlinear optical scattering problems using fix point iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new fix point iteration scheme for solving nonlinear electromagnetic scattering problems. The method is based on a spectral formulation of Maxwell's equations called the Bidirectional Pulse Propagation Equations. The scheme can be applied to a wide array of slab-like geometries, and for arbitrary material responses. We derive the scheme and investigated how it performs with respect to convergence and accuracy by applying it to the case of light scattering from a simple slab whose nonlinear material response is a sum a very fast electronic vibrational response, and a much slower molecular vibrational response.</description>

      <title>Practical approaches for crystal structure predictions with inpainting generation and universal interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Crystal Host-Guided Generation (CHGGen), a diffusion-based framework for crystal structure prediction. Unconditional generation with diffusion models demonstrates limited efficacy in identifying symmetric crystals as the unit cell size increases. CHGGen addresses this limitation through conditional generation with the inpainting method, which optimizes a fraction of atomic positions within a predefined and symmetrized host structure. We demonstrate the method on the ZnS-P$_2$S$_5$ and Li-Si chemical systems, where the inpainting method generates a higher fraction of symmetric structures than unconditional generation. The practical significance of CHGGen extends to enabling the structural modification of crystal structures, particularly for systems with partial occupancy, surface absorption and defects. The inpainting method also allows for seamless integration with other generative models, providing a versatile framework for accelerating materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Ultradense Sphere Packings Derived From Disordered Stealthy Hyperuniform Ground States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) packings are an emerging class of exotic amorphous two-phase materials endowed with novel physical properties. Such packings of identical spheres have been created from SHU point patterns via a modified collective-coordinate optimization scheme that includes a soft-core repulsion, besides the standard `stealthy' pair potential. Using the distributions of minimum pair distances and nearest-neighbor distances, we find that when the stealthiness parameter $\chi$ is lower than 0.5, the maximal values of $\phi$, denoted by $\phi_{\max}$, decrease to zero on average as the particle number $N$ increases if there are no soft-core repulsions. By contrast, the inclusion of soft-core repulsions results in very large $\phi_{\max}$ independent of $N$, reaching up to $\phi_{\max}=1.0, 0.86, 0.63$ in the zero-$\chi$ limit and decreasing to $\phi_{\max}=1.0, 0.67, 0.47$ at $\chi=0.45$ for $d=1,2,3$, respectively. We obtain explicit formulas for $\phi_{\max}$ as functions of $\chi$ and $N$ for a given $d$. For $d=2,3$, our soft-core SHU packings for small $\chi$ become configurationally very close to the jammed hard-particle packings created by fast compression algorithms, as measured by the pair statistics. As $\chi$ increases beyond $0.20$, the packings form fewer contacts and linear polymer-like chains. The resulting structure factors $S(k)$ and pair correlation functions $g_2(r)$ reveal that soft-core repulsions significantly alter the short- and intermediate-range correlations in the SHU ground states. We also compute the spectral density $\tilde{\chi}_{_V}(k)$, which can be used to estimate various physical properties (e.g., electromagnetic properties, fluid permeability, and mean survival time) of SHU two-phase dispersions. Our results offer a new route for discovering novel disordered hyperuniform two-phase materials with unprecedentedly high density.</description>

      <title>Learning Smooth and Expressive Interatomic Potentials for Physical Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become increasingly effective at approximating quantum mechanical calculations at a fraction of the computational cost. However, lower errors on held out test sets do not always translate to improved results on downstream physical property prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose testing MLIPs on their practical ability to conserve energy during molecular dynamic simulations. If passed, improved correlations are found between test errors and their performance on physical property prediction tasks. We identify choices which may lead to models failing this test, and use these observations to improve upon highly-expressive models. The resulting model, eSEN, provides state-of-the-art results on a range of physical property prediction tasks, including materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity prediction, and phonon calculations.</description>

      <title>Plane-Wave Decomposition and Randomised Training; a Novel Path to Generalised PINNs for SHM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00249v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a formulation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), based on learning the form of the Fourier decomposition, and a training methodology based on a spread of randomly chosen boundary conditions. By training in this way we produce a PINN that generalises; after training it can be used to correctly predict the solution for an arbitrary set of boundary conditions and interpolate this solution between the samples that spanned the training domain. We demonstrate for a toy system of two coupled oscillators that this gives the PINN formulation genuine predictive capability owing to an effective reduction of the training to evaluation times ratio due to this decoupling of the solution from specific boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning can uncover physical concepts or physical equations when prior knowledge from the other is available. However, these two aspects are often intertwined and cannot be discovered independently. We extend SciNet, which is a neural network architecture that simulates the human physical reasoning process for physics discovery, by proposing a model that combines Variational Autoencoders (VAE) with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). This allows us to simultaneously discover physical concepts and governing equations from simulated experimental data across various physical systems. We apply the model to several examples inspired by the history of physics, including Copernicus' heliocentrism, Newton's law of gravity, Schr\"odinger's wave mechanics, and Pauli's spin-magnetic formulation. The results demonstrate that the correct physical theories can emerge in the neural network.</description>

      <title>Constructing optimal Wannier functions via potential theory: isolated single band for matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rapidly convergent scheme for computing globally optimal Wannier functions of isolated single bands for matrix models in two dimensions. The scheme proceeds first by constructing provably exponentially localized Wannier functions directly from parallel transport (with simple analytically computable corrections) when topological obstructions are absent. We prove that the corresponding Wannier functions are real when the matrix model possesses time-reversal symmetry. When a band has a nonzero Berry curvature, the resulting Wannier function is not optimal, but it is transformed into the global optimum by a single gauge transformation that eliminates the divergence of the Berry connection. Complete analysis of the construction is presented, paving the way for further improvements and generalizations. The performance of the scheme is illustrated with several numerical examples.</description>
