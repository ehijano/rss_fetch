      <title>First-order theory of torsion-free Tarski monsters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop methods to control the first-order theory of groups arising as certain direct limits of torsion-free hyperbolic groups. We apply this to construct simple torsion-free Tarski monsters (non-abelian groups whose non-trivial, proper subgroups are infinite cyclic) with the same positive theory as the free group, answering several questions of Casals-Ruiz, Garreta, and de la Nuez Gonz\'alez. Moreover, these groups may be chosen so that every non-trivial conjugacy-invariant norm is stably bounded. In particular, for every word $w$ that is not silly in the sense of Segal, the $w$-length is unbounded, but the stable $w$-length vanishes. All previously known examples of groups with the same positive theory as the free group admit a non-elementary action on a hyperbolic space, while our examples cannot act on a hyperbolic space with a loxodromic element. Along the way, we solve the one-quantifier Knight conjecture for random quotients of arbitrary torsion-free, non-elementary, hyperbolic groups in the few relator model.</description>

      <title>In Search of Homology for Quasigroups of Bol-Moufang Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate (co)homology theory for quasigroups of Bol-Moufang type based on analysis of their extensions by affine quasigroups of the same type. We use these extensions to define second and third boundary operations, $\partial_2(x,y)$ and $\partial_3(x,y,z)$, respectively. We use these definitions to compute the second homology groups for several examples from the work of Phillips and Vojtechovsky. We speculate about the relation between these homology groups and those obtained from a small category with coefficients in a functor.</description>

      <title>On injective endomorphisms of the semigroup $\boldsymbol{B}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\mathscr{F}^2}$ with the two-element family $\mathscr{F}^2$ of inductive nonempty subsets of $\omega$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe injective endomorphisms of the semigroup $\boldsymbol{B}_{Z\mathbb{}}^{\mathscr{F}^2}$ with the two-element family $\mathscr{F}^2$ of inductive nonempty subsets of $\omega$. In particular we show that every injective endomorphism $\mathfrak{e}$ of $\boldsymbol{B}_{Z\mathbb{}}^{\mathscr{F}^2}$ is presented in the form $\mathfrak{e}=\mathfrak{e}_0\mathfrak{a}$, where $\mathfrak{e}_0$ is an injective $(0,0,[0))$-endomorphism of $\boldsymbol{B}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\mathscr{F}^2}$ and $\mathfrak{a}$ is an automorphism $\mathfrak{a}$ of $\boldsymbol{B}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\mathscr{F}^2}$. Also we describe all injective $(0,0,[0))$-endomorphisms $\mathfrak{e}_0$ of $\boldsymbol{B}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\mathscr{F}^2}$, i.e., such that $(0,0,[0))\mathfrak{e}_0=(0,0,[0))$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically rigid mapping class groups of infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study asymptotically rigid mapping class groups of certain infinite graphs. We determine their finiteness properties and show that these depend on the number of ends of the underlying graph. In a special case where the graph has finitely many ends, we construct an explicit presentation for the so-called pure graph Houghton group and investigate several of its algebraic and geometric properties. Additionally, we show that the graph Houghton groups are not commensurable with other known Houghton-type groups, namely the classical, surface, braided, handlebody, and doubled handlebody Houghton groups, demonstrating that this graph-based construction defines a genuinely new class of groups.</description>

      <title>Preserving self-similarity in free products of semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.12810v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve on earlier results on the closure under free products of the class of automaton semigroups. We consider partial automata and show that the free product of two self-similar semigroups (or automaton semigroups) is self-similar (an automaton semigroup) if there is a homomorphism from one of the base semigroups to the other. The construction used is computable and yields further consequences. One of them is that we can adjoin a free generator to any self-similar semigroup (or automaton semigroup) and preserve the property of self-similarity (or being an automaton semigroup).
  The existence of a homomorphism between two semigroups is a very lax requirement; in particular, it is satisfied if one of the semigroups contains an idempotent. To explore the limits of this requirement, we show that no simple or $0$-simple idempotent-free semigroup is a finitely generated self-similar semigroup (or an automaton semigroup). Furthermore, we give an example of a pair of residually finite semigroups without a homomorphism from one to the other.</description>

      <title>Quadratic maps between non-abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gowers and Hatami initiated the inverse theory for the uniformity norms $U^k$ of matrix-valued functions on non-abelian groups by proving a $1\%$-inverse theorem for the $U^2$-norm and relating it to stability questions for almost representations. In this article, we take a step toward an inverse theory for higher-order uniformity norms of matrix-valued functions on arbitrary groups by examining the $99\%$ regime for the $U^k$-norm on perfect groups of bounded commutator width.
  This analysis prompts a classification of Leibman's quadratic maps between non-abelian groups. Our principal contribution is a complete description of these maps via an explicit universal construction. From this classification we deduce several applications: A full classification of quadratic maps on arbitrary abelian groups; a proof that no nontrivial polynomial maps of degree greater than one exist on perfect groups; stability results for approximate polynomial maps.</description>

      <title>JSJ splittings for all Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that an Artin group splits over infinite cyclic subgroups if and only if its defining graph has a separating vertex, and explicitly construct a JSJ decomposition over infinite cyclic subgroups for all Artin groups. We then use these facts to show that, if two Artin groups are isomorphic, then they have the same set of parabolics supported on "big chunks", that is, maximal subgraphs without separating vertices. We also deduce acylindrical hyperbolicity for the automorphism groups of many Artin groups, partially answering a question of Genevois in the case of Artin groups. As a consequence, we produce new families of Artin groups with the R-infinity property.</description>

      <title>W*-superrigidity for groups with infinite center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct discrete groups $G$ with infinite center that are nevertheless W*-superrigid, meaning that the group von Neumann algebra $L(G)$ fully remembers the group $G$. We obtain these rigidity results both up to isomorphisms and up to virtual isomorphisms of the groups and their von Neumann algebras. Our methods combine rigidity results for the quotient of these groups by their center with rigidity results for their 2-cohomology.</description>

Abstract: Let $S$ and $S'$ be orientable finite-type surfaces of genus $g\geq 4$ and $g'$, respectively. We prove that every multitwist-preserving map between pure mapping class groups $\text{PMap}(S)\to \text{PMap}(S')$ is induced by a multi-embedding. As an application, we classify all homomorphisms $\text{PMap}(S)\to \text{PMap}(S')$ for $g\geq 4$ and $g' \leq 6\cdot 2^{g-4}$.</description>

      <title>From disc patterns in the plane to character varieties of knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an experimental study of groups generated by reflections in planar patterns of tangent circles, we describe some methods for constructing and studying representation spaces of holonomy groups of infinite volume hyperbolic $3$-manifolds that arise from unknotting tunnels of links. We include full descriptions of our computational methods, which were guided by simplicity and generality rather than by being particularly efficient in special cases. This makes them easy for non-experts to understand and implement to produce visualisations that can suggest conjectures and support algebraic calculations in the character variety. Throughout, we have tried to make the exposition clear and understandable for graduate students in geometric topology and related fields.</description>
