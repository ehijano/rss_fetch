      <title>Characterizing the nuclear models informed by PREX and CREX: a view from Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New measurements of the weak charge density distributions of $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb challenge existing nuclear models. In the post-PREX-CREX era, it is unclear if current models can simultaneously describe weak charge distributions along with accurate measurements of binding energy and charge radii. In this letter, we explore the parameter space of relativistic and non-relativistic models to study the differences between the form factors of the electric and weak charge distributions, $\Delta F=F_{ch}-F_{w}$, in $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. We show, for the first time, the parts of the mean-field models that are the most important in determining the relative magnitude of the neutron skin in lead and calcium nuclei. We carefully disentangle the tension between the PREX/CREX constraints and the ability of the RMF and Skyrme models to accurately describe binding energies and charge radii. We find that the nuclear symmetry energy coefficient $S_\mathrm{V}$ and the isovector spin-orbit coefficient $b'_4$ play different roles in determining $\Delta F$ of $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb. Consequently, adjusting $S_\mathrm{V}$ or $b'_4$ shifts predicted $\Delta F$ values toward or away from PREX/CREX measurements. Additionally, $S_\mathrm{V}$ and the slope L are marginally correlated given the constraints of our Bayesian inference, allowing us to infer them separately from PREX and CREX data.</description>

      <title>Formation of transfermium elements in reactions with $^{208}$Pb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the Langevin framework, we investigate the dynamics of the fusion process for production of transfermium elements in reactions of $^{48}$Ca, $^{50}$Ti, $^{54}$Cr, and $^{58}$Fe with $^{208}$Pb. After the reacting nuclei have made contact, the early dynamical stage is dominated by the dissipation of the initial radial kinetic energy, while the subsequent shape evolution is diffusive. The probability for surmounting the inner barrier and forming a compound system is obtained by simulating the evolution as a Metropolis random walk in a five-dimensional potential-energy landscape. Good agreement with the available data is obtained, especially for the maximal formation probability.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum-Resolved Inelastic Electron Scattering for Nuclear Giant Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant resonances (GRs) provide crucial insights into nuclear physics and astrophysics. Exciting GRs using particles like electrons is effective, yet the angular momentum (AM) transfer of electrons, including both intrinsic spin and orbital degrees of freedom in inelastic scattering, has never been studied. Here, we investigate AM transfer in GRs excited by plane-wave and vortex electrons, developing a comprehensive AM-resolved inelastic electron scattering theory. We find that even plane-wave electrons can model-independently extract transition strengths of higher multipolarity by selecting specific AM states of scattered electrons. Additionally, relativistic vortex electrons with orbital angular momentum (OAM) $\pm1$ can be efficiently generated. Vortex electrons can also be used to extract GR transition strength as in the plane-wave case, regardless of the position of nucleus relative to the beam axis. Furthermore, relativistic vortex electrons with larger OAM can be generated for on-axis nuclei due to AM conservation. Our method offers new perspectives for nuclear structure research and paves the way for generating vortex particles.</description>

      <title>High precision measurements of alpha_s at the future EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a projection study for the first moments of the inclusive spin structure function for the proton and neutron from simulated doubly-polarized e+p and e+3He collision data expected from the Electron-Ion collider. For detection and extraction of the neutron spin asymmetries from e+3He collisions, we used the double-tagging method which significantly reduces the uncertainty over the traditional inclusive method. Using the Bjorken sum rule, the projected results allow us to determine that the QCD coupling at the Z-pole alpha_s can be measured with a relative precision of 1.3%. This underscores the significance of the EIC for achieving precision determinations of alpha_s.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic factors of resonance states with the Gamow shell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an investigation of the spectroscopic factor of resonance states in $A =5-8$ nuclei, utilizing the Gamow shell model (GSM). Within the GSM, the configuration mixing is taken into account exactly with the shell model framework, and the continuum coupling is addressed via the complex-energy Berggren ensemble, which treats bound, resonance, and non-resonant continuum single-particle states on an equal footing. As a result, both the configuration mixing and continuum coupling are meticulously considered in the GSM. We first calculate the low-lying states of helium isotopes and isotones with the GSM, and the results are compared with that of \textit{ab initio} no-core shell model (NCSM) calculations. The results indicate that GSM can reproduce the low-lying resonance states more accurately than the no-core shell model. Following this, we delve into the spectroscopic factors of the resonance states as computed through both GSM and NCSM, concurrently conducting systematic calculations of overlap functions pertinent to these resonance states. Finally, the calculated overlap function and spectroscopic factor of $^6$He$(0_1^+)$ $\otimes \nu p_{3/2} \to $ $^7$He$(3/2_1^-)$ with GSM are compared with the results from \textit{ab initio} NCSM, variational Monte Carlo, and Green's function Monte Carlo calculations, as well as avaliable experimental data. The results assert that wave function asymptotes can only be reproduced in GSM, where resonance and continuum coupling are precisely addressed.</description>

      <title>Ab initio valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group calculations for neutron-rich P, Cl, and K isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron-rich P, Cl, and K isotopes, particularly those with neutron numbers around $N=28$, have attracted extensive experimental and theoretical interest. We utilize the \textit{ab initio} valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group approach, based on chiral nucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces, to investigate the exotic properties of these isotopes. Systematic calculations of the low-lying spectra are performed. A key finding is the level inversion between $3/2_1^+$ and $1/2_1^+$ states in odd-$A$ isotopes, attributed to the inversion of $\pi 0d_{3/2}$ and $\pi 1s_{1/2}$ single-particle states.\textit{Ab initio} calculations, which incorporate the three-nucleon forces, correlate closely with existing experimental data. Further calculations of effective proton single-particle energies provide deeper insights into the shell evolution for $Z=14$ and $16$ sub-shells. Our results indicate that the three-body force plays important roles in the shell evolution for $Z=14$ and $16$ sub-shells with neutron numbers ranging from 20 to 28. Additionally, systematic \textit{ab initio} calculations are conducted for the low-lying spectra of odd-odd nuclei. The results align with experimental data and provide new insights for future research into these isotopes, up to and beyond the drip line.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent accreted crust of neutron stars: The role of proton shell effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of accreting neutron stars are widely used to constrain the microphysical properties of superdense matter. A key ingredient in this analysis is the heating associated with nuclear reactions in the outer layers of the neutron star (crust), as well as the equation of state and composition of these layers. As recently shown, the neutron hydrostatic/diffusion (nHD) condition is valid in the inner part of the crust, where some of the neutrons are not bound to the nuclei, and this condition should be properly incorporated into crustal models. Here we construct models of the accreted crust of a neutron star, taking into account the nHD condition and proton shell effects in nuclei. For numerical illustration, we employ the recently proposed compressible liquid drop model, which incorporates shell effects. However, our approach is general and can also be used in future studies relying on more sophisticated nuclear physics models.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Corrections to the CBF Effective Nuclear Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the inclusion of relativistic boost corrections into the CBF effective nuclear Hamiltonian, derived from a realistic model of two- and three-nucleon interactions using the formalism of correlated basis functions and the cluster expansion technique. Different procedures to take into account the effects of boost interactions are compared on the basis of the ability to reproduce the nuclear matter equation of state obtained from accurate many-body calculations. The results of our study show that the repulsive contribution of the boost interaction significantly depends on the underlying model of the non relativistic potential. On the other hand, the dominant relativistic correction turns out to be the corresponding reduction of the strength of repulsive three-nucleon interactions, leading to a significant softening of the equation of state at supranuclear densities.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of the observation of $\eta^{\prime}$ mesic nuclei in the semi-exclusive $^{12}$C($p, dp$) reaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study theoretically the feasibility of the semi-exclusive $^{12}$C($p,dp$)$X$ reaction for the observation of $\eta^\prime$ mesic nuclei using the transport model JAM. The semi-exclusive measurements of the ($p,d$) reaction with protons from $\eta^\prime$ non-mesonic two-body absorption ($\eta^\prime NN \to NN$) are found to be critically important for the observation of the $\eta^\prime$ bound states. The Green's function method is used to calculate the momentum spectrum of forward going deuterons corresponding to the excitation energy spectrum of the $\eta^\prime \otimes {}^{11}$C system in the semi-exclusive measurement. The semi-exclusive measurements are considered to be important in general for the $\eta^\prime$ mesic nucleus formation.</description>

      <title>Modeling inclusive electron-nucleus scattering with Bayesian artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Bayesian protocol based on artificial neural networks that is suitable for modeling inclusive electron-nucleus scattering on a variety of nuclear targets with quantified uncertainties. Unlike previous applications in the field, which directly parameterize the cross sections, our approach employs artificial neural networks to represent the longitudinal and transverse response functions. In contrast to cross sections, which depend on the incoming energy, scattering angle, and energy transfer, the response functions are determined solely by the energy and momentum transfer to the system, allowing the angular component to be treated analytically. We assess the accuracy and predictive power of our framework against the extensive data in the quasielastic inclusive electron-scattering database. Additionally, we present novel extractions of the longitudinal and transverse response functions and compare them with previous experimental analysis and nuclear ab-initio calculations.</description>

      <title>Neutron-star seismology with realistic, finite-temperature nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oscillation spectrum of a neutron star is notably rich and intrinsically dependent on the equation of state of nuclear matter. With recent advancements in gravitational-wave and electromagnetic astronomy, we are nearing the capability to perform neutron-star asteroseismology and probe the complex physics of neutron stars. With this in mind, we explore the implementation of three-parameter finite-temperature matter models in the computation of neutron-star oscillations. We consider in detail the thermodynamics of nuclear matter and show how this information enters the problem. Our realistic treatment takes into account entropy and composition gradients that exist in the nuclear matter, giving rise to buoyant g-mode oscillations. To illustrate the implementation, we determine the oscillation spectrum of a low-temperature neutron star. In addition to the expected compositional and thermal g-modes, we find perturbations sourced by phase transitions in the equation of state. We also examine the thermal evolution of the oscillation spectrum of a neutron star with constant redshifted temperature.</description>

      <title>High-precision measurements of the atomic mass and electron-capture decay $Q$ value of $^{95}$Tc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A direct measurement of the ground-state-to-ground-state electron-capture decay $Q$ value of $^{95}$Tc has been performed utilizing the double Penning trap mass spectrometer JYFLTRAP. The $Q$ value was determined to be 1695.92(13) keV by taking advantage of the high resolving power of the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique to resolve the low-lying isomeric state of $^{95}$Tc (excitation energy of 38.910(40) keV) from the ground state. The mass excess of $^{95}$Tc was measured to be $-$86015.95(18) keV/c$^2$, exhibiting a precision of about 28 times higher and in agreement with the value from the newest Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2020). Combined with the nuclear energy-level data for the decay-daughter $^{95}$Mo, two potential ultra-low $Q$-value transitions are identified for future long-term neutrino-mass determination experiments. The atomic self-consistent many-electron Dirac--Hartree--Fock--Slater method and the nuclear shell model have been used to predict the partial half-lives and energy-release distributions for the two transitions. The dominant correction terms related to those processes are considered, including the exchange and overlap corrections, and the shake-up and shake-off effects. The normalized distribution of the released energy in the electron-capture decay of $^{95}$Tc to excited states of $^{95}$Mo is compared to that of $^{163}$Ho currently being used for electron-neutrino-mass determination.</description>

      <title>Simulating Parton Fragmentation on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton fragmentation functions (FFs) are indispensable for understanding processes of hadron production ubiquitously existing in high-energy collisions, but their first principle determination has never been realized due to the insurmountable difficulties in encoding their operator definition using traditional lattice methodology. We propose a framework that makes a first step for evaluating FFs utilizing quantum computing methodology. The key element is to construct a semi-inclusive hadron operator for filtering out hadrons of desired types in a collection of particles encoded in the quantum state. We illustrate the framework by elaborating on the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with numeral simulations. Remarkably, We show that the semi-inclusive hadron operator can be constructed efficiently with a variational quantum algorithm. Moreover, we develop error mitigation techniques tailed for accurately calculating the FFs in the presence of quantum noises. Our work opens a new avenue for investigating QCD hadronization on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Long Range Azimuthal Correlation, Entanglement and Bell Inequality Violation by Spinning Gluons at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the recently developed concept of the nucleon energy-energy correlator (NEEC) for the gluon sector to investigate the long-range azimuthal angular correlations in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The spinning gluon in these collisions will introduce a significant nonzero $\cos(2\phi)$ asymmetries in both Higgs Boson and top quark pair productions. The genesis of the $\cos(2\phi)$ correlation lies in the intricate quantum entanglement. Owing to the substantial $\cos(2\phi)$ effect, the NEEC observable in Higgs Boson and $t{\bar t}$ production emerges as a pivotal avenue for delving into quantum entanglement and scrutinizing the Bell inequality at high-energy colliders.</description>

Abstract: The hypothesis of the relation between the observed alignment of spots in the X-ray films in cosmic ray emulsion experiments and the selection procedure of the highest-energy particles itself together with the transverse momentum conservation is tested in the framework of the HYDJET++ model. It is shown that the high degree of alignment can appear at the reasonable values of transverse momentum disbalance of selected most energetic particles.</description>

      <title>Magnetic dipole transition in $^{48}$Ca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic dipole transition strength $B(M1)$ of $^{48}$Ca is dominated by a single resonant state at an excitation energy of 10.23 MeV. Experiments disagree about $B(M1)$ and this impacts our understanding of spin flips in nuclei. We performed ab initio computations based on chiral effective field theory and found that $B(M1:0^+\rightarrow1^+)$ lies in the range from $7.0$ to $10.2~\mu_N^2$. This is consistent with a $(\gamma,n)$ experiment but larger than results from $(e,e^\prime)$ and $(p,p')$ scattering. Two-body currents yield no quenching of the $B(M1)$ strength and continuum effects reduce it by about 10%. For a validation of our approach, we computed magnetic moments in $^{47,49}$Ca and performed benchmark calculations in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>Double spin correlations in the reaction dd-&gt;pnpn and in the pn-elastic scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An unexpectedly large double spin correlation with a sharp dependence on energy, found in elastic proton-proton scattering at large angles in the c.m.s. energy range $\sqrt{s_{pp}}= 3 \div 5.5$ GeV, may be associated with the formation of exotic eight-quark resonances at the thresholds of the strangeness and charm production. For a deeper understanding of the dynamics of this process it is important to measure double spin correlation in elastic $pn$ scattering in the same kinematics. The possibility of obtaining this data from the reaction $d d\to pnp$ with two polarized deuterons on NICA SPD is considered in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars contain neutron-rich matter with around 5% protons at nuclear saturation density. In this Letter, we consider equilibrium between bulk phases of matter based on asymmetric nuclear matter calculations using chiral effective field theory interactions rather than, as has been done in the past, by interpolation between the properties of symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter. Neutron drip (coexistence of nuclear matter with pure neutrons) is well established, but from earlier work it is unclear whether proton drip (equilibrium between two phases, both of which contain protons and neutrons) is possible. We find that proton drip is a robust prediction of any physically reasonable equation of state, but that it occurs over a limited region of densities and proton fractions. An analytical model based on expanding the energy in powers of the proton density, rather than the neutron excess, is able to account for these features of the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Nuclear mass table in deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum, II: Even-$Z$ nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02935v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass table in the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) with the PC-PK1 density functional has been established for even-$Z$ nuclei with $8\le Z\le120$, extended from the previous work for even-even nuclei [Zhang $\it{et.~al.}$ (DRHBc Mass Table Collaboration), At. Data Nucl. Data Tables 144, 101488 (2022)]. The calculated binding energies, two-nucleon and one-neutron separation energies, root-mean-square (rms) radii of neutron, proton, matter, and charge distributions, quadrupole deformations, and neutron and proton Fermi surfaces are tabulated and compared with available experimental data. A total of 4829 even-$Z$ nuclei are predicted to be bound, with an rms deviation of 1.477 MeV from the 1244 mass data. Good agreement with the available experimental odd-even mass differences, $\alpha$ decay energies, and charge radii is also achieved. The description accuracy for nuclear masses and nucleon separation energies as well as the prediction for drip lines is compared with the results obtained from other relativistic and nonrelativistic density functional. The comparison shows that the DRHBc theory with PC-PK1 provides an excellent microscopic description for the masses of even-$Z$ nuclei. The systematics of the nucleon separation energies, odd-even mass differences, pairing energies, two-nucleon gaps, $\alpha$ decay energies, rms radii, quadrupole deformations, potential energy curves, neutron density distributions, and neutron mean-field potentials are discussed.</description>

      <title>Consistent inclusion of fluctuations in first-order causal and stable relativistic hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct, for the first time, a Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha-Kovtun (BDNK) theory for linear stochastic fluctuations, which is proved to be mathematically consistent, causal, and covariantly stable. The Martin-Siggia-Rose action is shown to be bilocal in most cases, and the noise is not white. The presence of nonhydrodynamic modes induces long-range correlations in the primary fluid variables (temperature, chemical potential, and flow velocity). However, correlators of conserved densities remain localized in space, and coincide with those calculated within fluctuating Isreal-Stewart theory. We show that, in some cases, there is a nonlocal change of variables that maps the Israel-Stewart action into the BDNK action.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matrix elements of neutrinoless double-beta decay in covariant density functional theory with different mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay in candidate nuclei play a crucial role in interpreting results from current experiments and in designing future ones. Accurate NME values serve as important nuclear inputs for constraining parameters in new physics, such as neutrino mass and the Wilson coefficients of lepton-number-violating (LNV) operators. In this study, we present a comprehensive calculation of NMEs for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{100}$Mo, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe, using nuclear wave functions obtained from multi-reference covariant density functional theory (MR-CDFT). We employ three types of transition potentials at the leading order in chiral effective field theory. Our results, along with recent data, are utilized to constrain the coefficients of LNV operators. The results demonstrate that the combined NMEs based on the Feynman diagrams at the hadronic scale for the nonstandard mechanisms leads to the uncertainty by different nuclear models comparable to that for the standard mechanism. The use of NMEs from various nuclear models does not dramatically change the parameter space intervals for the coefficients, although MR-CDFT yields the most stringent constraint. Furthermore, our NMEs can also be used to perform a more comprehensive analysis with multiple isotopes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision cosmic-ray data from ongoing and recent past experiments (Voyager, ACE-CRIS, PAMELA, ATIC, CREAM, NUCLEON, AMS-02, CALET, DAMPE) are being released in the tens of MeV/n to multi-TeV/n energy range. Astrophysical and dark matter interpretations of these data are limited by the precision of nuclear production cross-sections. In Paper I, PRC 98, 034611 (2018), we set up a procedure to rank nuclear reactions whose desired measurements will enable us to fully exploit currently available data on CR Li to N ($Z=3-7$) species. Here we extend these rankings to O up to Si nuclei ($Z=8-14$), also updating our results on the LiBeB species. We also highlight how comprehensive new high precision nuclear data, that could e.g. be obtained at the SPS at CERN, would be a game-changer for the determination of key astrophysical quantities (diffusion coefficient, halo size of the Galaxy) and indirect searches for dark matter signatures.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Level Density and $\gamma$-ray Strength Function of $^{67}\mathrm{Ni}$ and the impact on the i-process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proton-$\gamma$ coincidences from $(\mathrm{d},\mathrm{p})$ reactions between a $^{66}\mathrm{Ni}$ beam and a deuterated polyethylene target have been analyzed with the inverse-Oslo method to find the nuclear level density (NLD) and $\gamma$-ray strength function ($\gamma$SF) of $^{67}\mathrm{Ni}$. The $^{66}\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{n},\gamma)$ capture cross section has been calculated using the Hauser-Feshbach model in TALYS using the measured NLD and $\gamma$SF as constraints. The results confirm that the $^{66}\mathrm{Ni}(\mathrm{n},\gamma)$ reaction acts as a bottleneck when relying on one-zone nucleosynthesis calculations. However, the impact of this reaction is strongly damped in multi-zone low-metallicity AGB stellar models experiencing i-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of heavy quarks within the hot QCD medium have been revisited, considering the influence of anomalous diffusion. This study has been conducted using the framework of the fractional Langevin equation involving the Caputo fractional derivative. We introduce a numerical scheme for the fractional Langevin equation and demonstrate that the mean square displacement of the particle exhibits anomalous diffusion, deviating from a linear relationship with time. Our analysis calculates various entities, such as mean squared momentum, momentum spread, and the nuclear suppression factor, $R_{AA}$. Notably, our findings indicate that superdiffusion strongly suppresses the $R_{AA}$ compared to normal diffusion in the hot QCD medium. The possible impacts on other parameters are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Neural Simulation-Based Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State directly from Telescope Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a unique opportunity to study strongly interacting matter under extreme density conditions. The intricacies of matter inside neutron stars and their equation of state are not directly visible, but determine bulk properties, such as mass and radius, which affect the star's thermal X-ray emissions. However, the telescope spectra of these emissions are also affected by the stellar distance, hydrogen column, and effective surface temperature, which are not always well-constrained. Uncertainties on these nuisance parameters must be accounted for when making a robust estimation of the equation of state. In this study, we develop a novel methodology that, for the first time, can infer the full posterior distribution of both the equation of state and nuisance parameters directly from telescope observations. This method relies on the use of neural likelihood estimation, in which normalizing flows use samples of simulated telescope data to learn the likelihood of the neutron star spectra as a function of these parameters, coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods to efficiently sample from the corresponding posterior distribution. Our approach surpasses the accuracy of previous methods, improves the interpretability of the results by providing access to the full posterior distribution, and naturally scales to a growing number of neutron star observations expected in the coming years.</description>

      <title>New method for the solution of the two-body Dirac equation for the positronium bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new theoretical method is developed to solve the two-body bound-state Dirac equation for positronium. Only Coulomb potential was included in the Dirac Hamiltonian. It is shown that the two-body Dirac Hamiltonian can be written in the Hermitian matrix form of the 4$\times$4 size and diagonalized in the momentum-state representation. Numerical results for the energy spectrum of the para- and ortho-positronium ground states performed within the variational method using the harmonic oscillator basis functions are in good agreement with a high-precision finite-element method of T.C. Scott et al. After the Fourier transformation into the coordinate-state representation the bound state wave functions of the para-Ps and ortho-Ps do not contain any singularity at the origin in contrast to the method mentioned above. The weights of the large-small and small-large components of the ground state wave functions are estimated to be of order 10$^{-6}$, while the weight of the small-small component is of order 10$^{-12}$.</description>

      <title>Light-quark mass dependence of the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the light-quark mass dependence of the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance at leading order in a renormalizable framework of covariant chiral effective field theory. The meson-baryon scattering amplitudes, which are obtained by solving the scattering equation within time-ordered perturbation theory, follow the quark mass trajectory of the Coordinated Lattice Simulations consortium. At $M_\pi\approx 200$ MeV and $M_K\approx 487$ MeV, our parameter-free prediction of $\Lambda(1405)$ poles is consistent with the recent lattice results of BaSc Collaboration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 051901 (2024)]. Varying the pion mass from $135$ MeV to $400$ MeV, we present the evolution of double-pole positions of $\Lambda(1405)$: the higher pole remains a resonance around the $\bar{K}N$ threshold; whereas the lower pole undergoes a transition from resonance to a virtual state, and ultimately to a bound state of the $\pi\Sigma$ system, which could be verified by the forthcoming lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Inhomogenuous instabilities at large chemical potential in a rainbow-ladder QCD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we continue our efforts to study the existence of a phase with an inhomogeneous, i.e., spatially varying, chiral condensate in QCD. To this end we employ a previously established method of stability analysis of the two-particle irreducible effective action in a truncation that corresponds to a rainbow-ladder approximation of the quark-gluon interaction of QCD. If the analysis is restricted to homogeneous phases, the phase diagram features a first-order chiral transition in the lower-temperature regime. Performing the stability analysis along the lower-chemical-potential border of the corresponding spinodal region, we find that below a certain temperature the homogeneous chirally symmetric solution is unstable against inhomogeneous condensation. We argue that this instability may persist to chemical potentials above the homogeneous first-order phase boundary, in which case it signals the existence of an inhomogeneous ground state. Our methodology is also applicable for more sophisticated truncations of the QCD effective action.</description>
