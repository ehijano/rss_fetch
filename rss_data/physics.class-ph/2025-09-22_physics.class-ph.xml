      <title>Non-Equatorial Uniform-Stress Space Elevators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-equatorial space elevators are interesting as they give more freedom for anchor location, avoid the highly occupied geosynchronous orbit and the areas of highest radiation in the Van Allen belts. We review the static equation for a uniform-stress tether, and use it to study the tapering of a uniform-stress tether in a general potential field. We then focus on a rotating coulomb potential and study the range of latitudes that are allowed for a uniform-stress space elevator. Finally, we look at a few practical issues that are raised by non-equatorial space elevators.</description>

      <title>Motion in Aubry's galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a test particle in the field of a model galaxy proposed by Serge Aubry is studied by a combination of theory and numerical computation. Regimes of near-integrable behaviour and almost perfect chaos are found. A proposed explanation for the latter is sketched. Thoughts are presented on the implications of the analysis for galaxies.</description>

      <title>myPhysmatics: Connected Mathematical Models in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book is devoted to an informal discussion of patterns constructed for treating physical problems. Such patterns, when sufficiently formalized, are usually referred as "models", and tents to be applied not only in physics, but conquer the fields traditionally occupied by other disciplines generally considered to be different from physics. The author calls this unification of seemingly disjoint results a "physmatical effect" - pointing to the fact that multitudes of fine - grained physics-based mathematical models become inextricably linked and networked. Mathematics serves as a key code gluing together isolated physical models viewed as nodes of this network.</description>

      <title>Transition Frequencies and Dynamic Amplification of Buried Lifelines: A Semi-Analytical Timoshenko Beam on Winkler Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground lifelines, such as pipelines and tunnels, are susceptible to ground vibrations from seismic events, traffic, and other dynamic sources. Accurate prediction of their response is essential for ensuring structural safety and operability. This study introduces a semi-analytical model for transverse vibration analysis of buried lifelines, formulated using the Timoshenko beam theory on elastic foundation. The closed-form analytical solutions revealed that the vibration spectrum comprises four parts, separated by three transition frequencies. At each transition, the oscillatory characteristics of the modes change as a function of the system properties, leading to marked variations in dynamic amplification. The model's validity is confirmed through case studies of buried steel pipelines of varying lengths and operating conditions, showing excellent agreement with finite element simulations. A subsequent parametric study quantifies the influence of key factors - including soil stiffness and system length - on dynamic performance. The proposed method provides a computationally efficient and physically transparent framework for capturing complex vibration phenomena beyond simplified travelling-wave approaches, offering valuable guidance for the design and resilience assessment of underground lifeline systems subjected to various dynamic loads.</description>

      <title>Superellipsoid modeling of wire-laser additive manufacturing defects measured by digital image correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wire-laser additive manufacturing (WLAM), producing parts with multiple entities requires optimizing both additive and subtractive processes. This involves adjusting positions and integrating machining operations. Geometric defects that occur during the components' deposition can affect subsequent entity production, making real-time measurement crucial. A contactless measuring system is essential to assess geometric deviations without complex post-processing. A comprehensive image stereocorrelation approach addresses this challenge. The produced geometry often has unaccounted features, such as rounded edges and corners. Superellipsoids serve as a versatile modeling tool for representing common geometries in WLAM and assessing dimensional and shape defects. Defined by three scale and two shape parameters, superellipsoids are introduced generally. This modeling tool is then combined with a global image correlation problem. The parameters defining this geometry are identified by minimizing the gray level difference between two images of a part. This approach is demonstrated in a case study, highlighting deviations in WLAM with a parameterized surface and paving the way for geometry updates in computer-aided manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Boiling flow visualization experiment scaled to divertor cooling conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dedicated experiment FEDORA (Fusion Experiment for Divertor Optimization Research Applications) has been constructed to visualize flow boiling at scaled fusion divertor conditions. Its main purpose is to obtain the information on local boiling parameters, needed for the development of mechanistic boiling models in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. Current boiling models, although grounded on realistic physical principles, still rely heavily on empirical correlations, particularly for boiling parameters such as nucleation site density, bubble departure diameter, and bubble departure frequency. Due to the harsh operating conditions in the water-cooled divertor plasma-facing components (high heat fluxes over 10 MW/m 2 , mean flow velocity of about 9 m/s), visualization of boiling in realistic cooling channels is not feasible. The proposed experiment addresses this challenge by employing a surrogate coolant, characterized by lower latent heat and saturation temperature. By analyzing key dimensionless numbers, the aim is to replicate boiling conditions to be similar to those in coolant channels of upcoming divertor designs. Distinctive features of the proposed experimental setup include visually transparent boiling channel, infra-red transparent window and a thin electrically heated foil. This setup allows simultaneous high-speed and high-resolution recording of boiling phenomena in the flow and measurement of temperature distribution on the heated surface. In this work, the design, similarity analysis and the first measurement results are presented, proving the concept of the visualization approach to understand the boiling heat transfer in divertor cooling channels.</description>

      <title>On the limitations of CFD modelling of flow boiling at high flow velocities and high heat fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to predict flow boiling at high heat flux and high flow velocity conditions has been investigated. High heat fluxes of about 10 MW/m 2 and high flow velocities of about 10 m/s typically appear in water cooling channels of divertor target elements in fusion reactors. In particular, the heat flux partitioning model used in the two-fluid CFD formulation was studied. CFD simulations of flow boiling in realistic divertor target cooling channels were performed and compared with conservative single-phase simulations. The predictive capability of CFD models for boiling was evaluated using experimental data, covering a wide range of flow velocities and heat fluxes. Existing CFD models correctly predicted void fraction and wall temperature at low flow velocities, but showed physically irrelevant results at higher velocities (above 3 m/s) leading to wall temperature overestimation. The study identified the wall heat flux partitioning model as the main contributor to the mispredictions and thoroughly discussed the main modelling shortcomings. By analysing the impact of operating conditions, some key boiling parameters, and state-of-the-art heat flux partitioning models, improvements of the model parameters are proposed. The simulations and model analyses are performed within the framework of the ANSYS CFX code and the results are compared with flow boiling experiments in uniformly and top-heated flow channels.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit for the for the Vlasov-Poisson system in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in two dimensions with Coulomb interaction force of the form $f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^2}$ and $N$-dependent cut-off at $|q|&gt;N^{-2}$. In particular, for typical initial data, we show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a classical anisotropic oscillator and the Foucault pendulum as examples illustrating non-conservation of action variables in integrable classical mechanical systems with adiabatically slow evolution. We also emphasize the importance of the mass parameter of a harmonic oscillator, alongside its frequency, in explicitly time-dependent situations.</description>
