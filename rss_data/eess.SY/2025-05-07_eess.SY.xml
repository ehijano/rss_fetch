      <title>Scalable 49-Channel Neural Recorder with an Event-Driven Ramp ADC and PCA Compression in 28 nm CMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural interfaces advance neuroscience research and therapeutic innovations by accurately measuring neuronal activity. However, recording raw data from numerous neurons results in substantial amount of data and poses challenges for wireless transmission. While conventional neural recorders consume energy to digitize and process the full neural signal, only a fraction of this data carries essential spiking information. Leveraging on this signal sparsity, this paper introduces a neural recording integrated circuit in TSMC 28nm CMOS. It features an event-driven ramp analog-to-digital converter, and a spike compression module based on principal component analysis. The circuit consists of 49 channels, each occupying an on-chip area of 50 $\times$ 60 $\mu$m$^2$. The circuit measures 1370 $\times$ 1370 $\mu$m$^2$ and consumes 534 $\mu$W. Compression testing on a synthetic dataset demonstrated an 8.8-fold reduction compared to raw spikes and a 328-fold reduction relative to the raw signal. This compression approach maintained a spike sorting accuracy of 74.9%, compared to the 79.5% accuracy obtained with the raw signal. The paper details the architecture and performance outcomes of the neural recording circuit and its compression module.</description>

      <title>Impact of Grid-Forming Inverters on Protective Relays: A Perspective for Current Limiting Control Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) inverters can significantly alter the fault characteristics of power systems, which challenges the proper function of protective relays. This paper gives a holistic analysis of the interaction between GFM inverter-based resources (IBRs) and the supervising elements in protective relays, including directional and phase selection elements. It is revealed that the current limiting control (CLC) that is based on the current reference saturation method, adversely affects the performance of supervising elements that rely on the negative-sequence quantities. In contrast, adopting highly inductive virtual impedance in the CLC enables a reliable operation of such elements. This finding provides insights into the design of CLC for GFM IBRs from a protection perspective. It is further found that even with a highly inductive virtual impedance, the altered virtual impedance dynamics introduced by the CLC can still lead to malfunctions of the incremental quantity-based supervising elements. These theoretical findings are corroborated by simulations and controller hardware-in-the-loop (CHIL) tests.</description>

      <title>Self-Calibrating Position Measurements: Applied to Imperfect Hall Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear Hall sensors are a cost-effective alternative to optical encoders for measuring the rotor positions of actuators, with the main challenge being that they exhibit position-dependent inaccuracies resulting from manufacturing tolerances. This paper develops a data-driven calibration procedure for linear analog Hall sensors that enables accurate online estimates of the rotor angle without requiring expensive external encoders. The approach combines closed-loop data collection with nonlinear identification to obtain an accurate model of the sensor inaccuracies, which is subsequently used for online compensation. Simulation results show that when the flux density model structure is known, measurement errors are reduced to the sensor noise floor, and experiments on an industrial setup demonstrate a factor of 2.6 reduction in the root-mean-square measurement error. These results confirm that Hall sensor inaccuracies can be calibrated even when no external encoder is available, improving their practical applicability.</description>

      <title>NN-Based Joint Mitigation of IQ Imbalance and PA Nonlinearity With Multiple States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint mitigation of IQ imbalance and PA nonlinearity is important for improving the performance of radio frequency (RF) transmitters. In this paper, we propose a new neural network (NN) model, which can be used for joint digital pre-distortion (DPD) of non-ideal IQ modulators and PAs in a transmitter with multiple operating states. The model is based on the methodology of multi-task learning (MTL). In this model, the hidden layers of the main NN are shared by all signal states, and the output layer's weights and biases are dynamically generated by another NN. The experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively perform joint DPD for IQ-PA systems, and it achieves better overall performance within multiple signal states than the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics on Signed Graphs and Graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we make use of graphon theory to study opinion dynamics on large undirected networks. The opinion dynamics models that we take into consideration allow for negative interactions between the individuals, whose opinions can thus grow apart. We consider both the repelling and the opposing models of negative interactions, which have been studied in the literature. We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on signed graphons and we show that their initial value problem solutions exist and are unique. We then show that, in a suitable sense, the graphon dynamics is a good approximation of the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon (W-random graphs), for which we provide a new convergence result under very general assumptions.</description>

      <title>Integrated equilibrium model for electrified logistics and power systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an integrated equilibrium model to characterize the complex interactions between electrified logistics systems and electric power delivery systems. The model consists of two major players: an electrified logistics operator (ELO) and a power system operator (PSO). The ELO aims to maximize its profit by strategically scheduling and routing its electric delivery vehicles (e-trucks) for deliveries and charging, in response to the locational marginal price (LMP) set by the PSO. The routing, delivery, and charging behaviors of e-trucks are modeled by a perturbed utility Markov decision process (PU-MDP) while their collective operations are optimized to achieve the ELO's objective by designing rewards in the PU-MDP. On the other hand, PSO optimizes the energy price by considering both the spatiotemporal e-truck charging demand and the base electricity load. The equilibrium of the integrated system is formulated as a fixed point, proved to exist under mild assumptions, and solved for a case study on the Hawaii network via Anderson's fixed-point acceleration algorithm. Along with these numerical results, this paper provides both theoretical insights and practical guidelines to achieve sustainable and efficient operations in modern electrified logistics and power systems.</description>

      <title>Consensus Seminorms and their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consensus is a well-studied problem in distributed sensing, computation and control, yet deriving useful and easily computable bounds on the rate of convergence to consensus remains a challenge. We study the applications of seminorms for this goal. We revisit a previously suggested family of seminorms and correct an error made in their original presentation where it was claimed that the a certain seminorm is equal to the well-known coefficient of ergodicity. We then propose a wider family of seminorms which guarantee convergence at an exponential rate of infinite products of matrices which generalizes known results on stochastic matrices to the class of matrices whose row sums are all equal one. Finally, we show that such seminorms cannot be used to bound the rate of convergence of classes larger than the well-known class of scrambling matrices, and pose several open questions for future research.</description>

      <title>Towards Cognitive Collaborative Robots: Semantic-Level Integration and Explainable Control for Human-Centric Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a preprint of a review article that has not yet undergone peer review. The content is intended for early dissemination and academic discussion. The final version may differ upon formal publication. As the Fourth Industrial Revolution reshapes industrial paradigms, human-robot collaboration (HRC) has transitioned from a desirable capability to an operational necessity. In response, collaborative robots (Cobots) are evolving beyond repetitive tasks toward adaptive, semantically informed interaction with humans and environments. This paper surveys five foundational pillars enabling this transformation: semantic-level perception, cognitive action planning, explainable learning and control, safety-aware motion design, and multimodal human intention recognition. We examine the role of semantic mapping in transforming spatial data into meaningful context, and explore cognitive planning frameworks that leverage this context for goal-driven decision-making. Additionally, we analyze explainable reinforcement learning methods, including policy distillation and attention mechanisms, which enhance interpretability and trust. Safety is addressed through force-adaptive control and risk-aware trajectory planning, while seamless human interaction is supported via gaze and gesture-based intent recognition. Despite these advancements, challenges such as perception-action disjunction, real-time explainability limitations, and incomplete human trust persist. To address these, we propose a unified Cognitive Synergy Architecture, integrating all modules into a cohesive framework for truly human-centric cobot collaboration.</description>

      <title>Bridging Model Predictive Control and Deep Learning for Scalable Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a widely used method for ensuring the safety of robotic systems. Traditional approaches compute reachable sets by numerically solving an HJ Partial Differential Equation (PDE) over a grid, which is computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. Recent learning-based methods have sought to address this challenge by approximating reachability solutions using neural networks trained with PDE residual error. However, these approaches often suffer from unstable training dynamics and suboptimal solutions due to the weak learning signal provided by the residual loss. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages model predictive control (MPC) techniques to guide and accelerate the reachability learning process. Observing that HJ reachability is inherently rooted in optimal control, we utilize MPC to generate approximate reachability solutions at key collocation points, which are then used to tactically guide the neural network training by ensuring compliance with these approximations. Moreover, we iteratively refine the MPC generated solutions using the learned reachability solution, mitigating convergence to local optima. Case studies on a 2D vertical drone, a 13D quadrotor, a 7D F1Tenth car, and a 40D publisher-subscriber system demonstrate that bridging MPC with deep learning yields significant improvements in the robustness and accuracy of reachable sets, as well as corresponding safety assurances, compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Contact-Aware Safety in Soft Robots Using High-Order Control Barrier and Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots operating alongside people, particularly in sensitive scenarios such as aiding the elderly with daily tasks or collaborating with workers in manufacturing, must guarantee safety and cultivate user trust. Continuum soft manipulators promise safety through material compliance, but as designs evolve for greater precision, payload capacity, and speed, and increasingly incorporate rigid elements, their injury risk resurfaces. In this letter, we introduce a comprehensive High-Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) + High-Order Control Lyapunov Function (HOCLF) framework that enforces strict contact force limits across the entire soft-robot body during environmental interactions. Our approach combines a differentiable Piecewise Cosserat-Segment (PCS) dynamics model with a convex-polygon distance approximation metric, named Differentiable Conservative Separating Axis Theorem (DCSAT), based on the soft robot geometry to enable real-time, whole-body collision detection, resolution, and enforcement of the safety constraints. By embedding HOCBFs into our optimization routine, we guarantee safety and actively regulate environmental coupling, allowing, for instance, safe object manipulation under HOCLF-driven motion objectives. Extensive planar simulations demonstrate that our method maintains safety-bounded contacts while achieving precise shape and task-space regulation. This work thus lays a foundation for the deployment of soft robots in human-centric environments with provable safety and performance.</description>

      <title>UX-aware Rate Allocation for Real-Time Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Immersive communications is a key use case for 6G where applications require reliable latency-bound media traffic at a certain data rate to deliver an acceptable User Experience (UX) or Quality-of-Experience (QoE). The Quality-of-Service (QoS) framework of current cellular systems (4G and 5G) and prevalent network congestion control algorithms for latency-bound traffic like L4S typically target network-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as data rates and latencies. Network capacity is based on the number of users that attain these KPIs. However, the UX of an immersive application for a given data rate and latency is not the same across users, since it depends on other factors such as the complexity of the media being transmitted and the encoder format. This implies that guarantees on network KPIs do not necessarily translate to guarantees on the UX.
  In this paper, we propose a framework in which the communication network can provide guarantees on the UX. The framework requires application servers to share real-time information on UX dependency on data rate to the network, which in turn, uses this information to maximize a UX-based network utility function. Our framework is motivated by the recent industry trends of increasing application awareness at the network, and pushing application servers towards the edge, allowing for tighter coordination between the servers and the 6G system. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework substantially improves the UX capacity of the network, which is the number of users above a certain UX threshold, compared to conventional rate control algorithms.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient RSMA-Based LEO Satellite Communications Assisted by UAV-Mounted BD-Active RIS: A DRL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an advanced non-terrestrial communication architecture that integrates Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) with a Beyond-Diagonal Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (BD-ARIS) mounted on a UAV under the coverage of a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. The BD-ARIS adopts a group-connected structure to enhance signal amplification and adaptability, while RSMA enables efficient multi-user access by dividing messages into common and private components. The system jointly optimizes satellite beamforming, UAV positioning, power allocation, and rate-splitting ratios to maximize the overall energy efficiency (EE). To solve the resulting non-convex and high-dimensional problem, we employ three state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms: Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3), and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). Moreover, realistic models for the power consumption of both the UAV and the BD-ARIS are considered. Simulation results reveal that TRPO consistently achieves the best performance in terms of EE and sum rate, especially under high transmit powers and challenging deployment scenarios. TD3 converges faster and performs competitively in moderate settings, while A3C suffers from instability due to its high variance. Additionally, the robustness of each algorithm under channel state information (CSI) uncertainty is evaluated, confirming TRPO resilience to imperfect observations. Overall, the proposed RSMA-BD-ARIS framework significantly outperforms conventional RIS-assisted designs and provides a scalable, energy-efficient solution for 6G and massive IoT applications in non-terrestrial networks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Task Performance: Human Experience in Human-Robot Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human interaction experience plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of human-machine collaboration, especially as interactions in future systems progress towards tighter physical and functional integration. While automation design has been shown to impact task performance, its influence on human experi- ence metrics such as flow, sense of agency (SoA), and embodiment remains underexplored. This study investigates how variations in automation design affect these psychological experience mea- sures and examines correlations between subjective experience and physiological indicators. A user study was conducted in a simulated wood workshop, where participants collaborated with a lightweight robot under four automation levels. The results of the study indicate that medium automation levels enhance flow, SoA and embodiment, striking a balance between support and user autonomy. In contrast, higher automation, despite optimizing task performance, diminishes perceived flow and agency. Furthermore, we observed that grip force might be considered as a real-time proxy of SoA, while correlations with heart rate variability were inconclusive. The findings underscore the necessity for automation strategies that integrate human- centric metrics, aiming to optimize both performance and user experience in collaborative robotic systems</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-based Cooperative Autonomous Driving in Smart Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsignalized intersections pose significant safety and efficiency challenges due to complex traffic flows. This paper proposes a novel roadside unit (RSU)-centric cooperative driving system leveraging global perception and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. The core of the system is an RSU-based decision-making module using a two-stage hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework. At first, policies are pre-trained offline using conservative Q-learning (CQL) combined with behavior cloning (BC) on collected dataset. Subsequently, these policies are fine-tuned in the simulation using multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO), aligned with a self-attention mechanism to effectively solve inter-agent dependencies. RSUs perform real-time inference based on the trained models to realize vehicle control via V2I communications. Extensive experiments in CARLA environment demonstrate high effectiveness of the proposed system, by: \textit{(i)} achieving failure rates below 0.03\% in coordinating three connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) through complex intersection scenarios, significantly outperforming the traditional Autoware control method, and \textit{(ii)} exhibiting strong robustness across varying numbers of controlled agents and shows promising generalization capabilities on other maps.</description>

      <title>Consensus-Aware AV Behavior: Trade-offs Between Safety, Interaction, and Performance in Mixed Urban Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transportation systems have long been shaped by complexity and heterogeneity, driven by the interdependency of agent actions and traffic outcomes. The deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) in such systems introduces a new challenge: achieving consensus across safety, interaction quality, and traffic performance. In this work, we position consensus as a fundamental property of the traffic system and aim to quantify it. We use high-resolution trajectory data from the Third Generation Simulation (TGSIM) dataset to empirically analyze AV and human-driven vehicle (HDV) behavior at a signalized urban intersection and around vulnerable road users (VRUs). Key metrics, including Time-to-Collision (TTC), Post-Encroachment Time (PET), deceleration patterns, headways, and string stability, are evaluated across the three performance dimensions. Results show that full consensus across safety, interaction, and performance is rare, with only 1.63% of AV-VRU interaction frames meeting all three conditions. These findings highlight the need for AV models that explicitly balance multi-dimensional performance in mixed-traffic environments. Full reproducibility is supported via our open-source codebase on https://github.com/wissamkontar/Consensus-AV-Analysis.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Network Flow Optimization for Task Scheduling in PTZ Camera Surveillance Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for optimizing the scheduling and control of Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) cameras in dynamic surveillance environments. The proposed method integrates Kalman filters for motion prediction with a dynamic network flow model to enhance real-time video capture efficiency. By assigning Kalman filters to tracked objects, the system predicts future locations, enabling precise scheduling of camera tasks. This prediction-driven approach is formulated as a network flow optimization, ensuring scalability and adaptability to various surveillance scenarios. To further reduce redundant monitoring, we also incorporate group-tracking nodes, allowing multiple objects to be captured within a single camera focus when appropriate. In addition, a value-based system is introduced to prioritize camera actions, focusing on the timely capture of critical events. By adjusting the decay rates of these values over time, the system ensures prompt responses to tasks with imminent deadlines. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this approach improves coverage, reduces average wait times, and minimizes missed events compared to traditional master-slave camera systems. Overall, our method significantly enhances the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of surveillance systems, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.</description>

      <title>Introducing Modelling, Analysis and Control of Three-Phase Electrical Systems Using Geometric Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art techniques for modeling, analysis and control of three-phase electrical systems belong to the real-valued multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) domain, or to the complex-valued nonlinear single-input/single-output (SISO) domain. In order to complement both domains while simplifying complexity and offering new analysis and design perspectives, this paper introduces the application of geometric algebra (GA) principles to the modeling, analysis and control of three-phase electrical systems. The key contribution for the modeling part is the identification of the transformation that allows transferring real-valued linear MIMO systems into GA-valued linear SISO representations (with independence of having a balanced or unbalanced system). Closed-loop stability analysis in the new space is addressed by using intrinsic properties of GA. In addition, a recipe for designing stabilizing and decoupling GA-valued controllers is provided. Numerical examples illustrate key developments and experiments corroborate the main findings.</description>

      <title>Context-aware LLM-based Safe Control Against Latent Risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous control systems face significant challenges in performing complex tasks in the presence of latent risks. To address this, we propose an integrated framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), numerical optimization, and optimization-based control to facilitate efficient subtask learning while ensuring safety against latent risks. The framework decomposes complex tasks into a sequence of context-aware subtasks that account for latent risks. These subtasks and their parameters are then refined through a multi-time-scale process: high-layer multi-turn in-context learning, mid-layer LLM Chain-of-Thought reasoning and numerical optimization, and low-layer model predictive control. The framework iteratively improves decisions by leveraging qualitative feedback and optimized trajectory data from lower-layer optimization processes and a physics simulator. We validate the proposed framework through simulated case studies involving robot arm and autonomous vehicle scenarios. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can mediate actions based on the context and latent risks and learn complex behaviors efficiently.</description>

      <title>Randomized Transport Plans via Hierarchical Fully Probabilistic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An optimal randomized strategy for design of balanced, normalized mass transport plans is developed. It replaces -- but specializes to -- the deterministic, regularized optimal transport (OT) strategy, which yields only a certainty-equivalent plan. The incompletely specified -- and therefore uncertain -- transport plan is acknowledged to be a random process. Therefore, hierarchical fully probabilistic design (HFPD) is adopted, yielding an optimal hyperprior supported on the set of possible transport plans, and consistent with prior mean constraints on the marginals of the uncertain plan. This Bayesian resetting of the design problem for transport plans -- which we call HFPD-OT -- confers new opportunities. These include (i) a strategy for the generation of a random sample of joint transport plans; (ii) randomized marginal contracts for individual source-target pairs; and (iii) consistent measures of uncertainty in the plan and its contracts. An application in fair market matching is outlined, in which HFPD-OT enables the recruitment of a more diverse subset of contracts -- than is possible in classical OT -- into the delivery of an expected plan.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Digital Twins: Robust Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Quantile Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital Twins, virtual replicas of physical systems that enable real-time monitoring, model updates, predictions, and decision-making, present novel avenues for proactive control strategies for autonomous systems. However, achieving real-time decision-making in Digital Twins considering uncertainty necessitates an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach and optimization driven by accurate predictions of system behaviors, which remains a challenge for learning-based methods. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates real-time decision-making with uncertainty awareness for Digital Twin systems. Leveraging a multistep ahead predictor named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) as the surrogate model, this framework differs from conventional MPC models that provide only one-step ahead predictions. In contrast, TiDE can predict future states within the prediction horizon in a one-shot, significantly accelerating MPC. Furthermore, quantile regression is employed with the training of TiDE to perform flexible while computationally efficient UQ on data uncertainty. Consequently, with the deep learning quantiles, the robust MPC problem is formulated into a deterministic optimization problem and provides a safety buffer that accommodates disturbances to enhance constraint satisfaction rate. As a result, the proposed method outperforms existing robust MPC methods by providing less-conservative UQ and has demonstrated efficacy in an engineering case study involving Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing. This proactive while uncertainty-aware control capability positions the proposed method as a potent tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process control in engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Generating Building-Level Heat Demand Time Series by Combining Occupancy Simulations and Thermal Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite various efforts, decarbonizing the heating sector remains a significant challenge. To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of highly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide heating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer time series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but not both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across different buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this paper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand time series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach integrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that account for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a cost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy development, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data can be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or to analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications of this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we prepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298 residential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different pathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly available data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European regions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of decarbonization strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel set-theoretical approach to hands-off control is proposed, which focuses on spatial arguments for command limitation, rather than temporal ones. By employing dynamical feedback alongside invariant set-based constraints, actuation is employed only to drive the system's state inside a "hands-off region" of its state-space, where the plant may freely evolve in open-loop configuration. A computationally-efficient procedure with strong theoretical guarantees is devised, and its effectiveness is showcased via an intuitive practical example.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Enforce Non-Negativity Constraint in Neural Network Approximation for Optimal Voltage Regulation (preprint)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power system voltage regulation is crucial to maintain power quality while integrating intermittent renewable resources in distribution grids. However, the system model on the grid edge is often unknown, making it difficult to model physical equations for optimal control. Therefore, previous work proposes structured data-driven methods like input convex neural networks (ICNN) for "optimal" control without relying on a physical model. While ICNNs offer theoretical guarantees based on restrictive assumptions of non-negative neural network parameters, can one improve the approximation power with an extra step on negative duplication of inputs? We show that such added mirroring step fails to improve accuracy, as a linear combination of the original input and duplicated input is equivalent to a linear operation of ICNN's input without duplication. While this design can not improve performance, we propose a unified approach to embed the non-negativity constraint as a regularized optimization of the neural network, contrary to the existing methods, which added a loosely integrated second step for post-processing on parameter negation. Our integration directly ties back-propagation to simultaneously minimizing the approximation error while enforcing the convexity constraints. Numerical experiments validate the issues of the mirroring method and show that our integrated objective can avoid problems such as unstable training and non-convergence existing in other methods for optimal control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers stochastic linear time-invariant systems subject to constraints on the average number of state-constraint violations over time without knowing the disturbance distribution. We present a novel disturbance-adaptive model predictive control (DAD-MPC) framework, which adjusts the disturbance model based on measured constraint violations. Using a robust invariance method, DAD-MPC ensures recursive feasibility and guarantees asymptotic or robust bounds on average constraint violations. Additionally, the bounds hold even with an inaccurate disturbance model, which allows for data-driven disturbance quantification methods to be used, such as conformal prediction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods while satisfying average violation constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a rectangular-shaped power divider has been presented operating at 27.9 GHz. The power divider has achieved acceptable results for important parameters such as S11, S12, S21, and S22. The substrate employed for the power divider is Roger 3003 which has a thickness of 1.6 mm. This power divider provides a reflection coefficient of -12.2 dB and an insertion loss of 3.1 dB at 28 GHz. This ka-band T-junction power divider covers 68% of the bandwidth. Dimensions of the ka-band T-junction power divider are 50x80 mm. Due to its dimensions and bandwidth this power divider is more suitable for millimetre wave applications like RADAR, beamforming, and 5G applications.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Line-Impedance Estimation in the Absence of Phasor Measurement Units</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes and compares experimentally several methods to estimate the series resistance and reactance (i.e., the transversal components of the $\pi$-model of a line) of low-voltage lines in distribution grids. It first shows that if phasor measurements are available and the grid nodal voltages and power injections are known, the problem can be formulated and solved as a conventional load flow with properly adjusted unknowns. To solve this problem, we propose an analytical derivation of the Jacobian matrix. If only RMS values are available, such as from smart meters, integrating information from multiple intervals becomes necessary, ultimately opening to least-squares estimations, widely adopted in the literature. In this context, applying the proposed Jacobian contributes to accelerating the problem resolution of existing algorithms. The methods are compared in terms of estimation performance and convergence by using measurements from an experimental distribution grid interfacing real-world components and with realistic size implemented at the Gridlab at HES-SO Valais.</description>

      <title>Toward a Harmonized Approach - Requirement-based Structuring of a Safety Assurance Argumentation for Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite increasing testing operation on public roads, media reports on incidents show that safety issues remain to this day. One major cause factoring into this circumstance is high development uncertainty that manufacturers face when deploying these systems in an open context. In particular, one challenge is establishing a valid argument at design time that the vehicle will exhibit reasonable residual risk when operating in its intended operational design domain. Regulations, such as the European Implementing Regulation 2022/1426, require manufacturers to provide a safety assurance argumentation for SAE-Level-4 automated vehicles. While there is extensive literature on assurance cases for safety-critical systems, the domain of automated driving lacks explicit requirements regarding the creation of safety assurance argumentations. In this paper, we aim to narrow this gap by elaborating a requirement-based approach. We derive structural requirements for an argumentation from literature and supplement these with requirements derived from stakeholder concerns. We implement the requirements, yielding a proposal for an overall argumentation structure. The resulting "safety arguments" argue over four topic complexes: The developed product, the underlying process including its conformance/compliance to standards/laws, as well as the argumentations' context and soundness. Finally, we instantiate this structure with respect to domain-specific needs and principles.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rates of Convergence for Entropy Regularization in Discounted Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the error introduced by entropy regularization in infinite-horizon, discrete, discounted Markov decision processes. We show that this error decreases exponentially in the inverse regularization strength both in a weighted KL-divergence and in value with a problem-specific exponent. This is in contrast to previously known estimates, of the order $O(\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the regularization strength. We provide a lower bound matching our upper bound up to a polynomial term, thereby characterizing the exponential convergence rate for entropy regularization. Our proof relies on the observation that the solutions of entropy-regularized Markov decision processes solve a gradient flow of the unregularized reward with respect to a Riemannian metric common in natural policy gradient methods. This correspondence allows us to identify the limit of this gradient flow as the generalized maximum entropy optimal policy, thereby characterizing the implicit bias of this gradient flow, which corresponds to a time-continuous version of the natural policy gradient method. We use our improved error estimates to show that for entropy-regularized natural policy gradient methods, the overall error decays exponentially in the square root of the number of iterations, improving over existing sublinear guarantees. Finally, we extend our analysis to settings beyond the entropy. In particular, we characterize the implicit bias regarding general convex potentials and their resulting generalized natural policy gradients.</description>

Abstract: To accommodate the increasing communication needs in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), wireless users in remote areas may require access to more spectrum than is currently allocated. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks, are deployed in specific areas, but many underused licensed spectrum bands remain in remote areas. Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. However, in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs make it challenging to effectively manage mutual interference between NTN and TN. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of spectrum sharing (SS) in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.</description>

      <title>Online Controller Synthesis for Robot Collision Avoidance: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inherent uncertainty of dynamic environments poses significant challenges for modeling robot behavior, particularly in tasks such as collision avoidance. This paper presents an online controller synthesis framework tailored for robots equipped with deep learning-based perception components, with a focus on addressing distribution shifts. Our approach integrates periodic monitoring and repair mechanisms for the deep neural network perception component, followed by uncertainty reassessment. These uncertainty evaluations are injected into a parametric discrete-time markov chain, enabling the synthesis of robust controllers via probabilistic model checking. To ensure high system availability during the repair process, we propose a dual-component configuration that seamlessly transitions between operational states. Through a case study on robot collision avoidance, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method, showcasing substantial performance improvements over baseline approaches. This work provides a comprehensive and scalable solution for enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous systems operating in uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Path Planning with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance for Autonomous Parking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe and efficient path planning in parking scenarios presents a significant challenge due to the presence of cluttered environments filled with static and dynamic obstacles. To address this, we propose a novel and computationally efficient planning strategy that seamlessly integrates the predictions of dynamic obstacles into the planning process, ensuring the generation of collision-free paths. Our approach builds upon the conventional Hybrid A star algorithm by introducing a time-indexed variant that explicitly accounts for the predictions of dynamic obstacles during node exploration in the graph, thus enabling dynamic obstacle avoidance. We integrate the time-indexed Hybrid A star algorithm within an online planning framework to compute local paths at each planning step, guided by an adaptively chosen intermediate goal. The proposed method is validated in diverse parking scenarios, including perpendicular, angled, and parallel parking. Through simulations, we showcase our approach's potential in greatly improving the efficiency and safety when compared to the state of the art spline-based planning method for parking situations.</description>
