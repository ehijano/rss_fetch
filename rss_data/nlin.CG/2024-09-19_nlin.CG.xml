      <title>Biological arrow of time: Emergence of tangled information hierarchies and self-modelling dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study open-ended evolution by focusing on computational and information-processing dynamics underlying major evolutionary transitions. In doing so, we consider biological organisms as hierarchical dynamical systems that generate regularities in their phase-spaces through interactions with their environment. These emergent information patterns can then be encoded within the organism's components, leading to self-modelling "tangled hierarchies". Our main conjecture is that when macro-scale patterns are encoded within micro-scale components, it creates fundamental tensions (computational inconsistencies) between what is encodable at a particular evolutionary stage and what is potentially realisable in the environment. A resolution of these tensions triggers an evolutionary transition which expands the problem-space, at the cost of generating new tensions in the expanded space, in a continual process. We argue that biological complexification can be interpreted computation-theoretically, within the G\"odel--Turing--Post recursion-theoretic framework, as open-ended generation of computational novelty. In general, this process can be viewed as a meta-simulation performed by higher-order systems that successively simulate the computation carried out by lower-order systems. This computation-theoretic argument provides a basis for hypothesising the biological arrow of time.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Taxonomy of Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cellular automata (CAs) are fully-discrete dynamical models that have received much attention due to the fact that their relatively simple setup can nonetheless express highly complex phenomena. Despite the model's theoretical maturity and abundant computational power, the current lack of a complete survey on the 'taxonomy' of various families of CAs impedes efficient and interdisciplinary progress. This review paper mitigates that deficiency; it provides a methodical overview of five important CA 'families': asynchronous, stochastic, multi-state, extended-neighbourhood, and non-uniform CAs. These five CA families are subsequently presented from four angles. First, a rigorous mathematical definition is given. Second, we map prominent variations within each CA family, as such highlighting mathematical equivalences with types from other families. Third, we discuss the genotype and phenotype of these CA types by means of mathematical tools, indicating when established tools break down. Fourth, we conclude each section with a brief overview of applications related to information theory and mathematical modelling.</description>
