      <title>Intermediate-mass black hole incubators. Gas accretion onto stellar black hole clusters in galactic central molecular zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar dynamical evolution of massive star clusters formed during starburst periods leads to the segregation of $\gtrsim10^4 M_\odot$ stellar-mass black hole sub-clusters in their centres. In gas-rich environments, such as galactic central molecular zones, these black hole clusters are likely to accrete large amounts of the gas from their surroundings, which in turn affects their internal dynamics. In this Letter we estimated the corresponding accretion rate onto the black hole cluster and its radiative feedback. We assessed whether such an accretion flow can lead to the collapse of the black hole cluster into an intermediate-mass black hole. The estimates were obtained analytically, considering the astrophysical conditions and star formation history reported for the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. We find that a stellar black hole cluster with mass $\gtrsim10^4 M_\odot$ located in the twisted ring of molecular clouds with radius $\approx100$ pc that is observed in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy can accrete about the same mass in gas on a timescale of a few million years. We suggest that this is sufficient for its subsequent collapse into an intermediate-mass black hole. Based on an estimate of the dynamical friction inspiral time, we further argue that the locations of the intermediate-mass black hole candidates recently observed in the central molecular zone are compatible with their formation therein during the last starburst period reported to have occurred $\approx1$ Gyr ago.</description>

      <title>A survey of molecular clouds in the Galactic center's outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleus of the Milky Way is known to drive a large-scale, multiphase galactic outflow, with gas phases ranging from the hot highly-ionized to the cold molecular component. In this work, we present the first systematic search for molecules in the Milky Way wind. We use the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) to observe the 12CO(2-1) emission line in 19 fields centered on previously known high-velocity atomic hydrogen (HI) clouds associated with the outflow. Over 200 CO clumps are detected within 16 different HI clouds. These clumps have typical radii of 1 - 3 parsec, high velocity dispersions of 1 - 6 km/s and molecular gas masses ranging from a few to several hundred solar masses. Molecular clumps in the wind sit on the low-mass end of the mass - size relation of regular molecular clouds, but are far displaced from the mass (or size) - linewidth relation, being generally more turbulent and showing high internal pressures. Nearly 90% of the clumps are gravitationally unbound with virial parameters &gt;&gt; 10 - 100, indicating that these structures are either being disrupted or they must be confined by external pressure from the surrounding hot medium. While the observed properties of CO clumps do not seem to evolve clearly with latitude, we find that molecular gas is not detected in any of the 6 HI clouds with projected distances over 1 kpc from the Galactic Center, suggesting the existence of a maximum timescale of ~ 3 Myr for the dissociation of molecular gas within the wind. Overall, current observations in the Galactic center support a scenario in which a hot wind entrains cold gas clouds from the disk, driving their progressive transformation from molecular to atomic and ultimately ionized gas through stripping, turbulence, and dissociation.</description>

      <title>Relatively Fast and Reasonably Furious: Evidence for Increased Burstiness in Smaller Halos at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an effective framework to model star-formation burstiness and use it to jointly fit galaxy UV luminosity functions (UVLFs), clustering, and H$\alpha$/UV ratios, providing the first robust empirical evidence that early galaxies hosted in lower-mass halos are burstier. Using $z\sim 4-6$ observations, we find that galaxies show approximately $0.6$ dex of SFR variability if hosted in halos of $M_h = 10^{11}\, M_\odot$ (typical of $M_{\rm UV}\approx -19$ galaxies at $z = 6$). This translates into a scatter of $\sigma_{M_{\rm UV}}\approx 0.75$ in the UVLF, in line with past findings. Strikingly, we find that burstiness grows for galaxies hosted in smaller halos, reaching $\gtrsim 1$ dex for $M_h \leq 10^{9}\, M_\odot$ (corresponding to $\sigma_{M_{\rm UV}} \approx 1.5$ for faint $M_{\rm UV} \gtrsim -15$ galaxies). Extrapolating to higher redshifts, when small halos were more prevalent, the inferred mass-dependent burstiness can reproduce observed UVLFs up to $z\sim 17$ within 1$\sigma$, potentially alleviating the tension between pre- and post-JWST galaxy-formation models. Current observations allow us to constrain burst timescales to approximately $20$ Myr, consistent with expectations from supernova feedback, and suggest broad distributions of ionizing efficiencies at fixed $M_{\rm UV}$. Our results demonstrate that mass-dependent burstiness, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations, is critical for understanding the mass assembly of early galaxies.</description>

      <title>MUSEQuBES: Investigating the Physical and Chemical Properties of Circumgalactic Gas Around Ly$\alpha$ Emitters at $z \approx 3.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the physical properties of absorbers associated with $z\approx3.3$ \lya\ emitters (LAEs) from the MUSEQuBES survey. Using \HI\ and ionic column densities derived from Voigt profile fitting, we determine the density and metallicity of 75 absorbers associated with 59 LAEs through a custom-built Bayesian framework. The overall sample shows a median density $\log\,(n_{\rm H}/{\rm cm^{-3}})=-2.7\pm0.7$ and metallicity \met$=-1.6^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$ with $\approx15\%$ ($\approx 40\%$ including upper limits) of systems showing metallicities consistent with the IGM at these redshifts (\met$\lesssim -2.8$). Intriguingly, absorbers with $\log\, N(\rm HI)/{\rm cm^{-2}} \gtrsim 16.5$, corresponding to an overdensity of $\sim 100$ at $z=3$, exhibit a bimodal metallicity distribution with peaks at \met$=-3.8\pm 0.2$ and $-1.8\pm 0.6$. The latter are observed at large impact parameters ($\gtrsim150$~pkpc) and often exhibit low-ionization species (e.g., \SiII, \AlII). We interpret the former as pristine inflowing gas from the cosmic web, while the latter likely traces metal-enriched CGM associated with outflows from faint galaxies not detected in Ly$\alpha$ emission. We find no significant correlations between absorber metallicity or density and host galaxy properties, including redshift, impact parameter, SFR, Ly$\alpha$ luminosity, or environment. Absorbers separated by $\lesssim500$~\kms\ show $\sim$1~dex metallicity and $\sim$0.5~dex density variations, indicating physical and chemical inhomogeneity of the medium around these LAEs.</description>

      <title>FROST-CLUSTERS -- III. Metallicity-dependent intermediate mass black hole formation by runaway collisions in dense star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the formation of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs), potential seeds for supermassive black holes (SMBHs), via runaway stellar collisions for a wide range of star cluster (surface) densities ($4\times10^3 M_\odot$ pc$^{-2} \lesssim \Sigma_\mathrm{h}$ $\lesssim 4\times10^6 M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$) and metallicities ($0.01 Z_\odot \lesssim Z \lesssim 1.0 Z_\odot)$. Our sample of isolated $(&gt;1400)$ and hierarchical ($30$) simulations of young, massive star clusters with up to $N=1.8\times10^6$ stars includes collisional stellar dynamics, stellar evolution, and post-Newtonian equations of motion for black holes using the BIFROST code. High stellar wind rates suppress IMBH formation at high metallicities $(Z \gtrsim 0.2 Z_\odot)$ and low collision rates prevent their formation at low densities ($\Sigma_\mathrm{h} \lesssim 3\times10^4 M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$). The assumptions about stellar wind loss rates strongly affect the maximum final IMBH masses $(M_\bullet \sim 6000 M_\odot$ vs. $25000 M_\odot$). The total stellar mass loss from collisions and collisionally boosted winds before $t=3$ Myr can together reach up to 5-10% of the final cluster mass. We present fitting formulae for IMBH masses as a function of host star cluster $\Sigma_\mathrm{h}$ and Z, and formulate a model for the cosmic IMBH formation rate density. Depending on the cluster birth densities, the IMBH formation rates peak at $z\sim2$-$4$ at up to $\sim10^{-7}$ yr$^{-1}$cMpc$^{-3}$. As more than 50% form below $z\lesssim1.5$-$3$, the model challenges a view in which all local IMBHs are failed early Universe SMBH seeds.</description>

      <title>On the Jeans criterion for hydrostatic and infalling gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local gravitational instability of non-rotating astrophysical fluids allowing for the presence of an external gravitational potential in addition to the fluid self-gravity. We present a self-consistent linear-perturbation analysis taking into account pressure and density gradients in the background medium. We explore two different steady-state configurations for the unperturbed gas: hydrostatic equilibrium and infall into a gravitational potential well. We show that in both cases the instability criterion is the classical Jeans criterion, which, contrary to previous claims, is not modified by the presence of the external gravitational field. While in the case of hydrostatic equilibrium linear local perturbations are always gravitationally stable, the conditions for gravitational instability can be met in the case of infalling gas, also in the presence of additional non-gravitational forces such as that due to a wind. We conclude that the Jeans criterion can have a role in regulating the formation of clumps and star clusters in streams or shells of gas infalling into galactic gravitational potential wells, as well as, on smaller scales, the fragmentation of gas in collapsing molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Galaxy interactions in void substructures: Morphology and stellar populations of two triplets from CAVITY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Cosmic voids are underdense regions of the Universe that provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution in relative isolation. Galaxy triplets in voids are rare systems where local interactions may strongly influence galaxy properties.
  Aims. We study the stellar populations, morphologies, mass assembly histories, and dynamical properties of six galaxies belonging to two void triplets from the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY): CAVITY5273X and VGS31.
  Methods. We used integral-field unit spectroscopy and performed full spectral fitting with the FADO code, which models stellar and nebular emission simultaneously. Spatially resolved maps of stellar age, metallicity, and star formation rate were reconstructed using the integrated nested Laplace approximation. Morphological properties were derived using morfometryka, emission-line diagnostics were applied, and mass assembly functions were computed. Stellar masses and metallicities were compared to the mass-metallicity relation for void galaxies.
  Results. The two triplets show different evolutionary behaviours. CAVITY52731 is a massive quenched galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus, while its companions and all galaxies in VGS31 are dominated by young stellar populations and recent star formation. Five galaxies experienced rapid stellar mass growth in the last 2 Gyr. Disturbed morphologies, including asymmetries and tidal features, indicate ongoing interactions. Galaxies in CAVITY5273X follow the expected void mass-metallicity relation, while VGS31 members show significant deviations.
  Conclusions. Our results show that local interactions can drive significant galaxy evolution even in the most underdense cosmic environments.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Feedback Effects in Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei Revealed by JWST Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents an analysis of the infrared ($\sim 3-28\,\mu m$) spectra extracted from the nuclear ($r &lt; 150$ pc) regions of four low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), observed by JWST NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS as an extension of the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We find that, compared to higher-luminosity AGN, these low-luminosity AGN exhibit distinct properties in their emission of ionized gas, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and molecular hydrogen (H$_2$). Specifically, the low-luminosity AGN exhibit relatively weak high-ionization potential lines (e.g., [Ne V] and [O IV]), and the line ratios suggest that fast radiative shocks (with $v_{\rm s}$ of $\sim \rm 100s\,km\,s^{-1}$) are the primary excitation source of ionized gas therein. Under the low-excitation conditions of their nuclear regions, these low-luminosity AGN generally exhibit a higher fraction of PAHs with large size ($N_{\rm C} \gtrsim 200$), reflecting the preferential destruction of smaller PAH molecules by AGN feedback. Furthermore, the H$_2$ transitions in these low-luminosity AGN are not fully thermalized, with slow, plausibly jet-driven molecular shocks (with $v_{\rm s} \leq \rm 10\,km\,s^{-1}$) likely being the extra excitation source. Taken together with results from the literature, these findings indicate that feedback operates in both low- and high-luminosity AGN, albeit its impact varies with AGN luminosity. In particular, systematic variations in PAH band ratios are found across AGN, demonstrating the differing influence of feedback in AGN of varying luminosities and highlighting the potential of PAH band ratios as diagnostics for distinguishing kinetic- and radiative-mode AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>Investigating quenching in Recently Quenched Elliptical galaxies with HI studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Quenched Elliptical galaxies (RQEs) represent a critical phase in the transition from star-forming to quiescent galaxies. However, the mechanisms driving their quenching remain elusive. We conduct a multi-wavelength analysis of 155 RQEs, along with their precursors (preRQEs) and descendants (postRQEs), focusing on their neutral hydrogen (HI) content and star formation properties. Contrary to conventional quenching models emphasizing gas depletion, RQEs retain substantial HI reservoirs ($f_{\text{gas}} \geq 17\%$), suggesting that quenching is not primarily driven by gas exhaustion. We identify a critical halo mass threshold at $\log M_{\text{halo}} = 12.1 M_{\odot}$, delineating different evolutionary pathways for RQEs. This threshold aligns with the transition from cold-mode to hot-mode gas accretion in theoretical models. RQEs in lower-mass halos ($\log M_{\text{halo}} &lt; 12.1 M_{\odot}$) likely experience rapid quenching, possibly initiated by major mergers, followed by brief AGN activity and sustained LINER emission. We propose two evolutionary pathways: (a) rapid quenching via major mergers followed by AGN/LINER activity and passive evolution, and (b) rapid quenching followed by rejuvenation through minor mergers before evolving into more massive, long-term quenched ellipticals. These results challenge the conventional understanding of galaxy quenching, especially in low-density environments where RQEs typically reside. Our findings suggest that while RQEs may follow a rapid quenching pathway, their evolution is influenced by interactions between gas accretion modes, feedback mechanisms, and environmental factors. Future observations with advanced radio interferometers like SKA will be crucial for elucidating the quenching mechanisms in RQEs and their role in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Dimensions of AGN Lightcurve Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) glossary is vast and complex. Depending on selection method, observing wavelength, and brightness, AGNs are assigned distinct labels, yet the relationship between different selection methods and the diversity of time-domain behavior within and across classes remains difficult to characterize in a unified framework. Changing-look AGNs (CLAGNs), which transition between classifications over time, further complicate this picture. In this work, we learn a data-driven, low-dimensional representation of multi-wavelength photometric light curves of AGNs, in which the structure of the projected manifold correlates with AGN class and independent spectroscopic properties. Using the NASA Fornax Science Platform, we assemble light curves from ZTF, Pan-STARRS, Gaia, and WISE/NEOWISE for two samples: (1) a heterogeneous set of $\sim$2000 AGNs spanning $z \lesssim 1$, including SDSS quasars, variability-selected sources, and CLAGNs; and (2) a homogeneous sample of $\sim$65000 narrow-line AGNs at $z \approx 0.1$ with well-characterized optical emission-line measurements. Without using class labels during training, the learned manifolds organize variability-selected AGNs into coherent regions of the low-dimensional space, distinguish between turn-on and turn-off CLAGNs, and place tidal disruption events in distinct regions. Manifold coordinates correlate with key spectroscopic and host-galaxy properties, including stellar mass, [OIII] luminosity, and D$_n$(4000), demonstrating that heterogeneous multi-band variability can be combined in a purely data-driven manner to recover correlations with independent physical diagnostics, without requiring explicit physical modeling. These results show that manifold learning offers a practical, assumption-light approach for integrating time-domain surveys and prioritizing spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

      <title>QED V: Variations in metal loading of galactic winds with element nucleosynthetic origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae, type II supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are important sites of stellar nucleosynthesis, but they differ greatly in their rates, their location within a galaxy, and the mean thermal energy and abundance distribution of their ejecta. In earlier papers in this series we have shown that a significant fraction of metals newly synthesized by type II supernovae are promptly lost to galactic winds -- i.e., galactic winds are metal loaded. Here we investigate whether the elements returned by type Ia supernovae and AGB stars are similarly metal loaded, or whether metal loading varies significantly with nucleosynthetic site. We use a series of high-resolution ``tall box'' simulations of the interstellar medium with the \quokka~GPU-accelerated code, within which we systematically vary the galaxy gas surface density, metallicity, and the scale heights and relative rates of the different nucleosynthetic sources. We show that the metal loadings of galactic winds differ substantially between metals produced by different sources, with typical variations at the level of $\approx 0.3$ dex, a phenomenon we term differential metal loading. Which set of metals suffers preferential loss from this phenomenon varies depending on the galactic environment, and is not easily predictable \textit{a priori}. Our findings call into question the the interpretation of diagnostics of galaxy formation, for example star formation timescales and initial mass functions, based on abundance diagnostics, since the abundance variations upon which these techniques rely are often at levels comparable to those we show can be induced by differential metal loading.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With upcoming facilities capable of detecting photometric and gravitational wave signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, studying their long-term accretion-driven variability is timely. OJ287 is a bright, nearby ($z=0.3$), and well-studied candidate for a SMBH binary. As such, it is an excellent case study for how binary dynamics could influence observed active galactic nucleus (AGN) photometric variability. We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of OJ287, using the code PHANTOM. We simulate two mass ratios: (i) M$_1$ $=$ 1.835$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ with M$_2$ $=$ 1.4$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\odot$, (ii) M$_1\approx$ M$_2$ ($\sim10^{8}$ M$_\odot$) along and (iii) control of a single SMBH and accretion disc. We find that the simulation with masses 1.835$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and 1.4$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\odot$ evolves consistently with the most currently accepted model of OJ287 as a precessing SMBH binary. The secondary's impacts with the disc result in the formation of spiral density waves and a corresponding $\sim$10-20% increases in the mass accretion rate of the primary SMBH. The impact timings and the mass accretion rate spikes show quasi-periodic variability as a result of the precession of the secondary's orbit with intervals between impacts ranging from $\sim$ 1 year to $\sim$ 10 years. In the near-equal mass case, the disc of the primary becomes tidally disrupted after $\sim$ 2 years. Consequently, the near-equal mass system with a period of 12 years is not a viable candidate for OJ287. This modeling provides insights into the potential signatures of SMBH binaries by both gravitational wave observatories and the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>The Secret Lives of Open Clusters: a Multiwavelength Examination of Three Open Clusters</title>

Abstract: Star clusters are well known for their dynamical interactions, an outcome of their high stellar densities; in this paper we use multiwavelength observations to search for the unique outcomes of these interactions in three nearby Galactic open clusters: IC 2602 (30 Myr), NGC 2632 (750 Myr) and M67 (4 Gyr). We compared X-ray observations from all-sky surveys like eROSITA, plus archival observations from Chandra X-ray Observatory, survey radio observations from ASKAP's Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey plus archival VLA observations, in conjunction with new cluster catalogs with Gaia. From X-ray, we found 77 X-ray sources likely associated with IC 2602, 31 X-ray sources in NGC 2632, and 31 near M67's central regions. We were further able to classify these X-ray sources based on their optical variability and any radio emission. Three IC 2602 X-ray sources had radio counterparts, which are likely all chromospherically active binary stars. We also identified luminous radio and X-ray variability from a spectroscopic triple system in M67, WOCS 3012/S1077, which is either consistent with a quiescent black hole binary, or due to an active binary stellar system. A recent population study of optical variables by Anderson &amp; Hunt 2025 shows that the population of optical variables in open clusters clearly changes over cluster age; this pilot study gives evidence that the X-ray population also changes with time, and demonstrates the need for a broader multiwavelength study of Galactic open clusters.</description>

      <title>The Contribution of Stars, Dust, Neutral Gas and SMBHs in Galaxies to the Cosmic Baryon Inventory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the cosmic stellar, dust and neutral gas mass history at $0&lt;z\lesssim3$ using ProSpect spectral energy distribution modelling of $\approx 800 \, 000$ galaxies in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey and the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS). The cosmic dust mass history broadly follows the shape of the cosmic star formation history; though, the decline is slower, suggestive of a slowing rate of dust growth and destruction as the star formation declines past its peak at $z\approx 2$. Neutral gas masses were estimated by scaling the dust masses by the metallicity-dependent dust-to-gas ratio. The neutral gas mass density as traced by the dust is an average of $\approx 0.6$ dex lower than that measured from $21$cm experiments, most likely due to differences in the spatial scales inhabited by dust and HI. Folding in measurements of the supermassive black hole mass density obtained previously with similar data and methods, we present a self-consistent census of the baryons confined to galaxies. Stars, neutral gas, SMBHs and dust contained within the optical radii of galaxies account for $\approx 5$ per cent of the baryons. Most of the remaining $\approx 95$ per cent of baryons must be ionised and dispersed throughout the interstellar, circumgalactic and intergalactic media within, around and between galaxies.</description>

      <title>Diverse Origins of Broad H$\alpha$ Lines in Heavily Obscured AGNs Revealed by Multi-epoch Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the classical AGN model, broad emission lines originate from the broad-line region (BLR) and are observable only when the attenuation by the dusty torus is small. However, we recently found several heavily-obscured ($A_V &gt; 50$ mag) AGNs with broad H$\alpha$ detections: MCG -3-34-64, UGC 5101, and Mrk 268. To investigate the origin of the observed broad line in these AGNs, we performed multi-epoch optical spectroscopic observations to search for flux variability of the broad H$\alpha$ line. For MCG -3-34-64 and UGC 5101, no significant variability was detected, suggesting that the broad line of these AGNs may arise from sources other than the BLR. Spectral fitting analysis suggests possible large contribution of ionized outflows to the observed broad component of MCG -3-34-64, while both the outflow and scattering by polar material can explain that of UGC 5101. For Mrk 268, we detected a significant ($4.3\sigma$) flux variation of the broad H$\alpha$ line by using the flux ratio of the H$\alpha$ complex and the [SII]$\lambda\lambda6716$, 6731 doublet, indicating that the broad line originates directly from the BLR. The lack of significant flux variation in the optical continuum implies that the line of sight to the nucleus of Mrk 268 is mildly obscured. Our results demonstrate that the observed broad H$\alpha$ lines in obscured AGNs likely have multiple origins. Such complexity may introduce additional uncertainties in black hole mass measurements of distant AGNs revealed by e.g., JWST.</description>

      <title>RotCurves: A PYTHON package for efficient modelling and fitting of galactic rotation curves at high-z</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotation curves are a fundamental tool in the study of galaxies across cosmic time, and with the advent of large integral field unit (IFU) kinematic surveys there is an increasing need for efficient and flexible modelling tools. We present RotCurves, a parametric forward-modeling tool designed for rotation curve analysis at high-z, correcting for ``beam smearing" by projecting and convolving the beam PSF in the plane of the galaxy. We benchmark RotCurves against the established parametric code dysmalpy using synthetic observations. The typical runtime with RotCurves is a few ~10ms, a factor 250 faster than dysmalpy for a single realization. For well-resolved systems (PSF FWHM &lt; Reff), the mock observed rotation and dispersion curves agree to within 5% up to 3Reff, where most of the discrepancies are in the inner disk. whereas in marginally resolved systems (PSF FWHM &gt; 1.5 Reff) discrepancies increase to up to 15%. Using a built-in MCMC fitting procedure, RotCurves recovers well the intrinsic model parameters across a wide range of galaxy properties and accounting for realistic noise patterns. Systematic biases emerge for the effective radius and for low disk masses (Mdisk &lt; 3x10^9 Msun). We show excellent parameter recovery at high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N &gt; 25), with increasing deviations in parameter recovery at lower S/N. RotCurves is best suited for inclinations of 10 &lt; i &lt; 80. RotCurves is built as an exploratory tool for rapid testing of mass model assumptions, parameter studies and for efficiently processing large samples of observational data from large IFU surveys. The code is publicly available on github.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent dynamical models with a finite extent -- V. Smooth radial truncations and phase-space consistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many stellar systems exhibit a finite spatial extent, yet constructing self-consistent spherical models with a prescribed outer boundary is non-trivial because sharp density cutoffs introduce discontinuities that lead to inconsistencies in the associated distribution function. In this paper we show that these difficulties arise from the abruptness of the truncation rather than from the finite extent itself. We introduce a general and infinitely differentiable radial truncation scheme that can be applied to any density profile, and illustrate its behaviour using the Hernquist model. We find that softly truncated models are dynamically consistent provided that the truncation is sufficiently gradual, and we determine the corresponding critical truncation sharpness. Their distribution functions display a characteristic bump-dip feature near the truncation energy that signals the transition between consistent and inconsistent cases. In contrast to sharply truncated models, softly truncated systems can support an extensive family of Osipkov-Merritt orbital structures, including moderately radial ones. Soft truncations therefore offer a general and physically motivated route to constructing finite-extent dynamical models with well-controlled outer-edge behaviour.</description>

      <title>Three Models of the Gravitational Potential of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parameters of an axisymmetric model for the gravitational potential of the Galaxy have been refined. The basic curve of the Galaxy's rotation in a distance interval of $R:0-190$ kpc was constructed using the velocities of masers, classical Cepheids, Red Clump stars, Blue Horizontal Branch stars, halo stars, globular clusters, and dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. The rotation curve was selected in such a way that there would be no dominant burst of circular velocities in the central ($R&lt;2$ kpc) region of the Galaxy. As a result, we constructed two two-component models of the galactic potential, which include contributions from the disk and the halo of invisible matter, as well as a three-component model with a small-mass bulge added in advance. These models can be useful in studying the long-term orbital evolution of stars and open and globular star clusters in the central ($R&lt;4$ kpc) region of the Galaxy. The constructed models were tested for self-consistency by comparing their rotation curves with a set of model curves generated with the Illustris TNG50 software package.</description>

      <title>Local Group analogues in a cosmological context -- I. Relating velocity structure to the cosmic web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our Local Group, dominated in mass by the Milky Way (MW) and M31, provides a unique laboratory for testing $\Lambda$CDM cosmology on small scales owing to its proximity. However, its connection to the surrounding large-scale environment, which is essential for interpreting its properties, is inadequately understood. In this work, we explore the connection between Local Group analogues (LGAs) and their surrounding large-scale environments using the ABACUSSUMMIT simulation suite, highlighting the key role of the coupling energy of the MW-M31 orbit, $E_{\rm coupling}$. We find that LGAs with high $E_{\rm coupling}$ preferentially reside in denser regions, whereas those with low $E_{\rm coupling}$ tend to occupy low-density environments. Furthermore, LGAs with low $E_{\rm coupling}$ exhibit strong alignment with cosmic filaments, manifested as a pronounced polar anisotropy in the distribution of tracer haloes. By contrast, LGAs with high $E_{\rm coupling}$ show a weaker polar anisotropy but an enhanced azimuthal anisotropy, with large-scale tracer haloes preferentially lying in the plane spanned by the halo pair and the orbital spin vector. Within this framework, our Local Group is characterised by typical $E_{\rm coupling}$ residing in a relatively under-dense environment, yet it remains consistent with the 95\% range of analogue systems identified in the simulation.</description>

      <title>On the Interstellar Extinction Curve toward HD 93222, A Sightline with an Exceedingly Narrow 2175 Angstrom Extinction Bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2175 Angstrom extinction bump, the most prominent spectral feature superimposed on the interstellar extinction curve, is widely seen in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way and external galaxies, both near and far. While its central wavelength is remarkably stable and independent with environment, its width shows considerable variation and environmental dependence. Here we examine the extinction curve for the line of sight toward HD 93222, a young star located in the Carina nebula. It is found that the 2175 Angstrom bump is extremely sharp, which is among the narrowest ever found in the Milky Way and external galaxies. We model the derived extinction curve and find that, to explain the extinction characteristics of HD 93222, in addition to the conventional silicate and graphite dust mixture, an additional population of nano-sized graphitic grains is required.</description>

      <title>MUSE-ALMA Haloes XIII. Molecular gas in $z \sim 0.5$ HI-selected galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new results from the MUSE-ALMA Haloes survey, covering 79 galaxies associated with strong HI absorption at redshift about 0.5. Our ALMA Cycle 10 observations add 39 systems to the initial 21, bringing the total to 60 galaxies. CO emission is detected in 9 new galaxies, and in 12 of 60 total, doubling the number of CO-emitting HI-selected galaxies and probing 1.2 dex deeper in molecular gas mass than previous studies. These galaxies span a wide range of stellar masses and metallicities. By comparing CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) properties with star formation rates and gas-phase metallicities from VLT/MUSE and HST, we find a dual behaviour in star formation efficiency: low-mass systems follow main-sequence scaling relations, while high-mass systems show suppressed star formation. This diversity indicates that HI absorbers trace both evolved and younger galaxies, providing a key step toward completing the baryon census at redshift about 0.5.</description>

      <title>Stellar masses of optically dark galaxies: uncertainty introduced by the attenuation law and star-formation histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations have suggested that some high-redshift galaxies may be ultra-massive, thereby challenging standard models of early galaxy formation and cosmology. We analyse the stellar masses using different modelling assumptions and with new data of three galaxies (S1, S2 and S3), whose NIRCam/grism redshifts were consistent with $z&gt;5$. These three optically dark galaxies have previously been reported to host exceptionally high stellar masses and star-formation rates, implying extremely high star-formation efficiencies. Recent NIRSpec/IFU observations for S1 indicate a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm spec}=3.2461^{+0.0001}_{-0.0002}$, which is lower than previously reported. Using the Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling tool \texttt{Prospector}, we investigate the impact of key model assumptions on stellar mass estimates, such as the choice of star-formation history (SFH) priors (constant versus rising SFH base for the non-parametric prior), the dust attenuation law, and the treatment of emission line fluxes. Our analysis yields revised stellar masses of $\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \approx 10.36^{+0.47}_{-0.32}, 10.95^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ and $10.31^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$ for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. We find that adopting a rising SFH base prior results in lower inferred stellar masses compared to a constant SFH base prior. We identify a significant degeneracy between the dust attenuation curve slope, the amount of dust attenuation, and stellar mass. Our results highlight various systematics in SED modelling due to SFH priors and dust attenuation that can influence stellar mass estimates of heavily dust obscured sources. Nevertheless, even with these revised stellar mass estimates, two of the three galaxies remain among the most massive and actively star-forming systems at their respective redshifts, implying high star-formation efficiencies.</description>

      <title>First direct electron temperature measurement in [O II] zone in I Zw 18</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new precise measurements of electron temperatures and oxygen abundances in the southeast knot of I Zw 18, one of the most metal-poor blue compact dwarf galaxies known, using spectroscopic data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1). For the first time in I Zw 18, we directly measure electron temperature in the low-ionization zone using the rarely detected [O II] $\lambda\lambda7320,7330$ doublet. We also detect the auroral lines [O III] $\lambda4363$ and [S III] $\lambda6312$, associated with high and intermediate ionization zones, respectively. We derive $T_{\mathrm{e}}([\mathrm{O}\,\mathrm{III}])=21\,200\pm860\ \mathrm{K}$, $T_{\mathrm{e}}([\mathrm{O}\,\mathrm{II}])=16\,170\pm950\ \mathrm{K}$, and $T_{\mathrm{e}}([\mathrm{S}\,\mathrm{III}])=17\,290\pm1750\ \mathrm{K}$, highlighting a significant temperature difference between ionization zones. Using these direct temperature measurements, we determine a total oxygen abundance of $12+\log(\mathrm{O}/\mathrm{H})=7.066\pm0.046$, $\log(\mathrm{N}/\mathrm{O})=-1.509\pm0.097$, and $\log(\mathrm{S}/\mathrm{O})=-1.558\pm0.041$. Our results extend the calibration of $t_2$--$t_3$ relations to the highest temperatures, providing important anchor points for the temperature structure of extremely metal-poor H II regions, including high-redshift galaxies where direct temperature measurements are especially challenging.</description>

Abstract: To reproduce observed galaxy properties, cosmological simulations require that massive galaxies experience feedback from active galactic nuclei, which regulates star formation within those galaxies. However, the energetics and timescales of these feedback processes are poorly constrained. We combine optical, infrared, sub-millimeter and radio observations of the active galaxy VV 340a, hosting a low-power jet launched from a supermassive black hole at its center. We find that the jet undergoes precession, with a period of (8.2 $\pm~$5.5) $\times~$10$^5$ years, and drives an outflow of gas at a rate of 19.4 $\pm~$7.9 solar masses per year. The jet shocks the gas, producing highly ionized plasma extending several kiloparsecs from the nucleus. The outflow ejects sufficient gas from the galaxy to influence its star formation rate.</description>

      <title>New CDM Crisis Revealed by Multi-Scale Cluster Lensing</title>

Abstract: The properties of substructure in galaxy clusters, exquisitely probed by gravitational lensing, offer a stringent test of dark matter models. Combining strong and weak lensing data for massive clusters, we map their total mass--dominated by dark matter--over the dynamic range needed to confront small-scale predictions for collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). Using state-of-the-art lens models, we extract four key subhalo properties: the mass function, projected radial distribution, internal density profile, and tidal truncation radius. We find that the subhalo mass function and truncation radii are consistent with CDM expectations. In contrast, the inner density profiles and radial distribution of subhalos are strongly discrepant with CDM. The incidence of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) from subhalo cores exceeds CDM predictions by nearly an order of magnitude, requiring inner density slopes as steep as $\gamma \gtrsim 2.5$ within $r \lesssim 0.01\,R_{200}$ consistent with core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), while the same subhalos behave as collisionless in their outskirts. Additionally, the observed radial distribution of subhalos hosting bright cluster member galaxies, explicitly modeled in the lens reconstructions, remains incompatible with CDM. Together, these small-scale stress tests reveal an intriguing paradox and challenge the dark matter microphysics of purely collisionless CDM and motivate hybrid scenarios, such as a dual-component model with both CDM and SIDM, or entirely new classes of dark matter theories.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Symmetry: Transformation Information for Planetary Nebulae and Supernova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a quantitative symmetry-identification pipeline for astrophysical images based on Transformation Information (TI), an information measure of self-similarity under geometric transformations. TI is expressed as a Kullback-Leibler (cross-entropy) divergence between an image and its rotated or reflected counterpart on the overlapping domain. By scanning rotation angles and reflection axes, we obtain TI curves whose local minima identify symmetry operations. We validate the method on a wind-rose pattern and then apply it to planetary nebulae, where the recovered axes trace bipolar and multipolar lobes consistent with morphology-based classifications. Applying TI to supernova remnants yields estimate axes associated with protrusions, rims, and substructure. To emphasize global morphology, we introduce a thresholded two-level variant that compares binary silhouettes and can reveal outline-driven symmetries. Finally, we quantify symmetry using a minima prominence-to-width score and show that this compact descriptor separates Type Ia and core-collapse remnants into distinct populations for an X-ray sample. TI provides a non-parametric, reproducible framework for symmetry identification, classification and population studies.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cosmogenic 10Be During the Heliosphere's Encounter with an Interstellar Cold Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geologic records of cosmogenic 10Be are sensitive to changes in the radiation environment with time. Recent works suggest there are periods when the Sun encountered massive cold clouds which compressed the heliosphere to within Earth's orbit. This would expose Earth to increased galactic cosmic rays and MeV-energy particles of heliospheric origin. We model 10Be production in Earth's atmosphere during possible cold cloud encounters, and estimate their detectability in marine records of variable temporal resolution. We find that an AU-scale cold cloud encounter can be detected using ocean sediment measurements of 10Be if Earth spends time inside the compressed heliosphere. For typical relative speeds between the Sun and local interstellar clouds, this translates to a crossing time of ~100 years. A cloud must have an extension on the scale of parsecs to tens-of-parsecs (crossing time 0.1-1 Myr) to be detectable through 10Be measurements in iron-manganese crusts.</description>

      <title>Stellar Rotation in the First Six Million Years: Rotational Velocities and Radii Estimates of T Tauri Stars in IC 5070 and IC 348</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have acquired high-resolution optical spectroscopy for a sample of T Tauri stars (TTSs) in open clusters using Hydra on the WIYN 3.5m telescope, and present projected rotational velocities (v sin i values) for 54 stars in IC 5070 and 99 stars in IC 348. We combine these with published values for stellar temperature, luminosity, rotation period, circumstellar disk status, and binarity; we are predominantly interested in how the last two factors may affect the rotation speeds of the stars. We find evidence to support theories that interaction with circumstellar disks may slow the rotation of TTSs compared to Class III stars in both clusters. We also identify a higher fraction of slow-rotating Class III stars in IC 348 compared to other clusters; we suggest that some fraction of these may be stars that recently lost their disks. We find that a higher fraction of binary stars are rapid rotators compared to single stars, though not to a statistically significant degree. We also combine our v sin i measurements with rotation periods to estimate projected stellar radii, which we compare to predictions from stellar evolution models using a maximum likelihood method. We continue to show that models with increasing starspot coverage reduce radius inflation and align better with published age estimates than models without starspots.</description>

      <title>Not so Swift: 20 years of multiwavelength observations of Mrk 421 and Mrk 501</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. The blazars Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 have shown multiwavelength variability on all observed timescales, and have been well studied at high energies on short timescales. We aim to characterise the long-term temporal behaviour of these blazars at synchrotron energies, namely optical, UV, and X-ray, in order to assess current models of these objects and their processes. Methods. Amongst the longest light curves ever studied for these sources, we investigated 20 years of data (2005-2025) from the Swift-UVOT and Swift-XRT telescopes. We examined spectral models, fractional variabilities, flux distributions, and X-ray photon index vs flux relations, as well as carrying out in-depth time series analysis using structure functions, Lomb-Scargle periodograms, and discrete correlation functions. Results. Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 both showed intriguing variability in all studied wavelengths; this variability has been found to be energy dependent, as has the trend of lognormality in flux distributions. X-ray photon indices fluctuated greatly throughout the entire period, showing an overall harder-when-brighter trend. Hints of a quasi-periodicity have been found in the X-ray of Mrk 501 (host frame time scale $\sim390$ days, &gt;3$\sigma$) but not in the UV or X-ray of Mrk 421, or in the UV of Mrk 501. No correlation at any time lag was found between the optical/UV and X-ray bands in either source.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Great Attractor: The Local Group's streamline trajectory, cosmic velocity and dynamical fate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Great Attractor using the Manticore-Local suite of digital twins of the nearby Universe. The Great Attractor concept has been proposed as an answer to three distinct questions: what sources the Local Group velocity in the cosmic microwave background frame, where present-day velocity streamlines converge, and where the Local Group is moving to. Addressing the original motivation of the Great Attractor -- explaining the Local Group cosmic velocity -- we find that mass within $155~h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ accounts for only ${\sim}72\%$ of that velocity magnitude with ${\sim}38\,\deg$ directional offset. We show that even in the purely linear regime convergence within this volume is not guaranteed, particularly when also accounting for small-scale contributions to the observer velocity; no single structure, including the proposed Great Attractor, would be expected to dominate the velocity budget. Streamline convergence is smoothing-scale-dependent, transitioning from Virgo at small scales through the Hydra--Centaurus region at intermediate scales to Shapley at large scales; at intermediate smoothing the convergence point lies near Abell 3565 with an asymmetric basin of mass $\log( M / (h^{-1} \mathrm{M}_\odot)) = 16.4 \pm 0.1$ that excludes Norma. To address the third question, we evolve the Manticore-Local realisations to scale factor $a = 10$ in a new Beyond-Present-Time simulation suite and identify the asymptotic future location of the Local Group. We find that the dominant motion is towards Virgo, but even it contributes at most one third of the Local Group velocity. Our results demonstrate that the classical Great Attractor is not a dynamically dominant structure but an artifact of the instantaneous velocity field, and that no single attractor is likely to account for the Local Group motion in the cosmic rest frame.</description>

      <title>Substellar population of the young massive cluster RCW 36 in Vela</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) is a cornerstone of star formation studies, yet its universality remains debated. We investigate the IMF in the young massive cluster RCW 36, located in the Vela Molecular Ridge and comparable to the Orion Nebula Cluster in stellar density. Our goal is to build the most complete census of RCW 36 and derive its first IMF and star-to-brown-dwarf (BD) ratio. We combine new GLAO observations from HAWK-I/VLT with archival data (2MASS, SOFI/NTT) and Gaia DR3 kinematics. Photometric accuracy and source extraction were improved using \textsc{DeNeb}, a deep-learning algorithm that removes complex nebular emission. Membership probabilities were assigned via color-magnitude diagram comparisons with a control field, and stellar masses were estimated using model isochrones. We find a revised distance of $954\pm40\,$pc and determine the IMF down to $\sim0.03\,M_{\odot}$, described by a broken power law ($dN/dM\propto M^{-\alpha}$) with $\alpha=1.62\pm0.03$ for $0.20$-$20\,M_{\odot}$ and $\alpha=0.46\pm0.14$ for $0.03$-$0.20\,M_{\odot}$. The star-BD ratio is $2$-$5$, consistent with other Galactic clusters. Lastly, through a study of the differences in the IMF within and outside $0.2\,$pc and the cumulative mass distributions for low-mass and intermediate to high-mass sources, we also detected signs of possible mass segregation within RCW 36, which should be primordial. RCW 36 shares many characteristics with other young massive clusters, such as a shallower than Salpeter high-mass slope and the possibility of mass segregation. The flatter lower-mass regime of the IMF is similar to most Galactic clusters. The star-BD ratio is also in line with the observed values in other clusters, independent of their inherent properties.</description>

      <title>Dust Properties of the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Revealed by Optical and Near-Infrared Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present independent polarimetric observations of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, including the first near-infrared polarimetric measurements. Using imaging polarimeters, we measured the degree of linear polarization from the visible RC band (0.64 {\mu}m) to the near-infrared KS band (2.25 {\mu}m), and investigated its dependence on solar phase angle (polarization phase curve; PPC) and wavelength (polarization color curve; PCC). We confirm that the PPC of 3I/ATLAS differs significantly from those of typical Solar System comets, showing an unusually large polarization amplitude. This PPC shows no significant change in the RC band across perihelion passage, despite the perihelion lying within the water snow line. This indicates that the unusual polarimetric behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unlikely to be driven by transient volatile activity, but instead reflects intrinsic optical properties of refractory dust particles. The PCC increases with wavelength over 0.6-1.2 {\mu}m and peaks at 1.5-2.0 {\mu}m, suggesting that the dominant scattering units are dust aggregates composed of submicron-sized monomers, broadly consistent with interstellar dust and solar-system cometary aggregates. Taken together, our results indicate that 3I/ATLAS preserves polarimetric properties characteristic of a primitive cometary planetesimal formed in another planetary system, with a refractory dust composition that differs from that typically observed among Solar System comets, despite sharing a similar size scale of the aggregate building blocks.</description>

Abstract: We point out that on 22 January 2026, the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS will align to within an exceptionally small angle, alpha= 0.69 degrees, with the Earth-Sun axis. This rare alignment provides unique circumstances for measuring the opposition surge and polarimetric properties of interstellar cometary dust. We characterize the alignment geometry, outline key scientific opportunities, and define the observational requirements for data collection. Observations before and after the alignment time offer an unprecedented opportunity which may not repeat for decades, for characterizing the albedo, structure, and composition of interstellar matter.</description>

      <title>Evidence of sloshing-driven mini-halo formation in the cool-core cluster RXCJ1558.3-1410</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio mini-halos are perplexing features, typically hosted by X-ray cool-core galaxy clusters. Understanding the connection between thermal X-ray and non-thermal radio emission is key to uncovering their origin. Here, we present a multiwavelength study of the cool-core cluster RXCJ1558.3-1410 using archival Chandra X-ray and wideband uGMRT radio data (Bands 3, 4 and 5). Our improved analysis confirms a previously known X-ray cavity at $\sim$36 kpc south-east of the cluster centre and we report a new cavity at $\sim$42 kpc to the north-west. These cavities suggest that the AGN provides mechanical power of $\sim$$6.0 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, sufficient to offset radiative cooling in the ICM. We also detect a sharp surface brightness edge at $\sim$72 kpc south-east of the centre, characterised by a temperature jump and pressure continuity, consistent with a cold front, likely caused by gas sloshing from a minor merger. Our uGMRT images reveals an interesting diffuse emission surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), with its edge spatially coinciding with the sloshing cold front and roughly with the cooling radius. Furthermore, a low star formation rate and uniform metal abundance up to the sloshing edge are consistent with the earlier findings of suppression of star formation and metallicity homogenisation by mixing core gas through sloshing. Finally, the spatial correlation between the mini-halo and the observed X-ray features indicates that ICM sloshing, rather than AGN feedback, plays a dominant role in powering the proposed radio mini-halo emission.</description>

      <title>The drastic impact of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on massive star populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars are the key engines of the Universe. However, their evolution and thus their ionizing feedback are still not fully understood. One of the largest gaps in current stellar evolution calculations is the lack of a model for the mass ejections that occur when the stars reach the Eddington limit, such as during an Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase. We aim to remedy this situation by providing a physically motivated and empirically calibrated method applicable in any 1D stellar evolution code to approximate the effect of such mass loss on stellar evolution. We employ the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, in which we implement a new mass-loss prescription that is acting when stellar models inflate too much when reaching the Eddington limit. Synthetic massive-star stellar populations using calculated grids of single-star models with this mass loss prescription are compared with the observed populations in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. In combination with already computed grids of binary evolution models, we investigate the impact of binarity on our predictions. Our single-star models reproduce key features of the observed stellar populations, namely (i) the absence of stars located beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit, (ii) an upper limit of RSG luminosities, (iii) the faintest observed single WR stars, (iv) the absolute number of O-stars, WRs, and RSGs, (v) WO stars in low metallicity environments, and (vi) the positions of LBV stars in the HRD. Our binary population explains at the same time the 70% binary fraction of O-stars and the 40% binary fraction of WR stars. However, our synthetic population also has caveats, such as an overproduction of bright H-free WN stars. Our results show that the effect of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on the structure and evolution of massive stars can remove tension between predicted and observed massive star populations.</description>

We identify 19 broad H$\alpha$ emitters with FWHM$&gt;$1000 km/s at z$\approx$4-5.5, including 9 new sources. The broad H$\alpha$ luminosity function (LF) derived from our sample is consistent with those of other JWST-selected broad-line AGN reported in the literature. The black hole masses and AGN bolometric luminosities, inferred from the broad H$\alpha$ components, indicate that most sources are accreting at ~10% of the Eddington limit. We derive their host stellar masses via SED fitting and find higher $M_{BH}/M_{*}$ ratios relative to the local $M_{BH}-M_{*}$ relations, consistent with previous studies. We find that 42% of the sample do not satisfy the widely-used color selection criteria for Little Red Dots (LRDs), with the majority of these sources lacking the characteristic steep rest-optical red slope, indicating that the LRD selection is highly incomplete when selecting AGN galaxies. A comparison of the average SEDs between our sample and LRDs selected in the same field reveals that the steep red slopes observed in some LRDs are likely due to line-boosting effects as previously suggested. Furthermore, we find that 68% of color-selected LRDs with H$\alpha$ detections in the NIRCam/Grism spectra do not exhibit broad-line features. While the limited sensitivity of the grism spectra may hinder the detection of broad-line components in faint sources, our findings still highlight the enigmatic nature of the LRD population.</description>

      <title>Many body effects in the line radiative transfer equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiative transfer equation for spectral lines from an extended gas is derived from first principles, treating the gas as a system of many atoms/molecules rather than isolated ones. Line broadening effects are assumed to be dominated by particle motions (Doppler effect), but collisional broadening effects are included in the impact approximation. We retrieve the canonical radiative transfer equation under the condition that the optical depth over a coherence length, defined as the transition-levels lifetime times the speed of light, is much lower than unity. For other cases, the line radiative transfer equation contains a correction factor whose magnitude depends exponentially on a quantity that we call the coherent optical depth. We compute that many-body effects affect line radiative transfer of strongly emitting and astronomically ubiquitous radio- and submillimeter lines, such as the HI 21 cm line, and rotational transitions of the main isotopologue of CO. These results imply that care must be taken when interpreting observations relying on these lines, as many-body effects can significantly alter emergent line profiles and bias inferred physical conditions of the emitting gas. Finally, we propose a simple laboratory experiment that would reveal many-body effects in the transfer of radiation, which could furthermore offer a cost-effective means of constraining fundamental molecular parameters.</description>

      <title>The Dichotomy in the Nuclear and Host Galaxy Properties of High-redshift Quasars</title>

Abstract: The early growth of high-redshift quasars and their host galaxies raises critical questions about their cosmic evolution. We exploit the angular resolution and sensitivity of NIRCam to investigate the host galaxies of 31 quasars at $4\lesssim z\lesssim7$ drawn from multiple JWST surveys. Using a new multi-band forward-modeling code (\textsc{GalfitS}) that incorporates physically motivated priors, we securely detect and quantify the host emission in 30 objects, while simultaneously characterizing the nuclear spectral energy distribution. The host galaxies of high-redshift quasars are $\sim 0.3$~dex more compact than star-forming galaxies of comparable mass. A striking dichotomy emerges: luminous ``blue'' quasars ($L_{5100}\gtrsim10^{45}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$) reside in bulge-dominated galaxies ($n \approx 5$) and exhibit a narrow range of ultraviolet nuclear slopes (median $\beta_{\rm UV} \approx -1.4$), while fainter ``red'' quasars inhabit disk-like hosts ($n\approx 1$) and display a broad range of slopes ($\beta_{\rm UV}\approx-2$ to 4). These two populations differ markedly in their black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, with high-luminosity quasars showing $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_\ast = 1.2\%$ compared to $4.7\%$ for lower luminosity sources, placing them collectively $\sim$0.6~dex above the local $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\ast$ relation. This offset likely reflects rapid black hole growth in early gas-rich environments, where feedback from the active galactic nucleus becomes effective only after substantial gas depletion. Our findings suggest that the observed dichotomy, whether due to intrinsic spectral differences or dust extinction, fundamentally shapes the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Identifying lopsidedness in spiral galaxies using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: About 30\% of disk galaxies show lopsidedness in their stellar disk. Although such a large-scale asymmetry in the disk can be primarily looked upon as a long-lived mode ($m=1$), the physical origin of the lopsidedness in the disk continues to be a puzzle. In this work, we employ a transfer-learning approach for the automated identification of lopsided galaxies using SDSS DR18 imaging by fine-tuning a Zoobot model, a deep convolutional neural network package pre-trained on the Galaxy Zoo dataset. We obtain 7,042 well-resolved, nearly face-on spiral galaxies from SDSS DR18 over the redshift range 0.01 $\leq z \leq 0.1$, with extinction-corrected g-band model magnitude &lt; 16 and Petrosian radius (enclosing 90 \% of the flux) $\geq$ 3 arcsec. Out of these, we visually identify 490 lopsided and 444 symmetric galaxy samples suitable for training. The trained model achieves a testing accuracy of $(87 \pm 0.02)$ \%, averaged over 10 independent trials. Using the best-performing model, we identify 3,679 lopsided and 2,429 symmetric galaxies from the remaining sample. Of these, 2,658 lopsided and 1,455 symmetric galaxies are predicted with are predicted with high prediction probability $P_{pred} \geq 0.85$. Lopsided galaxies in our predicted samples are relatively high star-forming, bluer, low-concentration (late-type), low-mass galaxies compared to the symmetric galaxies. Our study produces an usable catalogue of lopsided and symmetric galaxies, which will offer new insights into the formation of lopsidedness in disk galaxies. The dataset and the best-performing model are made publicly available through GitHub at https://github.com/bijusaha-astro/CNN_lopsided</description>

      <title>A $\tau-$DM relation for FRB hosts?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been proposed that measurements of scattering times ($\tau$) from fast radio bursts (FRB) may be used to infer the FRB host dispersion measure (DM) and its redshift. This approach relies on the existence of a correlation between $\tau$ and DM within FRB hosts such as that observed for Galactic pulsars. We assess the measurability of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation through simulated observations of FRBs within the ASKAP/CRAFT survey, taking into account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts intrinsically follow the $\tau - $DM relation measured for pulsars, this correlation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises mostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the Macquart relation, the variance within the $\tau - $DM relation itself, and observational biases against large $\tau$ values. We argue that theoretical relations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of galaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation between scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if our understanding of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation is correct.</description>

      <title>JADES: the chemical enrichment pattern of distant galaxies -- $\alpha$ enhancement, silicon depletion, and iron enhancement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present gas-phase abundances of carbon (C), $\alpha$-elements (O, Ne, Si, and Ar) and iron (Fe) obtained from stacked spectra of high-$z$ star-forming galaxies with the deep Near Infrared Spectrograph medium-resolution data from the James Webb Space Telescope Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. Our 564 sources at $z=4$--7 have a median stellar mass of $\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})=8.46$ and a median star-formation rate of $\log(\mathrm{SFR}/M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}})=0.30$, placing them close to the star-formation main sequence. We find that the stacked spectrum of all our 564 sources has relatively low [C/O]$=-0.70$, moderate [Ne/O]$=-0.09$, and low [Ar/O]$=-0.28$ values at a low gas-phase metallicity of $12+\log(\mathrm{O/H})=7.71$ ($Z\sim 0.1~Z_\odot$), suggesting dominant yields of core-collapse supernovae evolved from massive stars. The detection of a weak SiIII] emission line in our stacked spectrum provides a silicon-to-oxygen abundance ratio of [Si/O]$=-0.63$, which is lower than that of stars in the Milky Way disc and lower than expected by chemical evolution models, suggesting silicon depletion onto dust grains. Likewise, this Si/O value is lower than that we newly derive for two individual $z&gt;6$ galaxies (GN-z11 and RXCJ2248) with negligible dust attenuation. By performing spectral stacking in bins of $M_{*}$, SFR, specific SFR (sSFR), and ultra-violet (UV) continuum slope $\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$, we identify [FeIII] line detections in the high-sSFR bin and the blue-$\beta_{\mathrm{UV}}$ bin, both of which exhibit supersolar Fe/O ratios, while their C/O, Ar/O, and Si/O ratios are comparable to those of the all-sources stack. Our findings support a chemically young gas composition with rapid dust depletion in the general population of high-$z$ star-forming galaxies, while raising the possibility of anomalous, selective Fe/O enhancement at the very early epoch of star formation.</description>

      <title>Signatures of dark subhalos in dwarf spheroidal galaxies: I. Fluctuations in surface density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) subhalos offer critical tests of cosmological models through their abundance and properties, yet most remain undetectable due to their lack of stars. We investigate whether their presence leaves measurable imprints on the projected stellar density fields of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Building on literature $N$-body experiments, we show that subhalo interactions induce subtle out-of-equilibrium fluctuations appearing as density corrugations. In a CDM framework, these fluctuations are dominated by the most massive subhalos in the host halo. We develop a Fourier-based framework to quantify these features, identifying characteristic peaks in the spatial frequency spectrum that are well described by Voigt profiles. The peak parameters are sensitive to both the subhalo mass function and the number of stellar tracers. For the configurations tested, $N_{\star} \sim 10^5$ stars suffice to detect subhalo populations with $M_{\rm subhalo} \lesssim 10^6~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, while larger masses produce stronger and more complex signatures. We assess the feasibility of this technique by analyzing Gaia and HST data: in this context, the Fornax dwarf shows residual low-frequency structures resembling those in our controlled subhalo experiments, making it an interesting case for follow-up. Prospectively, wide-field surveys such as Euclid, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory are expected to deliver stellar samples of $N_{\star} \sim 10^5$ per dwarf, offering compelling prospects for probing subhalo imprints. Our results introduce a novel pathway to constrain the subhalo mass function in dSphs, and motivate follow-up work that incorporates alternative DM models and additional dynamical perturbations.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: The Hidden Neighbours of OI Absorbers during Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metal absorbers represent a powerful probe of galaxy feedback and reionization, as highlighted by both observational and theoretical results showing an increased abundance of low-ionised metal species at higher redshifts. The origin of such absorbers is currently largely unknown because of the low number of galaxy counterparts detected, suggesting that they might be surrounded by low-mass faint sources below the current detection threshold. We use the THESAN-ZOOM radiation hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the connection between properties of neutral oxygen (OI) absorbers and galaxies across redshift $z = 5 - 8$. We find that the virialised gas in haloes becomes progressively ionised with cosmic time, leading to a decrease of $\approx 0.2$ in the covering fraction of neutral oxygen, while the total oxygen covering fraction remains constant. Comparing the OI line density obtained from our covering fractions with the trend suggested by blind quasar observations, we determine that the observable absorbers ($N_{\rm OI} \gtrsim 10^{13}\,\text{cm}^{-2}$) are not confined to haloes: at $z \geq 5$ the majority ($\gtrsim 60\%$) arise beyond $R_{\rm{vir}}$, consistent with recent JWST results. Close to OI absorbers, low-mass galaxies ($M_\star \leq 10^8\,\rm{M}_\odot$) are more commonly found, while, depending on the simulated environment, we do not exclude the possibility of nearby more massive star-forming sources ($\geq 5\,\text{M}_\odot\,\text{yr}^{-1}$) similar to those suggested by the latest ALMA observations. These results establish OI absorbers as sensitive tracers of the evolving ionisation structure around faint galaxies to be probed by forthcoming deep spectroscopic surveys.</description>

Abstract: Jets from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are expected to heat the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). We investigate how the interaction between jets and the ICM appears in high-resolution X-ray observations using mock X-ray observations based on two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We constructed a model of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) similar to Cygnus A (Cyg A), a powerful FR II radio galaxy. Our simulations model bipolar jets propagating into a stratified ICM, forming forward shocks and low-density cocoons. Based on these results, we generate synthetic spectra that incorporate both shocked and unshocked ICM components. Then, we perform mock observations using the XRISM/Resolve X-ray spectrometer. We focus particularly on viewing angle effects. Our mock observations revealed that the smallest line broadening, observed as velocity dispersion, associated with the cocoon's bulk expansion occurs when observing along the jet direction, where the expansion velocity is highest. Although this may appear counterintuitive, it occurs because the rapidly expanding jet head contributes little to X-ray emission due to its high temperature and low density. Our results highlight the importance of considering the temperature and density structure of AGN-driven shocks and cocoons when interpreting XRISM data. These findings lay the groundwork for XRISM's observations of AGN jets and will improve our understanding of AGN feedback processes in galaxy clusters.</description>

Abstract: For a sample of masers, the basic kinematic equations were solved by including the Galactic rotation parameters and the peculiar velocity of the Sun as the unknown variables. Based on spectral analysis, the following estimates were obtained: $|f|_{R,\theta}=(7.0,5.1)\pm(1.2,1.4)$ km s$^{-1}$ and the corresponding wavelengths $\lambda_{R,\theta}=(1.9,1.7)\pm(0.4,0.7)$ kpc, as well as $\chi_\odot=-140^\circ\pm15^\circ$. The presence of periodic perturbations in the vertical velocities of masers with an amplitude of $|f|_W=3.1\pm1.4$ km s$^{-1}$ and a wavelength of $\lambda=1.9\pm0.8$ kpc was confirmed. It is shown that the velocities $f_R$ and $f_\theta$ can have both the same and different signs. Therefore, we obtained a large scatter of estimates. Thus, if $f_R$ and $f_\theta$ have the same signs, then $\Omega_p=25.8\pm2.0$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and $R_{cor}=9.1\pm0.8$ kpc. And when $f_R$ and $f_\theta$ have different signs, then $\Omega_p=35.4\pm2.0$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and $R_{cor}=6.8\pm0.8$ kpc.</description>

      <title>PHANGS-JWST: the largest extragalactic molecular cloud catalog traced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution JWST images of nearby spiral galaxies reveal polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission structures that trace molecular gas, including CO-dark regions. We identify ISM cloud structures in PHANGS-JWST 7.7 $\mu$m PAH maps for 66 galaxies, smoothed to 30 pc and at native resolution, extracting 108,466 and 146,040 clouds, respectively. Molecular properties were inferred using a linear conversion from PAH to CO. Given the tendency for clouds in galaxy centers to overlap in velocity space, we opted to flag these and omit them from the analysis in this work. The remaining clouds correspond to giant molecular clouds, such as those detected in CO(2-1) emission by ALMA, or lower surface density clouds that either fall below the ALMA detection limits of existing maps or genuinely have no molecular counterpart. Cross-matching with ALMA CO maps at 90 pc in 27 galaxies shows that 41 % of PAH clouds have CO associations. The converted molecular properties vary little across environments, but the most massive clouds are preferentially found in spiral arms. Fitting lognormal mass distributions down to $2\times10^{3} M_{\odot}$ shows that spiral arms host the highest-mass clouds, consistent with enhanced formation in arm gravitational potentials. Cloud molecular surface densities decline by a factor of $\sim 1.5-2$ toward $2 - 3 R_{e}$. However, the trend largely varies in individual galaxies, with flat, decreasing, and even no trend as a function of galactocentric radius. Factors like large-scale processes and morphologies might influence the observed trends. We publish two catalogs online, one at the common resolution of 30 pc and another at the native resolution. We expect them to have broad utility for future PAH clouds, molecular clouds, and star formation studies.</description>

Abstract: We introduce J-HERTz (J-PLUS Heritage Exploration of Radio Targets at $z &lt; 5$), a new multi-wavelength catalog that combines optical narrow-band photometry from J-PLUS, infrared observations from WISE, and deep low-frequency radio data from LoTSS for nearly half a million sources across 2,100 deg$^2$ of the northern sky. Key innovations of J-HERTz include Bayesian neural network classifications for 390,000 galaxies, 31,000 quasars, and 20,000 stars, along with significantly improved photometric redshifts for 235,000 galaxies compared to previous J-PLUS DR3 and LoTSS DR2 estimates. We identify 831 candidate Galactic radio stars, which, if confirmed, would constitute a significant addition to the number of radio-emitting stars identified to date. Among radio-loud galaxies with spectroscopic observations, $\gtrsim$20% lack Seyfert or LINER signatures, indicating a substantial population of optically quiescent radio galaxies, in agreement with previous works. Spectral energy distribution fitting of their host galaxies using J-PLUS photospectra reveals systematically low specific star formation rates, consistent with quenched stellar populations. J-HERTz thus provides a powerful dataset to exploit radio-optical synergies, enabling studies that span from the origin of stellar radio emission to the AGN life cycle and the role of jet activity in shaping host galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Spectuner-D1: Spectral Line Fitting of Interstellar Molecules Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral lines from interstellar molecules provide crucial insights into the physical and chemical conditions of the interstellar medium. Traditional spectral line analysis relies heavily on manual intervention, which becomes impractical when handling the massive datasets produced by modern facilities like ALMA. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning framework to automate spectral line fitting. Using observational data from ALMA, we train a neural network that maps both molecular spectroscopic data and observed spectra to physical parameters such as excitation temperature and column density. The neural network predictions can serve as initial estimates and be further refined using a local optimizer. Our method achieves consistent fitting results compared to global optimization with multiple runs, while reducing the number of forward modeling runs by an order of magnitude. We apply our method to pixel-level fitting for an observation of the G327.3-0.6 hot core and validate our results using XCLASS. We perform the fitting for typical complex organic molecules of hot cores, including CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$OCHO, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$CN, and C$_2$H$_3$CN. For a 100 $\times$ 100 region covering 5 GHz bandwidth, the fitting process requires 4.9 to 41.9 minutes using a desktop with 16 cores and one consumer-grade GPU card.</description>

      <title>Rotational Kinematics in the Globular Cluster System of M31: Insights from Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As ancient stellar systems, globular clusters (GCs) offer valuable insights into the dynamical histories of large galaxies. Previous studies of GC populations in the inner and outer regions of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) have revealed intriguing subpopulations with distinct kinematic properties. Here, we build upon earlier studies by employing Bayesian modelling to investigate the kinematics of the combined inner and outer GC populations of M31. Given the heterogeneous nature of the data, we examine subpopulations defined by GCs' metallicity and by associations with substructure, in order to characterise possible relationships between the inner and outer GC populations. We find that lower-metallicity GCs and those linked to substructures exhibit a common, more rapid rotation, whose alignment is distinct from that of higher-metallicity and non-substructure GCs. Furthermore, the higher-metallicity GCs rotate in alignment with Andromeda's stellar disk. These pronounced kinematic differences reinforce the idea that different subgroups of GCs were accreted to M31 at distinct epochs, shedding light on the complex assembly history of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Rotation of the Globular Cluster Population of the Dark Matter Deficient Galaxy NGC 1052-DF4: Implication for the Total Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the globular cluster population of NGC 1052-DF4, a dark matter deficient galaxy, using Bayesian inference to search for the presence of rotation. The existence of such a rotating component is relevant to the estimation of the mass of the galaxy, and therefore the question of whether NGC 1052-DF4 is truly deficient of dark matter, similar to NGC 1052-DF2 another galaxy in the same group. The rotational characteristics of seven globular clusters in NGC 1052-DF4 were investigated, finding that a non-rotating kinematic model has a higher Bayesian evidence than a rotating model, by a factor of approximately 2.5. In addition, we find that under the assumption of rotation, its amplitude must be small. This distinct lack of rotation strengthens the case that, based on its intrinsic velocity dispersion, NGC 1052-DF4 is a truly dark matter deficient galaxy.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Star Properties from Future High-Precision Measurements of Their Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future high-precision X-ray and gravitational-wave observations of neutron stars (NSs) are expected to constrain NS radii with uncertainties as small as $\sigma \simeq 0.1$~km. Such unprecedented precision offers a unique opportunity to extract new information about the nature and equation of state (EOS) of supradense matter in NS cores. Using mock radius data with uncertainties ranging from $\sigma = 1.0$ to $0.1$~km, together with a flexible meta-model NS EOS that allows for a first-order hadron-quark phase transition, we perform a Bayesian statistical analysis to assess the impact of radius measurements on EOS constraints. We find that high-precision radius measurements, particularly for massive NSs, significantly tighten constraints on the hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$, the quark matter mass fraction in NS cores, and several parameters characterizing the EOS of supranuclear hadronic matter, although the degree of improvement depends on the assumed prior range of $\rho_t$. In contrast, even with the highest precision considered, NS radii -- including those of massive stars -- remain largely insensitive to the stiffness of quark matter, independent of the measurement accuracy or the prior range adopted for $\rho_t$.</description>

      <title>A planet-host ratio relation to synthesize microlensing and transiting exoplanet demography from Roman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NASA Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will be the first survey able to detect large numbers of both cold and hot exoplanets across Galactic distances: $\sim$1,400 cold exoplanets via microlensing and $\sim$200,000 hot, transiting planets. Differing sensitivities to planet bulk properties between the microlensing and transit methods require relations like a planet mass--radius relation (MRR) to mediate. We propose using instead a planet--host {\em ratio} relation (PHRR) to couple directly microlensing and transit observables in demographic forward-modelling simulations. Unlike the MRR, a PHRR uses parameters that are always measured and so can potentially leverage the full Roman exoplanet sample. Using 908 confirmed exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we show that transit depth, $\delta$, and planet--host mass ratio, $q$, obey a PHRR that is continuous over all planet scales. The PHRR is improved by including orbital period, $P$, and host effective temperature, $T_{\star}$. We compare several candidate PHRRs of the form $\delta (q,T_\star, P)$, with the Bayesian Information Criterion favouring power-law dependence on $T_\star$ and $P$, and broken power-law dependence on $q$. The break in $q$ itself depends on $T_\star$, as do the power-law slopes in $q$ either side of the break. The favoured PHRR achieves a fairly uniform $50\%$ relative precision in $\delta$ for all $q$. Approximately $5\%$ of the sample has a transit depth that is strongly over-predicted by the PHRR; around half of these are associated with large stars ($R_\star &gt; 2.5 \, R_{\odot}$) potentially subject to Malmquist bias.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of HCN ($J=3-2$) rotational emission from comet 3I/ATLAS at a heliocentric distance of 2.13 AU with the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). Observations were conducted from 07 August 2025 and 14 September 2025 (UT) using the $^{\prime}\overline U^{\prime}\overline u$ heterodyne receiver and ACSIS spectroscopic backend. The HCN line was detected at $&gt;6\sigma$ on 14 Sep 2025 (UT) and a production rate of $Q({\rm HCN})=(4.0\pm1.7)\times10^{25}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$ was derived by non-LTE radiative transfer modelling. Preliminary estimates of the HCN/H$_2$O and CN/HCN abundance ratios suggest values similar to Solar System comets.</description>

      <title>Luminosity-Dependent Assembly Bias of Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing and Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assembly bias, which is the variation in halo clustering at fixed mass driven by formation history, has long been predicted by numerical simulations but remains difficult to confirm observationally. Previous studies have reported evidence for halo assembly bias by dividing samples according to galaxy stellar mass using various methods. In this work, we present observational measurements of halo assembly bias based on the luminosity of spectroscopically confirmed brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Using cluster catalogs and shear measurements from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, we employ a mass-dependent halo-bias model to disentangle halo bias from its underlying mass dependence in galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering measurements. We confirm that brighter BCGs are less strongly clustered on large scales, with a relative bias ratio deviating from unity at the $\sim3\sigma$ level, suggesting the presence of assembly bias. Similar qualitative trends are also found in the FLAMINGO and MillenniumTNG hydrodynamical simulations, strengthening the connection between galaxy luminosity and halo formation history.</description>

      <title>A new estimate of the zero-point shift of the Gaia DR3 parallaxes obtained from a comparison with VLBI measurements of masers and radio stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most complete sample of radio stars and masers with trigonometric parallaxes measured by the VLBI method, common with the Gaia EDR3 and Gaia DR3 catalogs, has been compiled using literature data. The sample contains 151 stars. An analysis of the differences in parallaxes and proper motions of Gaia-VLBI stars has been performed. A new estimate of the systematic shift of the Gaia parallax zero point relative to the inertial coordinate system has been obtained: $\Delta\pi=-0.038\pm0.011$ mas. The obtained estimates of the relative rotation rates confirm the absence of a significant rotation of the Gaia\,DR3 system relative to the extragalactic coordinate system, which in this case is represented by VLBI measurements.</description>

      <title>The AIDA-TNG project: dark matter profiles and concentrations in alternative dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) scenario, the density profiles of dark matter haloes are well described by analytical models linking their concentration to halo mass. Alternative scenarios, such as warm dark matter (WDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), modify the inner structure of haloes and predict different profile shapes and central slopes. We employ the AIDA-TNG simulations to investigate how alternative dark matter physics and baryonic processes jointly shape the internal structure of haloes. Using dark-matter-only and full-physics runs, we measure the dark matter density profiles of haloes spanning six orders of magnitude in mass, from 10^9.5 Msun to 10^14.5 Msub, and characterise them with multiple analytical models. We provide the distribution of the best-fitting parameters, as well as the concentration-mass relation in WDM and SIDM. The Einasto profile well reproduces the inner flattening produced in WDM models, both in the collisionless and in the full-physics runs. In SIDM dark-matter-only runs, haloes are better described by explicitly cored profiles, with core sizes that depend on mass and on the self-interaction model. When baryons are included, the differences between CDM and SIDM decrease, and such large dark-matter cores no longer form because adiabatic contraction in the baryon-dominated region counteracts self-interactions. Nevertheless, the coupling between baryons and self-interactions induces a broader range of inner slopes, including cases that are steeper than CDM at Milky Way masses. Alternative dark matter physics thus leaves clear signatures in the inner halo structure, even if baryons significantly reshape these differences. Our results are useful for future studies that need to predict the properties of haloes in multiple dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength properties of changing-state active galactic nuclei: I. the evolution of soft excess and X-ray continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Changing-state active galactic nuclei (CSAGNs) exhibit rapid variability, with mass accretion rates that can change by several orders of magnitude in a few years. This provides us with a unique opportunity to study the evolution of the inner accretion flow almost in real time. Here, we used over 1000 observations to study the broadband X-ray spectra of a sample of five CSAGNs, spanning three orders of magnitude in Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$), using phenomenological models to trace the evolution of key spectral components. We derive several fundamental parameters, such as the photon index, soft excess strength, reflection strength, and luminosities of the soft excess and primary continuum. We find that the soft excess and primary continuum emissions show a very strong positive correlation ($p \ll 10^{-10}$), suggesting a common physical origin. The soft excess strength does not show any dependency on the reflection parameter, suggesting that in these objects the soft excess is not dominated by a blurred ionized reflection process. On the other hand, the strength of the soft excess is found to be strongly positively correlated with the Eddington ratio ($p \ll 10^{-10}$), and we find that the soft excess vanishes below $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim -2.5$. Moreover, we find a clear `V'-shaped relation for $\Gamma-\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, with a break at $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd} = -2.47 \pm 0.09$. Our findings indicate a change in the geometry of the inner accretion flow at low Eddington ratios, and that the soft excess is primarily produced via warm Comptonization.</description>
