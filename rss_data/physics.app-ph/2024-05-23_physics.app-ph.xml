      <title>Dielectric and energy-storage properties of Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.10Ti0.90O3 ceramics with BaO-Na2O-Nb2O5-WO3-P2O5 glass addition</title>

Abstract: Lead-free Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.10Ti0.90O3 (BCZT) ceramics with different BaO-Na2O-Nb2O5-WO3-P2O5 (BNNWP) glass content, forming (1-x)BCZT-xBNNWP lead-free ceramics (abbreviated as BCZTx; x=0, 2, 4, 6, and 8wt%) were synthesized using the conventional solid-state processing route. The XRD investigation shows the coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases in BCZT pure. Likewise, only the tetragonal phase was detected in BCZTx (x = 2-8 wt%) ceramics. The SEM findings indicate that the average grain size decreases as the amount of BNNWP glass additives increases. In addition, BCZT ceramics Amodified with glass additions showed narrower hysteresis loops and a large electric field. The BCZT4 showed the highest recovered energy density of 0.52 J/cm3 at 135kV/cm with an energy storage efficiency of 62.4%, which is increased by 6.6 compared to BCZT0 (0.075 J/cm3). The energy density was also calculated using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory</description>

      <title>Giant Real-time Strain-Induced Anisotropy Field Tuning in Suspended Yttrium Iron Garnet Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yttrium Iron Garnet based tunable magnetostatic wave and spin wave devices are poised to revolutionize the fields of Magnonics, Spintronics, Microwave devices, and quantum information science. The magnetic bias required for operating and tuning these devices is traditionally achieved through large power-hungry electromagnets, which significantly restraints the integration scalability, energy efficiency and individual resonator addressability. While controlling the magnetism of YIG mediated through its magnetostrictive/magnetoelastic interaction would address this constraint and enable novel strain/stress coupled magnetostatic wave (MSW) and spin wave (SW) devices, effective real-time strain-induced magnetism change in YIG remains elusive due to its weak magnetoelastic coupling efficiency and substrate clamping effect. We demonstrate a heterogeneous YIG-on-Si MSW resonator with a suspended thin-film device structure, which allows significant straining of YIG to generate giant magnetism change in YIG. By straining the YIG thin-film in real-time up to 1.06%, we show, for the first time, a 1.837 GHz frequency-strain tuning in MSW/SW resonators, which is equivalent to an effective strain-induced magnetocrystalline anisotropy field of 642 Oe. This is significantly higher than the previous state-of-the-art of 0.27 GHz of strain tuning in YIG. The unprecedented strain tunability of these YIG resonators paves the way for novel energy-efficient integrated on-chip solutions for tunable microwave, photonic, magnonic, and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Impurity-level induced broadband photoelectric response in wide-band semiconductor SrSnO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband spectrum detectors exhibit great promise in fields such as multispectral imaging and optical communications. Despite significant progress, challenges like materials instability, complex manufacturing process and high costs still hinder further application. Here we present a method that achieves broadband spectral detect by impurity-level in SrSnO3. We report over 200 mA/W photo-responsivity at 275 nm (ultraviolet C solar-bind) and 367 nm (ultraviolet A) and ~ 1 mA/W photo-responsivity at 532 nm and 700 nm (visible) with a voltage bias of 5V. Further transport and photoluminescence results indicate that the broadband response comes from the impurity levels and mutual interactions. Additionally, the photodetector demonstrates excellent robustness and stability under repeated tests and prolonged exposure in air. These findings show the potential of SSO photodetectors and propose a method to achieve broadband spectrum detection, creating new possibility for the development of single-phase, low-cost, simple structure and high-efficiency photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Tough Cortical Bone-Inspired Tubular Architected Cement-based Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cortical bone is a tough biological material composed of tube-like osteons embedded in the organic matrix surrounded by weak interfaces known as cement lines. The cement lines provide a microstructurally preferable crack path, hence triggering in-plane crack deflection around osteons due to cement line-crack interaction. Here, inspired by this toughening mechanism and facilitated by a hybrid (3D-printing/casting) process, we engineer architected tubular cement-based materials with a new stepwise cracking toughening mechanism, that enabled a non-brittle fracture. Using experimental and theoretical approaches, we demonstrate the underlying competition between tube size and shape on the stress intensity factor from which engineering stepwise cracking can emerge. Two competing mechanisms, both positively and negatively affected by the growing tube size, arise to significantly enhance the overall fracture toughness by up to 5.6-fold compared to the monolithic brittle counterpart without sacrificing the specific strength. This is enabled by crack-tube interaction and engineering the tube size and shape, which leads to stepwise cracking and promotes rising R-curves. Disorder curves are proposed for the first time to quantitatively characterize the degree of disorder for describing the representation of architected arrangement of materials (using statistical mechanics parameters) in lieu of otherwise inadequate periodicity classification.</description>

      <title>Target Field Design of Surface Permanent Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a target field approach to analytically design magnetic fields using permanent magnets. We assume that their magnetisation is bound to a two-dimensional surface and is composed of a complete basis of surface modes. By posing the Poisson's equation relating the magnetic scalar potential to the magnetisation using Green's functions, we derive simple integrals which determine the magnetic field generated by each mode. This approach is demonstrated by deriving the governing integrals for optimising axial magnetisation on cylindrical and circular-planar surfaces. We approximate the governing integrals numerically and implement them into a regularised least-squares optimisation routine to design permanent magnets that generate uniform axial and transverse target magnetic fields. The resulting uniform axial magnetic field profiles demonstrate more than a tenfold increase in uniformity across equivalent target regions compared to the field generated by an optimally separated axially magnetised pair of rings, as validated using finite element method simulations. We use a simple example to examine how two-dimensional surface magnetisation profiles can be emulated using thin three-dimensional volumes and determine how many discrete intervals are required to accurately approximate a continuously-varying surface pattern. Magnets designed using our approach may enable higher quality bias fields for electric machines, nuclear fusion, fundamental physics, magnetic trapping, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Ferri-ionic Coupling in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ Nanoflakes: Polarization States and Controllable Negative Capacitance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$ covered by an ionic surface charge and reveal the appearance of polar states with relatively high polarization ~5 microC/cm$^2$ and stored free charge ~10 microC/cm$%2$, which can mimic "mid-gap" states related with a surface field-induced transfer of Cu and/or In ions in the van der Waals gap. The change in the ionic screening degree and mismatch strains induce a broad range of the transitions between paraelectric phase, antiferroelectric, ferrielectric, and ferri-ionic states in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. The states' stability and/or metastability is determined by the minimum of the system free energy consisting of electrostatic energy, elastic energy, and a Landau-type four-well potential of the ferrielectric dipole polarization. The possibility to govern the transitions by strain and ionic screening can be useful for controlling the tunneling barrier in thin film devices based on CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. Also, we predict that the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes reveal features of the controllable negative capacitance effect, which make them attractive for advanced electronic devices, such as nano-capacitors and gate oxide nanomaterials with reduced heat dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1808.06706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compact Marx generator was built to mimic a spark-gap Tesla transformer. The generator produced radio-frequency pulses of up to $\pm$200 kV and $\pm$15 A with a frequency between 110 to 280 kHz at a repetition rate of 120 Hz. The generator tolerated larger circuit-parameter perturbations than is expected for conventional Tesla transformers. Possible applications include research on the control and laser guiding of spark discharges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.05571v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moir\'{e} effect provides an interpretation for the steering of antennas that form beams through internal spatial interferences. We make an explicit connection between such antennas and the moir\'{e} effect, and use it to model six planar antennas that steer by scaling, rotating, or translating operations. Three of the antennas illustrate how to use moir\'{e} patterns to generate antenna designs.</description>

      <title>A rapid approach to urban traffic noise mapping with a generative adversarial network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With rapid urbanisation and the accompanying increase in traffic density, traffic noise has become a major concern in urban planning. However, traditional grid noise mapping methods have limitations in terms of time consumption, software costs, and a lack of parameter integration interfaces. These limitations hinder their ability to meet the need for iterative updates and rapid performance feedback in the early design stages of street-scale urban planning. Herein, we developed a rapid urban traffic noise mapping technique that leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a surrogate model. This approach enables the rapid assessment of urban traffic noise distribution by using urban elements such as roads and buildings as the input. The mean values for the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM) are 0.0949 and 0.8528, respectively, for the validation dataset. Hence, our prediction accuracy is on par with that of conventional prediction software. Furthermore, the trained model is integrated into Grasshopper as a tool, facilitating the rapid generation of traffic noise maps. This integration allows urban designers and planners, even those without expertise in acoustics, to easily anticipate changes in acoustics impacts caused by design.</description>

      <title>Novel dielectric resonance of composites containing randomly distributed ZrB2 particles with continuous dual-peak microwave absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Substantial efforts have been devoted to the elaborate component and microstructure design of absorbents (inclusions) in microwave absorbing (MA) composite materials. However, mesoscopic architectures of composites also play significant roles in prescribing their electromagnetic properties, which are rarely explored in studies of MA materials. Herein, a composite containing randomly distributed ZrB2 particles is fabricated to offer a mesoscopic cluster configuration, which produces a novel dielectric resonance. The resonance disappears and reoccurs when ZrB2 is coated with the insulating and semiconductive ZrO2 layer respectively, suggesting that it is a plasmon resonance excited by the electron transport between ZrB2 particles in clusters rather than any intrinsic resonances of materials constituting the composite. The resonance strength can be regulated by controlling the quantity of the electron transport between particles, which is accomplished by gradually increasing the insulating ZrO2-coated ZrB2 ratio x to disturb the electron transport in ternary disordered composites containing ZrB2 and insulating ZrO2-coated ZrB2. When x exceeds 0.7, the electron transport is cut off completely and the resonance thus disappears. The resonance induces unusual double quarter-wavelength interference cancellations or resonance absorption coupled with quarter-wavelength interference cancellation, giving rise to continuous dual-peak absorption. This work highlights the significance of mesoscopic architectures of composites in MA material design, which can be exploited to prescribe novel electromagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for exoplanet detection in high-contrast spectroscopy Combining cross correlation maps and deep learning on medium-resolution integral-field spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of high-contrast imaging instruments combined with medium-resolution spectrographs allows spectral and temporal dimensions to be combined with spatial dimensions to detect and potentially characterize exoplanets with higher sensitivity. We develop a new method to effectively leverage the spectral and spatial dimensions in integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) datasets using a supervised deep-learning algorithm to improve the detection sensitivity to high-contrast exoplanets. We begin by applying a data transform whereby the IFS datasets are replaced by cross-correlation coefficient tensors obtained by cross-correlating our data with young gas giant spectral template spectra. This transformed data is then used to train machine learning (ML) algorithms. We train a 2D CNN and 3D LSTM with our data. We compare the ML models with a non-ML algorithm, based on the STIM map of arXiv:1810.06895. We test our algorithms on simulated young gas giants in a dataset that contains no known exoplanet, and explore the sensitivity of algorithms to detect these exoplanets at contrasts ranging from 1e-3 to 1e-4 at different radial separations. We quantify the sensitivity using modified receiver operating characteristic curves (mROC). We discover that the ML algorithms produce fewer false positives and have a higher true positive rate than the STIM-based algorithm, and the true positive rate of ML algorithms is less impacted by changing radial separation. We discover that the velocity dimension is an important differentiating factor. Through this paper, we demonstrate that ML techniques have the potential to improve the detection limits and reduce false positives for directly imaged planets in IFS datasets, after transforming the spectral dimension into a radial velocity dimension through a cross-correlation operation.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of optical nanofiber tips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the fabrication of an optical nanofiber tip (ONFT) using a two-step chemical etching technique. This technique employs 30% and 24% hydrofluoric (HF) acid for the first and second steps, respectively. In the first step, a silica single-mode fiber with clad diameter of 125 um and core diameter of 10 um is immersed in the HF acid for 90 minutes. The resultant fiber diameter is reduced to 45 um. In the second step, such a fiber is again immersed in the HF acid for 60-80 minutes. The etching time is controlled to achieve the desired tip diameter of the ONFT. We characterize fabricated ONFTs by measuring optical transmission and surface morphology. The observed optical transmissions are more than 30% and tip diameters are less than 500 nm. The measured results readily reveal the merit of the employed technique as it is easy and cost-effective. Due to the strong confinement of the electromagnetic field at the tip of ONFTs, these structures lay versatile platforms with potential applications in sensing, photonics, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Realization of Singular Topological Edge States in Locally Resonant Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate singular topological edge states in a locally resonant metamaterial with a configuration based on inversion-symmetric extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains. Such states arise from a topological gap transition from a conventional Bragg-type gap (BG) to a local resonance-induced gap (LRG), accompanied by a topological phase transition. Remarkably, nontrivial topological states can emerge in the vicinity of the singularity in the imaginary parts of the wavenumber within the bandgap, leading to highly localized modes on a scale comparable to a single subwavelength unit cell. We experimentally demonstrate distinct differences in topologically protected modes-highlighted by wave localization-between the BG and the LRG in locally resonant granular-based metamaterials. Our findings suggest the scope of topological metamaterials may be extended via their bandgap nature.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature waveguide-integrated photodetector using bolometric effect for mid-infrared spectroscopy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waveguide-integrated mid-infrared (MIR) photodetectors are pivotal components for developing molecular spectroscopy applications, leveraging mature photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technologies. Despite various strategies, critical challenges still remain in achieving broadband photoresponse, cooling-free operation, and large-scale complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible manufacturability. To leap beyond these limitations, the bolometric effect - a thermal detection mechanism - is introduced into the waveguide platform. More importantly, we pursue a free-carrier absorption (FCA) process in germanium (Ge) to create an efficient light-absorbing medium, providing a pragmatic solution for full coverage of the MIR spectrum without incorporating exotic materials into CMOS. Here, we present an uncooled waveguide-integrated photodetector based on a Ge-on-insulator (Ge-OI) PIC architecture, exploiting the bolometric effect combined with FCA. Notably, our device exhibits a broadband responsivity of ~12 mA/W across 4030-4360 nm (and potentially beyond), challenging the state of the art, while achieving a noise-equivalent power of 3.4x10^-9 W/Hz^0.5 at 4180 nm. We further demonstrate label-free sensing of carbon dioxide using our integrated photodetector and sensing waveguide on a single chip. This approach to room-temperature waveguide-integrated MIR photodetection, harnessing bolometry with FCA in Ge, not only facilitates the realization of fully integrated lab-on-a-chip systems with wavelength flexibility but also provides a blueprint for MIR PICs with CMOS-foundry-compatibility.</description>

Abstract: Most integrated evanescent-field photonic sensors measure changes in either the real part or the imaginary part of the complex refractive index of the sample, i.e., refraction or absorption. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a near-infrared sensor based on a silicon nitride Mach-Zehnder interferometer which provides a direct measurement of the complex refractive index. Our architecture exhibits a high sensitivity, achieving limits of detection below $2\cdot 10^{-6}\,\mathrm{RIU}$ for both the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index. We furthermore show that our sensor can be employed as an integrated dispersion spectrometer.</description>

      <title>Statistical Reproducibility of Selective Area Grown InAs Nanowire Devices</title>

Abstract: New approaches such as selective area growth, where crystal growth is lithographically controlled, allow the integration of bottom-up grown semiconductor nanomaterials in large-scale classical and quantum nanoelectronics. This calls for assessment and optimization of the reproducibility between individual components. We quantify the structural and electronic statistical reproducibility within large arrays of nominally identical selective area growth InAs nanowires. The distribution of structural parameters is acquired through comprehensive atomic force microscopy studies and transmission electron microscopy. These are compared to the statistical distributions of the cryogenic electrical properties of 256 individual SAG nanowire field effect transistors addressed using cryogenic multiplexer circuits. Correlating measurements between successive thermal cycles allows distinguishing between the contributions of surface impurity scattering and fixed structural properties to device reproducibility. The results confirm the potential of SAG nanomaterials, and the methodologies for quantifying statistical metrics are essential for further optimization of reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Non-Volatile Analog Control and Reconfiguration of a Vortex Nano-Oscillator Frequency</title>

Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions are nanoscale devices which have recently attracted interested in the context of frequency multiplexed spintronic neural networks, due to their interesting dynamical properties, which are defined during the fabrication process, and depend on the material parameters and geometry. This paper proposes an approach to extending the functionality of a standard magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by introducing an additional ferromagnet/antiferromagnet (FM/AFM) storage layer (SL) vertically integrated with the standard Vortex MTJ stack into the nanopillar. The magnetostatic field created by this storage layer acts on the free layer and can be used to change its static and dynamic properties. To tune the magnitude and direction of this magnetostatic field, magnetic reconfiguration is carried out through a thermally assisted switching mechanism using a voltage pulse that heats the AFM layer in the SL above the Neel temperature in the presence of an external field. It is experimentally shown that using an MTJ based on a 600 nm diameter nanopillar with a vortex in the free layer, reconfiguration of the SL allows to continuously change the core precession frequency in the 15 MHz range. The reconfigurable analogue storage layer locally affects both the static and dynamic properties of the MTJ free layer, demonstrating vertical 3D integration of additional functionalities into a single MTJ nanopillar.</description>

Abstract: We present the coupled oscillator: a new mechanism for signal amplification with widespread application in metrology. We introduce the mechanical theory of this framework, and support it by way of simulations. We present a particular implementation of coupled oscillators: a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) that uses one large (~100mm) N52 magnet coupled magnetically to a small (~0.25mm), oscillating N52 magnet, providing a force resolution of 200zN measured over 1s in a noiseless environment. We show that the same system is able to resolve magnetic gradients of 130aT/cm at a single point (within 500um). This technology therefore has the potential to revolutionize force and magnetic gradient sensing, including high-impact areas such cardiac and brain imaging.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Current Concentration of Buffer Layer Material for Cable Ablation Failure: Role of Random Fiber Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the buffer layer ablation failures of high voltage cables are frequently reported by the power systems. Previous studies have dominantly regarded the buffer layer as the continuous homogeneous medium, whereas neglects its microstructures. In this paper, the current distribution within the random fiber networks of buffer layer are investigated. Experiment results of our self-designed platform revealed an uneven current distribution in buffer layer at the moment of bearing current. This phenomenon is named as the intrinsic current concentration where the current density concentrates at certain sites inner the buffer layer. And the degree of current concentration will be suppressed by compressing the sample. Then, a 2D simulation model of the random fiber networks was constructed based on the Mikado model. The simulation results also presented an uneven current distribution in the networks whose every fiber can be viewed as a micro-resistor. Two types of dimensionless current concentration factors were defined to describe the degree of current concentration, finding their values decreasing with the rise of fiber density. Meanwhile, it is equivalent of compressing the buffer layer and increasing the fiber density of model. We believe that the intrinsic current concentration phenomenon is mainly related with the inhomogeneity of geometry structure of buffer layer. The ablation traces and fracture fibers observed by the X-ray micro-computed tomography test supported this point. In addition, the non-ideal surface of sample can also induce this phenomenon. The intrinsic current concentration can aggravate the degree of originally existed macroscopic current concentration in cables, thus causing the ablation failure. Our work may unveil a deeper understanding on the cable ablation failure and the electrical response of the similar fibrous materials.</description>

      <title>A geometric perspective: experimental evaluation of the quantum Cramer-Rao bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The power of quantum sensing rests on its ultimate precision limit, quantified by the quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB), which can surpass classical bounds. In multi-parameter estimation, the QCRB is not always saturated as the quantum nature of associated observables may lead to their incompatibility. Here we explore the precision limits of multi-parameter estimation through the lens of quantum geometry, enabling us to experimentally evaluate the QCRB via quantum geometry measurements. Focusing on two- and three-parameter estimation, we elucidate how fundamental quantum uncertainty principles prevent the saturation of the bound. By linking a metric of "quantumness" to the system geometric properties, we investigate and experimentally extract the attainable QCRB for three-parameter estimations.</description>

      <title>Response of Non-premixed Jet Flames to Blast Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The work investigates the response dynamics of non-premixed jet flame to blast waves that are incident along the jet axis. In the present study, blast waves, generated using the wire-explosion technique, are forced to sweep across a non-premixed jet flame that is stabilised over a nozzle rim positioned at a distance of 264 mm from the source of blast generation. The work spans a wide range of fuel jet Reynolds numbers ($Re$) and incident blast wave Mach numbers ($M_{s,r}$). The interaction imposes a characteristic flow field over the jet flame, marked by a sharp discontinuity followed by a decaying profile and a delayed second spike. The second spike in the flow field profile corresponds to the induced flow that follows the blast front. While the response of the flame to the blast front was minimal, it was found to detach from the nozzle rim and lift off following the interaction with the induced flow. Subsequently, the lifted flame was found to re-attach back at the nozzle or extinguish, contingent on the operating $Re$ and $M_{s,r}$. Alongside flame lift-off, flame tip flickering was aggravated under the influence of the induced flow. A simplified theoretical model extending the vorticity transport equation was developed to estimate the change in flickering timescales and length scales owing to the interaction with the induced flow. The observed experimental trends were further compared against theoretical predictions from the model.</description>

      <title>Dual-grating single-shot pump-probe technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple and effective single-shot pump-probe technique is reported. Using only two commercial gratings, a large time window of ~ 95.58 ps is spatially encoded in a single probe pulse, and single-shot time-resolved measurements are implemented. The time window exceeds the maximum reported values for single-shot pump-probe techniques using the echelon or angle beam encoding strategy. The phase difference problem in the echelon encoding strategies is also eliminated and a customized echelon is not needed in this technique. The measurements of the ultrafast dynamics of ZnSe at a wavelength of 650 nm verify the effectiveness of this technique.</description>
