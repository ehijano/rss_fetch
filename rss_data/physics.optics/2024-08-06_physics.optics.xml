      <title>Ultrafast tunable photonic integrated Pockels extended-DBR laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-agile lasers that can simultaneously feature low noise characteristics as well as fast mode hop-free frequency tuning are keystone components for applications ranging from frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) LiDAR, to coherent optical communication and gas sensing. The hybrid integration of III-V gain media with low-loss photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has recently enabled integrated lasers with faster tuning and lower phase noise than the best legacy systems, including fiber lasers. In addition, lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) PICs have enabled to exploit the Pockels effect to demonstrate self-injection locked hybrid lasers with tuning rates reaching peta-hertz per second. However, Pockels-tunable laser archetypes relying on high-Q optical microresonators have thus far only achieved limited output powers, are difficult to operate and stabilize due to the dynamics of self-injection locking, and require many analog control parameters. Here, we overcome this challenge by leveraging an extended distributed Bragg reflector (E-DBR) architecture to demonstrate a simple and turn-key operable frequency-agile Pockels laser that can be controlled with single analog operation and modulation inputs. Our laser supports a continuous mode hop-free tuning range of over 10 GHz with good linearity and flat actuation bandwidth up to 10 MHz, while achieving over 15 mW in-fiber output power at 1545 nm and kHz-level intrinsic linewidth, a combination unmet by legacy bulk lasers. This hybrid laser design combines an inexpensive reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA) with an electro-optic DBR PIC manufactured at wafer-scale on a LNOI platform. We showcase the performance and flexibility of this laser in proof-of-concept coherent optical ranging (FMCW LiDAR) demonstration, achieving a 4 cm distance resolution and in a hydrogen cyanide spectroscopy experiment.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterization of optical micro/nanofibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate the fabrication of optical micro/nanofibers (MNFs) using chemical etching and gas-flame techniques. In the chemical etching technique, a two-step process involves 40% and 24% of hydrofluoric acid solutions for the first and second steps, respectively. The measured diameters of MNFs range is 0.34 {\mu}m - 1.4 {\mu}m. In the gas-flame technique, we design the pulling parameters in a four-step process to achieve the desired diameter of MNFs. The single-mode fiber is adiabatically tapered using high-precision stages while heating the fiber with hydrogen-oxygen flame. The measured diameters of pulled MNFs range is 0.48 {\mu}m - 0.53 {\mu}m, showing good correspondence with the designed diameters. Due to the strong confinement of the field around the MNF, it has diverse applications in various fields, such as sensing, nanophotonics, quantum optics, quantum photonics, and nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Bound States in the Continuum in a Wire Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a slab of wire medium composed of thin parallel metallic wires can naturally support bound states in the continuum (BICs) formed in an unusual way. The revealed BICs appear due to the strong spatial dispersion making possible the propagation of longitudinal plasma-like waves and TEM polarized modes with a flat band. The symmetry-protected (at-$\Gamma$) BICs are formed due to the polarization mismatch between the longitudinal plasma-like waves and transversal plane waves in the surrounding space, while the accidental (off-$\Gamma$) BICs appear as a result of the Friedrich-Wintgen destructive interference between them. All revealed BICs can be well-described analytically without the use of the Bloch theorem within effective medium approximation when the wire medium behaves as homogeneous 1D anisotropic plasma with strong spatial dispersion.</description>

      <title>Strip-Loaded Nanophotonic Interfaces for Resonant Coupling and Single-Photon Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the design and simulation of strip-loaded nanophotonic interfaces aimed at improving resonant coupling and photon routing efficiency. In our design, the guided mode is confined within a plane by a high-index thin film and is loosely confined laterally by a lower index strip. Using a hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) strip, titanium dioxide core, and silicon dioxide substrate, we optimise the waveguide dimensions for maximum lateral confinement of light. Specifically, we propose a polymer-based Bragg grating cavity and ring resonator that achieve near-optimal mode volumes and high Q-factors. Our simulations suggest that a cavity with a mode volume of V_{\text{eff}} \approx 7.0 \left(\frac{\lambda}{n}\right)^3 and a Q-factor of 7000 can produce photons with 97% indistinguishability at 4K. Additionally, we investigate directional couplers for efficient photon routing, comparing photonic and plasmonic material structures. While pure photonic structures demonstrate lower loss and improved quality factors, they face practical limitations in terms of bending radius. Conversely, plasmonic structures offer shorter bending radii but higher propagation losses. This research lays the groundwork for future nanophotonic designs, aiming to enhance photon generation and routing capabilities for quantum optical applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Relativistic Vortex Electrons in External Laser Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating vortex electron interactions with electromagnetic fields is essential for advancing particle acceleration techniques, scattering theory in background fields, and obtaining novel electron beams for material diagnostics. A systematic investigation into the dynamics of vortex electrons in external laser fields and the exploration of laser-induced vortex modes remains lacking. In this work, we study the propagation of vortex electrons in linearly polarized (LP) and circularly polarized (CP) laser pulses, both separately and in their combined form in two-mode laser pulses. The theoretical formalism is developed by utilizing Volkov-Bessel wave functions, and the four-current density is obtained as a crucial observable quantity. Numerical results illustrate the dynamics of vortex electrons in external lasers, showing that the beam center of the vortex electron follows the classical motion of a point charge electron, while maintaining the probability distribution structure for both vortex eigenstates and superposition modes. The combined effect of LP and CP laser pulses in the two-mode laser field allows for the versatile control of vortex electrons, which is absent with LP or CP lasers alone, at femtosecond and sub-nanometer scales. Our findings demonstrate the versatile control over vortex electrons via laser pulses, with our formalism providing a reference for vortex scattering in laser backgrounds and inspiring the laser-controlled achievement of novel vortex modes as targeted diagnostic probes for specialized materials.</description>

      <title>Moire exciton polaritons in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moire lattices attract intensive attention in the double graphene/TMD layers and photonic crystals due to the interesting exotic physics within these structures. However, precise measurement of the moir'e ground states, excited states and Bloch bands in the twisted photonic lattices is still illusive. In this work we report the strong coupling between the excitons of CsPbBr3 microplates and the photonic modes of the moire lattice at room temperature. Depending on the coupling strength between the nearest potential sites, we observe staggered moire polariton ground states, excited states trapped in the potential sites and moire polariton bands across the twisted photonic lattice. In addition, the phase locking of moire zero (stable in-phase) states and moire pi (metastable antiphase) states with different spatial distributions are measured. Moir'e polariton distribution can be tuned in the shape of parallelogram by controlling the depth and width of the potential in one photonic lattice with another one fixed. Our work lays the foundation to study moir'e exciton polariton Wigner crystals and Luttinger liquid in twisted photonic lattices at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Optically Determined Solar Cell Current Transport Efficiency Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently suggested reciprocity relation states that the current transport efficiency from the junction to the cell terminal can be determined by differentiating luminescence images with respect to the terminal voltage. The validity of this relation is shown experimentally in this paper, by comparison with simultaneously measured electrical currents and simulations. Moreover, we verify that the method is applicable under various light concentrations and applied voltages, which allows us to investigate the cell in relevant conditions. Results evidence several kind of series resistances affecting the current transport efficiencies. We show that the relative contribution of those different resistances to the loss in current collection is a function of the illumination intensity.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Keldysh theory for non-resonant strong-field ionization of monolayer 2D materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Keldysh theory of photoionization for solids is generalized to atomically thin two-dimensional semiconductors. We derive a closed-form formula and its asymptotic forms for a two-band model with a Kane dispersion. These formulas exhibit characteristically different behaviors from their bulk counterparts which are attributed to the scaling of the 2D density of states. We validate our formulas by comparing them to recent strong-field ionization experiments in monolayer MoS2 with good agreement. Our work is expected to find a wide range of applications in intense light - 2D material interaction.</description>

      <title>Coulomb coupling between two nanospheres trapped in a bichromatic optical tweezer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Levitated optomechanics is entering the multiparticle regime, paving the way for the use of arrays of strongly coupled massive oscillators to explore complex interacting quantum systems. Here, we demonstrate the trapping of two nanospheres inside a dual optical tweezer generated by two copropagating lasers operating at different wavelengths (1064 nm and 976 nm). Due to the chromatic aberration of the tweezer optics, two focal points are created approximately 9 microns apart, each one acting as an optical trap for a silica nanoparticle. At this distance, the surface charges on the nanospheres produce a Coulomb force that couples their motion along the tweezer axis. The strong coupling regime is achieved, as evidenced by the observed avoided crossing of the normal-mode frequencies. These results highlight the potential of our experimental scheme for future studies on systems of strongly coupled oscillators, including their implementation in optical cavities, both in the classical and in quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Tunable 30 GHz laser frequency comb for astronomical spectrograph characterization and calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for earth-like exoplanets with the Doppler radial velocity technique is an extremely challenging and multifaceted precision spectroscopy problem. Currently, one of the limiting instrumental factors in reaching the required long-term $10^{-10}$ level of radial velocity precision is the defect-driven sub-pixel quantum efficiency variations in the large-format detector arrays used by precision echelle spectrographs. Tunable frequency comb calibration sources that can fully map the point spread function across a spectrograph's entire bandwidth are necessary for quantifying and correcting these detector artifacts. In this work, we demonstrate a combination of laser frequency and mode spacing control that allows full and deterministic tunability of a 30 GHz electro-optic comb together with its filter cavity. After supercontinuum generation, this gives access to any optical frequency across 700 - 1300 nm. Our specific implementation is intended for the comb deployed at the Habitable Zone Planet Finder spectrograph and its near-infrared Hawaii-2RG array, but the techniques apply to all laser frequency combs used for precision astronomical spectrograph calibration and other applications that require broadband tuning.</description>

      <title>Vortex inverted pin beams: Mitigation of scintillations in strong atmospheric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently introduced a new class of optical beams with a Bessel-like transverse profile and increasing beam width during propagation, akin to an "inverted pin". Owing to their specially engineered distribution, these beams have shown remarkable performance in atmospheric turbulence. Specifically, inverted pin beams were found to have reduced scintillation index as compared to collimated or focused Gaussian beams as well as other types of pin beams especially in moderate to strong turbulence. In this work, we demonstrate that inverted pin beams carrying orbital angular momentum can further suppress intensity scintillations in moderate to strong irradiance fluctuation conditions. Our results can be useful in improving the performance and link availability of free-space optical communication systems.</description>

      <title>Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg interference in edge state pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adiabatic edge state pumping (ESP) in one dimensional model, which has important applications in topological phase transition and the associated implementation of edge states in quantum simulation, has been widely performed in both theories and experiments. This phenomenon has been verified in some small physical models, yet some fundamental issues about this process have not been clarified. In this paper, we revisit this problem of ESP and pinpoint a pair of non-adiabatic points in the band levels, at which the adiabatic condition breaks down. We determine the two points using the criteria of non-adiabaticity. As a result, the oscillation of ESP as evolution time varies can be resolved in terms of Landau-Zener-St\"{u}ckelberg (LZS) interference. Furthermore, in the presence of disorder, we show that the ESP may break down for the anticrossing between the edge and the bulk levels, where the non-adiabaticity diverges. Thus in a relatively long chain with weak disorder, we demonstrate the failure of the ESP. This new type of ESP unveiled in this work is readily accessible in experiment, and shall therefore lead to a down-to-earth platform for the intriguing LZS dynamics.</description>

      <title>Something from Nothing: Enhanced Laser Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via Zero-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout quantum science and technology, measurement is used as a powerful resource for nonlinear operations and quantum state engineering. In particular, single-photon detection is commonly employed for quantum-information applications and tests of fundamental physics. By contrast, and perhaps counter-intuitively, measurement of the absence of photons also provides useful information, and offers significant potential for a wide range of new experimental directions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation via zero-photon detection and verify this cooling through heterodyne measurements of the anti-Stokes scattered optical field. Our measurements are well captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state engineering, and quantum measurement and control.</description>

      <title>Something from Nothing: A Theoretical Framework for Enhancing or Enabling Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via the anti-Stokes or Stokes Interaction and Zero-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to describe how zero-photon detection may be utilized to enhance laser cooling via the anti-Stokes interaction and enable cooling via the Stokes interaction. Our description includes both pulsed and continuous measurements as well as optical detection efficiency and open-system dynamics. For both cases, we discuss how the cooling depends on the system parameters such as detection efficiency and optomechanical cooperativity, and we study the continuous measurement-induced dynamics contrasting to single-photon detection events. For the Stokes case, contrary to the common paradigm of heating via optomechanical parametric amplification, we find the efficiency required to cool a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection. This work serves as a companion article to the recent experiment [E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, K. D. Major, et al., arXiv preprint arXiv:0000.00000 (2024)], which demonstrated enhanced laser cooling of a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes signal. The framework developed here provides new approaches for cooling mechanical resonators that can be applied to a wide range of areas including nonclassical state preparation, quantum thermodynamics, and avoiding the unwanted heating effects of parametric amplification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fibers poses a major challenge for maintaining the fidelity of quantum states for quantum communications. In this work, a comprehensive model linking the probability of quantum measurement errors (infidelity) to PMD is developed and validated by experimental measurements of differential group delay and quantum bit error rate (QBER). Our research proposes effective methods to mitigate PMD effects for broadband entangled photons and evaluates the impact of higher-order PMD effects. The model provides an experimentally verified framework for the optimization of commercial quantum key distribution systems in deployed fiber optic lines.</description>

Abstract: Quantum networks and distributed quantum computers rely on entanglement generation between photons and long-lived quantum memories. For large-scale architectures, one of the most crucial parameters is the efficiency at which entanglement can be created and detected. Here, we maximize the efficiency for the detection of hybrid entanglement between a nuclear spin qubit in diamond with a photonic time-bin qubit. Our approach relies on an optimal implementation of the photonic qubit analyzer, for which we use a high-speed electro-optic deflector to direct photons deterministically along the optimal interferometer paths. This way, we completely eliminate all cases in which photons are randomly lost due to the propagation in the wrong interferometer path. In this first demonstration experiment, we use nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, for which we immediately demonstrate the presence of the entanglement. An extension to other spin-photon entanglement systems is straightforward. Further, our scheme can be used in the framework of quantum repeater networks, including spectral and temporal multiplexing strategies. Our results thus pave the way for the future high-performance quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Field-Tunable Valley Coupling and Localization in a Dodecagonal Semiconductor Quasicrystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are characterized by atomic arrangements possessing long-range order without periodicity. Van der Waals (vdW) bilayers provide a unique opportunity to controllably vary atomic alignment between two layers from a periodic moir\'e crystal to an aperiodic quasicrystal. Here, we reveal a remarkable consequence of the unique atomic arrangement in a dodecagonal WSe2 quasicrystal: the K and Q valleys in separate layers are brought arbitrarily close in momentum space via higher-order Umklapp scatterings. A modest perpendicular electric field is sufficient to induce strong interlayer K-Q hybridization, manifested as a new hybrid excitonic doublet. Concurrently, we observe the disappearance of the trion resonance and attribute it to quasicrystal potential driven localization. Our findings highlight the remarkable attribute of incommensurate systems to bring any pair of momenta into close proximity, thereby introducing a novel aspect to valley engineering.</description>

      <title>Generation of 480 nm picosecond pulses for ultrafast excitation of Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atoms in Rydberg states are an important building block for emerging quantum technologies. While the excitation to the Rydberg orbitals are typically achieved in more than tens of nanoseconds, the physical limit is in fact much faster, at the ten picoseconds level. Here, we tackle such ultrafast Rydberg excitation of a Rubidium atom by designing a dedicated pulsed laser system generating 480 nm pulses of 10 ps duration. In particular, we improved upon our previous design by using an injection-seeded optical parametric amplifier (OPA) to obtain stable pulsed energy, decreasing the fluctuation from 30 % to 6 %. We then succeeded in ultrafast excitation of Rydberg atoms with excitation probability of ~90 %, not limited anymore by energy fluctuation but rather by the atomic state preparation, addressable in future works. This achievement broadens the range of applications of Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Quantum Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum imaging with undetected photons spatially transfers amplitude and phase information from one spectral region of physical interest to another spectral region that is easy to detect. The photon energy of the two spectral regions can, in principle, be separated by several orders of magnitude. However, quantum imaging with undetected photons has so far only been demonstrated in spectral regions of similar order of magnitude in frequency (and for which cameras are commercially available). Here, we demonstrate amplitude- and phase-sensitive imaging in the terahertz spectral region (1.5 THz center frequency) by detecting only visible photons (center wavelength 662.2 nm, 452.7 THz center frequency) more than two orders of magnitude apart. As a result, terahertz spectral information can be reliably detected with a standard CMOS camera without cooling, achieving a spatial resolution close to the wavelength. By taking advantage of quantum distillation in a nonlinear interferometer, the influence of ubiquitous thermal terahertz photons can be neglected. Our results are in good agreement with numerical simulations of the imaging process and demonstrate the huge potential of this method to address otherwise challenging spectral regions where cameras do not exist.</description>

      <title>Quantum Target Ranging for LiDAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Quantum Target Ranging in the context of multi-hypothesis testing and its applicability to real-world LiDAR systems. First, we demonstrate that ranging is generally an easier task compared to the well-studied problem of target detection. We then analyze the theoretical bounds and advantages of quantum ranging in the context of phase-insensitive measurements, which is the operational mode of most LiDAR systems. Additionally, we adopt a background noise model more suited to optical frequencies, as opposed to the typical single-mode thermal noise model used in quantum target detection theory. Our findings indicate that a significant exponential quantum advantage can be achieved using simple photon-counting receivers across a broad range of parameters, thereby validating the efficacy of the quantum approach for LiDAR implementations.</description>

      <title>Observations of a PT-like phase transition and limit cycle oscillations in non-reciprocally coupled optomechanical oscillators levitated in vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoparticles levitated in an optical trap provide a versatile platform to study mechanical oscillators in a controlled environment with tuneable parameters. Recently, it has become possible to couple two of these optomechanical oscillators. Here, we demonstrate the collective non-Hermitian dynamics of such a pair of non-conservatively coupled oscillators. We take advantage of the tunability of the optical interactions between the particles in our system and set the optical interaction between the particles to be purely non-reciprocal. By continuously varying the relative power of the trapping beams, we take the system through a transition, similar to a parity-time phase transition. A Hopf bifurcation at a critical point results in the formation of collective limit cycle oscillations, resembling those observed in phonon lasers. These coupled levitated oscillators provide a platform for exceptional point optomechanical sensing and can be extended to multi-particle systems, paving the way for the development of topological optomechanical media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent decades have seen significant advancements in integrated photonics, driven by improvements in nanofabrication technology. This field has developed from integrated semiconductor lasers and low-loss waveguides to optical modulators, enabling the creation of sophisticated optical systems on a chip scale capable of performing complex functions like optical sensing, signal processing, and metrology. The tight confinement of optical modes in photonic waveguides further enhances the optical nonlinearity, leading to a variety of nonlinear optical phenomena such as optical frequency combs, second-harmonic generation, and supercontinuum generation. Active tuning of photonic circuits is crucial not only for offsetting variations caused by fabrication in large-scale integration, but also serves as a fundamental component in programmable photonic circuits. Piezoelectric actuation in photonic devices offers a low-power, high-speed solution and is essential in the design of future photonic circuits due to its compatibility with materials like Si and Si3N4, which do not exhibit electro-optic effects. Here, we provide a detailed review of the latest developments in piezoelectric tuning and modulation, by examining various piezoelectric materials, actuator designs tailored to specific applications, and the capabilities and limitations of current technologies. Additionally, we explore the extensive applications enabled by piezoelectric actuators, including tunable lasers, frequency combs, quantum transducers, and optical isolators. These innovative ways of managing photon propagation and frequency on-chip are expected to be highly sought after in the future advancements of advanced photonic chips for both classical and quantum optical information processing and computing.</description>

Abstract: We present two distinct ultra-low frequency noise lasers at 729 nm with a fast frequency noise of 30 Hz^2/Hz, corresponding to a Lorentzian linewidth of 0.1 kHz. The characteristics of both lasers, which are based on different types of laser diodes, are investigated using experimental and theoretical analysis with a focus on identifying the advantages and disadvantages of each type of system. Specifically, we study the differences and similarities in mode behaviour while tuning frequency noise and linewidth reduction. Furthermore, we demonstrate the locking capability of these systems on medium-finesse cavities. The results provide insights into the unique operational characteristics of these ultra-low noise lasers and their potential applications in quantum technology that require high levels of control fidelity.</description>

Abstract: Soliton pulsations are ubiquitous feature of non-stationary soliton dynamics in mode-locked lasers and many other physical systems. To overcome difficulties related to huge amount of necessary computations and low efficiency of traditional numerical methods in modeling the evolution of non-stationary solitons, we propose a two-parallel bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural network, with the main objective to predict dynamics of vector-soliton pulsations in various complex states, whose real-time dynamics is verified by experiments. Besides, the scheme of coded information storage based on the TP-Bi_LSTM RNN, instead of actual pulse signals, is realized too. The findings offer new applications of deep learning to ultrafast optics and information storage.</description>

      <title>Hybrid electroluminescence device for on-demand single photon generation at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research focused on single photon emitters (SPEs) hosted by layered semiconductors, particularly hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), has revealed a promising alternative to quantum dots (QDs) for generating single, indistinguishable photons. hBN-based SPEs offer lower material costs, room temperature emission, and easy integration into potential optoelectronic devices due to the layered structure of the host crystal. This work presents compact hybrid electroluminescence devices, in which GaN laser diodes (LDs) are used for bottom-to-top excitation of hBN nanoflakes deposited on the laser facets. Our approach circumvents the issue of electroluminescence generation from hBN and provides access to the SPE's signal without optical driving by an external laser. Using laser diodes upgraded with Bragg reflectors a room-temperature generation of single photons from hBN is confirmed by an 80%-dip in their g(2) second-order correlation. The on-demand emission of single photons at room temperature is demonstrated by driving the laser diodes in pulsed operation, with confidence supported by a measured g(2)(0) value of 0.37.</description>

      <title>Photon number resolving detectors as evidence for the corpuscular nature of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.04245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the question of whether photon-number-resolving (PNR) detectors provide compelling evidence for the discrete nature of light; i.e., whether they indicate the prior presence of a certain number of discrete photons. To answer this question, we reveal the insufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing PNR detectors, and propose an alternative interpretation for the analysis of PNR detector output that is consistent with a wave picture of light and does not rely on the presumption of light particles. This interpretation is based on the aggregation of correlated or accidentally coincident detections within a given detector coincidence window. Our interpretation accounts for the arbitrary character of detector coincidence windows and includes connections to established treatments of intensity interferometers. To validate our interpretation, we performed an experiment on a multiplexed PNR detector and examined the dependence of photon number on the coincidence window via post-processing. These observations were then compared to a fully classical wave model based on amplitude threshold detection, and the results were found to be in excellent agreement. We find that results from low SNR PNR detectors, such as those existing in the literature, are able to be described by classical descriptions, and therefore do not demonstrate evidence for the discrete nature of light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00094v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of quantum technology, the interest in communication tasks assisted by quantum systems has increased both in academia and industry. Nonetheless, the transmission of a quantum state in real-world scenarios is bounded by environmental noise, so that the quantum channel is an open quantum system. In this work, we study a high dimensional non-Markovian open quantum system in a multi-core optical fiber by characterizing the environmental interaction as quantum operations, which here correspond to phase flips between pairs of computational basis states. The experimental platform is currently state-of-the-art for space division multiplexing optical fiber communication, which can serve as a robust channel for high-dimensional quantum communication. To test the channel, we perform a quantum communication task in the prepare-and-measure scenario. The non-Markovian nature of the system is demonstrated by implementing a Quantum Vault protocol. A better understanding of the phase noise in multi-core fibers could improve the stability and quality of several real-world communication protocols since they are a prime candidate to increase the telecom data transmission rate worldwide.</description>

      <title>Superadditive Communication with the Green Machine: A Practical Demonstration of Nonlocality without Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving the ultimate Holevo limit of optical communication capacity requires a joint-detection receiver which makes a collective quantum measurement over multiple modulated symbols. Such superadditivity -- a higher communication rate than that achievable by symbol-by-symbol optical detection -- is a special case of the well-known nonlocality without entanglement and has yet to be demonstrated. In this article, we propose and demonstrate a design of joint-detection receivers, the Green Machine, that can achieve superadditivity. We build this receiver and show that its capacity surpasses any symbol-by-symbol receivers in the photon-starved regime with binary-phase-shift-keying (BPSK). Our Green Machine receiver can also significantly reduce the transmitter peak power requirement compared with the pulse-position modulation (the conventional modulation format used for deep space laser communication). We further show that the self-referenced phase makes it immune to phase noise, e.g., atmospheric turbulence or platform vibrations.</description>

Abstract: In this article we propose a numerical algorithm to compute the intensity and polarization of a polychromatic electromagnetic radiation crossing a medium with graded refractive index and modeled by the Vector Radiative Refractive Transfer Equations (VRRTE). Special attention is given to the case where the refractive index has a discontinuity for which the Fresnel conditions are necessary. We assume that the only spatial variable of interest is the altitude (stratified medium). An algorithm based on iterations of the sources is shown to be monotone and convergent. Numerical examples are given with highly varying absorption coefficient kappa and Rayleigh scattering as in the Earth atmosphere. To study the effect of CO2 in the atmosphere kappa is changed in the frequency ranges where CO2 is absorbing.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Hot-Carrier Degradation driven by silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation in SPADs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel approach for modeling Dark Count Rate (DCR) drift in Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) is proposed based on Hot-Carrier Degradation (HCD) inducing silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation at the Si/SiO2 interface. The energy and the quantity of hot-carriers are modeled by the interplay of carrier energy distribution and current density. The carrier energy distribution, achieved by a Full-Band Monte-Carlo simulation considering the band structure and the scattering mechanisms, establishes a crucial link to the degradation of the top SPAD interface, primarily influenced by hot electrons due to their broader energy spread. The current density is determined by analyzing the generation rates of carriers under dark and photo conditions, along with the multiplication rate, through a combination of experimental data and modeling techniques. Subsequently,these hot carriers are correlated with the distribution of bond dissociation energy, which is modeled by the disorder-induced local variations among the Si-H bond energy at the Si/SiO2 interface. The impact-ionization probability between hot carriers and Si-H bonds is then calculated by differentiating their energies, thereby determining the degradation kinetics. This enables the capture of the rise in dark current density with stress duration by the increasing number of defects, which in turn affects the modeling of degradation rate. For the first time, a direct correlation between the dark current and DCR, along with their drift over stress time, has been established, relying on the carrier generation rate originating from these defects together with the position-dependent breakdown probability Pt.This physic-based model allows to predict DCR for unprecedented long-term stress measurement time up to 10e6s, covering a whole set of characterization and stress conditions for SPAD devices.</description>
