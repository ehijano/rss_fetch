      <title>Spacecraft inertial parameters estimation using time series clustering and reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a machine learning approach to estimate the inertial parameters of a spacecraft in cases when those change during operations, e.g. multiple deployments of payloads, unfolding of appendages and booms, propellant consumption as well as during in-orbit servicing and active debris removal operations. The machine learning approach uses time series clustering together with an optimised actuation sequence generated by reinforcement learning to facilitate distinguishing among different inertial parameter sets. The performance of the proposed strategy is assessed against the case of a multi-satellite deployment system showing that the algorithm is resilient towards common disturbances in such kinds of operations.</description>

      <title>Development of an ultra-sensitive 210-micron array of KIDs for far-IR astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Probe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is a proposed space observatory which will use arrays of thousands of kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) to perform low- and moderate-resolution spectroscopy throughout the far-infrared. The detectors must have noise equivalent powers (NEPs) at or below 0.1 aW/sqrt(Hz) to be subdominant to noise from sky backgrounds and thermal noise from PRIMA's cryogenically cooled primary mirror. Using a Radio Frequency System on a Chip for multitone readout, we measure the NEPs of detectors on a flight-like array designed to observe at a wavelength of 210 microns. We find that 92% of the KIDs measured have an NEP below 0.1 aW/sqrt(Hz) at a noise frequency of 10 Hz.</description>

      <title>Planet Formation Imager (PFI): Project update and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Planet Formation Imager (PFI) Project is dedicated to defining a next-generation facility that can answer fundamental questions about how planets form, including detection of young giant exoplanets and their circumplanetary disks. The proposed expansive design for a 12-element array of 8m class telescopes with &gt;1.2 km baselines would indeed revolutionize our understanding of planet formation and is technically achievable, albeit at a high cost. It has been 10 years since this conceptual design process began and we give an overview of the status of the PFI project. We also review how a scaled back PFI with fewer large telescopes could answer a range of compelling science questions, including in planet formation and as well as totally different astrophysics areas. New opportunities make a space-based PFI more feasible now and we give a brief overview of new efforts that could also pave the way for the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) space mission.</description>

      <title>Prospects for using drones to test formation-flying CubeSat concepts, and other astronomical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drones provide a versatile platform for remote sensing and atmospheric studies. However, strict payload mass limits and intense vibrations have proven obstacles to adoption for astronomy. We present a concept for system-level testing of a long-baseline CubeSat space interferometer using drones, taking advantage of their cm-level xyz station-keeping, 6-dof freedom of movement, large operational environment, access to guide stars for end-to-end testing of optical train and control algorithms, and comparable mass and power requirements. We have purchased two different drone platforms (Aurelia X6 Pro, Freefly Alta X) and present characterization studies of vibrations, flight stability, gps positioning precision, and more. We also describe our progress in sub-system development, including inter-drone laser metrology, realtime gimbal control, and LED beacon tracking. Lastly, we explore whether custom-built drone-borne telescopes could be used for interferometry of bright objects over km-level baselines using vibration-isolation platforms and a small fast delay for fringe-tracking.</description>

      <title>STARI: STarlight Acquisition and Reflection toward Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the concept for STARI: STarlight Acquisition and Reflection toward Interferometry. If launched, STARI will be the first mission to control a 3-D CubeSat formation to the few mm-level, reflect starlight over 10s to 100s of meters from one spacecraft to another, control tip-tilt with sub-arcsecond stability, and validate end-to-end performance by injecting light into a single-mode fiber. While STARI is not an interferometer, the mission will advance the Technology Readiness Levels of the essential subsystems needed for a space interferometer in the near future.</description>

      <title>Polarized X-rays Correlated with Short--Timescale Variability of Cygnus X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the variability of polarized X-rays on a timescale of a few seconds in the low/hard state of the black hole binary Cygnus X-1. The correlation between polarization degrees and angles with X-Ray intensity was analyzed using data collected by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in June 2022. Given that X-Ray variability in the low/hard state of Cygnus X-1 is non-periodic, flux peaks were aggregated to suppress statistical fluctuations. We divided the temporal profiles of these aggregated flux peaks into seven time segments and evaluated the polarization for each segment. The results reveal that the polarization degree was 4.6\%$\pm$1.2 and 5.3\%$\pm$1.2 before and after the peak, respectively, but decreased to 3.4\%$\pm$1.1 and 2.7\%$\pm$1.1 in the segments including and immediately following the peak. Furthermore, the polarization angle exhibited a slight shift from approximately 30$^{\circ}$ to $\sim$40$^{\circ}$ before and after the peak. These findings suggest that the accretion disk contracts with increasing X-Ray luminosity, and the closer proximity of the X-Ray emitting gas to the black hole may lead to reduced polarization.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES -- XIV. Time-delay and differential dust extinction determination with lensed type II supernova color curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is one of the most relevant unsolved problems in cosmology today. Strongly gravitationally lensed transient objects, such as strongly lensed supernovae, are an independent and competitive probe that can be used to determine the Hubble constant. In this context, the time delay between different images of lensed supernovae is a key ingredient. We present a method, to retrieve time delays and the amount of differential dust extinction between multiple images of lensed type IIP supernovae through their color curves, which display a kink in the time evolution. With multiple realistic mock color curves based on an observed unlensed supernova from the Carnegie Supernova Project, we demonstrate that we can retrieve the time delay with uncertainties of $\pm$1.0 days for light curves with 2-day cadence and 35% missing data due to weather losses. The differential dust extinction is more susceptible to uncertainties, because it depends on imposing the correct extinction law. Further we also investigate the kink structure in the color curves for different rest-frame wavelength bands, particularly rest-frame UV light curves from SWIFT, finding sufficiently strong kinks for our method to work for typical lensed SN redshifts that would redshift the kink feature to optical wavelengths. With the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, hundreds of strongly lensed supernovae will be detected and our new method for lensed SN IIP is readily applicable to provide delays.</description>

      <title>Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method for multilevel NLTE radiative transfer problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The calculation of the emerging radiation from a model atmosphere requires knowledge of the emissivity and absorption coefficients, which are proportional to the atomic level population densities of the levels involved in each transition. Due to the intricate interdependency of the radiation field and the physical state of the atoms, iterative methods are required in order to calculate the atomic level population densities. A variety of different methods have been proposed to solve this problem, which is known as the Non-Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE) problem.
  In this study we have developed a Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method (JFNK) to solve multi-level NLTE radiative transfer problems. Using the Rybicki &amp; Hummer (1992) method as a reference (Rybicki, G. B. &amp; Hummer, D. G. 1992, A&amp;A, 262, 209), our results show that our JFNK solver can achieve up to a factor two speed up when using local approximate operators / preconditioners, while also achieving a lower residual error in the statistical equilibrium equations. Another advantage of this method is that the addition of charge conservation and partial redistribution effects should be straight forward.
  Our method can help accelerating the calculation of the emerging spectra from numerical models and also the reconstruction of chromospheric datasets through NLTE inversions.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential of Small Satellites: TheMIS's Active Cooling Technology on the SpIRIT Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Thermal Management Integrated System (TheMIS) is a key element of the Australia-Italy Space Industry Responsive Intelligent Thermal (SpIRIT) mission, launched in a 510km Polar Sun-Synchronous orbit in December 2023. SpIRIT is a 6U CubeSat led by The University of Melbourne in cooperation with ASI, with support from ASA and with contributions from Australian space industry and international research organizations. The TheMIS subsystem actively cools and controls the temperature of sensitive instruments, increasing the potential range of payloads supported on small spacecraft systems. TheMIS core functionality is based on a commercial Stirling Cycle Cryocooler in-principle capable of reaching cold-tip temperatures below T=100K. The cooler is operated by customized control electronics and is connected to deployable radiators through pyrolytic graphite sheet thermal straps, all developed by the University of Melbourne. Until now, this level of thermal control has been relatively uncommon in nanosatellites. TheMIS aims to validate the design and performance by controlling the thermal environment of SpIRIT's HERMES payload, an X-ray instrument provided by ASI which has a noise background strongly sensitive to temperature. Beyond SpIRIT, TheMIS has the potential to support a broad range of applications, including holding infrared focal plane arrays at cryogenic temperatures, and increasing resilience of electronics to space weather. This paper provides an overview of TheMIS's design, implementation, and operational performance, detailing the commissioning phase and the early results obtained from its operations in orbit, with comparison to the thermal model developed during the mission environmental testing campaign. Finally, the paper discusses ongoing challenges for thermal management of payloads in small satellite systems and potential future strategies for continuous improvement</description>

      <title>Measuring the Substructure Mass Power Spectrum of 23 SLACS Strong Galaxy-Galaxy Lenses with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing can be used as a tool for constraining the substructure in the mass distribution of galaxies. In this study we investigate the power spectrum of dark matter perturbations in a population of 23 Hubble Space Telescope images of strong galaxy-galaxy lenses selected from The Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey. We model the dark matter substructure as a Gaussian Random Field perturbation on a smooth lens mass potential, characterized by power-law statistics. We expand upon the previously developed machine learning framework to predict the power-law statistics by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that accounts for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. For the training sets, we use the smooth lens mass potentials and reconstructed source galaxies that have been previously modelled through traditional fits of analytical and shapelet profiles as a starting point. We train three CNNs with different training set: the first using standard data augmentation on the best-fitting reconstructed sources, the second using different reconstructed sources spaced throughout the posterior distribution, and the third using a combination of the two data sets. We apply the trained CNNs to the SLACS data and find agreement in their predictions. Our results suggest a significant substructure perturbation favoring a high frequency power spectrum across our lens population.</description>

      <title>Direct Method to Compute Doppler Beaming Factors in Binary Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Doppler beaming effect, induced by the reflex motion of stars, introduces flux modulations and serves as an efficient method to photometrically determine mass functions for a large number of close binary systems, particularly those involving compact objects. In order to convert observed beaming-flux variations into a radial-velocity curve, precise determination of the beaming factor is essential. Previously, this factor was calculated as a constant, assuming a power-law profile for stellar spectra. In this study, we present a novel approach to directly compute this factor. Our new method not only simplifies the computation, especially for blue bands and cool stars, but also enables us to evaluate whether the relationship between beaming flux and radial velocity can be accurately described as linear. We develop a python code and compute a comprehensive beaming-factor table for commonly used filter systems covering main-sequence, subgiant, and giant stars, as well as hot subdwarf and white dwarf stars. Both the code and our table are archived and publicly available at http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13049419.</description>
