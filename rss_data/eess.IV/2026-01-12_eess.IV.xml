      <title>Sketch&amp;Patch++: Efficient Structure-Aware 3D Gaussian Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features such as edges and contours, while others represent broader, smoother regions analogous to brush strokes that add volume and depth. Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail.
  In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\% of the original model size. This structure-aware representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.</description>

      <title>Cedalion Tutorial: A Python-based framework for comprehensive analysis of multimodal fNIRS &amp; DOT from the lab to the everyday world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) are rapidly evolving toward wearable, multimodal, and data-driven, AI-supported neuroimaging in the everyday world. However, current analytical tools are fragmented across platforms, limiting reproducibility, interoperability, and integration with modern machine learning (ML) workflows. Cedalion is a Python-based open-source framework designed to unify advanced model-based and data-driven analysis of multimodal fNIRS and DOT data within a reproducible, extensible, and community-driven environment. Cedalion integrates forward modelling, photogrammetric optode co-registration, signal processing, GLM Analysis, DOT image reconstruction, and ML-based data-driven methods within a single standardized architecture based on the Python ecosystem. It adheres to SNIRF and BIDS standards, supports cloud-executable Jupyter notebooks, and provides containerized workflows for scalable, fully reproducible analysis pipelines that can be provided alongside original research publications. Cedalion connects established optical-neuroimaging pipelines with ML frameworks such as scikit-learn and PyTorch, enabling seamless multimodal fusion with EEG, MEG, and physiological data. It implements validated algorithms for signal-quality assessment, motion correction, GLM modelling, and DOT reconstruction, complemented by modules for simulation, data augmentation, and multimodal physiology analysis. Automated documentation links each method to its source publication, and continuous-integration testing ensures robustness. This tutorial paper provides seven fully executable notebooks that demonstrate core features. Cedalion offers an open, transparent, and community extensible foundation that supports reproducible, scalable, cloud- and ML-ready fNIRS/DOT workflows for laboratory-based and real-world neuroimaging.</description>

      <title>DYRECT Computed Tomography: DYnamic Reconstruction of Events on a Continuous Timescale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-resolved high-resolution X-ray Computed Tomography (4D $\mu$CT) is an imaging technique that offers insight into the evolution of dynamic processes inside materials that are opaque to visible light. Conventional tomographic reconstruction techniques are based on recording a sequence of 3D images that represent the sample state at different moments in time. This frame-based approach limits the temporal resolution compared to dynamic radiography experiments due to the time needed to make CT scans. Moreover, it leads to an inflation of the amount of data and thus to costly post-processing computations to quantify the dynamic behaviour from the sequence of time frames, hereby often ignoring the temporal correlations of the sample structure. Our proposed 4D $\mu$CT reconstruction technique, named DYRECT, estimates individual attenuation evolution profiles for each position in the sample. This leads to a novel memory-efficient event-based representation of the sample, using as little as three image volumes: its initial attenuation, its final attenuation and the transition times. This third volume represents local events on a continuous timescale instead of the discrete global time frames. We propose a method to iteratively reconstruct the transition times and the attenuation volumes. The dynamic reconstruction technique was validated on synthetic ground truth data and experimental data, and was found to effectively pinpoint the transition times in the synthetic dataset with a time resolution corresponding to less than a tenth of the amount of projections required to reconstruct traditional $\mu$CT time frames.</description>

      <title>InnerGS: Internal Scenes Reconstruction and Segmentation via Factorized 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity for efficient scene rendering by representing scenes as explicit sets of anisotropic 3D Gaussians. However, most existing work focuses primarily on modeling external surfaces. In this work, we target the reconstruction of internal scenes, which is crucial for applications that require a deep understanding of an object's interior. By directly modeling a continuous volumetric density through the inner 3D Gaussian distribution, our model effectively reconstructs smooth and detailed internal structures from sparse sliced data. Beyond high-fidelity reconstruction, we further demonstrate the framework's potential for downstream tasks such as segmentation. By integrating language features, we extend our approach to enable text-guided segmentation of medical scenes via natural language queries. Our approach eliminates the need for camera poses, is plug-and-play, and is inherently compatible with any data modalities. We provide cuda implementation at: https://github.com/Shuxin-Liang/InnerGS.</description>

      <title>Subject-driven Video Generation via Disentangled Identity and Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to train a subject-driven customized video generation model through decoupling the subject-specific learning from temporal dynamics in zero-shot without additional tuning. A traditional method for video customization that is tuning-free often relies on large, annotated video datasets, which are computationally expensive and require extensive annotation. In contrast to the previous approach, we introduce the use of an image customization dataset directly on training video customization models, factorizing the video customization into two folds: (1) identity injection through image customization dataset and (2) temporal modeling preservation with a small set of unannotated videos through the image-to-video training method. Additionally, we employ random image token dropping with randomized image initialization during image-to-video fine-tuning to mitigate the copy-and-paste issue. To further enhance learning, we introduce stochastic switching during joint optimization of subject-specific and temporal features, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method achieves strong subject consistency and scalability, outperforming existing video customization models in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Dense 3D Displacement Estimation for Landslide Monitoring via Fusion of TLS Point Clouds and Embedded RGB Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Landslide monitoring is essential for understanding geohazards and mitigating associated risks. Existing point cloud-based methods, however, typically rely on either geometric or radiometric information and often yield sparse or non-3D displacement estimates. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical partitioning-based coarse-to-fine approach that integrates 3D point clouds and co-registered RGB images to estimate dense 3D displacement vector fields. Patch-level matches are constructed using both 3D geometry and 2D image features, refined via geometric consistency checks, and followed by rigid transformation estimation per match. Experimental results on two real-world landslide datasets demonstrate that the proposed method produces 3D displacement estimates with high spatial coverage (79% and 97%) and accuracy. Deviations in displacement magnitude with respect to external measurements (total station or GNSS observations) are 0.15 m and 0.25 m on the two datasets, respectively, and only 0.07 m and 0.20 m compared to manually derived references, all below the mean scan resolutions (0.08 m and 0.30 m). Compared with the state-of-the-art method F2S3, the proposed approach improves spatial coverage while maintaining comparable accuracy. The proposed approach offers a practical and adaptable solution for TLS-based landslide monitoring and is extensible to other types of point clouds and monitoring tasks. The example data and source code are publicly available at https://github.com/gseg-ethz/fusion4landslide.</description>
