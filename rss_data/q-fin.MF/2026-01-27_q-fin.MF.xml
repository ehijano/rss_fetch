      <title>VIX and European options with jumps in the short-maturity regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the short-maturity asymptotics for VIX and European option prices in local-stochastic volatility models with compound Poisson jumps. Both out-of-the-money (OTM) and at-the-money (ATM) asymptotics are considered. The leading-order asymptotics are obtained in closed-form. We apply our results to three examples: the Eraker model, a Kou-type model, and a folded normal model. Numerical illustrations are provided for these three examples that show the accuracy of predictions based on the asymptotic results.</description>

      <title>A Derivative Pricing Perspective on Liquidity Tokens in Constant Product Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11339v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In decentralized finance, any individual can pool their assets into an automated market maker (AMM) -- herein we focus on the constant product market maker (CPMM) -- in exchange for a claim on a fraction of future pool assets and fees earned from the market making operations. This position is represented by a liquidity token, whose prevailing on-chain price is effectively the initial deposited assets. Though this price is well-defined, we treat the liquidity token as a derivative position in the prices of the underlying assets for the CPMM in order to deduce risk-neutral pricing and hedging formulas, not dissimilar to the Black-Scholes result. Adopting this perspective, in a frictionless environment, hedging the CPMM liquidity token under fair valuation should produce a riskless process, which therefore grows at the risk-free rate, something that is not seen in empirical case studies under the prevailing price. With our novel pricing formula, we construct a method to calibrate a volatility to data which provides an updated (non-market) valuation which is consistent with the (near-continuous) replication strategy out-of-sample. We conclude with a discussion of novel AMM design considerations motivated by this derivative-pricing perspective.</description>

      <title>Short-rate models with stochastic discontinuities: a PDE approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the reform of interest rate benchmarks, interbank offered rates (IBORs) like LIBOR have been replaced by risk-free rates (RFRs), such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the U.S. and the Euro Short-Term Rate (\euro STR) in Europe. These rates exhibit characteristics like jumps and spikes that correspond to specific market events, driven by regulatory and liquidity constraints. To capture these characteristics, this paper considers a general short-rate model that incorporates discontinuities at fixed times with random sizes. Within this framework, we introduce a PDE-based approach for pricing interest rate derivatives and establish, under suitable assumptions, a Feynman-Ka\v{c} representation for the solution. For affine models, we derive (quasi) closed-form solutions, while for the general case, we develop numerical methods to solve the resulting PDEs.</description>
