Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study Virasoro constraints for Hodge integrals in Gromov-Witten theory of any target varieties. Results consist of the following: Firstly, we propose Virasoro conjecture for Hodge integrals in Gromov-Witten theory of any target varieties; Secondly, we prove Virasoro constraints for Hodge integrals in genus zero of any target varieties; Thirdly, we prove the genus-1 $L_1^{\mathbb{E}}$ constraint with one Hodge character class insertion for any target varieties; Lastly, we obtain certain new vanishing identities in higher genus for Gromov-Witten invariants of any target varieties.</description>

      <title>Lieb's Theorem for Bose Hubbard Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a cone-theoretical method, we prove the uniqueness of the ground state for two Bose Hubbard models. The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model with real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is a two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the ground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive integer) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the ground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients are real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs work equally well for any arbitrary lattice.</description>

      <title>The Bisognano-Wichmann property for non-unitary Wightman conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bisognano-Wichmann and Haag duality properties for algebraic quantum field theories are often studied using the powerful tools of Tomita-Takesaki modular theory for nets of operator algebras. In this article, we study analogous properties of nets of algebras generated by smeared Wightman fields, for potentially non-unitary theories. In light of recent work constructing Wightman field theories for (non-unitary) M\"obius vertex algebras, we obtain a broadly applicable non-unitary version of the Bisognano-Wichmann property. In this setting we do not have access to the traditional tools of Hilbert space functional analysis, like functional calculus. Instead, results analogous to those of Tomita-Takesaki theory are derived `by hand' from the Wightman axioms. As an application, we demonstrate Haag duality for nets of smeared Wightman fields for unitary theories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Horizon Segments and Spacetime Isometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a space-time $(\mathscr{M}, g_{ab})$ admitting a dynamical horizon segment (DHS) $\mathscr{H}$, we show that there are stringent constraints on the Killing fields $\xi^a$ that $g_{ab}$ can admit in a neighborhood of $\mathscr{H}$: Generically, $\xi^a$ can only be a rotational Killing field which, furthermore, leaves each marginally trapped 2-sphere cross-section $\mathcal{S}$ of $\mathscr{H}$ invariant. Finally, if $\xi^a$ happens to be hypersurface orthogonal near $\mathscr{H}$, then, not only the angular momentum but also all spin multipoles vanish on every $\mathcal{S}$; the entire spin structure of these DHSs is indistinguishable from that of spherically symmetric DHSs!</description>

      <title>Irreducible modules over the universal central extension of the planar Galilean conformal algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the representation theory of the universal central extension $\mathcal{G}$ of the infinite-dimensional Galilean conformal algebra, introduced by Bagchi-Gopakumar, in $(2+1)$ dimensional space-time, which was named the planar Galilean conformal algebra by Aizawa. More precisely, we construct a family of Whittaker modules $W_{\psi_{m,n}}$ over $\mathcal{G}$ while the necessary and sufficient conditions for these modules to be irreducible are given when $m\in\mathbb{Z}_+, n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $m,n$ have the same parity. Moreover, the irreducible criteria of the tensor product modules $\Omega(\lambda,\eta,\sigma,0)\otimes R, \Omega (\lambda,\eta,0,\sigma)\otimes R$ over $\mathcal{G}$ are obtained, where $\Omega(\lambda,\eta,\sigma,0), \Omega (\lambda,\eta,0,\sigma)$ are $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{h})$-free modules of rank one over $\mathcal{G}$ and $R$ is an irreducible restricted module over $\mathcal{G}$. Also, the isomorphism classes of these tensor product modules are determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the Navier-Stokes equation in the $f$-plane approximation, we provide an exact and explicit solution of the governing equations at leading order for fluid flows in the upper layer of the ocean, driven by a wind stress. Such a solution highlights the presence of a mean Ekman current superimposed to trochoidal oscillations and a background geostrophic current.</description>

      <title>Differential Space of Feynman Integrals: Annihilators and $\mathcal{D}$-module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel algorithm for constructing differential operators with respect to external variables that annihilate Feynman-like integrals and give rise to the associated $\mathcal{D}$-modules, based on Griffiths-Dwork reduction. By leveraging the Macaulay matrix method, we derive corresponding relations among partial differential operators, including systems of Pfaffian equations and Picard-Fuchs operators. Our computational approach is applicable to twisted period integrals in projective coordinates, and we showcase its application to Feynman graphs and Witten diagrams. The method yields annihilators and their algebraic relations for generic regulator values, explicitly avoiding contributions from surface terms. In the cases examined, we observe that the holonomic rank of the $\mathcal{D}$-modules coincides with the dimension of the corresponding de Rham co-homology groups, indicating an equivalence relation between them, which we propose as a conjecture.</description>

      <title>Lambert's problem in orbital dynamics: a self--contained introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lambert's problem is a classical boundary value problem in analytical mechanics. It arises when trying to determine the energy required to place a particle, subject to a central gravitational potential, in a free fall trajectory connecting two given points on a desired travel time. Due to its mathematical beauty and its relevance in aerospace engineering, it has been and remains the object of attention of countless engineers, mathematicians (pure and applied), and physicists seeking to produce efficient solution algorithms. In this expository article, didactic in nature, we present a unified and comprehensive derivation that assumes only a minimal background in physics and mathematics. We focus on the simplest two--body case and carefully develop the argument for elliptical trajectories. The goal is to provide a single reference that can serve as an accelerated introduction for students and researchers interested in a quick introduction to the subject.</description>

      <title>A General Coupling for Ising Models and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The couplings between the Ising model and its graphical representations, the random-cluster, random current and loop $\mathrm{O}(1)$ models, are put on common footing through a generalization of the Swendsen-Wang-Edwards-Sokal coupling. A new special case is that the single random current with parameter $2J$ on edges of agreement of XOR-Ising spins has the law of the double random current. The coupling also yields a general mechanism for constructing conditional Bernoulli percolation measures via uniform sampling, providing new perspectives on models such as the arboreal gas, random $d$-regular graphs, and self-avoiding walks. As an application of the coupling for the Loop-Cluster joint model, we prove that the regime of exponential decay of the $q$-state Potts model, the random-cluster representation, and its $q$-flow loop representation coincides on the torus, generalizing the Ising result. Finally, the Loop-Cluster coupling is generalized to lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Surface Nematic Quasi-Uniformity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line fields on surfaces are a means to describe the nematic order that may pattern them. The least distorted nematic fields are called uniform, but they can only exist on surfaces with negative constant Gaussian curvature. To identify the least distorted nematic fields on a generic surface, we relax the notion of uniformity into that of quasi-uniformity and prove that all such fields are parallel transported (in Levi-Civita's sense) by the geodesics of the surface. Both global and local constructions of quasi-uniform fields are presented to illustrate both richness and significance of the proposed notion.</description>

Abstract: In recent papers (arXiv:2407.16507, arXiv:2408.05158) we presented results suggesting the existence of a new class of time-periodic solutions to the defocusing cubic wave equation on a one-dimensional interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Here we confirm these findings by rigorously constructing solutions from this class. The proof uses rational arithmetic computations to verify essential operator bounds.</description>

Abstract: We establish Gromov's celebrated reconstruction theorem in Lorentzian geometry. Alongside this result, we introduce and study a natural concept of isomorphy of normalized bounded Lorentzian metric measure spaces. We outline applications to the spacetime reconstruction problem from causal set theory. Lastly, we propose three notions of convergence of (isomorphism classes of) normalized bounded Lorentzian metric measure spaces, for which we prove several fundamental properties.</description>

      <title>Non-constant ground configurations in the disordered ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disordered ferromagnet is a disordered version of the ferromagnetic Ising model in which the coupling constants are non-negative quenched random. A ground configuration is an infinite-volume configuration whose energy cannot be reduced by finite modifications. It is a long-standing challenge to ascertain whether the disordered ferromagnet on the $\mathbb{Z}^D$ lattice admits non-constant ground configurations. We answer this affirmatively in dimensions $D\ge 4$, when the coupling constants are sampled independently from a sufficiently concentrated distribution. The obtained ground configurations are further shown to be translation-covariant with respect to $\mathbb{Z}^{D-1}$ translations of the disorder.
  Our result is proved by showing that the finite-volume interface formed by Dobrushin boundary conditions is localized, and converges to an infinite-volume interface. This may be expressed in purely combinatorial terms, as a result on the fluctuations of certain minimal cutsets in the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^D$ endowed with independent edge capacities.</description>

Abstract: Bi-Hamiltonian structures can be utilised to compute a maximal set of functions in involution for certain integrable systems, given by the eigenvalues of the recursion operator relating both Poisson structures. We show that the recursion operator relating two compatible Jacobi structures cannot produce a maximal set of functions in involution. However, as we illustrate with an example, bi-Hamiltonian structures can still be used to obtain a maximal set of functions in involution on a contact manifold, at the cost of symplectisation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and equilibrium states of infinite systems of lattice bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of systems of lattice bosons with infinitely many degrees of freedom. We show that their dynamics defines a group of automorphisms on a $C^*$--algebra introduced by Buchholz, which extends the resolvent algebra of local field operators. For states that admit uniform bounds on moments of the local particle number, we derive propagation bounds of Lieb--Robinson type. Using these bounds, we show that the dynamics of local observables gives rise to a strongly continuous unitary group in the GNS representation. Moreover, accumulation points of finite-volume Gibbs states satisfy the KMS condition with respect to this group. This, in particular, proves the existence of KMS states.</description>

      <title>Wave pulses with unusual asymptotical behavior at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of wave signals in the far zone is not only of theoretical interest but also of paramount practical importance in communications and other fields of applications of optical, electromagnetic or acoustic waves. Long time ago T. T. Wu introduced models of 'electromagnetic missiles' whose decay could be made arbitrarily slower than the usual inverse distance by an appropriate choice of the high frequency portion of the source spectrum. Very recent work by Plachenov and Kiselev introduced a finite-energy scalar wave solution, different from Wu's, decaying slower than inversely proportional with the distance. A physical explanation for the unusual asymptotic behavior of the latter will be given in this article. Furthermore, two additional examples of scalar wave pulses characterized by abnormal slow decay in the far zone will be given and their asymptotic behavior will be discussed. A proof of feasibility of acoustic and electromagnetic fields with the abnormal asymptotics will be described.</description>

      <title>The second order Huang-Yang approximation to the Fermi thermodynamic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a dilute Fermi gas in the thermodynamic limit with interaction potential scattering length $\mathfrak{a}_0$ at temperature $T&gt;0$. We prove the 2nd order Huang-Yang approximation for the Fermi pressure of the system, in which there is a 2nd order term carrying the positive temperature efffect.Our formula is valid up to the temperature $T&lt;\rho^{\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{6}}$, which is, by scaling, also necessary for the Huang-Yang formula to hold. Here, $T_F\sim\rho^{\frac{2}{3}}$ is the Fermi temperature. We also establish during the course of the proof, a conjecture regarding the second order approximation of density $\rho$ by R. Seiringer \cite{FermithermoTpositive}. Our proof uses frequency localization techniques from the analysis of nonlinear PDEs and does not involve spatial localization or Bosonization. In particular, our method covers the classical Huang-Yang formula at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Deformation of Geometry through Function C(v): Scalar Deformation Flow and the Geometric Classification of 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the scalar deformation function C(v), which captures how local geometric structures respond to motion at velocity v. This function exhibits smooth analytic behavior and defines a critical velocity vc beyond which the geometry compresses. Extending C(v) into a flow C(v, tau), we construct a scalar analogue of Ricci flow that governs the evolution of geometric configurations toward symmetric, stable states without singularities. The flow is derived from a variational energy functional and satisfies global existence and convergence properties. We show that this scalar evolution provides a pathway for topological classification of three-manifolds through conformal smoothing and energy minimization, offering a curvature-free geometric mechanism rooted in analytic deformation. The resulting framework combines techniques from differential geometry and dynamical systems and may serve as a minimal geometric model for structure formation in relativistic contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14517v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2023 second edition of a 2006 encyclopedia article on mathematical aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (QFTCST). Section-titles (with new sections indicated with stars) are: Introduction and preliminaries, Construction of a $*$-algebra for a real linear scalar field on globally hyperbolic spacetimes and some general theorems, *More about (quasifree) Hadamard states, Particle creation and the limitations of the particle concept, Theory of the stress-energy tensor, *More about the intersection of QFTCST with AQFT and the Fewster-Verch No-Go Theorem, Hawking and Unruh effects, *More about (classical and) quantum fields on black hole backgrounds, Non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes and the time-machine question, *More about QFT on non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes, Other related topics and some warnings. The article contains many references. It also includes a review of, and also compares and contrasts, recent results on the implications of QFTCST for the question of the instability of three sorts of Cauchy horizon -- first those inside black holes such as especially Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter, second the compactly generated Cauchy horizons of spacetimes in which time-machines get manufactured, and third the Cauchy horizon of the spacetime which is believed to describe evaporating black holes and which underlies (one version of) the black hole information-loss puzzle.</description>

      <title>How much entanglement is needed for quantum error correction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that logical states of quantum error-correcting codes have to be highly entangled such that codes capable of correcting more errors require more entanglement to encode a qubit. Here, we show that the validity of this belief depends on the specific code and the choice of entanglement measure. To this end, we characterize a tradeoff between the code distance $d$ quantifying the number of correctable errors, and the geometric entanglement measure of logical states quantifying their maximal overlap with product states or more general ``topologically trivial" states. The maximum overlap is shown to be exponentially small in $d$ for three families of codes: (1) low-density parity check codes with commuting check operators, (2) stabilizer codes, and (3) codes with a constant encoding rate. Equivalently, the geometric entanglement of any logical state of these codes grows at least linearly with $d$. On the opposite side, we also show that this distance-entanglement tradeoff does not hold in general. For any constant $d$ and $k$ (number of logical qubits), we show there exists a family of codes such that the geometric entanglement of some logical states approaches zero in the limit of large code length.</description>

      <title>Periodic Solutions for the 1d Cubic Wave Equation with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study time-periodic solutions for the cubic wave equation on an interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We begin by following the perturbative construction of Vernov and Khrustalev and provide a rigorous derivation of the fourth-order expansion in small amplitude, which we use to verify the Galerkin scheme. In the main part, we focus on exploring large solutions numerically. We find an intricate bifurcation structure of time-periodic solutions forming a fractal-like pattern and explore it for the first time. Our results suggest that time-periodic solutions exist for arbitrary frequencies, with appearance of fine bifurcation structure likely related to the Cantor set families of solutions described in previous rigorous works.</description>

      <title>Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations and integrable hyperbolic Landau-Zener models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between integrable Landau-Zener (LZ) models and Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations. The latter are originally equations for the correlation functions of two-dimensional conformal field theories, but can also be interpreted as multi-time Schr\"odinger equations. The general LZ problem is to find probabilities of tunneling from eigenstates at $t=t_\text{in}$ to eigenstates at $t\to+\infty$ for an $N\times N$ time-dependent Hamiltonian $\hat H(t)$. A number of such problems are exactly solvable in the sense that their tunneling probabilities are elementary functions of Hamiltonian parameters. Recently, it has been proposed that exactly solvable LZ models of this type map to KZ equations. Here we use this connection to identify and solve a class of integrable LZ models with hyperbolic time dependence, $\hat H(t)=\hat A+\hat B/t$, for $N=2, 3$, and $4$, where $\hat A$ and $\hat B$ are time-independent matrices.</description>

Abstract: This survey explores knot polynomials and their categorification, culminating in the homological invariants of knots. We begin with an overview of classical knot polynomials, progressing towards the superpolynomial and its role in unifying various knot homologies. Along the way, we provide physical and geometric insights into the unification of the $sl(N)$ Khovanov-Rozansky and the knot Floer homology. We then turn our attention to the intriguing correspondence between knots and quivers, examining how this perspective sheds light on the integrality of BPS states encoded in the Labastida-Mari\~no-Ooguri-Vafa (LMOV) invariants. We will further investigate the knot-quiver correspondence from a physics and geometric side and study the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory $T[Q_K]$ for the quivers.</description>

      <title>Orientation Reversal and the Chern-Simons Natural Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the fundamental property of preservation of relations, underlying resurgent analysis, provides a new perspective on crossing a natural boundary, an important general problem in theoretical and mathematical physics. This reveals a deeper rigidity of resurgence in a quantum field theory. We study the non-perturbative completion of complex Chern-Simons theory that associates to a 3-manifold a collection of $q$-series invariants labeled by Spin$^c$ structures, for which crossing the natural boundary corresponds to orientation reversal of the 3-manifold. Our new resurgent perspective leads to a practical numerical algorithm that generates $q$-series which are dual to unary $q$-series composed of false theta functions. Until recently, these duals were only known in a limited number of cases, essentially based on Ramanujan's mock theta functions, and the common belief was that the more general duals might not even exist. Resurgence analysis identifies as primary objects Mordell integrals: transforms of resurgent functions. Their unique Borel summed transseries decomposition on either side of the Stokes line is the unique decomposition into real and imaginary parts. The latter are combinations of unary $q$-series in terms of $q$ and its modular counterpart $\tilde{q}$, and are resurgent by construction. The Mordell integral is analytic across the natural boundary of the $q$ and $\tilde{q}$ series, and uniqueness of a similar decomposition which preserves algebraic relations on the other side of the boundary defines the unique boundary crossing of the $q$ series. This continuation can be efficiently implemented numerically. This identifies known unique mock modular identities, and extends well beyond. The resurgent approach reveals new aspects, and is very different from other approaches based on indefinite theta series, Appell-Lerch sums, and logarithmic vertex operator algebras.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Derivation of the Wave Kinetic Equation for $\beta$-FPUT System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave kinetic theory has been suggested as a way to understand the longtime statistical behavior of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) system, with the aim of determining the thermalization time scale. The latter has been a major problem since the model was introduced in the 1950s. In this thesis we establish the wave kinetic equation for a reduced evolution equation obtained from the $\beta$-FPUT system by removing the non-resonant terms. We work in the kinetic limit $N\to \infty$ and $\beta\to 0$ under the scaling laws $\beta=N^{-\gamma}$ with $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$. The result holds up to the sub-kinetic time scale $T=N^{-\epsilon}\min\bigl(N,N^{5\gamma/4}\bigr)=N^{-\epsilon}T_{\mathrm{kin}}^{5/8}$ for $\epsilon\ll 1$, where $T_{\mathrm{kin}}$ represents the kinetic (thermalization) timescale. The novelties of this work include the treatment of non-polynomial dispersion relations, and the introduction of a robust phase renormalization argument to cancel dangerous divergent interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the fundamental entropic inequality proved recently in [arXiv:2408.15306] can be applied to obtain a useful relation for the Holevo quantity of discrete and continuous ensembles of quantum states.
  This relation gives a tight upper bound on the Holevo quantity of a given ensemble $\mu$ expressed in terms of the Holevo quantities of two auxiliary ensembles $\mu_+$ and $\mu_-$ produced by $\mu$. Among others, this implies quite accurate upper bounds on the Holevo quantity of a discrete ensemble of quantum states expressed via the probabilities and the metric characteristics of an ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Zakharov-Ito equation \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} u_t+u_{xxx}+3uu_x+\rho\rho_x=0,\\ \rho_t+{(u\rho)}_x=0. \end{cases} \end{equation*} We prove the local well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s&gt;3/2$ and global well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s\geq2$. When $\rho=0$, the Zakharov-Ito equation reduces to the KdV equation, hence has solitary waves with speeds $c\in(0,+\infty)$. We prove the orbital stability of these solitary waves in $H^1\times L^2$ by combining a variational approach and the framework of Grillakis, Shatah and Strauss \cite{GSS1987}.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Quantum Dynamics on Embedded Submanifolds: From Geometric Mass to Higgs Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a quantum dynamics framework for curved submanifolds embedded in higher-dimensional spaces. Through rigorous dimensional reduction, we derive the first complete Schr\"{o}dinger and Klein-Gordon equations incorporating non-perturbative geometric interactions-resolving ambiguities in constrained quantization. Crucially, extrinsic curvature of the ambient manifold governs emergent low-dimensional quantum phenomena. Remarkably, this mechanism generates scalar field masses matching Kaluza-Klein spectra while eliminating periodic compactification requirements. Geometric induction concurrently produces Higgs mechanism potentials. Particle masses emerge solely from submanifold embedding geometry, with matter-field couplings encoded in curvature invariants. This enables experimental access to higher-dimensional physics at all energy scales through geometric induction.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave generation in the presence of Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the wave equation for gravitational waves emitted by compact objects systems using the Multipolar Post-Minkowskian (MPM) method, and in the presence of Lorentz invariance violating terms. We select a Lorentz-violating extension of General Relativity in the pure gravity sector, directly taken from the Standard Model Extension (SME) formalism, and derive the wave equation for metric perturbation from the modified Einstein equation. We solve it with the MPM method and compute the gauge-invariant Riemann tensor components governing the geodesic deviation. Finally we compare the leading order term of the perturbative scheme in the small SME coefficients, with the leading order of the General Relativity. We outline the benefits and difficulties of this method. All the results are given as functionals of a set of general PM moments that can be matched to the physical properties of the source. These results are a first step toward putting state-of-the-art constraints on symmetries violations with new gravitational wave detectors like LISA.</description>

      <title>Large Time Behavior of the Klein-Gordon-Schr\"{o}dinger system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the global existence and scattering for small and localized solutions of the Klein-Gordon-Schr\"{o}dinger system in three dimensions. The system consists of coupled semilinear Schr\"{o}dinger and Klein-Gordon equations with quadratic nonlinearities. This model is motivated by the study of plasma oscillations arising from the Hartree equation near a translation-invariant equilibrium with the Coulomb potential. Our proof relies on the space-time resonance method. The main difficulty comes from the two dimensional space-time resonant set and the absence of null form structure.</description>
