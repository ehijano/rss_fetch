      <title>Algebraic quantisation approach to integrable differential-difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an algebraic quantisation approach, based on quantisation ideals, and apply it to integrable non-Abelian differential--difference equations. We show that the Toda hierarchy admits a bi-quantum structure whose classical (commutative) limit recovers a well-known Poisson pencil. In addition, we discover a non-standard quantisation that has no commutative counterpart. In both cases we present the quantum systems in the Heisenberg form.
  The generality of the method is illustrated through a wide range of integrable lattices, including the modified Volterra, Bogoyavlensky, Ablowitz-Ladik, relativistic Toda, Merola-Ragnisco-Tu, Adler-Yamilov, Chen-Lee-Liu, Belov-Chaltikian, and Blaszak-Marciniak systems. For each of them, we construct explicit quantisation ideals and present the first few commuting quantum Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Pentagram maps over rings, Grassmannians, and skewers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pentagram map is a discrete dynamical system on planar polygons. By definition, the image of a polygon $P$ under the pentagram map is the polygon $P'$ whose vertices are the intersection points of consecutive shortest diagonals of $P$. The pentagram map was introduced by R. Schwartz in 1992, and is now one of the most renowned discrete integrable systems. Several authors proposed generalizations of the pentagram map to other geometries, in particular to Grassmannians, where the role of points and lines is played by higher-dimensional subspaces, as well to skewer geometry, where both points and lines are affine lines in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. In the present paper, we develop a common framework for these kinds of generalizations. Specifically, we show that those maps can be viewed as pentagram maps in the projective plane over an appropriate ring. In general, those rings need not be division rings or commutative. We show that the Grassmannian pentagram map corresponds to the ring of matrices, while the skewer map is the pentagram map over the ring of dual numbers. Furthermore, we prove that the pentagram map remains integrable for any stably finite ground ring $R$.</description>
