      <title>System identification based on characteristic curves: a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier analysis for first-order nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02349v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the sinosoidal output response in power series (SORPS) formalism was presented for system identification and simulation. Based on the concept of characteristic curves (CCs), it establishes a mathematical connection between power series and Fourier series for a first-order nonlinear system [F. J. Gonzalez, Sci. Rep. 13, 1955, (2023)]. However, the system identification procedure discussed there, based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), presents the limitations of requiring a sinusoidal single tone for the dynamical variable and equally spaced time steps for the input-output dataset (DS). These limitations are here addressed by introducing a different approach: we use a power series-based model for system modeling using two hyperparameters $\hat{A}_0$ and $\hat{A}_1$ optimally defined depending on the DS. Overall, this work expands the applicability of the SORPS formalism to arbitrary DSs and represents a groundbreaking contribution for the concept of CCs. The method of CCs is complementary to the commonly used approaches of NARMAX-models and sparse regression techniques, which emphasize the estimation of the individual parameter values of the model. However, the CCs-based methods emphasize the computation of the CCs as a whole, thus presenting the advantages that the system identification is uniquely defined, and that it can be applied for any system without additional algebraic operations. Thus, the parsimonious principle defined by the NARMAX-philosophy is extended from the concept of a model with as few parameters as possible to the concept of finding the lowest model order that correctly describe the input-output DS. This opens up a wide variety of potential applications in vibration analysis, structural dynamics, viscoelastic materials, nonlinear electric circuits, voltammetry techniques, structural health monitoring, and fault diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Improved Long-Term Prediction of Chaos Using Reservoir Computing Based on Stochastic Spin-Orbit Torque Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting chaotic systems is crucial for understanding complex behaviors, yet challenging due to their sensitivity to initial conditions and inherent unpredictability. Probabilistic Reservoir Computing (RC) is well-suited for long-term chaotic predictions by handling complex dynamic systems. Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT) devices in spintronics, with their nonlinear and probabilistic operations, can enhance performance in these tasks. This study proposes an RC system utilizing SOT devices for predicting chaotic dynamics. By simulating the reservoir in an RC network with SOT devices that achieve nonlinear resistance changes with random distribution, we enhance the robustness for the predictive capability of the model. The RC network predicted the behaviors of the Mackey-Glass and Lorenz chaotic systems, demonstrating that stochastic SOT devices significantly improve long-term prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Resonance and Weak Chaos in Quasiperiodically-Forced Circle Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a numerical technique, the weighted Birkhoff average (WBA) to distinguish between four categories of dynamics for quasiperiodically-forced circle maps. Regular dynamics can be classified by rotation vectors, and these can be rapidly computed to machine precision using the WBA. Regular orbits can be resonant or incommensurate and we distinguish between these by computing their "resonance order." When the dynamics is chaotic the WBA converges slowly. Such orbits can be strongly chaotic, when they have a positive Lyapunov exponent or weakly chaotic, when the maximal Lyapunov exponent is zero. The latter correspond to the strange nonchaotic attractors (SNA) that have been observed in quasiperiodically-forced circle maps beginning with the models introduced by Ding, Grebogi, and Ott. The WBA provides a new technique to find SNAs, and allows us to accurately compute the proportions of each of the four orbit types as a function of map parameters.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous transition to chaos in a canonical random neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a paradigmatic random recurrent neural network introduced by Sompolinsky, Crisanti, and Sommers (SCS). In the infinite size limit, this system exhibits a direct transition from a homogeneous rest state to chaotic behavior, with the Lyapunov exponent gradually increasing from zero. We generalize the SCS model considering odd saturating nonlinear transfer functions, beyond the usual choice $\phi(x)=\tanh x$. A discontinuous transition to chaos occurs whenever the slope of $\phi$ at 0 is a local minimum (i.e., for $\phi'''(0)&gt;0$). Chaos appears out of the blue, by an attractor-repeller fold. Accordingly, the Lyapunov exponent stays away from zero at the birth of chaos.</description>

      <title>Extracting Equations of Motion from Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01926v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alternative computing paradigms open the door to exploiting recent innovations in computational hardware to probe the fundamental thermodynamic limits of information processing. One such paradigm employs superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to execute classical computations. This, though, requires constructing sufficiently complex superconducting circuits that support a suite of useful information processing tasks and storage operations, as well as understanding these circuits' energetics. First-principle circuit design, though, leads to prohibitive algebraic complications when deriving the effective equations of motion -- complications that to date have precluded achieving these goals, let alone doing so efficiently. We circumvent these complications by (i) specializing our class of circuits and physical operating regimes, (ii) synthesizing existing derivation techniques to suit these specializations, and (iii) implementing solution-finding optimizations which facilitate physically interpreting circuit degrees of freedom that respect physically-grounded constraints. This leads to efficient, practical circuit prototyping and access to scalable circuit architectures. The analytical efficiency is demonstrated by reproducing the potential energy landscape generated by the quantum flux parametron (QFP). We then show how inductively coupling two QFPs produces a device that is capable of executing 2-bit computations via its composite potential energy landscape. More generally, the synthesis methods detailed here provide a basis for constructing universal logic gates and investigating their thermodynamic performance.</description>
