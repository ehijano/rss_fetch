      <title>Permutation groups and symmetric Hecke algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The endomorphism algebras of the permutation modules for transitive permutation groups, known as Hecke algebras, are fundamental objects in representation theory. While group algebras are known to be symmetric over any field, it is natural to ask whether this property extends to Hecke algebras. To study this, we introduce the new concepts of $p$-$S$-permutation groups (for a prime $p$) and $S$-permutation groups. A \emph{ $p$-$S$-permutation group} is a transitive permutation group whose associated Hecke algebra is symmetric over every field of characteristic $p$. An \emph{ $S$-permutation group} is a transitive permutation group that is a $p$-$S$-permutation group for all primes $p$. In this paper, we study Hecke algebras from a group-theoretical perspective and we show that several classes of permutation groups are $p$-$S$-permutation groups and $S$-permutation groups in our sense. This result represents a substantial extension of earlier work by Li and He. (Transform Groups, 30(4), 2025), and reframes the question of determining when the algebra \(\End_{KG}(K\Omega)\) is symmetric within a more general theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Higher torsion classes, $\tau_d$-tilting theory and silting complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initiated in work by Adachi, Iyama and Reiten, the area known as $\tau$-tilting theory plays a fundamental role in contemporary representation theory. In this paper we explore a higher-dimensional analogue of this theory, formulated with respect to the higher Auslander-Reiten translation $\tau_d$. In particular, we associate to any functorially finite $d$-torsion class a maximal $\tau_d$-rigid pair and a $(d+1)$-term silting complex. In the case $d=1$, the notions of maximal $\tau_d$-rigid and support $\tau$-tilting pairs coincide, and our theory recovers the classical bijections. However, the proof strategies for $d&gt;1$ differ significantly. As an intermediate step, we prove that a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a module category induces a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of the category of $(d+1)$-term complexes, producing novel examples of $d$-exact categories. We introduce the notion of a $d$-torsion class in the exact setup, and use this to obtain the aforementioned $(d+1)$-term silting complex. We moreover apply our theory to study $d$-APR tilting modules and slices. To illustrate our results, we provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of maximal $\tau_d$-rigid pairs and $(d+1)$-term silting complexes for higher Auslander and higher Nakayama algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $2$. We consider the commuting variety and the commuting nilpotent variety of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$, namely the sets $\mathcal{C}_2(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n})=\{ (x,y) \in \mathfrak{sp}_{2n} \times \mathfrak{sp}_{2n} \mid [x,y]=0\}$ and $\mathcal{C}_2^{\text{nil}}(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n})=\{ (x,y) \in \mathfrak{sp}_{2n} \times \mathfrak{sp}_{2n} \mid x,y \text{ nilpotent, } [x,y]=0\}$ and prove that they are both irreducible, of dimensions $\dim(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}) + 2n$ and $\dim(\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}) + n-1$, respectively.</description>

      <title>A mutation invariant for skew-symmetrizable matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix mutation of skew-symmetrizable matrices is foundational in cluster algebra theory. Effective mutation invariants are essential for determining whether two matrices lie in the same mutation class. Casals~\cite{Casals} introduced a binary mutation invariant for skew-symmetric matrices. In this paper, we extend Casals' construction to the skew-symmetrizable setting. When the skew-symmetrizer $d_1,\dots, d_n$ is pairwise coprime, we obtain two distinct extensions of this invariant.</description>

      <title>On the uniform dimension of subextensions in skew polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the invariance of the non-necessarily finite uniform dimension and related concepts for subextensions in skew polynomial rings \mbox{$ \mathbb{S}=R[ \mathbf{\mathrm{X}}; \mathbf{\alpha} , \mathbf{\delta} ]$} of bijective type over a well-ordered set of variables. When the coefficient ring has enough uniform left ideals, in the commuting variables case we show that classical results on this topic for polynomial rings extend to subextensions of skew Laurent polynomial rings \mbox{$ \mathbb{S}=R[ \mathbf{\mathrm{X}}^{\pm1}; \mathbf{\alpha}]$}, generated over $R$ by any family of (standard) terms. The situation in the non-commuting variables context is more complex; easily formed polynomial-like subrings can behave very oddly from the ambient ring.
  We provide easy examples of a (semi)prime left Goldie skew polynomial ring of bijective type containing a monoid subring isomorphic to a free non-commutative polynomial ring. We then study the so-called subclass of \emph{essentially special subextensions} and obtain for them the preservation of the uniform dimension and related concepts.</description>

      <title>Semiseparability of induction functors in a monoidal category</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any algebra morphism in a monoidal category, we provide sufficient conditions (which are also necessary if the unit is a left tensor generator) for the attached induction functor being semiseparable. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the semiseparability of the induction functor is preserved if one applies a lax monoidal functor. Similar results are shown for the coinduction functors attached to coalgebra morphisms in a monoidal category. As an application, we study the semiseparability of combinations of (co)induction functors in the context of duoidal categories.</description>

      <title>The generic extension map and modular standard modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study two classes of $\ell$-modular standard modules of the general linear group. The first class is obtained by reducing existing standard modules over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_\ell$ to $\overline{\mathbb{F}}_\ell$ with respect to their natural integral structure. The second class is obtained by studying the generic extension map of the cyclical quiver, which was motivated by the construction of certain monomial bases of quantum algebras. In the latter case we also manage to prove a modular version of the Langlands classification, similar to the work of Langlands and Zelevinsky over $\mathbb{C}$. We moreover compute the corresponding $\ell$-modular Rankin-Selberg $L$-functions and check that they agree with the $L$-functions of their $\mathrm{C}$-parameters constructed by Kurinczuk and Matringe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Jucys-Murphy elements of the BMW algebra to show that its center over the complex numbers for almost all parameters making it semisimple is given by Wheel Laurent polynomials, a subalgebra of the symmetric Laurent polynomials in the JM elements. As an application, we give an Okounkov-Vershik like approach to its finite dimensional representations. In the non semisimple case related to the type B Lie algebras, the central subalgebra of Wheel Laurent polynomials is large enough to separate blocks of the BMW algebras.</description>

      <title>Two invariant subalgebras of rational Cherednik algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Originally motivated by connections to integrable systems, two natural subalgebras of the rational Cherednik algebra have been considered in the literature. The first is the subalgebra of all degree zero elements and the second is the Dunkl angular momentum subalgebra. In this article, we study the ring-theoretic and homological properties of these algebras. Our approach is to realise them as rings of invariants under the action of certain reductive subgroups of $\rm SL_2$. This allows us to describe their centres. Moreover, we show that they are Auslander-Gorenstein and Cohen-Macaulay and, at $t = 0$, give rise to prime PI-algebras whose PI-degree we compute. Since the degree zero subalgebra can be realized as the ring of invariants for the maximal torus $\rm T \subset SL_2$ and the action of this torus on the rational Cherednik algebra is Hamiltonian, we also consider its (quantum) Hamiltonian reduction with respect to $\rm T$. At $t = 1$, the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the spherical subalgebra is a filtered quantization of the quotient of the minimal nilpotent orbit closure $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}$ in ${\mathfrak gl}(n)$ by the reflection group $W$. At $t = 0$, we get a graded Poisson deformation of the symplectic singularity $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}/W$.</description>

      <title>Integration of Hochschild cohomology, derived Picard groups and uniqueness of lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a partial integration map from the first Hochschild cohomology of any cohomologically unital A-infinity category over a field of characteristic zero to its derived Picard group. We discuss useful properties such as injectivity, naturality and the relation with the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. Based on the image of the integration map we propose a candidate for the identity component of the derived Picard group in the case of finite-dimensional graded algebras. As a first application of the integration map it is shown that the vanishing of its domain is a necessary condition for the uniqueness of lifts of equivalences from the homotopy category to the A-infinity-level. The final part contains applications to derived Picard groups of wrapped and compact Fukaya categories of cotangent bundles and their plumbings and an outlook on applications to derived Picard groups of partially wrapped Fukaya categories after Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich.</description>

      <title>Leading terms of relations on a level 5 module over the twisted affine Lie algebra $A_2^{(2)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the starting points of this work was the duality of Borcea relating standard level $k$ representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and level $2k+1$ of $A_2^{(2)}$. For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\in\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5\Lambda_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5\Lambda_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2\Lambda_0)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum spheres as Leavitt path algebras: Quivers with Quantum Yang-Baxter equation, and Hecke condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study Leavitt path algebras over quivers with relations such as quantum Yang-Baxter equation, Hecke condition, and RTT conditions. This construction allows us to produce examples of Leavitt path algebras that contain quantum matrix algebra as subalgebra and obtain an algebraic analogue of the Hong-Szyma\'{n}ski result. In particular, we show that the coordinate algebra over odd-dimensional Vaksman-Soibelman quantum sphere can be realized as the Zhang twist of a Leavitt path algebra over a quiver with such relations. Furthermore, we show that the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, and Hecke condition for our RTT construction can be generated intrinsically from the adjacency matrix of certain quivers.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly construct Maass wave cusp forms associated to Hecke characters on arbitrary real quadratic fields. This result is a generalization of Maass (1949), who constructed Maass wave cusp forms under the assumption that narrow class number is one. We also compute its Petersson inner product explicitly and give a few examples involving dihedral Artin representations.</description>
