      <title>Eigenstate localization in a many-body quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of extensive many-body Hamiltonians with few-body interactions and a many-body mobility edge: all eigenstates below a nonzero energy density are localized in an exponentially small fraction of "energetically allowed configurations" within Hilbert space. Our construction is based on quantum perturbations to a classical low-density parity check code. In principle, it is possible to detect this eigenstate localization by measuring few-body correlation functions in efficiently preparable mixed states.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production by Underdamped Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy production (EP) is a central quantity in nonequilibrium physics as it monitors energy dissipation, reversibility, and free energy differences during thermodynamic transformations. Estimating EP, however, is challenging both theoretically and experimentally due to limited access to the system dynamics. For overdamped Langevin dynamics and Markov jump processes it was recently proposed that, from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TUR), short-time cumulant currents can be used to estimate EP without knowledge of the dynamics. Yet, estimation of EP in underdamped Langevin systems remains an active challenge. To address this, we derive a modified TUR that relates the statistics of two specific novel currents -- one cumulant current and one stochastic current -- to a system's EP. These two distinct but related currents are used to constrain EP in the modified TUR. One highlight is that there always exists a family of currents such that the uncertainty relations saturate, even for long-time averages and in nonsteady-state scenarios. Another is that our method only requires limited knowledge of the dynamics -- specifically, the damping-coefficient to mass ratio and the diffusion constant. This uncertainty relation allows estimating EP for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We validate the method numerically, through applications to several underdamped systems, to underscore the flexibility in obtaining EP in nonequilibrium Langevin systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of Magnetic Anisotropy on 3-Qubit Antiferromagnetic Thermal Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the anisotropic effects on a system of three qubits with chain and ring topology, described by the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg XXX model subjected to a homogeneous magnetic field. We explore the Stirling and Otto cycles and find that easy-axis anisotropy significantly enhances engine efficiency across all cases. At low temperatures, the ring configuration outperforms the chain on both work and efficiency during the Stirling cycle. Additionally, in both topologies, the Stirling cycle achieves Carnot efficiency with finite work at quantum critical points. In contrast, the quasistatic Otto engine also reaches Carnot efficiency at these points but yields no useful work. Notably, the Stirling cycle exhibits all thermal operational regimes engine, refrigerator, heater, and accelerator unlike the quasistatic Otto cycle, which functions only as an engine or refrigerator.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulations of the Blinking-Checkers Model for Polyamorphic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The blinking-checkers model [F. Caupin and M. A. Anisimov, Phys. Rev. Lett, 127,185701 (2021)] is a minimal lattice model which has demonstrated that, in the meanfield approximation, it can reproduce the phenomenon of fluid polyamorphism. This model is a binary lattice-gas, in which each site has three possible states: empty, occupied with particles of type 1, and occupied with particles of type 2. Additionally, the two types of particles may interconvert from one to another. Equilibrium interconversion imposes a constraint that makes this model thermodynamically equivalent to a single-component system. In this work, Monte-Carlo simulations of the blinking-checkers model are performed, demonstrating polyamorphic phase behavior. The locations of the liquid-liquid and liquid-gas critical points are found to be different from the meanfield predictions for this model with the same interaction parameters, as the phase behavior is significantly affected by critical fluctuations. Based on the computed values of the critical exponents of the order parameter, susceptibility, correlation length, and surface tension, we confirm that the blinking-checkers model, for both liquid-gas and liquid-liquid equilibria, belongs to the three-dimensional Ising class of critical-point universality.</description>

      <title>On the role of Loewner entropy in statistical mechanics of 2D Ising system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental properties of 2-dimensional (2D) Ising system were formulated using the Loewner theory. We focus on the role of the complexity measure of the 2D geometry, referred to as the Loewner entropy, to derive the statistical-mechanical relations of the 2D Ising system by analyzing the structure of the interface (i.e., the phase separation line). For the mixing property of the discrete Loewner evolution, we assume that the Loewner driving force ${\it\eta_s(n)}$ obtained from the interface has a stationary property, where the autocorrelation function $\langle{\it\eta_s(0)\eta_s(n)}\rangle $ converges in the long-time limit. Using this fact, we reconstruct the continuous Loewner evolution driven by the diffusion process whose increments correspond to the sequence of ${\it\eta_s(n)}$, and the fractal dimension of the generated curve was derived. We show that these formulations lead to a novel expression of the Hamiltonian, grand canonical ensemble of the system, which also are applicable for the non-equilibrium state of the system. In addition, the relations on the central limit theorem (CLT) governing the local fluctuation of the interface, the non-equilibrium free energy, and fluctuation dissipation relation (FDR) were derived using the Loewner theory. The present results suggest a possible form of the complexity-based theory of the 2D statistical mechanical systems that is applicable for the non-equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in full counting statistics of free fermions and directed polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider directed polymers in 1+1 spatial dimension under action of an external repulsive potential along a line. Using the exact mapping onto imaginary time evolution of free fermions we find that for sufficiently strong potential the system of polymers undergoes a continuous configurational phase transition. The transition corresponds to merging empty regions in the dominant limit shape.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and departure statistics of critically loaded queues: oscillating cumulants and generalized BRAVO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Queueing theory is used for modeling biological processes, traffic flows and many more real-life situations. Beyond that, queues describe systems out of equilibrium and can thus be considered as minimal models of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. We demonstrate that non-equilibrium phase transitions of queues in the steady state are accompanied by a nontrivial flow of departing customers. Our analytical results show that the cumulants of the departure statistics deviate strongly from Poissonian values and oscillate in the vicinity of phase transitions, i.e., if a critical load is approached. The load-dependent oscillations of the cumulants generalize the BRAVO effect (Balancing Reduces Asymptotic Variance of Outputs) in queues and may occur in other boundary-driven non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Principal component analysis of absorbing state phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a principal component analysis (PCA) of two one-dimensional lattice models belonging to distinct nonequilibrium universality classes - directed bond percolation and branching and annihilating random walks with even number of offspring. We find that the uncentered PCA of datasets storing various system's configurations can be successfully used to determine the critical properties of these nonequilibrium phase transitions. In particular, in both cases, we obtain good estimates of the critical point and the dynamical critical exponent of the models. For directed bond percolation we are, furthermore, able to extract critical exponents associated with the correlation length and the order parameter. We discuss the relation of our analysis with low-rank approximations of datasets.</description>

      <title>Out of equilibrium response and fluctuation-dissipation violations across scales in flocking systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flocking systems are known to be strongly out of equilibrium. Energy input occurs at the individual level to ensure self-propulsion, and the individual motility in turn contributes to ordering, enhancing information propagation and strengthening collective motion. However, even beyond ordering, a crucial feature of natural aggregations is response. How, then, do off-equilibrium features affect the response of the system? In this work, we consider a minimal model of flocking and investigate response behavior under directional perturbations. We show that equilibrium dynamical fluctuation-dissipation relations between response and correlations are violated, both at the local and at the global level. The amount of violation peaks at the ordering transition, exactly as for the entropy production rate. Entropy is always produced locally and connected to the local fluctuation-dissipation violation via Harada-Sasa relationships. However, cooperative mechanisms close to the transition spread off-equilibrium effects to the whole system, producing an out of equilibrium response on the global scale. Our findings elucidate the role of activity and interactions in the cost repartition of collective behavior and explain what observed in experiments on natural living groups.</description>

      <title>Anthropic Selection for a Low-Entropy Past</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The definition of thermodynamic entropy is dependent on one's assignment of physical microstates to observed macrostates. As a result, low entropy in the distant past could be equivalently explained by selection of a particular observer. In this paper, I make the case that because we observe a low-entropy past everywhere even as we look further and further away, anthropic selection over observers does not explain the non-equilibrium state of the observed cosmos. Under a uniform prior over possible world states, the probability of a non-equilibrium past, given our local observations, decreases to zero as the size of the world tends toward infinity. This claim is not dependent on choice of observer, unless the amount of information used to encode the observer's coarse-graining perception function scales linearly with the size of the world. As a result, for anthropic selection to choose a world like the one we live in, the initial state of a universe with size $N$ must be low-information, having Kolmogorov complexity that does not scale with $N$.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlators in electronic structure using Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator spreading has profound implications in diverse fields ranging from statistical mechanics and blackhole physics to quantum information. The usual way to quantify it is through out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), which are the quantum analog to Lyapunov exponents in classical chaotic dynamics. In this work we explore the phenomenon of operator spreading in quantum simulation of electronic structure in quantum computers. To substantiate our results, we focus on a hydrogen chain $H_4$ and demonstrate that operator spreading is enhanced when the chain is far from its equilibrium geometry. We also investigate the dynamics of bipartite entanglement and its dependence on the partition's size. Our findings reveal distinctive signatures closely resembling area- and volume-laws in equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium geometries, respectively. Our results provide insight of operator spreading of coherent errors in quantum simulation of electronic structure and can be experimentally implemented in various platforms available today.</description>

      <title>Flow Through Porous Media at the Percolation Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study low-Reynolds-number fluid flow through a two-dimensional porous medium modeled as a Lorentz gas. Using extensive finite element simulations we fully resolve the flow fields for packing fractions approaching the percolation threshold. Near the percolation transition, we find a power-law scaling of the flow rate versus the pressure drop with an exponent of $\approx 5/2$, which has been predicted earlier by mapping the macroscopic flow to a discrete flow network [Phys. Rev. Lett. 54, 1985]. Importantly, we observe a rounding of the scaling behavior at small system sizes, which can be rationalized via a finite-size scaling ansatz. Finally, we show that the distribution of the kinetic energy exhibits a power-law scaling over several decades at small energies, originating from collections of self-similar, viscous eddies in the dead-end-channels. Our results lay the foundation for unraveling critical behavior of complex fluids omnipresent in biological and geophysical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: World-wide efforts aim at the realization of advanced quantum simulators and processors. However, despite the development of intricate hardware and pulse control systems, it may still not be generally known which effective quantum dynamics, or channels, are implemented on these devices. To systematically infer those, we propose a neural-network algorithm approximating generic discrete-time dynamics through the repeated action of an effective quantum channel. We test our approach considering time-periodic Lindblad dynamics as well as non-unitary subsystem dynamics in many-body unitary circuits. Moreover, we exploit it to investigate cross-talk effects on the ibmq_ehningen quantum processor, which showcases our method as a practically applicable tool for inferring quantum channels when the exact nature of the underlying dynamics on the physical device is not known a priori. While the present approach is tailored for learning Markovian dynamics, we discuss how it can be adapted to also capture generic non-Markovian discrete-time evolutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement theory of the heat capacity of thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory and mechanistic understanding of the thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently missing. We develop a theoretical quantum confinement description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for the heat capacity. In particular, due to the suppression of vibrational modes caused by the thin film confinement, the vibrational density of states (VDOS) deviates from the Debye quadratic law in frequency and is, instead, cubic in frequency. This leads to a temperature dependence of the heat capacity which is $\sim T^4$ instead of Debye's $\sim T^3$ law. Furthermore, the new theory predicts a linear increase of the heat capacity upon increasing the nanometric film thickness. Both dependencies are found in excellent agreement with recent experimental data on NbTiN thin films.</description>

Abstract: Disordered hyperuniform structures are an exotic state of matter having suppressed density fluctuations at large length-scale similar to perfect crystals and quasicrystals but without any long range orientational order. In the past decade, an increasing number of non-equilibrium systems were found to have dynamic hyperuniform states, which have emerged as a new research direction coupling both non-equilibrium physics and hyperuniformity. Here we review the recent progress in understanding dynamic hyperuniform states found in various non-equilibrium systems, including the critical hyperuniformity in absorbing phase transitions, non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluids and the hyperuniform structures in phase separating systems via spinodal decomposition.</description>

      <title>Principles of bursty mRNA expression and irreversibility in single cells and extrinsically varying populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical model of mRNA expression is the telegraph model, describing a gene that switches on and off, subject to transcription and decay. It describes steady-state mRNA distributions that subscribe to transcription in bursts with first-order decay, referred to as super-Poissonian expression. Using a telegraph-like model, I propose an answer to the question of why gene expression is bursty in the first place, and what benefits it confers. Using analytics for the entropy production rate, I find that entropy production is maximal when the on and off switching rates between the gene states are approximately equal. This is related to a lower bound on the free energy necessary to keep the system out of equilibrium, meaning that bursty gene expression may have evolved in part due to free energy efficiency. It is shown that there are trade-offs between having slow nuclear export, which can reduce cytoplasmic mRNA noise, and the energy required to keep the system out of equilibrium -- nuclear compartmentalization comes with an associated free energy cost. At the population level, I find that extrinsic variation, manifested in cell-to-cell differences in kinetic parameters, can make the system more or less reversible -- and potentially energy efficient -- depending on where the noise is located. This highlights that there evolutionary constraints on the suppression of extrinsic noise, whose origin is in cellular heterogeneity, in addition to intrinsic randomness arising from molecular collisions. Finally, I investigate the partially observed nature of most mRNA expression data which seems to obey detailed balance, yet remains unavoidably out-of-equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Memory effects in colloidal motion under confinement and driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of individual particles in inhomogeneous environments is complex and exhibits non-Markovian responses. The latter may be quantified by a memory function within the framework of the linear generalised Langevin equation (GLE). Here, we exemplify the implications of steady driving on the memory function of a colloidal model system for Brownian motion in a corrugated potential landscape, specifically, for one-dimensional motion in a sinusoidal potential. To this end, we consider the overdamped limit of the GLE, which is facilitated by separating the memory function into a singular (Markovian) and a regular (non-Markovian) part. Relying on exact solutions for the investigated model, we show that the random force entering the GLE must display a bias far from equilibrium, which corroborates a recent general prediction. Based on data for the mean-square displacement obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations, we estimate the memory function for different driving strengths and show that already moderate driving accelerates the decay of the memory function by several orders of magnitude in time. We find that the memory may persist on much longer timescales than expected from the convergence of the mean-square displacement to its long-time asymptote. Furthermore, the functional form of the memory function changes from a monotonic decay to a non-monotonic, damped oscillatory behaviour, which can be understood from a competition of confined motion and depinning. Our analysis of the simulation data further reveals a pronounced non-Gaussianity, which questions the Gaussian approximation of the random force entering the GLE.</description>

      <title>Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality in two-component driven diffusive models: Symmetry and renormalization group perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.12210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elucidate the universal spatio-temporal scaling properties of the time-dependent correlation functions in a class of two-component one-dimensional (1D) driven diffusive system that consists of two coupled asymmetric exclusion process. By using a perturbative renormalization group framework, we show that the relevant scaling exponents have values same as those for the 1D Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. We connect these universal scaling exponents with the symmetries of the model equations. We thus establish that these models belong to the 1D KPZ universality class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain the steering of slow degrees of freedom by coupling them to driven components for which the time-symmetric reactivities are manipulated. We present the strategy and main principle that make that sort of navigation feasible. For illustration, nonlinear limit cycles (as in the van der Pol oscillator) and strange attractors (as in the Lorenz dynamics) are seen to emerge when the driving in the nonequilibrium medium is kept fixed while the frenesy is tuned to produce the required forces. We imagine that such frenetic steering is available in Life as well, allowing selection of the appropriate biological functioning.</description>

      <title>On the structure factor of jammed particle configurations on the one-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A broad class of blocked or jammed configurations of particles on the one-dimensional lattice can be characterized in terms of local rules involving only the lengths of clusters of particles (occupied sites) and of holes (empty sites). Examples of physical relevance include the metastable states reached by kinetically constrained spin chains, the attractors of totally irreversible processes such as random sequential adsorption, and arrays of Rydberg atoms in the blockade regime. The configurational entropy of ensembles of such blocked configurations has been investigated recently by means of an approach inspired from the theory of stochastic renewal processes. This approach provides a valuable alternative to the more traditional transfer-matrix formalism. We show that the renewal approach is also an efficient tool to investigate a range of observables in uniform ensembles of blocked configurations, besides their configurational entropy. The main emphasis is on their structure factor and correlation function.</description>

      <title>Markov generators as non-hermitian supersymmetric quantum Hamiltonians: spectral properties via bi-orthogonal basis and Singular Value Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuity equations associated to continuous-time Markov processes can be considered as Euclidean Schr\"odinger equations, where the non-hermitian quantum Hamiltonian $\bold{H}={\bold{div}}{\bold J}$ is naturally factorized into the product of the divergence operator ${\bold {div}}$ and the current operator ${\bold J}$. For non-equilibrium Markov jump processes in a space of $N$ configurations with $M$ links and $C=M-(N-1)\geq 1$ independent cycles, this factorization of the $N \times N$ Hamiltonian ${\bold H}={\bold I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ involves the incidence matrix ${\bold I}$ and the current matrix ${\bold J}$ of size $M \times N$, so that the supersymmetric partner ${\hat{\bold H}}= {\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ governing the dynamics of the currents living on the $M$ links is of size $M \times M$. To better understand the relations between the spectral decompositions of these two Hamiltonians $\bold{H}={\bold I}^{\dagger}{\bold J}$ and ${\hat {\bold H}} ={\bold J}{\bold I}^{\dagger}$ with respect to their bi-orthogonal basis of right and left eigenvectors that characterize the relaxation dynamics towards the steady state and the steady currents, it is useful to analyze the properties of the Singular Value Decompositions of the two rectangular matrices ${\bold I}$ and ${\bold J} $ of size $M \times N$ and the interpretations in terms of discrete Helmholtz decompositions. This general framework concerning Markov jump processes can be adapted to non-equilibrium diffusion processes governed by Fokker-Planck equations in dimension $d$, where the number $N$ of configurations, the number $M$ of links and the number $C=M-(N-1)$ of independent cycles become infinite, while the two matrices ${\bold I}$ and ${\bold J}$ become first-order differential operators acting on scalar functions to produce vector fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of universality class has emerged from our understanding of critical phenomena widely observed in nature and has guided the recent development of physics. Accordingly, identifying a rich variety of universality class is a major issue in modern physics. Here, we report that a daily phenomenon, similar to a drop falling from a faucet, possesses a strikingly close analogy with critical phenomena, with this version remarkably revealing the existence of an uncountably infinite number of universality classes. The key for our present findings is the confinement of a system into a thin cell, in which we observe the dynamics of air-liquid interface formed by entrained air into viscous liquid by a solid disk, to find critical exponents that define a universality class depend on continuous numbers characterizing the confinement.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian theory of market impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08867v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The available liquidity at any time in financial markets falls largely short of the typical size of the orders that institutional investors would trade. In order to reduce the impact on prices due to the execution of large orders, traders in financial markets split large orders into a series of smaller ones, which are executed sequentially. The resulting sequence of trades is called a meta-order. Empirical studies have revealed a non-trivial set of statistical laws on how meta-orders affect prices, which include i) the square-root behaviour of the expected price variation with the total volume traded, ii) its crossover to a linear regime for small volumes, and iii) a reversion of average prices towards its initial value, after the sequence of trades is over. Here we recover this phenomenology within a minimal theoretical framework where the market sets prices by incorporating all information on the direction and speed of trade of the meta-order in a Bayesian manner. The simplicity of this derivation lends further support to the robustness and universality of market impact laws. In particular, it suggests that the square-root impact law originates from the over-estimation of order flows originating from meta-orders.</description>

      <title>Intertwining the Busemann process of the directed polymer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Busemann process of the planar directed polymer model with i.i.d. weights on the vertices of the planar square lattice, both the general case and the solvable inverse-gamma case. We demonstrate that the Busemann process intertwines with an evolution obeying a version of the geometric Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence. In the inverse-gamma case this relationship enables an explicit description of the distribution of the Busemann process: the Busemann function on a nearest-neighbor edge has independent increments in the direction variable, and its distribution comes from an inhomogeneous planar Poisson process. Various corollaries follow, including that each Busemann function has the same countably infinite dense set of discontinuities in the direction variable. This contrasts with the known zero-temperature last-passage percolation cases, where the analogous sets are nowhere dense but have a dense union. The distribution of the asymptotic competition interface direction of the inverse-gamma polymer is discrete and supported on the Busemann discontinuities. Further implications follow for the eternal solutions and the failure of the one force--one solution principle for the discrete stochastic heat equation solved by the polymer partition function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon the findings presented in the first three papers of this series, we formulate an effective field theory for interacting collective states. These states consist of a large number of interconnected neurons and are distinguished by their intrinsic activity. The field theory encompasses an infinite set of fields, each of which characterizes the dynamics of a specific type of collective state. Interaction terms within the theory drive transitions between various collective states, allowing us to describe processes such as activation, association, and deactivation of these states.</description>

      <title>Detection of diffusion anisotropy from an individual short particle trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In parallel with advances in microscale imaging techniques, the fields of biology and materials science have focused on precisely extracting particle properties based on their diffusion behavior. Although the majority of real-world particles exhibit anisotropy, their behavior has been studied less than that of isotropic particles. In this study, we introduce a new method for estimating the diffusion coefficients of individual anisotropic particles using short-trajectory data on the basis of a maximum likelihood framework. Traditional estimation techniques often use mean-squared displacement (MSD) values or other statistical measures that inherently remove angular information. Instead, we treated the angle as a latent variable and used belief propagation to estimate it while maximizing the likelihood using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Compared to conventional methods, this approach facilitates better estimation of shorter trajectories and faster rotations, as confirmed by numerical simulations and experimental data involving bacteria and quantum rods. Additionally, we performed an analytical investigation of the limits of detectability of anisotropy and provided guidelines for the experimental design. In addition to serving as a powerful tool for analyzing complex systems, the proposed method will pave the way for applying maximum likelihood methods to more complex diffusion phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an open interacting particle system on a finite lattice. The particles perform asymmetric simple exclusion and are randomly created or destroyed at all sites, with rates that grow rapidly near the boundaries. We study the hydrodynamic limit for the particle density at the hyperbolic space-time scale and obtain the entropy solution to a boundary-driven quasilinear conservation law with a relaxation term. Different from the usual boundary conditions introduced in [Bardos, Roux, and Nedelec, (1979), Comm. Part. Diff. Equ], discontinuity (boundary layer) does not formulate at the boundaries due to the strong relaxation scheme.</description>

      <title>A Novel Class of Phase Space Representations for the Exact Population Dynamics of Two-State Quantum Systems and the Relation to Triangle Window Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use the constraint phase space developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501, non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit proposed as a heuristic empirical model in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>

      <title>Random close packing of binary hard spheres predicts the stability of atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spite of the empirical success of the Weizsaecker mass formula, a predictive, physics-based, analytical estimate of the stability chart of nuclei has remained elusive. We show that a recent analytical progress in the mathematical description of random close packing of spheres with different sizes provides an excellent description of the $Z$ versus $N$ slope in the nuclides chart. In particular, the theory is able to predict the most quoted ratio $Z/N\approx 0.75$ for stable nuclides, in agreement with experimental observations without any fitting parameter. This provides a solution to a longstanding mystery in nuclear physics: until now, the stability of atomic nuclei was empirically described by the Bethe-Weizsaecker mass formula, which, only thanks to 4-5 adjustable fitting parameters, can capture the tendency of large nuclei to be rich in neutrons. The latter phenomenon was traditionally (qualitatively) explained in terms of a subtle balance between electrostatics and asymmetry effects due to the Pauli exclusion principle. We show that the larger stability of neutron-rich nuclei is the result of a maximized nuclear density, which is controlled by geometric packing considerations.</description>
