      <title>Top-Quark Pair Production in Heavy-Ion Collisions in the ATLAS Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Top-quark pair production in heavy-ion collisions provides a unique opportunity to probe nuclear parton distribution functions and study the time evolution of strongly interacting matter, including the quark-gluon plasma. This work presents the observation and measurement of top-quark pair production in both proton--lead (p+Pb) and lead--lead (Pb+Pb) collisions using the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In p+Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8.16 TeV, top-quark pair production is observed in the lepton+jets and dilepton channels, with significances exceeding 5 standard deviations in each channel. The nuclear modification factor, $R_{p\mathrm{A}}$, is measured for the first time in this process, providing new insights into nuclear parton distribution functions. In Pb+Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV, top-quark pair production is studied in the ($e\mu$) final state, using datasets recorded in 2015 and 2018 with an integrated luminosity of 1.9 nb$^{-1}$. The measurement achieves a significance of 5.0 standard deviations and is compared to theoretical predictions based on various nuclear PDF sets. These measurements establish top-quark pairs as valuable tools for investigating heavy-ion collisions, offering novel insights into the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma and nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking neutrino-nucleus quasielastic scattering model predictions against a missing energy profile obtained using a monoenergetic neutrino beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14831v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine three exclusive nuclear ground state shell models implemented in the NEUT neutrino event generator and benchmark them against the recent JSNS$^2$ measurement of missing energy using a monoenergetic neutrino source. The nature of the measurement allows a detailed investigation of nuclear ground-state modeling using a neutrino source, and gives access to a direct measurement of the neutron spectral function in a $^{12}$C nucleus. The NEUT intranuclear cascade and nuclear deexcitation \textsc{NucDeEx} are used to simulate inelastic final-state interactions and nuclear deexcitations respectively. We find that the spectral function (SF) models perform better than relativistic mean field models in modeling both the ground state and the tail of the missing energy distribution when the NEUT cascade and nuclear excitation channels are turned on. We also find that taking into account the missing energy threshold for single nucleon knockout interactions results in all nuclear models being accepted based on the obtained $p$-values.</description>

      <title>A Review of Hyperon Physics at BESIII Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration has collected large data samples from $e^+e^-$ collisions at center-of-mass energies ranging from 1.84 to 4.95 GeV, which include the world's largest charmonium sample, consisting of 10 billion $J/\psi$ and 3 billion $\psi(3686)$ events. These high-statistics datasets enable BESIII to carry out a wide range of studies in hyperon physics. In this article, we review the major achievements of the BESIII Collaboration in this field, which can be broadly categorized into four areas: hyperon polarization and $CP$ violation, rare hyperon decays, hyperon pair production, and hyperon-nucleon interactions.</description>

      <title>DAMSA Experiment Conceptual Design White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DAMSA (DArk Messenger Searches at an Accelerator) is a novel short-baseline accelerator experiment aimed at probing short-lived physics processes, including searches for evidence of a dark sector of particle physics and well-motivated Standard Model signals. Motivated by open questions in neutrino physics and the absence of conclusive evidence for conventional weakly interacting massive particles, DAMSA targets MeV-to-sub-GeV dark-sector messengers with feeble couplings that can be produced in abundance at the PIP-II LINAC. By employing an ultra-short baseline of order one meter, DAMSA is uniquely positioned to overcome the beam-dump "ceiling" that limits sensitivity to promptly decaying particles in longer-baseline experiments. The conceptual design emphasizes a beam-dump production scheme combined with a compact detector optimized for rare decays while mitigating intense neutron-induced backgrounds inherent to high-power proton beams. To validate the experimental strategy and detector technologies, the Little DAMSA Path-Finder (LDPF) proof-of-concept experiment is proposed, focusing on axion-like particles decaying to two photons and operating with 300 MeV electron beams at FAST. Successful realization of LDPF will establish the feasibility of the DAMSA approach, enabling a broad and powerful program to explore short-lived new physics and precision Standard Model processes in a previously inaccessible regime. This conceptual design document outlines the technical details of DAMSA's physics goals, the beam facility proposals, key experimental challenges and how to overcome them, and the proposed experimental staging campaigns.</description>

      <title>Prospects for discovering strongly decaying doubly heavy $T_{bc}$ tetraquark states at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the discovery potential of the $T_{bc}$ states with $J^P = 0^+$ in proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at LHCb at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13~\mathrm{TeV}$. The study focuses on the decay channel $T_{bc} \to B^- D^+$. A phenomenological approach is employed to construct the background model based on the associated production of $B$ and $D$ mesons, incorporating previously published LHCb results. Background processes are simulated using $\texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}$ and $\texttt{Pythia8.3}$. We explore the parameter space of the $T_{bc}$ mass, width, production cross section, and the effective double-parton-scattering cross section ($\sigma_{\mathrm{eff}}$) relevant for the $B D$ meson background. The integrated luminosity required for a $5\sigma$ discovery at LHCb is evaluated under various assumptions. We find that a $5\sigma$ observation is achievable for a production cross section of $103~\mathrm{nb}$, which is expected to be within reach during Run~4. In addition, we estimate the minimum observable $\sigma(T_{bc}) \times \mathrm{BR}(T_{bc} \to B^- D^+)$ for a $5\sigma$ discovery under different luminosity scenarios, providing guidance for future experimental searches at LHCb.</description>

      <title>Emergent Large Lepton Mixing from Neutrino Refraction in Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel origin for the disparity between quark and lepton flavor mixing based on the refractive nature of neutrino masses. We postulate that the fundamental mixing in both the quark and lepton sectors is CKM-like, together with tiny vacuum neutrino masses, while the observed PMNS mixing matrix emerges dynamically from coherent forward scattering of neutrinos on an ultralight dark matter background. The resulting in-medium Hamiltonian rotates CKM mixing angles into large effective lepton mixings, naturally realizing quark--lepton complementarity without invoking new flavor symmetries. This framework links neutrino mass generation, flavor mixing, and dark matter, and predicts environment-dependent neutrino oscillation effects testable in current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Differentiable quantum-trajectory simulation of Lindblad dynamics for QGP transport-coefficient inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study parameter estimation for the transport coefficients of the quark-gluon plasma by differentiating open-quantum-system-based Monte Carlo simulations of quarkonium suppression. The underlying simulator requires solving a Lindblad equation in a large Hilbert space, which makes parameter estimation computationally expensive. We approach the problem using gradient-based optimization. Specifically, we apply the score-function gradient estimator to differentiate through discrete jump sampling in the Monte Carlo wave-function algorithm used to solve the Lindblad equation. The resulting stochastic gradient estimator exhibits sufficiently low variance and can still be estimated in an embarrassingly parallel manner, enabling efficient scaling of the simulations. We implement this gradient estimator in the existing open-source quarkonium suppression code QTraj. To demonstrate its utility for parameter estimation, we infer the two transport coefficients $\hat{\kappa}$ and $\hat{\gamma}$ using gradient-based optimization on synthetic nuclear modification factor data.</description>

      <title>Weak boson probes of Higgs unitarity restoration at 10 TeV parton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higgs coupling deviations, at levels accessible to the high-luminosity LHC, can imply a phenomenological no-lose theorem for the next generation of collider facilities. Correlating Higgs coupling deviations from the SM expectation in the gauge boson sector with high-scale unitarity requirements, we estimate and compare the sensitivity that can be expected at a future hadron collider (operating at 100 TeV centre-of-mass energy) and a 10 TeV muon collider. Both muon and hadron colliders offer discovery potential for mass scales up to ${\cal{O}}(6~\text{TeV})$ where unitarity violation induced by (sub)percent Higgs coupling modifications is mended. We comment on how an intermediate precision FCC-ee programme can corroborate such deviations.</description>

      <title>A SiPM-Based RICH Detector with Timing Capabilities for Isotope Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel compact particle identification (PID) detector concept based on Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) optimized to perform combined Ring-Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) and Time-of-Flight (TOF) measurements using a common photodetector layer. The system consists of a Cherenkov radiator layer separated from a photosensitive surface equipped with SiPMs by an expansion gap. A thin glass slab, acting as a second Cherenkov radiator, is coupled to the SiPMs to perform Cherenkov-based charged particle timing measurements. We assembled a small-scale prototype instrumented with various Hamamatsu SiPM array sensors with pixel pitches ranging from 2 to 3 mm and coupled with 1 mm thick fused silica window. The RICH radiator consisted of a 2 cm thick aerogel tile with a refractive index of 1.03 at 400 nm. The prototype was successfully tested in beam test campaigns at the CERN PS T10 beam line with pions and protons. We measured a single-hit angular resolution of about 4 mrad at the Cherenkov angle saturation value and a time resolution better than 50 ps RMS for charged particles with Z = 1. The present technology makes the proposed SiPM-based PID system particularly attractive for space applications due to the limited detector volumes available. In this work, we present beam test results obtained with the detector prototype and we discuss possible configurations optimized for the identification of ions in space applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient and precise Cherenkov-based charged particle timing using SiPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dedicated R&amp;D efforts are currently underway to couple a thin Cherenkov radiator to Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays for precise charged particle Time-of-Flight (ToF) measurements. The prompt nature of Cherenkov radiation makes it an ideal candidate for achieving ultimate timing performance in a ToF detector. Using a thin radiator with a high refractive index, such as fused silica, enables the generation of a fast signal from charged particles that exceed the Cherenkov threshold. A crucial requirement for approaching the target time resolution is the optimization of both the radiator material and thickness, as well as the optical coupling to the SiPM arrays. In this work, we present the main factors that affect the time resolution and the expected performance achieved through a detailed Monte Carlo simulation and the comparison with beam test results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Timepix2 Lite, a compact readout interface for the Timepix2 hybrid pixel detector, designed to provide high spatial and temporal resolution in a wide range of radiation detection applications. The Timepix2 Lite enables simultaneous energy and precise timing measurements on the nanosecond scale and supports advanced real-time data acquisition and visualization through the TrackLab software framework. Its compact and flexible architecture, enabled by the miniaturized design, allows seamless integration into diverse experimental setups, including nuclear spectroscopy, stratospheric balloon missions, and nanosecond-scale half-life measurements. As a case study, the half-life of the second excited state in 237Np was determined to be 67.5(7) ns for the 59.5 keV transition, consistent with previously reported results.</description>

      <title>Testing the three massive neutrino paradigm: Constraints on Neutrino Properties and Interactions from Recent Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino physics offers unique insights into phenomena beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This thesis presents phenomenological investigations organized around three pillars: consolidation of the three-flavor oscillation paradigm, exploration of new physics viability, and precise determination of solar neutrino fluxes.
  The theoretical framework introduces massive neutrinos, leptonic mixing, and flavor transitions, followed by experimental results emphasizing Borexino and NOvA data analyses.
  The first pillar establishes the three-flavor framework through global analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator data, providing updated determinations of mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$) and mass-squared differences ($\Delta m^2_{21}$, $\Delta m^2_{31}$), while quantifying ambiguities in mass ordering and $\theta_{23}$ octant.
  The second pillar investigates Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) with electrons and quarks, combining Borexino data with COHERENT's CE$\nu$NS measurements to establish bounds on propagation and detection couplings, excluding viable NSI parameter regions including potential LMA-D solutions.
  The third pillar advances solar neutrino physics through precision flux determinations, integrating pp-chain and CNO-cycle measurements. Results show preference for high-metallicity Standard Solar Models and incompatibility between $3+1$ mixing parameters favored by Gallium experiments and solar observations.
  This synthesis guides future experiments toward resolving mass ordering, CP violation, and dark sector interactions.</description>

      <title>Probing Late-Stage Hadronic Interactions at High Baryon Density via $K^{*0}$ Production in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precision measurement of the $K^{*0}$ meson yield is reported in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7,\; 11.5,\; 14.6,\; 19.6,$ and $27~\mathrm{GeV}$ using the high-statistics data sample collected by the STAR experiment during the Beam Energy Scan II (BES-II) program at RHIC. The transeverse momentum ($p_{T}$)-integrated yield ratios $(K^{*0} + \overline{K^{*0}})/(K^{+} + K^{-})$ in central collisions show a suppression relative to peripheral collisions at the $(1.7\text{-}3.6)\,\sigma$ level, while a thermal model without final-stage rescattering overpredicts this ratio with a deviation of $(6.9\text{-}8.2)\,\sigma$. These results indicate a loss of the measured $K^{*0}$ signal in central collisions due to re-scattering of its hadronic decay products in the hadronic phase. The $p_{T}$-integrated yield of charged kaons exhibits an approximate scaling with charged-particle multiplicity, independent of collision energy and system size. A similar trend is observed for the short-lived $K^{*0}$ resonance, although significant deviations emerge at lower energies. At BES energies, the $K^{*0}/K$ ratio shows stronger suppression than at the highest RHIC and LHC energies within a given multiplicity bin, particularly in central and mid-central collisions. This behavior is consistent with changes in the effective hadronic interaction cross section and is supported by transport model calculations, which indicate dominant meson-baryon interactions at lower energies and meson-meson interactions at higher energies.</description>

Abstract: In light of recent precision measurements from BESIII, we reanalyze the $D, D_s \to \eta^{(\prime)}$ transition form factors using QCD light-cone sum rules, incorporating high-twist contributions and well-established next-to-leading-order QCD corrections. Our analysis confirms the chiral enhancement effect arising from twist-3 light-cone distribution amplitudes of the pseudoscalar mesons, and demonstrates a rapid convergence of the operator product expansion. The resulting high-accuracy form factors enable us to determine the optimal $\eta$-$\eta^\prime$ mixing parameters from the precise experimental data for the $D, D_s \to \eta^{(\prime)} \ell^+ \nu_\ell$ (with $\ell = e, \mu$) differential decay rates. We find that the BESIII data strongly favor a set of mixing parameters, characterized by small decay constants and a large mixing angle, in the quark flavor basis. Notably, the light-cone-sum-rule predictions for the decays $D \to \eta^{(\prime)} \ell^+ \nu_\ell$, induced by weak $c\to d$ current, reach a precision comparable to the BESIII experimental results. Nevertheless, further refined measurements and more accurate form-factor determinations will be essential to scrutinize the potential role of gluonic components in charmed meson semileptonic decays.</description>

      <title>$H$ dibaryon and its cousins from SU(6)-constrained baryon-baryon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain the $S$-wave baryon-baryon interaction using SU(6) symmetry within a nonrelativistic effective field theory. The most general leading-order Lagrangian contains two independent parameters, which we determine using physical $NN$ and lattice QCD $\Omega\Omega$ scattering lengths. This framework allows for parameter-free predictions in the strangeness $S=-2$ sector relevant to the $H$ dibaryon. Solving the coupled-channel scattering problem, we identify two bound states below the $\Lambda\Lambda$ threshold, one deeply bound and one shallow, along with resonances near the $\Sigma\Sigma$ and $\Sigma^*\Sigma^*$ thresholds. We demonstrate that these poles result in distinct enhancements in $\Lambda\Lambda$ invariant mass distributions, suggesting that the $H$ dibaryon exists as a multichannel bound state and providing clear signatures for experimental verification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents experimental and simulation data to characterize the Ring Oscillators (RO) produced in 65-nm CMOS technology for the next promising generation of readout chips for the pixel detector in the Inner Tracker (ITk) at the ATLAS experiment at CERN. To enable a better understanding of the RO block embedded in ITkPixV1.1 single chip card (SCC), tests at various temperatures, voltages, accumulated total ionizing dose (TID) with X-ray irradiation, and high-temperature annealing will be presented. The objective of this study is to examine the RO output dependency based on different variable conditions and provide simulation data using Cadence, an electronic design automation (EDA) software to validate the experimental outcomes.</description>

      <title>Top quark FCNC in Randall-Sundrum models: post-LHC allowed rates and searches at $e^+e^-$ and $\mu^+ \mu^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the sensitivity to Flavor Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC) in interactions involving the top quark at future $e^+e^-$ and $\mu^+\mu^-$ machines. We consider the $Ztc$ vertex as well as four-fermion contact interactions involving top and charm quarks. To incorporate limits from (HL-)LHC we consider FCNC from Randall-Sundrum models and we recast LHC searches for the resonances that at the microscopic level give rise to the FCNC effects. We determine the maximal strength of the effective FCNC couplings $Ztc$ coupling allowed by LHC. We find that the LHC currently improves on the limit set by previous machines, e.g. LEP indirect sensitivity to heavy vectors. Future improvements of direct searches at HL-LHC may reach a level equivalent to $BR(t\to c Z)\simeq 10^{-6}$. We explore the possibility to probe even smaller FCNC coupling strength using an $e^+e^-$ machine at center-of-mass energy suitable for a Higgs factory $E_{cm}\in$ [200,240] GeV or to probe contact interactions involving top and charm flavors at a high-energy muon collider at $E_{cm}=10$ TeV.</description>

      <title>One- and three-dimensional identical charged-kaon femtoscopic correlations in Pb--Pb collisions at $\mathbf{ \sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02}$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identical charged-kaon correlations induced by quantum-statistics effects and final-state interactions are measured in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. The results of one- (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) analyses show that the obtained system-size parameters (radii) are smaller for more peripheral collisions and decrease with increasing pair transverse momentum $k_{\rm T}$. The 1D parameters agree within uncertainties with those obtained in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76$ TeV. The observed power-law dependence of the extracted 3D radii as a function of the pair transverse momentum is a signature of the collective flow in the particle-emitting system created in Pb$-$Pb collisions. This dependence is well reproduced by the integrated hydrokinetic model calculations except for the outward projection of the radius (measured in the longitudinally co-moving system) for the most central collisions. The time of maximal emission for kaons is extracted from the 3D analysis in a wide collision centrality range from 0 to 90%. Its reduction with decreasing charged-particle multiplicity is well reproduced by the hydrokinetic model predictions, and means that kaons are emitted earlier in more peripheral events.</description>

      <title>Space-time evolution of particle emission in p$-$Pb collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=~5.02}$ TeV with 3D kaon femtoscopy</title>

Abstract: The measurement of three-dimensional femtoscopic correlations between identical charged kaons (K$^\pm$K$^\pm$) produced in p$-$Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s{_{\rm NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with ALICE at the LHC is presented for the first time. This measurement, supplementary to those in pp and Pb$-$Pb collisions, allows understanding the particle-production mechanisms at different charged-particle multiplicities and provides information on the dynamics of the source of particles created in p$-$Pb collisions, for which a general consensus does not yet exist. It is shown that the measured source sizes increase with charged-particle multiplicity and decrease with increasing pair transverse momentum. These trends for K$^\pm$K$^\pm$ are similar to the ones observed earlier in identical charged-pion and K$_{\rm s}^{0}$K$_{\rm s}^{0}$ correlations in Pb$-$Pb collisions at various energies and in $\pi^\pm \pi^\pm$ correlations in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s{_{\rm NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV. At comparable multiplicity, the source sizes measured in p$-$Pb collisions agree within uncertainties with those observed in pp collisions, and there is an indication that they are smaller than those observed in Pb$-$Pb collisions. The obtained results are also compared with predictions from the hadronic interaction model EPOS~3, which tends to underestimate the source size for the most central collisions and agrees with the data for semicentral and peripheral events. Furthermore, the time of maximal emission for kaons is extracted. It turns out to be comparable with the value obtained in highly peripheral Pb$-$Pb collisions at the same energy, indicating that the kaon emission evolution is similar to that in p$-$Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Search potential for direct slepton pair production at the CEPC with $\sqrt{s}$ = 360 GeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03600v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) is designed to operate at the key center-of-mass energies: 91.2 GeV as a Z factory for precision Z boson studies,$\approx$ 160 GeV at the threshold for W boson pair production, and 240 GeV as a Higgs factory for copious Higgs boson production. It can be upgraded to 360 GeV (CEPC-360GeV) for enabling top quark-antiquark ($t\bar{t}$) pair production. Beyond enabling high-precision measurements of the Standard Model (SM), CEPC-360GeV is uniquely position to perform searches for new physics beyond the SM (BSM) physics, serving as a valuable complement to hadron colliders. This paper presents a sensitivity study on the direct pair production of staus and smuons at the CEPC with $\sqrt{s}$ = 360 GeV, conducted via full Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. Under the assumptions of integrated luminosity 1.0 ab^{-1} and a flat 5% systematic uncertainty, CEPC-360GeV could potentially discover the combined production of left-handed and right-handed staus up to a mass of 170 GeV (if they exist), or up to 169 GeV for pure left-handed staus and 162 GeV for pure right-handed staus. For direct smuon production, the discovery potential reaches up to 178 GeV under the same conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the electromagnetic characteristics of unconventional states may offer new insights into their internal structures. In particular, the magnetic moment attributes may serve as a crucial physical observable for differentiating exotic states with disparate configurations or spin-parity quantum numbers. As a promising avenue for research, encompassing both opportunities and challenges, an in-depth examination of the electromagnetic properties of exotic states is crucial for advancing our understanding of unconventional states. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of $ \rm{I(J^{P})} = 1(1^{+})$ $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states are analyzed in the framework of QCD light-cone sum rules by considering the diquark-antidiquark approximation, designated as type $3_c \otimes \bar 3_c$. Although the tetraquark states examined in this study have nearly identical masses, their magnetic moment results exhibit noticeable discrepancies. This may facilitate the differentiation between quantum numbers associated with states with identical quark content. The results show that heavy quarks overcoming light quarks can determine both the sign and the magnitude of the magnetic moments of these tetraquark states. The numerical results obtained in this study suggest that the magnetic moments of $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may reveal aspects of their underlying structure, which could distinguish between their spin-parity quantum numbers and their internal structure. The results obtained regarding the magnetic moments of the $Z_{\bar b c}$ tetraquark states may be checked within the context of different phenomenological approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searches for new particles often span a wide range of mass scales, where the shape of potential signals and the SM background varies significantly. We make use of a multivariate method that fully exploits the correlation between signal and background features and the explored mass scale, and is trained on a sample that is balanced across the entire mass range. The classifiers, either a neural network or a boosted decision tree, produce a continuous output across the full mass range and, at a given mass, achieve nearly the same performance as a classifier specifically trained for that mass. The performance of the classifiers is better than the one obtained with parameterised neural networks and similar methods.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Renormalization-Group Evolution for the Nucleon Distribution Amplitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine for the first time the two-loop renormalization-group (RG) equation for the nucleon light-cone distribution amplitude, which constitutes the last missing ingredient for the complete next-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to the nucleon form factors in the hard-collinear factorization framework. Applying the conformal expansion for this fundamental nucleon distribution amplitude then enables us to construct an analytic solution that captures the desired scale dependence of phenomenologically interesting series coefficients. Importantly, the two-loop RG evolutions of these central hadronic quantities can bring about noticeable impacts on the corresponding leading-logarithmic results for three sample models of the nucleon distribution amplitude.</description>

      <title>jBOT: Semantic Jet Representation Clustering Emerges from Self-Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning is a powerful pre-training method for learning feature representations without labels, which often capture generic underlying semantics from the data and can later be fine-tuned for downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce jBOT, a pre-training method based on self-distillation for jet data from the CERN Large Hadron Collider, which combines local particle-level distillation with global jet-level distillation to learn jet representations that support downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and classification. We observe that pre-training on unlabeled jets leads to emergent semantic class clustering in the representation space. The clustering in the frozen embedding, when pre-trained on background jets only, enables anomaly detection via simple distance-based metrics, and the learned embedding can be fine-tuned for classification with improved performance compared to supervised models trained from scratch.</description>
