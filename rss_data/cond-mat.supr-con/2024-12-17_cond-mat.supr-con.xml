      <title>Pressure induced superconducting dome in LaNiGa2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LaNiGa2 is a time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductor with symmetry protected band crossings, making it an ideal platform for investigating the interplay between unconventional superconductivity and electronic structure topology. Here we present a transport study of LaNiGa2 under pressure. The application of pressure to LaNiGa2 induces a significant enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature Tc at a pressure of 7 GPa. In contrast, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show no evidence of structural phase transitions up to 26.3 GPa. Moreover, the ratio of band diffusivity shows a sudden increase at around 7 GPa, suggesting possible pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure that are closely linked to the evolution of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Coherent and Incoherent Effects in Superconductor Photoemission Spectra via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disentangling coherent and incoherent effects in the photoemission spectra of strongly correlated materials is generally a challenging problem due to the involvement of numerous parameters. In this study, we employ machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to address the long-standing issue of the bilayer splitting in superconducting cuprates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CNN training on modeled spectra and confirm earlier findings that establish the presence of bilayer splitting across the entire doping range. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of the splitting does not decrease with underdoping, contrary to expectations. This approach not only highlights the potential of machine learning in tackling complex physical problems but also provides a robust framework for advancing the analysis of electronic properties in correlated superconductors.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of the superconducting pairing symmetry in a bilayer two-orbital model of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superconducting pairing symmetry in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ based on a bilayer two-orbital model. There are two symmetric bands $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, as well as two antisymmetric ones $\beta$ and $\delta$. It is found that the $\gamma$ band induces considerable ferromagnetic spin fluctuation and prefers an odd-frequency, $s$-wave spin triplet pairing state. The addition of the other bands gradually suppresses the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation and enhances the antiferromagnetic ones. The superconducting pairing then evolves from a spin triplet into a $d$-wave spin singlet, and finally into an $s_\pm$-wave one. The competition between the $d$-wave and $s_\pm$-wave pairings relies on whether the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation is suppressed completely or not.</description>

      <title>Transmission of radio-frequency waves and nuclear magnetic resonance in lanthanum superhydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of near-room temperature superconductivity in the lanthanum hydride LaH$_{10}$ has revolutionized this field of research. Until recently, the need to use diamond anvils for the synthesis of polyhydrides severely limited the list of experimental techniques that could be used to study these materials. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is one of the key methods for probing spin systems of superconductors. In this work, we show how 1H NMR measurements can be realized in diamond anvil cells to study high-temperature superconductivity in lanthanum polyhydrides at pressures up to 165 GPa. We observed a pronounced suppression of the 1H NMR signal intensity below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 260 K in a magnetic field of 7 T, corresponding to the screening of the radio-frequency pulses by the newly discovered superhydride LaH$_{12}$.Below the critical temperature of superconductivity, all 1H NMR characteristics, including the spin-lattice relaxation rate $\textit{1/T$_{1}$T}$, demonstrate pronounced features, indicating a superconducting transition in the sample. In the absence of an applied magnetic field, the radio-frequency signal transmission through the LaH$_{12}$ sample shows a pronounced drop below $\textit{T$_{c}$(onset)}$ = 267 K, confirming the superconducting nature of the transition. Fitting the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation data allows the estimation of the superconducting gap $\textit{${\Delta}$(0)}$ between 427 and 671 K (corresponding to 36.8 to 57.8 meV), and the ratio $\textit{R$_{\Delta}$ = 2${\Delta}$(0)/k$_B$T$_c$}$ between 3.76 and 5.16 in the synthesized hydride sample.</description>

      <title>Realizing Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing assisted topological Majorana zero modes and superconducting diode effect in helical Shiba chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BDG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture diposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which supports topological MZMs at the end of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to a superconducting diode effect in Shiba chain where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the asymmetric FFLO state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Optical and transport properties of Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The broad-band optical spectroscopy was used to study the optical and the hidden transport properties of the Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ superconducting films with different Ni contents. The normal state data were analyzed using a Drude-Lorentz model with two Drude components: narrow and broad ones. In the superconducting state, two gaps with $2\Delta _{0}^{(1)}/k_{B}T_{c}=1.57$ and $2\Delta _{0}^{(2)}/k_{B}T_{c}=3.48$ are formed for the Ba(Fe$_{0.965}$Ni$_{0.035}$)$_2$As$_2$ films, while for the Ba(Fe$_{0.95}$Ni$_{0.05}$)$_2$As$_2$ films these characteristic ratios are 1.88--2.08 and 3.66--4.13. Both gaps are formed from the narrow Drude component, whereas the broad Drude component remains ungapped. The calculated from infrared data total dc resistivity of the films with Ni contents $x=0.05$ and $x=0.08$ as well as the low-temperature scattering rate for the narrow Drude component show a hidden Fermi-liquid behavior. On the contrary, the films with $x=0.035$ manifest a hidden non-Fermi-liquid behavior. The Allen theory generalized to a multiband systems was applied to the analysis of the temperature dependences of a resistivity of the Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ films. The change of total electron-boson coupling and representative energy in the normal state versus the superconducting state for this system was shown to be typical of other iron-based superconducting materials as well as high-temperature superconducting cuprates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits incorporating Josephson elements represent a promising hardware platform for quantum technologies. Potential applications include scalable quantum computing, microwave quantum networks, and quantum-limited amplifiers. However, progress in Josephson junction-based quantum technologies is facing the ongoing challenge of minimizing loss channels. This is also true for parametric superconducting devices based on nonlinear Josephson resonators. In this work, we report on the fabrication and characterization of low-loss Josephson parametric devices operated in the GHz frequency range, showing record internal quality factors. Specifically, we achieve internal quality factors significantly above $10^5$ for both Josephson parametric converters and the Josephson parametric amplifiers at low microwave power ranging in the single-photon regime. These low-loss devices mark a significant step forward in realizing high-performance quantum circuits, enabling further advancements in superconducting quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a fully $ \textit{ab initio} $ approach to predicting thermal attenuation in elastic helium atom scattering amplitudes, validated through strong agreement with experiments on Nb(100) and (3$\times$1)-O/Nb(100) surfaces. Our results reveal the relative contributions from bulk, resonant, and surface phonon modes, as well as from different surface mode polarizations, providing insights into differences between smooth and corrugated surfaces. These findings advance understanding of surface dynamics and electron-phonon coupling, laying groundwork for future studies on surface superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Conveyor-belt superconducting quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The processing unit of a solid-state quantum computer consists in an array of coupled qubits, each locally driven with on-chip microwave lines that route carefully-engineered control signals to the qubits in order to perform logical operations. This approach to quantum computing comes with two major problems. On the one hand, it greatly hampers scalability towards fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are estimated to need a number of qubits -- and, therefore driving lines -- on the order of $10^6$. On the other hand, these lines are a source of electromagnetic noise, exacerbating frequency crowding and crosstalk, while also contributing to power dissipation inside the dilution fridge. We here tackle these two overwhelming challenges by presenting a novel quantum processing unit (QPU) for a universal quantum computer which is globally (rather than locally) driven. Our QPU relies on a string of superconducting qubits with always-on ZZ interactions, enclosed into a closed geometry, which we dub ``conveyor belt''. Strikingly, this architecture requires only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ physical qubits to run a computation on $N$ computational qubits, in contrast to previous $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ proposals for global quantum computation. Additionally, universality is achieved via the implementation of single-qubit gates and a one-shot Toffoli gate. The ability to perform multi-qubit operations in a single step could vastly improve the fidelity and execution time of many algorithms.</description>

      <title>d-Wave Magnetism in Cuprates from Oxygen Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The antiferromagnetic parent phase of high-T$_c$ cuprates has been established as a N\'eel state of copper moments, but early work pointed out the important role of ligand oxygen orbitals. Using the three-orbital Emery model we show how doping-induced antiferromagnetic ordering of weak magnetic moments on the oxygen sites can lead to unconventional d-wave magnetism with spin-split electronic bands. Our mechanism for forming such altermagnetic (AM) states in cuprates does not rely on a lowering of the crystal symmetry but rather on interaction-induced formation of magnetic moments on directional oxygen orbitals within the crystallographic unit cell. Therefore, we obtain two different types of AM, namely a (0,0)-AM and a ($\pi$,$\pi$)-AM, and identify different mechanisms for appearance supported by Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization calculations. We finally suggest a scenario to realize the unconventional spin-split bands in a candidate compound by density functional theory and discuss experimental implications.</description>

      <title>Efficient electronic cooling above 2 K by niobium-based superconducting tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Replacing the bulky cryoliquid-based cooling stages of cryoenabled instruments by chip-scale refrigeration is envisioned to disruptively reduce the system size similar to microprocessors did for computers. Electronic refrigerators based on superconducting tunnel junctions have been anticipated to provide a solution, but reaching the necessary above the 1-K operation temperature range has remained a goal out of reach for several decades. We show efficient electronic refrigeration by Al-AlO$_x$-Nb superconducting tunnel junctions starting from bath temperatures above 2 K. The junctions can deliver electronic cooling power up to approximately mW/mm$^2$, which enables us to demonstrate tunnel-current-driven electron temperature reduction from 2.4 K to below 1.6 K (34% relative cooling) against the phonon bath. Our work shows that the key material of integrated superconducting circuits - niobium - enables powerful cryogenic refrigerator technology. This result is a prerequisite for practical cryogenic chip-scale refrigerators and, at the same time, it introduces a new electrothermal tool for quantum heat-transport experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03538v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pair density waves (PDWs) are a inhomogeneous superconducting states whose Cooper pairs possess a finite momentum resulting in a oscillatory gap in space, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. There is growing evidence for the existence of PDW superconducting order in many strongly correlated materials, particularly in the cuprate superconductors and in several other different types of systems.
  A feature of the PDW state is that inherently it has a CDW as a composite order associated with it. Here we study the structure of the electronic topological defects of the PDW, paying special attention to the half-vortex and its electronic structure that can be detected in STM experiments. We discuss tell-tale signatures of the defects in violations of inversion symmetry, in the excitation spectrum and their spectral functions in the presence of topological defects. We discuss the ``Fermi surface'' topology of Bogoliubov quasiparticle of the PDW phases, and we briefly discuss the role of quasiparticle interference.</description>

      <title>Ruddlesden-Popper and perovskite phases as a material platform for altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subclass of collinear antiferromagnets where spin Kramers degeneracy is broken -- resulting in ferromagnetic-like properties -- offers exciting new opportunities in magnetism and hence motivates the reasoned expansion of the material base for these so-called altermagnets. Here, we show that Ruddlesden-Popper and perovskite phases are generic hosts for altermagnetic behavior. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate altermagnetism in prototypical nickel-based systems such as La$_2$NiO$_4$ and identify additional candidates, including the superconducting La$_3$Ni$_3$O$_7$ and the multiferroic BiFeO$_3$. These materials span insulating, semiconducting, and metallic conduction types, with computed nonrelativistic spin splittings reaching up to 250~meV. Our analysis also reveals the presence of accidental nodes and distinct topologies in the spin-momentum texture at the Brillouin-zone boundary, suggesting a refined classification for altermagnetic materials beyond the $d$-wave or higher even-parity wave classes. In addition, we address formal inconsistencies in the traditional classification of magnetically ordered systems, proposing resolutions grounded in the altermagnetic framework, and point out the potential for altermagnetic behavior in systems beyond collinear antiferromagnets with perfectly compensated magnetization, broadening the scope for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Globally driven superconducting quantum computing architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a platform for implementing a universal, globally driven quantum computer based on a 2D ladder hosting three different species of superconducting qubits. In stark contrast with the existing literature, our scheme exploits the always-on longitudinal ZZ coupling. The latter, combined with specific driving frequencies, enables the reach of a blockade regime, which plays a pivotal role in the computing scheme.</description>

      <title>From perfect to imperfect poor man's Majoranas in minimal Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poor man's Majoranas (PMMs) hold the promise to engineer Majorana bound states in a highly tunable setup consisting of a chain of quantum dots that are connected via superconductors. Due to recent progress in controlling the amplitudes of elastic cotunneling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR), two vital ingredients for PMMs, experimental investigations of PMMs have gained significant interest. Previously, analytic conditions for the "sweet spots" that result in PMMs have focused on systems with infinite Zeeman energy. Here, we derive analytically a sweet spot condition for PMMs in a system with finite Zeeman energy in the absence of Coulomb interaction. We then consider two numerical models, one in which ECT and CAR are transmitted via superconducting bulk states and one in which they are transmitted via an Andreev bound state. We demonstrate that the analytical sweet spot conditions can only be approximated in these more realistic models, but they cannot be satisfied exactly. As a consequence, we do not find perfect PMMs in these systems, but instead near-zero-energy states that are highly, but not perfectly, localized. These states can be considered as imperfect PMMs and their classification relies on threshold values, which adds some arbitrariness to the concept of PMMs.</description>

      <title>Topological chiral superconductivity beyond pairing in Fermi-liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism to produce superconductivity by strong purely repulsive interactions for flat dispersion $\varepsilon \sim k^4$, without using pairing instability in Fermi-liquid. The resulting superconductors break both time-reversal and reflection symmetries in the orbital motion of electrons, and exhibit non-trivial topological order. Our findings suggest that this topological chiral superconductivity is more likely to emerge near or between fully spin-valley polarized metallic phase and Wigner crystal phase. These topological chiral superconductors can be fully or partially spin-valley polarized. For partial spin-valley polarization, the ratios of electron densities associated with different spin-valley quantum numbers are quantized as simple rational numbers. Furthermore, many of these topological chiral superconductors exhibit charge-4 or higher condensation, neutral quasiparticles with fractional statistics, and/or gapless chiral edge states. Two of the topological chiral superconductors are in the same phases as the ``spin''-triplet or spinless $p+ \textrm{i} p$ BCS superconductor, while others are in different phases than any BCS superconductors. The same mechanism is also used to produce anyon superconductivity between fractional anomalous quantum Hall states in the presence of a periodic potential.</description>

      <title>Improving the accuracy of circuit quantization using the electromagnetic properties of superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum information processing with superconducting qubits have fueled a growing demand for scaling and miniaturizing circuit layouts. Despite significant progress, predicting the Hamiltonian of complex circuits remains a challenging task. Here, we propose an improved method for quantizing superconducting circuits that incorporates material- and geometry-dependent kinetic inductance. Our approach models superconducting films as reactive boundary elements, seamlessly integrating into the conventional circuit quantization framework without adding computational complexity. We experimentally validate our method using superconducting devices fabricated with 35 nm-thick disordered niobium films, demonstrating significantly improved accuracy in predicting the Hamiltonian based solely on the device layout and material properties of superconducting films and Josephson junctions. Specifically, conventional methods exhibit an average error of 5.4% in mode frequencies, while our method reduces it to 1.1%. Our method enables systematic studies of superconducting devices with disordered films or compact elements, facilitating precise engineering of superconducting circuits at scale.</description>
