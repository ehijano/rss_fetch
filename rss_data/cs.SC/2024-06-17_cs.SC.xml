      <title>The Liouville Generator for Producing Integrable Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a growing need to devise processes that can create comprehensive datasets in the world of Computer Algebra, both for accurate benchmarking and for new intersections with machine learning technology. We present here a method to generate integrands that are guaranteed to be integrable, dubbed the LIOUVILLE method. It is based on Liouville's theorem and the Parallel Risch Algorithm for symbolic integration.
  We show that this data generation method retains the best qualities of previous data generation methods, while overcoming some of the issues built into that prior work. The LIOUVILLE generator is able to generate sufficiently complex and realistic integrands, and could be used for benchmarking or machine learning training tasks related to symbolic integration.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic of D-Algebraic Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with the arithmetic of solutions to ordinary or partial nonlinear differential equations which are algebraic in the indeterminates and their derivatives. We call these solutions D-algebraic functions, and their equations are algebraic (ordinary or partial) differential equations (ADEs). The general purpose is to find ADEs whose solutions contain specified rational expressions of solutions to given ADEs. For univariate D-algebraic functions, we show how to derive an ADE of smallest possible order. In the multivariate case, we introduce a general algorithm for these computations and derive conclusions on the order bound of the resulting algebraic PDE. Using our accompanying Maple software, we discuss applications in physics, statistics, and symbolic integration.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Quotient Polynomials with Applications to Exact Divisibility and Divisibility Testing of Sparse Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for monic polynomials $f, g \in \mathbb{C}[x]$ such that $g$ divides $f$, the $\ell_2$-norm of the quotient polynomial $f/g$ is bounded by $\lVert f \rVert_1 \cdot \tilde{O}(\lVert{g}\rVert_0^3\text{deg}^2{ f})^{\lVert{g}\rVert_0 - 1}$. This improves upon the previously known exponential (in $\text{deg}{ f}$) bounds for general polynomials. Our results implies that the trivial long division algorithm runs in quasi-linear time relative to the input size and number of terms of the quotient polynomial $f/g$, thus solving a long-standing problem on exact divisibility of sparse polynomials.
  We also study the problem of bounding the number of terms of $f/g$ in some special cases. When $f, g \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $g$ is a cyclotomic-free (i.e., it has no cyclotomic factors) trinomial, we prove that $\lVert{f/g}\rVert_0 \leq O(\lVert{f}\rVert_0 \text{size}({f})^2 \cdot \log^6{\text{deg}{ g}})$. When $g$ is a binomial with $g(\pm 1) \neq 0$, we prove that the sparsity is at most $O(\lVert{f}\rVert_0 ( \log{\lVert{f}\rVert_0} + \log{\lVert{f}\rVert_{\infty}}))$. Both upper bounds are polynomial in the input-size. We leverage these results and give a polynomial time algorithm for deciding whether a cyclotomic-free trinomial divides a sparse polynomial over the integers.
  As our last result, we present a polynomial time algorithm for testing divisibility by pentanomials over small finite fields when $\text{deg}{ f} = \tilde{O}(\text{deg}{ g})$.</description>

      <title>On Rational Recursion for Holonomic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently conjectured that every component of a discrete-time rational dynamical system is a solution to an algebraic difference equation that is linear in its highest-shift term (a quasi-linear equation). We prove that the conjecture holds in the special case of holonomic sequences, which can straightforwardly be represented by rational dynamical systems. We propose two algorithms for converting holonomic recurrence equations into such quasi-linear equations. The two algorithms differ in their efficiency and the minimality of orders in their outputs.</description>

      <title>Jacobi Stability Analysis for Systems of ODEs Using Symbolic Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical theory of Kosambi-Cartan-Chern (KCC) developed in differential geometry provides a powerful method for analyzing the behaviors of dynamical systems. In the KCC theory, the properties of a dynamical system are described in terms of five geometrical invariants, of which the second corresponds to the so-called Jacobi stability of the system. Different from that of the Lyapunov stability that has been studied extensively in the literature, the analysis of the Jacobi stability has been investigated more recently using geometrical concepts and tools. It turns out that the existing work on the Jacobi stability analysis remains theoretical and the problem of algorithmic and symbolic treatment of Jacobi stability analysis has yet to be addressed. In this paper, we initiate our study on the problem for a class of ODE systems of arbitrary dimension and propose two algorithmic schemes using symbolic computation to check whether a nonlinear dynamical system may exhibit Jacobi stability. The first scheme, based on the construction of the complex root structure of a characteristic polynomial and on the method of quantifier elimination, is capable of detecting the existence of the Jacobi stability of the given dynamical system. The second algorithmic scheme exploits the method of semi-algebraic system solving and allows one to determine conditions on the parameters for a given dynamical system to have a prescribed number of Jacobi stable fixed points. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithmic schemes.</description>

      <title>Linear equations with monomial constraints and decision problems in abelian-by-cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that it is undecidable whether a system of linear equations over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$ admit solutions where a specified subset of variables take value in the set of monomials $\{X^z \mid z \in \mathbb{Z}\}$. In particular, we construct a finitely presented $\mathbb{Z}[X^{\pm}]$-module, where it is undecidable whether a linear equation $X^{z_1} \boldsymbol{f}_1 + \cdots + X^{z_n} \boldsymbol{f}_n = \boldsymbol{f}_0$ has solutions $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This contrasts the decidability of the case $n = 1$, which can be deduced from Noskov's Lemma.
  We apply this result to settle a number of problems in computational group theory. We show that it is undecidable whether a system of equations has solutions in the wreath product $\mathbb{Z} \wr \mathbb{Z}$, providing a negative answer to an open problem of Kharlampovich, L\'{o}pez and Miasnikov (2020). We show that there exists a finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic group in which the problem of solving a single quadratic equation is undecidable. We also construct a finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic group, different to that of Mishchenko and Treier (2017), in which the Knapsack Problem is undecidable. In contrast, we show that the problem of Coset Intersection is decidable in all finitely generated abelian-by-cyclic groups.</description>
