      <title>Phases and dynamics of few fermionic impurities immersed in two-dimensional boson droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unravel the ground state properties and emergent non-equilibrium dynamics of a mixture consisting of a few spin-polarized fermions embedded in a two-dimensional bosonic quantum droplet. For an increasingly attractive droplet-fermion interaction we find a transition from a spatially delocalized fermion configuration to a state where the fermions are highly localized and isolated. This process is accompanied by the rise of induced fermion-fermion interactions mediated by the droplet. Additionally, for increasing attractive droplet-fermion coupling, undulations in the droplet density occur in the vicinity of the fermions manifesting the back-action of the latter. Following interaction quenches from strong attractive to weaker droplet-fermion couplings reveals the spontaneous nucleation of complex excitation patterns in the fermion density such as ring and cross shaped structures. These stem from the enhanced interference of the fermions that remain trapped within the droplet, which emulates, to a good degree, an effective potential for the fermions. The non-negligible back-action of the droplet manifests itself in the fact that the effective potential predictions are less accurate at the level of the many-body wave function. Our results provide a paradigm for physics beyond the reduced single-component droplet model, unveiling the role of back-action in droplets and the effect of induced mediated interactions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transitions in SU(1, 1) quantum dynamics: applications to Bose-Einstein condensates and periodically driven coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties in non-equilibrium quantum systems with the SU(1, 1) structure. Through M\"obius transformation, we map the dynamics of these systems following a sudden quench or a periodic drive onto three distinct trajectories on the Poincar\'e disc, corresponding the heating, non-heating, and a phase boundary describing these non-equilibrium quantum states. We consider two experimentally feasible systems where their quantum dynamics exhibit the SU(1, 1) structure: the quench dynamics of the Bose-Einstein condensates and the periodically driven coupled oscillators. In both cases, the heating, non-heating phases, and their boundary manifest through distinct signatures in the phonon population where exponential, oscillatory, and linear growths classify these phases. Similarly, the entanglement entropy and negativity also exhibit distinct behaviors (linearly, oscillatory, and logarithmic growths) characterizing these phases, respectively. Notibly, for the periodically driven coupled oscillators, the non-equilibrium properties are characterized by two sets of SU(1, 1) generators. The corresponding two sets of the trajectories on two Poincar\'e discs lead to a more complex phase diagram. We identify two distinct phases within the heating region discernible solely by the growth rate of the entanglement entropy, where a discontinuity is observed when varying the parameters across the phase boundary within in heating region. This discontinuity is not observed in the phonon population.</description>

      <title>Quantum droplets in dipolar condensate mixtures with arbitrary dipole orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through considering a two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate, we investigate the influence of the angle between the polarization orientations of the two species on the ground states, and show that the miscibility between the two components can be adjusted not only by the inter-component contact interaction but also by the polarization angle. Particularly, in the presence of an external confinement, the two species exhibit a preference for splitting into multiple droplets separated from each other in the immiscible regime, featuring a zig-zag like profile. Furthermore, the number of separated droplets depends solely on the polarization angle. This introduces a promising degree of freedom for exploring emergent states of matter in dipolar quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Dynamical suppression of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect in Anyonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a fascinating phenomenon in nonequilibrium systems where eigenstates massively localize at the systems' boundaries, pumping (quasi-)particles loaded in these systems unidirectionally to the boundaries. Its interplay with many-body effects have been vigorously studied recently, and inter-particle repulsion or Fermi degeneracy pressure have been shown to limit the boundary accumulation induced by the NHSE both in their eigensolutions and dynamics. However, in this work we found that anyonic statistics can even more profoundly affect the NHSE dynamics, suppressing or even reversing the state dynamicss against the localizing direction of the NHSE. This phenomenon is found to be more pronounced when more particles are involved.The spreading of quantum information in this system shows even more exotic phenomena, where NHSE affects only the information dynamics for a thermal ensemble, but not that for a single initial state. Our results open up a new avenue on exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena arisen from the interplay between NHSE and anyonic statistics, and can potentially be demonstrated in ultracold atomic quantum simulators and quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Theory of fractional quantum Hall liquids coupled to quantum light and emergent graviton-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthrough experiments have demonstrated how it is now possible to explore the dynamics of quantum Hall states interacting with quantum electromagnetic cavity fields. While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $\nu=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. We additionally observe that moving to strong cavity field gradients leads to an instability towards a sliding Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase, featuring a strong density modulation in the gradient direction. Finally, by exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light. We discuss the experimental implications of our findings and possible extension of our results to more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Geometry of the Haldane Model under a Quantum Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the time evolution of a topological system when the system undergoes a sudden quantum quench within the same nontrivial phase. Using Haldane's honeycomb model as an example, we show that equilibrium states in a topological phase can be distinguished by geometrical features, such as the characteristic momentum at which the half-occupied edge modes cross, the associated edge-mode velocity, and the winding vector about which the normalized pseudospin magnetic field winds along a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We generalize these geometrical quantities for non-equilibrium states and use them to visualize the quench dynamics of the topological system. In general, we find the pre-quench equilibrium state relaxes to the post-quench equilibrium state in an oscillatory fashion, whose amplitude decay as $t^{1/2}$. In the process, however, the characteristic winding vector of the non-equilibrium system can evolve to regimes that are not reachable with equilibrium states.</description>

      <title>Realizing limit cycles in dissipative bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general mechanism for generating limit cycle (LC) oscillations by coupling a linear bosonic mode to a dissipative nonlinear bosonic mode. By analyzing the stability matrix, we show that LCs arise due to a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. We find that the existence of LCs is independent of the sign of the effective nonlinear interaction. The LC phase can be classified as a continuous time crystal (CTC), if it emerges in a many-body system. The bosonic model can be realised in three-level systems interacting with a quantised light mode as realised in atom-cavity systems. Using such a platform, we experimentally observe LCs for the first time in an atom-cavity system with attractive optical pump lattice, thereby confirming our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Matter-wave interferometers with trapped strongly interacting Feshbach molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement two types of matter-wave interferometers using trapped Bose-condensed Feshbach molecules, from weak to strong interactions. In each case, we focus on investigating interaction effects and their implications for the performance. In the Ramsey-type interferometer where interference between the two motional quantum states in an optical lattice is observed, interparticle interactions are found to induce energy shifts in the states. Consequently, this results in a reduction of the interferometer frequency and introduces a phase shift during the lattice pulses used for state manipulation. Furthermore, nonuniformity leads to dephasing and collisional effects contribute to the degradation of contrast. In the Michelson-type interferometer, where matter waves are spatially split and recombined in a waveguide, interference is observed in the presence of significant interaction, however coherence degrades with increasing interaction strength. Notably, coherence is also observed in thermal clouds, indicating the white-light nature of the implemented Michelson-type interferometer.</description>

      <title>A Microscopic Description for Two Body Loss in Cold Atoms Near Feshbach Resonances with Strong Spontaneous Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the two body loss dynamics of fermionic cold atoms near $s$- and $p$-wave Feshbach resonances with a microscopic Keldysh path integral formalism and compare the result to the macroscopic phenomenological loss rate equation. The microscopic loss rate equation is an integral-differential equation of the momentum distribution that depends on the functional form of the loss rate coefficient. For $s$-wave resonance, the microscopic theory yields the same result as the phenomenological equation. However, the calculation of $p$-wave resonance shows a discrepancy between the two descriptions for an quantum-degenerate gas. This discrepancy originates from the functional form of the loss coefficient which is associated with the microscopic loss mechanism of the two body loss and is neglected in the phenomenological equations where the coefficient is typically a constant. We find the discrepancy between the microscopic theory and the phenomenological description is smeared by thermal average at high temperature, $T\gtrsim T_F$ where $T_F$ is the Fermi temperature.</description>
