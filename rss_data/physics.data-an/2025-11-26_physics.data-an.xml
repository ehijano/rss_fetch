      <title>A matrix form solution of the multi-dimensional generalized Langevin equation in the quadratic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this research paper, we present an exact matrix form analytical solution of the multi-dimensional generalized Langevin equation with quadratic potentials. Our investigation provides detailed expressions for the two-dimensional probability distribution and extends the understanding of the dynamics governed by harmonic potentials. By utilizing the inverse Laplace transformation, we offer a precise method to solve these equations, corroborated by specific examples. This study contributes to the fundamental understanding of stochastic processes in multi-dimensional systems with harmonic potentials and clarifies the limitations of our approach. While the findings are specific to quadratic potentials, they provide a robust framework for exploring related phenomena within this context.</description>

      <title>Classifying Complex Dynamical and Stochastic Systems via Physics-Based Recurrence Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employ the recently developed recurrence microstate probabilities as features to improve accuracy of several well-established machine learning (ML) algorithms. These algorithms are applied to classify discrete and continuous dynamical systems, as well as colored noise. We demonstrate that the dynamical characteristics quantified by this method are effectively captured in the recurrence microstate space, a space defined solely by the recurrence properties of the signal. This space change reduces dimensions, which also reduces the necessary time to perform calculations and obtain relevant information about the underlying system. Here, we also demonstrate that a few optimal machine learning (ML) algorithms are particularly effective for classification when combined with recurrence microstates. Furthermore, these new machine learning vectors significantly reduce memory usage and computational complexity, outperforming the direct analysis of raw data.</description>

      <title>Learning Efficient Representations of Neutrino Telescope Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino telescopes detect rare interactions of particles produced in some of the most extreme environments in the Universe. This is accomplished by instrumenting a cubic-kilometer scale volume of naturally occurring transparent medium with light sensors. Given their substantial size and the high frequency of background interactions, these telescopes amass an enormous quantity of large variance, high-dimensional data. These attributes create substantial challenges for analyzing and reconstructing interactions, particularly when utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called om2vec, that employs transformer-based variational autoencoders to efficiently represent the detected photon arrival time distributions of neutrino telescope events by learning compact and descriptive latent representations. We demonstrate that these latent representations offer enhanced flexibility and improved computational efficiency, thereby facilitating downstream tasks in data analysis.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Pipeline for Track Finding in the Velo at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the next decade, increases in instantaneous luminosity and detector granularity will amplify the amount of data that has to be analysed by high-energy physics experiments, whether in real time or offline, by an order of magnitude. The reconstruction of charged particle tracks, which has always been a crucial element of offline data processing pipelines, must increasingly be deployed from the very first stages of the real time processing to enable experiments to achieve their physics goals. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received a great deal of attention in the community because their computational complexity scales nearly linearly with the number of hits in the detector, unlike conventional algorithms which often scale quadratically or worse. This paper presents ETX4VELO, a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's Vertex Locator, in the context of LHCb's fully GPU-based first-level trigger system, Allen. Currently implemented in Python, ETX4VELO offers the ability to reconstruct tracks with shared hits using a novel triplet-based method. When benchmarked against the traditional track-finding algorithm in Allen, this GNN-based approach not only matches but occasionally surpasses its physics performance. In particular, the fraction of fake tracks is reduced from over 2% to below 1% and the efficiency to reconstruct electrons is improved. While achieving comparable physics performance is a milestone, the immediate priority remains implementing ETX4VELO in Allen in order to determine and optimise its throughput, to meet the demands of this high-rate environment.</description>
