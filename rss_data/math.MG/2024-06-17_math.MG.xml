      <title>A Gentle Introduction to CAT(0) Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this project we explore the geometry of general metric spaces, where we do not necessarily have the tools of differential geometry on our side. Some metric spaces (X,d) allow us to define geodesics, permitting us to compare geodesic triangles in (X,d) to geodesic triangles in a so called model space. In Chapters 1 and 2 we first discuss how to define the length of curves, and geodesics on (X,d), and then using these to portray the notion of ``non-positive curvature'' for a metric space. Chapter 3 concerns itself with special cases of such non-positively curved metric spaces, called CAT(0) spaces. These satisfy particularly nice properties, such as being uniquely geodesic, contractible, and having a convex metric, among others.
  We mainly follow the book by Martin R. Bridson and Andr\'e Haefliger, with some differences. Firstly, we restrict ourselves to using the Euclidean plane E^2 as our model space, which is all that is necessary to define CAT(0) spaces. Secondly, we skip many sections of the mentioned book, as many are not relevant for our specific purposes. Finally, we add details to some of the proofs, which can be sparse in details or completely non-existent in the original literature. In this way we hope to create a more streamlined, self-contained, and accessible introduction to CAT(0) spaces.</description>

      <title>Ball characterizations in planes and spaces of constant curvature, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let us have in S^2, R^2 or H^2 a pair of convex bodies, for S^2 different from S^2, such that the intersections of any congruent copies of them are centrally symmetric. Then our bodies are congruent circles. If the intersections of any congruent copies of them are axially symmetric, then our bodies are circles.
  Let us have in S^2, R^2 or H^2 proper closed convex subsets K,L with interior points, such that the numbers of the connected components of the boundaries of K and L are finite. If the intersections of any congruent copies of K and L are centrally symmetric, then K and L are congruent circles, or, for R^2, parallel strips. We describe all pairs of such subsets K,L, whose any congruent copies have an intersection with axial symmetry. For S^2, R^2 and H^2 there are 1, 5 and 9 cases, resp.
  Let us have in S^d, R^d or H^d proper closed convex C^2_+ subsets K,L with interior points, such that all sufficiently small intersections of their congruent copies are symmetric w.r.t. a particular hyperplane. Then the boundary components of both K and L are congruent, and each of them is a sphere, a parasphere or a hypersphere.
  Let us have a pair of convex bodies in S^d, R^d or H^d, which have at any boundary points supporting spheres, for S^d of radius less than \pi/2. If the convex hull of the union of any congruent copies of these bodies is centrally symmetric, then our bodies are congruent balls, for S^d of radius less than \pi/2. An analogous statement holds for symmetry w.r.t. a particular hyperplane. For d=2 suppose the existence of the above supporting circles, for S^2 of radius less than \pi/2, and for S^2 smoothness of K and L. If we suppose axial symmetry of all the above convex hulls, then our bodies are circles, for S^2 of radii less than \pi/2.</description>

      <title>Radial Projections in $\mathbb{R}^n$ Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the recent results on radial projections by Orponen, Shmerkin, Wang using two different methods. In particular, we show that given $X,Y\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ Borel sets and $X\neq \emptyset$. If $\dim Y \in (k,k+1]$ for some $k\in \{1,\dots, n-1\}$, then \[ \sup_{x\in X} \dim \pi_x(Y\setminus \{x\}) \geq \min \{\dim X + \dim Y - k, k\}. \] Our results give a new approach to solving a conjecture of Lund-Pham-Thu in all dimensions and for all ranges of $\dim Y$.
  The first of our two methods for proving the above theorem is shorter, utilizing a result of the first author and Gan. Our second method, though longer, follows the original methodology of Orponen--Shmerkin--Wang, and requires a higher dimensional incidence estimate and a dual Furstenberg-set estimate for lines. These new estimates may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Continuum Erd\H{o}s-Beck Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a version of the Erd\H{o}s--Beck Theorem from discrete geometry for fractal sets in all dimensions. More precisely, let $X\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ Borel and $k \in [0, n-1]$ be an integer. Let $\dim (X \setminus H) = \dim X$ for every $k$-dimensional hyperplane $H \in \mathcal{A}(n,k)$, and let $\mathcal L(X)$ be the set of lines that contain at least two distinct points of $X$. Then, a recent result of Ren shows
  $$ \dim \mathcal{L}(X) \geq \min \{2 \dim X, 2k\}.
  $$
  If we instead have that $X$ is not a subset of any $k$-plane, and
  $$
  0&lt;\inf_{H \in \mathcal{A}(n,k)} \dim (X \setminus H) = t &lt; \dim X,
  $$
  we instead obtain the bound
  $$ \dim \mathcal{L}(X) \geq \dim X + t.
  $$ We then strengthen this lower bound by introducing the notion of the "trapping number" of a set, $T(X)$, and obtain \[ \dim \mathcal L(X) \geq \max\{\dim X + t, \min\{2\dim X, 2(T(X)-1)\}\}, \] as consequence of our main result and of Ren's result in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Finally, we introduce a conjectured equality for the dimension of the line set $\mathcal{L}(X)$, which would in particular imply our results if proven to be true.</description>

      <title>Topological rigidity of small RCD(K,N) spaces with maximal rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a polycyclic group $\Lambda$, rank$(\Lambda )$ is defined as the number of $\mathbb{Z}$ factors in a polycyclic decomposition of $\Lambda$. For a finitely generated group $G$, rank$(G)$ is defined as the infimum of rank$(\Lambda )$ among finite index polycyclic subgroups $\Lambda \leq G$.
  For a compact RCD$(K,N)$ space $(X,\mathsf{d}, \mathfrak{m} )$ with diam$(X) \leq \varepsilon (K,N)$, the rank of $\pi_1(X)$ is at most $N$. In this note we show that in case of equality, $X$ is homeomorphic to an infranilmanifold, generalizing to the non-smooth setting a result by Kapovitch--Wilking. We also fill a gap in the proof that if $\pi_1(X) = \mathbb{Z}^N$, then $X$ is bi-H\"older homeomorphic to a flat torus (diffeomorphic in the smooth case).</description>

      <title>Elementary fractal geometry. 4. Automata-generated topological spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite automata were used to determine multiple addresses in number systems and to find topological properties of self-affine tiles and finite type fractals. We join these two lines of research by axiomatically defining automata which generate topological spaces. Simple examples show the potential of the concept. Spaces generated by automata are topologically self-similar. Two basic algorithms are outlined. The first one determines automata for all $k$-tuples of equivalent addresses from the automaton for double addresses. The second one constructs finite topological spaces which approximate the generated space. Finally, we discuss the realization of automata-generated spaces as self-similar sets.</description>

      <title>The magnitude and spectral geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric significance of Leinster's notion of magnitude for a smooth manifold with boundary of arbitrary dimension, motivated by open questions for the unit disk in $\mathbb{R}^2$. For a large class of distance functions, including embedded submanifolds of Euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds satisfying a technical condition, we show that the magnitude function is well defined for $R\gg 0$ and admits a meromorphic continuation to sectors in $\mathbb{C}$. In the semiclassical limit $R \to \infty$, the magnitude function admits an asymptotic expansion, which determines the volume, surface area and integrals of generalized curvatures. Lower-order terms are computed by black box computer algebra. We initiate the study of magnitude analogues to classical questions in spectral geometry and prove an asymptotic variant of the Leinster-Willerton conjecture.</description>

      <title>Widths and rigidity of unconditional sets and random vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that any unconditional set in $\mathbb{R}^N$ that is invariant under cyclic shifts of coordinates is rigid in $\ell_q^N$, $1\le q\le 2$, i.e. it can not be well approximated by linear spaces of dimension essentially smaller than $N$. We apply the approach of E.D.~Gluskin to the setting of averaged Kolmogorov widths of unconditional random vectors or vectors of independent mean zero random variables, and prove their rigidity. These results are obtained using a general lower bound for the averaged Kolmogorov width via weak moments of biorthogonal random vector. This paper continues the study of the rigidity initiated by the first author.
  We also provide several corollaries including lower bounds for Kolmogorov widths of mixed norm balls.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature bounds and rigidity for non-smooth Riemannian and semi-Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rigidity problems for Riemannian and semi-Riemannian manifolds with metrics of low regularity. Specifically, we prove a version of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem \cite{CheegerGromoll72splitting} for Riemannian metrics and the flatness criterion for semi-Riemannian metrics of regularity $C^1$. With our proof of the splitting theorem, we are able to obtain an isometry of higher regularity than the Lipschitz regularity guaranteed by the $\mathsf{RCD}$-splitting theorem \cite{gigli2013splitting, gigli2014splitoverview}. Along the way, we establish a Bochner-Weitzenb\"ock identity which permits both the non-smoothness of the metric and of the vector fields, complementing a recent similar result in \cite{mondino2024equivalence}. The last section of the article is dedicated to the discussion of various notions of Sobolev spaces in low regularity, as well as an alternative proof of the equivalence (see \cite{mondino2024equivalence}) between distributional Ricci curvature bounds and $\mathsf{RCD}$-type bounds, using in part the stability of the variable $\mathsf{CD}$-condition under suitable limits \cite{ketterer2017variableCD}.</description>

      <title>The $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry of Teichm\"uller space -- Second order infinitesimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $L^1$-$L^\infty$ geometry is the Finsler geometry of the Teichm\"uller space by the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function of holomorphic quadratic differentials. In this paper, aiming to develop the $L^1$-$L^\infty$-geometry and the differential geometry on the Teichm\"uller space, we formulate the second order infinitesimal structures (the infinitesimal structures on the (co)tangent bundles) over the Teichm\"uller space. We will give model spaces of the second order infinitesimal spaces.
  By applying our formulation, we give affirmative answers to two folklore. We first show that the map from the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials to the tangent bundle defined by Teichm\"uller Beltrami differentials is a real-analytic diffeomorphism on every stratum in the space of holomorphic quadratic differentials. Second, we show that the Teichm\"uller metric is real-analytic on the image of each stratum. We also observe a new duality between the Teichm\"uller metric and the $L^1$-norm function at the infinitesimal level.</description>
