      <title>Probably isomorphic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two structures $M, N$ in the same language are called probably isomorphic if they (or, in case of metric structures, their completions) are isomorphic after forcing with the Lebesgue measure algebra. We show that, if $M$ and $N$ are discrete structures, or extremal models of a non-degenerate simplicial theory, then $M$ and $N$ are probably isomorphic if and only if $L^1([0,1], M) \cong L^1([0,1], N)$. We moreover employ some of the set-theoretic arguments used to prove the aforementioned result to characterize when nontrivial ultraproducts of diffuse von Neumann algebras are tensorially prime.</description>

      <title>Positive definiteness and Fell bundles over discrete groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a natural concept of positive definiteness for bundle maps between Fell bundles over (possibly different) discrete groups and describe several examples. Such maps induce completely positive maps between the associated full cross-sectional $C^*$-algebras in a functorial way. Under the assumption that the kernel of the homomorphism connecting the groups under consideration is amenable, they also induce completely positive maps between the associated reduced cross-sectional $C^*$-algebras. As an application, we define an approximation property for a Fell bundle over a discrete group which generalizes Exel's approximation property and still implies the weak containment property. Both approximation properties coincide when the unit fibre is nuclear.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Cartan Inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pseudo-Cartan inclusion is a regular inclusion having a Cartan envelope. Unital pseudo-Cartan inclusions were classified by Pitts; we extend this classification to include the non-unital case. The class of pseudo-Cartan inclusions coincides with the class of regular inclusions having the faithful unique pseudo-expectation property and can also be described using the ideal intersection property. We describe the twisted groupoid associated with the Cartan envelope of a pseudo-Cartan inclusion. These results significantly extend previous results obtained for the unital setting.
  We explore properties of pseudo-Cartan inclusions and the relationship between a pseudo-Cartan inclusion and its Cartan envelope. For example, if $\mathcal D\subseteq \mathcal C$ is a pseudo-Cartan inclusion with Cartan envelope $\mathcal B\subseteq \mathcal A$, then $\mathcal C$ is simple if and only if $\mathcal A$ is simple. Also every regular $*$-automorphism of $\mathcal C$ uniquely extends to a $*$-automorphism of $\mathcal A$. We show that the inductive limit of pseudo-Cartan inclusions with suitable connecting maps is a pseudo-Cartan inclusion, and the minimal tensor product of pseudo-Cartan inclusions is a pseudo-Cartan inclusion. Further, we describe the Cartan envelope of pseudo-Cartan inclusions arising from these constructions. We conclude with some applications and a few open questions.</description>

      <title>Rates of convergence in the Free Multiplicative Central Limit Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide the first quantitative estimates for the rate of convergence in the free multiplicative central limit theorem (CLT), in terms of the Kolmogorov and $r$-Wasserstein distances for $r \geq 1$. While the free additive CLT has been thoroughly studied, including convergence rates, the multiplicative setting remained open in this regard. We consider products of the form $$ \pi_n^{g,n^{-1/2}x} := g\left(\frac{x_1}{\sqrt{n}}\right) \cdots g\left(\frac{x_n}{\sqrt{n}}\right),$$ where $x_1, \dots, x_n$ are freely independent self-adjoint operators with common variance $\sigma^2$ and $g \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$ satisfies certain regularity and integrability conditions. We quantify the deviation of the singular value distribution of $\pi_n^{g,x}$ from the free positive semicircular law, with bounds depending only on the moments of the underlying variables. Additionally, we present a combinatorial proof of the free multiplicative CLT that extends to the unbounded setting.</description>
