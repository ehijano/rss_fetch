      <title>ChatQCD: Let Large Language Models Explore QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) has yielded a vast literature spanning distinct phenomena. We construct a corpus of papers and build a generative model. This model holds promise for accelerating the capability of scientists to consolidate their knowledge of QCD by the ability to generate and validate scientific works in the landscape of works related to QCD and similar problems in HEP. Furthermore, we discuss challenges and future directions of using large language models to integrate our scientific knowledge about QCD through the automated generation of explanatory scientific texts.</description>

      <title>Quarks to Cosmos: Particles and Plasma in Cosmological evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe in the context of the particle physics (PP) standard model (SM) `PP-SM' the understanding of the primordial properties and composition of the Universe in the temperature range $130\GeV&gt;T&gt;20\keV$. The Universe evolution is described using FLRW cosmology. We present a global view on particle content across time and describe the different evolution eras using deceleration parameter $q$. We follow the arrow of time in the expanding and cooling Universe: After the PP-SM heavies $(t, h, W, Z)$ diminish in abundance below $T\simeq 50\GeV$, the PP-SM plasma in the Universe is governed by the strongly interacting Quark-Gluon content. Once the temperature drops below $T\simeq 150\MeV$, quarks and gluons hadronize into strongly interacting matter particles. Rapid disappearance of baryonic antimatter completes at $T_\mathrm{B}=38.2\MeV$. We study the ensuing disappearance of strangeness and mesons in general. We show that the different eras defined by particle populations are barely separated from each other with abundance of muons fading out just prior to $T=\mathcal{O}(2.5)\MeV$, the era of emergence of the free-streaming neutrinos. We discuss the two relevant fundamental constants controlling the decoupling of neutrinos. We subsequently follow the primordial Universe as it passes through the hot dense electron-positron plasma epoch. The high density of positron antimatter disappears near $T=20.3\keV$: Nuclear reactions occur in the presence of a highly mobile and relatively strongly interacting electron-positron plasma phase. We apply plasma theory methods to describe the strong screening effects between heavy dust particle (nucleons). We analyze the paramagnetic characteristics of the electron-positron plasma when exposed to an external primordial magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Single Inclusive Jet Production: Timelike Factorization and Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factorization theorems for single inclusive jet production play a crucial role in the study of jets and their substructure. In the case of small radius jets, the dynamics of the jet clustering can be factorized from both the hard production dynamics, and the dynamics of the low scale jet substructure measurement, and is described by a matching coefficient that can be computed in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). A proposed factorization formula describing this process has been previously presented in the literature, and is referred to as the semi-inclusive, or fragmenting jets formalism. By performing an explicit two-loop calculation, we show the inconsistency of this factorization formula, in agreement with another recent result in the literature. Building on recent progress in the factorization of single logarithmic observables, and the understanding of reciprocity, we then derive a new all-order factorization theorem for inclusive jet production. Our factorization involves a non-trivial convolution structure, that maintains the universality of the hard function from inclusive fragmentation. We perform an explicit two-loop calculation of the jet function in both $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills (SYM), and for all color channels in QCD, finding exact agreement with the structure derived from our renormalization group equations. In addition, we derive several new results, including an extension of our factorization formula to jet substructure observables, a jet algorithm definition of a generating function for the energy correlators, and new results for exclusive jet functions. Our results are a key ingredient for achieving precision jet substructure at colliders.</description>

      <title>Feynman integral reduction: balanced reconstruction of sparse rational functions and implementation on supercomputers in a co-design approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction is one of the essential steps in evaluating Feynman integrals. A modern approach to IBP reduction uses modular arithmetic evaluations with parameters set to numerical values at sample points, followed by reconstruction of the analytic rational coefficients. Due to the large number of sample points needed, problems at the frontier of science require an application of supercomputers. In this article, we present a rational function reconstruction method that fully takes advantage of sparsity, combining the balanced reconstruction method and the Zippel method. Additionally, to improve the efficiency of the finite-field IBP reduction runs, at each run several numerical probes are computed simultaneously, which allows to decrease the resource overhead. We describe what performance issues one encounters on the way to an efficient implementation on supercomputers, and how one should co-design the algorithm and the supercomputer infrastructure. Benchmarks are presented for IBP reductions for massless two-loop four- and five-point integrals using a development version of FIRE, as well as synthetic examples mimicking the coefficients involved in scattering amplitudes for post-Minkowskian gravitational binary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Some physics of small collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years certain experimental results from small collision systems (e.g. p-p, d-Au, p-Pb) at the RHIC and LHC have been reinterpreted as evidence for formation therein of a dense flowing medium (QGP) despite small collision volumes. Systems that had been assigned as simple references (e.g. cold nuclear matter) for larger A-A collisions would then no longer play that role. This presentation examines conventional interpretations of certain data features in the context of a two-component (soft+hard) collision model. Specific topics include centrality determination for p-Pb collisions, interpretation (or not) of nuclear modification factors, significance of claims for strangeness enhancement, and interpretation of the "ridge" in p-p collisions. For p-p and p-Pb data analysis results indicate that p-Pb collisions are simple linear superpositions of p-N collisions, and N-N collisions within small systems generally follow simple and consistent rules. However, there is more to be learned about "basic" QCD in small systems with improved analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium production in pp and heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe bottomonium production not only in pp collisions but also in heavy-ion collisions by using the Remler's formalism where quarkonium density operator is applied to all possible combination of heavy quark and heavy antiquark pairs. In pp collisions heavy (anti)quark momentum is provided by the PYTHIA event generator after rescaling $p_T$ and rapidity to imitate the FONLL calculations. Then spatial separation between heavy quark and heavy antiquark is introduced based on the uncertainty principle. In heavy-ion collisions quarkonium wavefunction changes with temperature assuming heavy quark potential equals the free energy of heavy quark and heavy antiquark system in heat bath. The density operator is updated whenever heavy quark or heavy antiquark scatters in QGP produced in heavy-ion collisions. Our results are consistent with the experimental data from ALICE and CMS Collaborations assuming that the interaction rate of heavy (anti)quark in quarkonium is suppressed to 10 \% that of unbound heavy (anti)quark. We also find that off-diagonal recombination of bottomonium barely happens even in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the $X(4475)$, $X(4500)$, $Z_{\bar{c}\bar{s}}(4600)$ and related tetraquark states with the QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce explicit P-waves to construct the diquark operators, then construct the local four-quark currents to explore the hidden-charm tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{+-}$ and $2^{++}$ in the framework of the QCD sum rules at length. Our calculations indicate tiny light-flavor $SU(3)$ breaking effects on the tetraquark masses due to the special currents and the predictions support assigning the $X(4775)$ and $X(4500)$ as the $[uc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{uc}]_{\widehat{V}}-[dc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{dc}]_{\widehat{V}}$ and $[sc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{sc}]_{\widehat{V}}$ tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ respectively, and assigning the $Z_{c}(4600)$ and $Z_{\bar{c}\bar{s}}(4600)$ as the $[uc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{dc}]_{\widehat{V}}$ and $[qc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{sc}]_{\widehat{V}}$ tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ respectively, and thus account for the LHCb's data.</description>

      <title>Transport properties of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) by comparing the role of elastic and inelastic (radiative) processes in the sQGP medium within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM), constructed for the description of non-perturbative quantum chromodynamic (QCD) phenomena of the sQGP in line with the lattice QCD (lQCD) equation of state. First, we present the results for the energy and temperature dependencies of the total radiative cross sections and compare them to the corresponding elastic cross sections. Second, we perform a calculation of the interaction rate and relaxation time of radiative versus elastic scatterings. Finally, we obtain the jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ and investigate its dependence on the choice of the strong coupling in thermal, jet parton and radiative vertices.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the peak of the sound velocity for isospin imbalanced strongly interacting matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of a system composed of strongly interacting matter with an isospin imbalance, using as an effective description of QCD the two-flavor Linear Sigma Model with quarks. From the one-loop effective potential, including the two light quarks, pions and sigma contributions, and enforcing the restrictions imposed by chiral symmetry, we show that the development of an isospin condensate comes together with the emergence of a Goldstone mode that provides a constraint for the chiral and isospin condensates as a result of a non-trivial mixing between the charged pions and the sigma. We compute the thermodynamical quantities of interest and in particular the sound velocity squared, showing that it presents a maximum for an isospin chemical potential similar to the one reported by lattice QCD results and also with a similar height. Therefore, we attribute the origin of the peak of the sound velocity to the proper treatment of the Goldstone mode and to the non-trivial mixing of the charged pions and sigma in the isospin condensed phase.</description>

      <title>Hypercontractivity and factorial moment scaling in the symmetry broken phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for remnants of the QCD chiral critical point is a central objective of current and future high-energy ion collision experiments. Previous studies suggest that a scaling law relating higher-order factorial moments of hadron multiplicity fluctuations to the second factorial moment could serve as a tool for detecting the QCD critical point. However, we demonstrate that this scaling law is not unique to critical phenomena. Instead, it emerges as a general property of distributions by extending the concept of hypercontractivity, originally applied to ordinary moments, to factorial moments. We present examples of distribution classes that exhibit the same higher-order factorial moment scaling as multiplicity fluctuations in the symmetry-broken phase. This insight allows us to explain the recent intermittency analysis results from the STAR experiment at RHIC (arXiv:2301.11062), where no indication of criticality was observed.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Based Estimator for Light Flavour Elliptic Flow in Heavy Ion Collisions at LHC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a deep learning feed-forward network for estimating elliptic flow ($v_2$) coefficients in heavy-ion collisions from RHIC to LHC energies. The success of our model is mainly the estimation of $v_2$ from final state particle kinematic information and learning the centrality and the transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) dependence of $v_2$ in wide $p_{\rm T}$ regime. The deep learning model is trained with AMPT-generated Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV minimum bias events. We present $v_2$ estimates for $\pi^{\pm}$, $\rm K^{\pm}$, and $\rm p+\bar{p}$ in heavy-ion collisions at various LHC energies. These results are compared with the available experimental data wherever possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical results at approximate NNLO in QCD for top-quark pair-production total cross sections and top-quark differential distributions at the LHC in the SMEFT. In this work we consider effects of new physics parametrized by the chromomagnetic dipole operator. These approximate results are obtained by adding higher-order soft gluon corrections to the complete NLO calculations. The higher-order corrections are large, and they reduce the scale uncertainties. These improved theoretical predictions can be used to set stronger bounds on top-quark QCD anomalous couplings.</description>

      <title>$\rho$ meson form factors and parton distribution functions in impact parameter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the form factors and impact parameter space parton distribution functions of the $\rho$ meson derived from the generalized parton distributions within the framework of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, employing a proper time regularization scheme. We compare the charge $G_C$, magnetic $G_M$, and quadrupole $G_Q$ form factors with lattice data. The dressed form factors, $G_C^D$ and $G_M^D$, exhibit good agreement with lattice results; however, $G_Q^D$ is found to be harder than what is observed in lattice calculations. The Rosenbluth cross section for elastic electron scattering on a spin-one particle can be expressed through the structure functions $A(Q^2)$ and $B(Q^2)$. Additionally, the tensor polarization $T_{20}(Q^2,\theta)$ can also be formulated in terms of these form factors. We analyze the structure functions $A(Q^2)$, $B(Q^2)$ and tensor polarization function $T_{20}(Q^2,\theta)$; our findings quantitatively align with predicted values across various limits. In impact parameter space, we examine parton distribution functions along with their dependence on longitudinal momentum fraction $x$ and impact parameter $\bm{b}_{\perp}$. The width distributions in impact parameter space indicate that the range of charge distribution $q_C(x,\bm{b}_{\perp}^2)$ is the most extensive at small $x$, the transverse magnetic radius is the broadest at large $x$, while the quadrupole distribution $q_Q(x,\bm{b}_{\perp}^2)$ exhibits the narrowest range.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Form Factor of the Pion and Proton and the Conformal Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the hard scattering amplitude of gravitational form factors (GFFs) of hadrons within QCD factorization at large momentum transfers, focusing on their conformal field theory (CFT) description. These form factors are key to studying quark and gluon angular momentum in hadrons, connected to Mellin moments of Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS). The analysis uses diffeomorphism invariance and conformal symmetry in momentum space. A non-Abelian $TJJ$ 3-point function at $O(\alpha_s^2)$ reveals a dilaton interaction in the $t$-channel. We present a parameterization relevant for future DVCS/GFF experiments at the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>$4b + X$ via electroweak multi-Higgs production as smoking gun signals for Type-I 2HDM at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the Standard Model (SM) by one additional Higgs doublet leads to the Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM). A specific charge assignment of the SM fermions under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry leads to the Type-I 2HDM. A key feature of the Type-I 2HDM is that all the additional Higgs bosons can be fermiophobic, when their couplings to the SM fermions are suppressed. As a result, all the new Higgs states can be fairly light, $\sim$100 GeV or less, without being in conflict with the current data from the direct Higgs boson searches and the $B$-physics measurements. In a recent study Ref.~\cite{Mondal:2023wib}, which this proceeding is based on, we established that the new neutral as well as the charged Higgs bosons in this model can all be simultaneously observable in the multi-$b$ final state. An experimental validation of our results would be a clear indication that the true underlying Higgs sector in nature is the Type-I 2HDM.</description>

      <title>Overview on low mass scalars at $e^+e^-$ facilities -- theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I give a short summary on scenarios with new physics scalars that could be investigated at future $e^+e^-$ colliders. I concentrate on cases where at least one of the additional scalar has a mass below 125 GeV, and discuss models where this could be realized. Most of the material presented here has already been discussed in arXiv:2307.15962, and I therefore try to focus on novel developments since then.</description>

      <title>Prospects for light exotic scalar measurements at the e$^+$e$^-$ Higgs factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics program of the Higgs factory will focus on measurements of the 125 GeV Higgs boson, with the Higgs-strahlung process being the dominant production channel at 250 GeV. However, production of extra light scalars is still not excluded by the existing experimental data, provided their coupling to the gauge bosons is sufficiently suppressed. Fermion couplings of such a scalar could also be very different from the SM predictions leading to non-standard decay paterns. Presented in this contribution are results from the ongoing studies on prospects of direct light scalar observation at future Higgs factory experiments in different decay channels.</description>

      <title>Investigation on the $\Omega(2012)$ from QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the recently observed $\Omega(2012)$ baryon using QCD sum rules. By constructing $P$-wave $\Omega$ baryon currents and performing spin projection and parity projection, we obtain the masses of the $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ states as $M_{1/2^-} = 2.07^{+0.07}_{-0.07}{\rm~GeV}$ and $M_{3/2^-} = 2.05^{+0.09}_{-0.10}{\rm~GeV}$ in good agreement with experiment. This suggests that $\Omega(2012)$ is likely to be a negative parity $P$-wave excited state, though its spin remains undetermined and requires further study of its decay properties.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity from number density current in (non)equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) serve as comprehensive probes into our early Universe with associated generations of stochastic gravitational waves and superhorizon curvature perturbations or even primordial black holes. In characterizing the FOPT, phenomenological parameters like transition temperatures, strength factors, bubble separations, and energy budgets can be easily extracted from the macroscopic equilibrium features of the underlying particle physics models except for the terminal wall velocity of the bubble expansion, making it the last key parameter to be determined most difficultly due to the non-equilibrium nature of the microscopic transition model. In this paper, we propose a new model-independent approach to calculate the bubble wall velocity by two fundamental conservation equations in the first-order hydrodynamics from not only the usual energy-momentum tensor but also the number density current in terms of a few phenomenological parameters from field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the single-quantum positron annihilation with a bound electron in the near threshold region. The angular distribution and the total cross section are considered. We obtain a simple analytical expression for the Coulomb potential and for the screened potential. It is worth noting that the obtained results for the screened potential are universal and independent of the explicit form of the atomic potential. It is shown that screening significantly increases the cross section. We also obtain the analogous results for bound-free $e^+e^-$ photoproduction.</description>

      <title>Large Hadron Collider Signatures of Exotic Vector-Like Quarks within the 2-Higgs Doublet Model Type-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decay of the exotic Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) $X$ and $Y$, with $5/3$ and $-4/3$ units of electric charge, respectively, within the 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM). Building on our previous studies of Vector-Like Top and Bottom (VLT and VLB) quarks, we now investigate the characteristics of $X$ and $Y$ in the alignment limit of a Type-II Yukawa structure and show that, in the framework of such a 2HDM, one can have large non-Standard Model (SM) decay rates of the $X$ and$ Y$ states. Our analysis focuses on their potential detection at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), based on their pair production followed by a variety of both SM and non-SM decay patterns. In order to distinguish between doublet and triplet representations of the VLQs $X$ and $Y$, we uncover specific signatures that can provide insights into this particular architecture of Beyond the SM (BSM) physics.</description>

      <title>50 years of Neutrino Physics at Aligarh Muslim University</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An overview of the significant contributions made by the Aligarh group in the field of neutrino physics has been provided. The group's work began with the study of quasielastic neutrino scattering on deuterium, specifically the process $\nu_\mu + d \rightarrow \mu^- + p +p$, focusing on moderate neutrino energies within the impulse approximation framework in order to analyze the early experiments at ANL and BNL with deuterium filled bubble chambers. These studies were later extended to numerically calculate (anti)neutrino interaction cross sections for the inclusive quasielastic scattering from nuclei using local density approximation~(LDA), incorporating nucleon-nucleon correlations for moderate to heavy nuclear targets. The inelastic scattering cross sections for one pion production and the deep inelastic scattering~(DIS) from nuclei have been obtained using LDA with multi nucleon correlation effects. In the case of single pion production, the final state interaction of the pions with the residual nucleus has also been taken into account. In addition, the group has explored other inelastic processes of kaon and eta meson production, in the (anti)neutrino interactions with the nucleon targets. Furthermore, we have investigated electron and positron scattering off proton targets in the intermediate energy range, focusing on polarization observables and T-noninvariance. Our research has also delved into polarized electron scattering to explore the possibility of observing parity-violating asymmetry (PVA) in elastic and deep inelastic scattering, among other related topics. The group has also contributed to the study of atmospheric neutrino flux in the cosmic ray interactions, relevant for various sites of the neutrino oscillation experiments with atmospheric neutrinos.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the production and the decay of top quark through flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) interaction at future linear colliders. We first discuss the theoretical predictions of top quark FCNC decays into $qH$ and $qZ$ within a class of $t$-channel simplified dark matter models. For the existing bounds on the top quark FCNC interactions at the Large Hadron Collider, we estimate the production rates of top quark through FCNC interactions at future linear colliders for energies from $250$ GeV to $3$ TeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subtle field-theoretical effects suggest the presence of additional Higgs contributions in standard model processes. This has been supported by electroweak lattice calculation, e.\ g.\ for vector boson scattering. These effects can be included in perturbation theory by a suitable augmentation. We use such augmented perturbation theory to determine the impact at next-to-leading order at lepton colliders, from LEP to future machines such as FCC, in collisions with fermion-antifermion final states. After providing the formal background, we outline the calculational procedure, showing that in the fully exclusive process $e^-e^+\to f\bar{f}$ deviations only occur in fixed order at electroweak NNLO, but become relevant at the TeV scale already in resummed tree-level calculations. We discuss further processes where deviations are expected already at fixed-order NLO.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vector $U$-bosons, or so called 'dark photons', are one of the possible candidates for the dark matter mediators. We present a procedure to derive theoretical constraints on the upper limit of kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon^2(M_U)$ from heavy-ion as well as $p+p$ and $p+A$ dilepton data from SIS to LHC energies. Our study is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach which reproduces the measured dilepton spectra in $p+p$, $p+A$ and $A+A$ collisions well. In addition to the different dilepton channels originating from interactions and decays of ordinary Standard Model matter particles (mesons and baryons), we incorporate in the PHSD the decay of hypothetical $U$-bosons to dileptons, $U \to e^+ e^-$, where the $U$-bosons themselves are produced by the Dalitz decay of pions, $\eta$-mesons, Delta resonances as well as by vector meson and $K^+$ decays. This analysis provides the upper limit on the $\epsilon^2(M_U)$ and can also help to estimate the requested accuracy for future experimental searches of 'light' dark photons by dilepton experiments.</description>

      <title>A QCD interpretation of the scaling observed in the LHC proton-proton elastic cross-sections at moderate transfer momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A phenomenological scaling property of the LHC proton-proton elastic scattering cross sections at moderate transfer momentum has been recently observed. The theoretical QCD saturation framework for hard elastic scattering on the proton, which we recall, predicts a strikingly similar scaling property in the same configuration of energy and momentum transfer. This similarity favors a theoretical interpretation where the hard amplitude is the building block of the $pp$ amplitude via unitarization. The values of the scaling exponents favor two QCD saturation approaches where the saturation scale exponent is of order one half of that which is found for hard elastic scattering and deep inelastic processes on the proton.</description>

      <title>Positive definiteness constraints of effective scalar potential in Georgi-Machacek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Georgi-Machacek (GM) Model, which extends the Higgs sector of standard model with additional triplets, can preserve the custodial symmetry at tree level and allow large triplet vacuum expectation values of order $\cal{O}$(10) GeV. Various theoretical constraints can be imposed on the parameters of the Lagrangian, including the bounded-from-below constraints for the tree-level scalar potential. We propose to go beyond the tree-level bounded-from-below constraints and discuss the positive definiteness constraints for the effective potential of GM model to ensure the non-existence of a deeper vacuum in large field value regions. Based on one-loop renormalization group-improved (RG-improved) effective potential and new positive definite criteria for homogeneous polynomial with multiple variables (which is necessary because of the custodial symmetry breaking effects by loops), we can analyse numerically the positive definiteness constraints for GM model. Our numerical results indicate that the ranges of the quartic couplings allowed by the positive definiteness requirements are quite different from that derived from the tree-level bounded-from-below requirements. Especially, some parameter regions excluded previously by the tree-level bounded-from-below requirements can still satisfy the positive definite requirements with the one-loop RG-improved scalar potential. Besides, a portion of parameter space that can satisfy the tree-level bounded-from-below constraints with EW scale coupling inputs, should in fact be ruled out by the the positive definiteness requirements of the effective potential at large field value regions.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space methods for neutrino oscillations: extension to multi-beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Phase-Space approach (PSA), which was originally introduced in [Lacroix et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino flavor oscillations for interacting neutrinos emitted from stellar objects is extended to describe arbitrary numbers of neutrino beams. The PSA is based on mapping the quantum fluctuations into a statistical treatment by sampling initial conditions followed by independent mean-field evolution. A new method is proposed to perform this sampling that allows treating an arbitrary number of neutrinos in each neutrino beam. We validate the technique successfully and confirm its predictive power on several examples where a reference exact calculation is possible. We show that it can describe many-body effects, such as entanglement and dissipation induced by the interaction between neutrinos. Due to the complexity of the problem, exact solutions can only be calculated for rather limited cases, with a limited number of beams and/or neutrinos in each beam. The PSA approach considerably reduces the numerical cost and provides an efficient technique to accurately simulate arbitrary numbers of beams. Examples of PSA results are given here, including up to 200 beams with time-independent or time-dependent Hamiltonian. We anticipate that this approach will be useful to bridge exact microscopic techniques with more traditional transport theories used in neutrino oscillations. It will also provide important reference calculations for future quantum computer applications where other techniques are not applicable to classical computers.</description>

      <title>Measuring the atmospheric muon neutrino and anti-neutrino flux ratio with the ATLAS detector at LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a significant uncertainty in the prediction of atmospheric muon neutrino and anti-neutrino flux ratio using different flux models, especially at higher energies. We study the prospects of experimentally measuring this flux ratio as a function of energy with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. To this end, we compute the contained-vertex and external upward going charged current event rates induced by atmospheric muon (anti-)neutrinos through deep inelastic scattering at the 4 kiloton hadron calorimeter (HCAL) component of ATLAS. We illustrate the event selection criteria necessary to eliminate the cosmic ray muon background for the above event classes. While the contained vertex events have a striking topology with a muon being created inside the HCAL and then travelling to the muon chamber possibly through the tracker, for muons with energy larger than 3 GeV, a much higher statistics is obtained for the external upward going events created in the rock column below the detector. Our estimates show that the energy dependence of the ratio of negative and positively charged muons induced by atmospheric muon neutrino and anti-neutrino fluxes can be measured by ATLAS upto a muon energy of 100 GeV, with 1000-live days of neutrino physics exposure over a period of several years, considering only the period with the LHC beams not in circulation, but the detector and magnetic fields of ATLAS in operation. With this exposure, we obtain $63~\mu^-$ and $32~\mu^+$ contained vertex events, and $630~\mu^-$ and $307~\mu^+$ external upward-going events, after imposing the necessary selection criteria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical analysis of the interaction between superfluid dark matter and rotating supermassive black holes offers a promising framework for probing quantum effects in ultralight dark matter and its role in galactic structure. We study how black hole rotation influences the state of ultralight bosonic dark matter, focusing on the stability and dynamics of vortex lines. The gravitational effects of both dark matter and the black hole on the physical properties of these vortex lines, including their precession around the black hole, are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Prospects of measuring quantum entanglement in $\tau\tau$ final states at a future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method to study quantum entanglement at a future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factory (here the Future Circular Collider colliding $e^+$ and $e^-$ (FCC-ee) operating at $\sqrt{s}=240\,\mathrm{GeV}$) in the $\tau\tau$ final state. This method is focused on the $\tau \to \pi \nu_\tau$ decay. We show how the introduced method works on simulated events without detector effects. When detector effects are applied, the necessary $\tau$ four-momenta can be reconstructed from kinematic constraints. We will discuss the advantages of $e^+e^-$ collisions over $pp$ collisions where the reconstruction of the $\tau\tau$ rest frame is more difficult. This discussion will focus on the influence of $p_T$ trigger cuts on the visible $\pi^\pm$ in the $\tau$ lepton decay.</description>

      <title>The next-to-leading order Higgs impact factor at physical top mass: The real corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the real corrections to the impact factor for the production of a forward Higgs boson, retaining full top-mass dependence. We demonstrate that the rapidity divergence is the one predicted by the BFKL factorization and perform the explicit subtraction in the BFKL scheme. We show that the IR-structure of the impact factor is the expected one and that, in the infinite-top-mass approximation, the previously known result is recovered. We also verify that the impact factor vanishes when the transverse momenta of the $t$-channel Reggeon goes to zero, in agreement with its gauge-invariant definition, exploiting the $m_t \rightarrow \infty$ expansion up to the next-to-next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of collinear factorisation in the photoproduction of a $ \pi ^{0}\gamma $ pair with large invariant mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a $ 2 \to 3 $ exclusive process, where collinear factorisation is broken, namely the exclusive photoproduction of a $ \pi ^{0}\gamma $ pair with large invariant mass. This occurs because the process suffers from gluon exchanges trapped in the Glauber region. Using an explicit example, we show that the Glauber gluon, which is exchanged between a collinear spectator parton from the nucleon sector and a soft spectator parton from the outgoing pion, has both of its lightcone plus and minus components pinched. Therefore, it cannot be deformed to collinear/soft regions, as is often the case for processes that do factorise. We further confirm the leading power behaviour of the identified Glauber region, highlighting that this is the case although it relies on extracting a soft parton from the outgoing pion. We stress that the Glauber pinch for this process is of the leading power, due to the possibility of having two-gluon exchanges between the collinear nucleon sector and hard partonic scattering sub-process. In fact, the Glauber gluon that we identify is one of these two active gluons, and therefore, its effects are observed already at leading order. A direct consequence of our work is that collinear factorisation breaks in the same way for other $ 2 \to 3 $ exclusive processes, where two-gluon exchanges in the $ t $-channel are possible, like in the exclusive production of a photon pair from $ \pi ^{0} N $ collisions. However, we highlight that in cases where such two-gluon exchanges do not exist, like in the exclusive $ \pi ^{\pm}\gamma $ photoproduction, the Glauber exchanges that we discuss here do not occur, and hence they do not suffer from factorisation breaking effects.</description>

      <title>Octant Ambiguity in the Presence of Non-isotropic Lorentz Invariance Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global analyses of neutrino data suggest that the mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ is likely to be nonmaximal with two closely matched solutions emerging: one representing a smaller angle ($\theta_{23}$ &lt; $\pi/4$) and the other a larger angle ($\theta_{23}$ &gt; $\pi/4$). This ambiguity, known as the octant ambiguity of $\theta_{23}$, presents a significant challenge in neutrino research and is a primary objective of future long-baseline experiments. In this study, for the first time, we explore how non-isotropic Lorentz violation affects measurements of mixing angle $\theta_{23}$, with a particular emphasis on sidereal effects in the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment. Our findings reveal that ability of DUNE to resolve the octant ambiguity is significantly compromised in the presence of the $c^{xy}_{e \tau}$ parameter. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LIV exacerbates the degeneracy between the Dirac CP-phase $\delta_{cp}$ and $\theta_{23}$.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Lensing Due to Schwarzchild Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a powerful concept in the Astrophysics to study black holes. The gravitational field of a massive object like a galaxy or black hole bends and magnifies the light from a distant object behind it. The Schwarzchild black hole that are the simplest type of black hole, having no charge or angular momentum have been useful to observe the gravitational lensing. In the presented work, Schwarzchild black hole has been simulated keeping the spiral, elliptical, lenticular and irregular galaxies at the background to obtain the gravitational lensing.</description>

      <title>Complete 1-loop study of exclusive $ J/\psi $ and $ \Upsilon $ photoproduction with full GPD evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the exclusive photoproduction of a heavy vector quarkonium, namely $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ at 1-loop in $\alpha_s$. In collinear factorisation (CF), the amplitude for such a process is obtained by the convolution of a hard partonic sub-amplitude, with a universal generalised parton distribution (GPD). For the first time, we perform a complete calculation at 1-loop including full leading-log (LL) GPD evolution. We first demonstrate the huge instability of the cross section at high energies when the factorisation scale $\mu_F$ is varied. This instability has been reported previously in the literature, and occurs due to the large logarithms generated by the huge difference between the hard scale of the process, which is the mass of the heavy quarkonium here, and the centre-of-mass energy of the process. This problem was also reported in inclusive heavy vector quarkonium photoproduction. We show that this issue can be resolved by resumming these large logarithms using high-energy factorisation (HEF), by performing a matching with the result in CF using the doubly logarithmic approximation (DLA) in order to be consistent with the fixed order evolution of GPDs. Finally, we show that the cross sections obtained from such a matching, besides being free from the previously mentioned factorisation scale variation instabilities, are consistent with the H1 data for $J/\psi$ production and with the ZEUS data for $\Upsilon$ production.</description>

      <title>Solving bound-state equations in $\text{QCD}_2$ with bosonic and fermionic quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the bound-state equations (BSEs) in two-dimensional QCD in the $N_c\to \infty$ limit, viewed from both the infinite momentum frame (IMF) and the finite momentum frame (FMF). The BSE of a meson in the original 't Hooft model, {\it viz.}, spinor $\text{QCD}_2$ containing only fermionc quarks, has been extensively studied in literature. In this work, we focus on the BSEs pertaining to two types of ``exotic" hadrons, a ``tetraquark" which is composed of a bosonic quark and bosonic antiquark, and a ``baryon" which is composed of a bosonic antiquark and a fermionic quark. Utilizing the Hamiltonian approach, we derive the corresponding BSEs for both types of ``exotic" hadrons, from the perspectives of the light-front and equal-time quantization, and confirm the known results. The recently available BSEs for ``tetraquark" in FMF has also been recovered with the aid of the diagrammatic approach. For the first time we also present the BSEs of a ``baryon" in FMF in the extended 't Hooft model. By solving various BSEs numerically, we obtain the mass spectra pertaining to ``tetraquark" and ``baryon" and the corresponding bound-state wave functions of the lowest-lying states. It is numerically demonstrated that, when a ``tetraquark" or ``baryon" is continuously boosted, the forward-moving component of the bound-state wave function approaches the corresponding light-cone wave function, while the backward-moving component fades away.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic radiation by electrically charged fermions embedded in a rotating medium in an external magnetic field. We compute the dependence of the radiation intensity on the angular velocity $\Omega$ of the rotating medium for fermion polarizations along and opposite the magnetic field direction in intense subcritical fields. The polarization dependence of the photon radiation results in the Sokolov--Ternov effect -- the radiative polarization of fermions. We study the dependence of the degree of polarziation on $\Omega$. We found that rotation significantly changes the degree of polarization. We show that the rotating quark-gluon plasma acquires a finite magnetic moment that exhibits complex dependence on $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Negative non-Gaussianity as a salvager for PBHs with PTAs in bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity in the primordial curvature perturbation is a crucial element of the early universe due to its significant impact on the primordial black hole (PBH) production. In this work, we focus on the effects of negative non-Gaussianity on PBH abundance through the lens of the compaction function criterion for PBH formation. Our setup utilizes an effective field theory of non-singular bounce, including the standard slow-roll inflation with an ultra-slow roll phase for amplifying the curvature perturbations to form PBHs. We investigate with two separate values of the non-Gaussianity parameter, $f_{\rm NL}=(-39.95,-35/8)$, found within the ekpyrotic contraction and the matter bounce scenarios, respectively, and show that a negatively large amount of $f_{\rm NL}$ can provide sizeable abundance, $10^{-3}\leq f_{\rm PBH}\leq 1$, and completely mitigates the PBH overproduction issue. We also highlight that the case with the effective sound speed $c_{s}=1$, coupled with $f_{\rm NL}=-39.95$, provides an agreement under $1\sigma$ for the scalar-induced gravitational wave explanation of the latest PTA (NANOGrav15 and EPTA) signal. Lastly, we extract an upper bound on the most negative value of, $f_{\rm NL}\sim -60$, below which we show breaching of the underlying perturbativity constraints on the power spectrum amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform high-statistics simulations to study the impacts of nuclear structure on the ratios of anisotropic flow observables in $^{208}$Pb+$^{208}$Pb and $^{129}$Xe+$^{129}$Xe collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Even with $40\%$ difference in atomic numbers between $^{208}$Pb and $^{129}$Xe nuclei, the ratios of anisotropic flow in the same centrality class between the two collision systems are strongly affected by the nuclear structure inputs in the initial state. The ratios of $v_2\{4\}/v_2\{2\}$ in these collisions are sensitive to the nuclear skin thickness of the colliding nuclei, providing indirect constraints on the nuclei's neutron skin. Our model predictions serve as a benchmark to compare with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>An alternative idea about the source of baryon asymmetry in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper proposes an alternative scenario for the emergence of baryon asymmetry in the Universe. This scenario is realized in the lattice gravity model associated with the Dirac field as follows. At ultra-high temperatures of the Grand Unification order $T_c\sim10^{18}$ GeV and higher, the system is in a PT-symmetric phase. But when the temperature decreases, a phase transition to an asymmetric phase occurs, in which a non-zero tetrad appears, that is, space-time with the Minkowski metric, and the system's wave function splits into two: $|\rangle=|+\rangle+|-\rangle$. The fields of tetrads in states $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$ differ in sign. At the very first moment of time with a duration of the order of the Planck time, a transition of fermions between these states is possible. These transitions in different parts of space are not correlated with each other. Therefore, the final asymmetry of the fermion charge between these states is relatively extremely small and it is preserved in time, since the interaction of the states $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$ ceases at times greater than the Planck time.</description>

      <title>A Novel Proposal for Exploring Spacetime Microstructure with Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of physics at the Planck scale has garnered significant attention due to its implications for understanding the fundamental nature of the universe. At this scale, quantum fluctuations in spacetime become apparent, as suggested by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. These fluctuations indicate that spacetime is not a smooth manifold but rather has a more complex structure that might be fractal-like, exhibiting self-similarity across different scales. This study investigates the scaling behavior of spacetime microstructure at the Planck scale. By introducing the concept of self-similar spacetime microelement measurements, a scaling-characterized metric tensor is derived from analyzing the Lorentz scalar line element, which imposes constraints on spacetime dimensions and components. In linear scale measurements of spacetime, equivalent equations - such as the geodesic equations, Einstein field equations, Klein-Gordon equation, and Dirac equation - can be expressed in scaling form. Notably, the golden ratio naturally appears in the microstructure of linear scale measurements, suggesting a potential explanation for the Planck length's significance. This work provides insights into quantum fluctuations and proposes modifications to classical geometric intuitions, potentially advancing our understanding of the microstructure of spacetime.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the stabilization of multiple moduli by utilizing Siegel modular forms in the framework of $Sp(2g,\mathbb{Z})$ modular invariant theories. We derive the stationary conditions at CP-conserving fixed points for a generic modular- and CP-invariant scalar potential. The stabilization of multiple moduli is explicitly demonstrated in $Sp(4,\mathbb{Z})$ and $Sp(6,\mathbb{Z})$ modular invariant scalar potentials. Furthermore, it turns out that there exists a light axion when the moduli are stabilized nearby a fixed point.</description>

Abstract: The consistency of string theory as a theory of gravity does not rely on the presence of spacetime supersymmetry; however, its absence leads to the emergence of tadpole diagrams in the on-shell worldsheet formulation, thus undermining our control over the physics. Two-dimensional conformal invariance, a pillar of string theory, requires tadpole subtraction through the Fischler-Susskind mechanism, whose spacetime consequence is the emergence of scalar tadpole potentials. In this thesis, I explore several implications of the absence of supersymmetry in string-derived scenarios. I focus on the three ten-dimensional tachyon-free string theories in which spacetime supersymmetry is absent or broken, studying the gravitational consequences of tadpole potentials. First, I address vacuum solutions in terms of singular codimension-one vacua, explore their generalizations, and discuss the properties of their singular boundaries. I present an alternative perspective on these vacua based on the formalism of fake supersymmetry, in which the second-order equations of motion are replaced by supersymmetry-like first-order equations. I then turn to the topic of engineering vacua in the non-supersymmetric string models by constructing solutions that are supported by electric and magnetic fluxes and by providing evidence for their instability. Finally, I investigate brane-like solutions in the presence of tadpole potentials that yield both flux vacua with the isometries of supersymmetric branes and gravitational profiles that capture the backreaction of localized sources.</description>

      <title>The density of states method for symplectic gauge theories at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature behaviour of the $Sp(4)$ Yang-Mills lattice theory in four dimensions, by applying the Logarithmic Linear Relaxation (LLR) algorithm. We demonstrate the presence of coexisting (metastable) phases, when the system is in the proximity of the transition. We measure observables such as the free energy, the expectation value of the plaquette operator and of the Polyakov loop, as well as the specific heat, and the Binder cumulant. We use these results to obtain a high-precision measurement of the critical coupling at the confinement-deconfinement transition, and assess its systematic uncertainty, for one value of the lattice extent in the time direction. Furthermore, we perform an extensive study of the finite-volume behaviour of the lattice system, by repeating the measurements for fixed lattice time extent, while increasing the spatial size of the lattice. We hence characterise the first-order transition on the lattice, and present the first results in the literature on this theory for the infinite volume extrapolation of lattice quantities related to latent heat and interface tension.
  Gauge theories with $Sp(4)$ group have been proposed as new dark sectors to provide a fundamental origin for the current phenomenological evidence of dark matter. A phase transition at high temperature, in such a new dark sector, occurring in the early universe, might have left a relic stochastic background of gravitational waves. Our results represent a milestone toward establishing whether such a new physics signal is detectable in future experiments, as they enter the calculation of the parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, controlling the power spectrum of gravitational waves. We also outline the process needed in the continuum extrapolation of our measurements, and test its feasibility on one additional choice of temporal extent of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of dense matter equation of state of neutron star with antikaon condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Density Dependent Relativistic Hadron (DDRH) field theoretical Model in a Bayesian analysis to investigate the equation of state (EOS) of dense matter featuring antikaon condensation for $K^-$ and $\bar{K}^0$ inside neutron stars. The vector coupling parameters within the kaonic sector are determined through the iso-spin counting rule and quark model. Our study integrates various constraints, including $\chi$EFT calculations, nuclear saturation properties, and astrophysical observations from pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+66 and from the GW170817 event. We present posterior distributions of model parameters derived from these constraints, enabling us to explore the distributions of nuclear matter properties and neutron star (NS) characteristics such as radii, tidal deformabilities, central energy densities, and speed of sound. The antikaon potential at the 68(90)\% confidence intervals is determined to be $-129.36^{+12.53(+32.617)}_{-3.837(-5.696)}$ MeV. This aligns with several studies providing estimates within the range of $-120$ to $-150$ MeV. We find that the maximum neutron star mass is constrained to around 2M$_\odot$ due to the significant softening of the EOS caused by antikaon condensation. This softening results in a considerable decrease in the speed of sound. Although antikaon condensation for $K^-$ is not feasible inside the canonical neutron stars, it becomes feasible for higher NS masses. The condensation of both $K^-$ and $\bar{K}^0$ is probably present in the interior of neutron star with mass greater than 2M$_\odot$. We also discuss the interconnections among input variables, isoscalar and isovector aspects of the EOS, and specific NS properties in the context of antikaon condensation.</description>

      <title>The GD-1 stellar stream perturber as a core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GD-1 stellar stream exhibits spur and gap structures that may result from a close encounter with a dense substructure. When interpreted as a dark matter subhalo, the perturber is denser than predicted in the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model. In self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), however, a halo could evolve into a phase of gravothermal collapse, resulting in a higher central density than its CDM counterpart. We conduct high-resolution controlled N-body simulations to show that a collapsed SIDM halo could account for the GD-1 perturber's high density. We model a progenitor halo with a mass of $3\times10^8~M_\odot$, motivated by a cosmological simulation of a Milky Way analog, and evolve it in the Milky Way's tidal field. For a cross section per mass of $\sigma/m\approx30-100~{\rm cm^2~g^{-1}}$ at $V_{\rm max }\sim10~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$, the enclosed mass of the SIDM halo within the inner $10~{\rm pc}$ can be increased by more than an order of magnitude compared to its CDM counterpart, leading to a good agreement with the properties of the GD-1 perturber. Our findings indicate that stellar streams provide a novel probe into the self-interacting nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>On the simultaneity of Forbush decreases: the simultaneous effects of interplanetary parameters and geomagnetic activity indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forbush decreases (Fd) are transient, short-term reductions in the intensity of galactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth's surface. When this reduction is observed at multiple locations at the same time, it is referred to as simultaneous Forbush decreases (SFd). Identifying Fd events in daily averaged Cosmic ray (CR) raw data is always tedious, but the task has gone minimal through an algorithm (automated Fd detection). We deployed an automated Fd location algorithm on daily-averaged CR data from five neutron monitor stations covering the period 1998 to 2006. We identified 80 days with the most simultaneous events. While there exists extensive research on the subject using a case study approach, the current study is statistical. Whereas most of the previous investigations employed a small sample of Fds manually selected from a single CR station, large samples of Fds, selected after disentangling the Sun's influence on CR data from multiple neutron monitors (MNs) are used. The connection between the Fds and many solar-terrestrial variables is tested. The beautiful and consistent results obtained between the space weather variables and Fds at the five NM stations call the attention of space weather researchers to the need for rigorous, detailed, and accurate cataloging of Fds. Solar cycle oscillation significantly impacts the amplitude and timing of Fds. Its influence should be removed before Fd selection.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic study of the $ \Omega \alpha $ interaction in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-particle momentum correlation between the Omega-baryon ($\Omega$) and the $^{4}He (\alpha) $ in high-energy heavy ion collisions is explored.
  Such correlations as an alternative source of information can help us further understand the interaction between $ \Omega $ and nucleons (N).
  $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials in the single-folding potential approach are constructed by employing two different available $\Omega N $ interactions in $^{5}S_{2}$ channel, i.e, one is based on the (2 + 1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations near the physical point by the HAL QCD collaboration, and another is based on the meson exchanges with effective Lagrangian, where in the latter case coupled channels effect is considered.
  It is found that the correlation functions at small size source depends on the used potential model. This implicitly means that at high density nuclear medium, $ \Omega \alpha $ momentum correlation could drive the feature of $ \Omega N $ interactions.
  Moreover, by extracting the scattering length and the effective range from obtained $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials, the correlation functions are calculated within the Lednicky-Lyuboshits (LL) formalism.
  It is shown that since the $\Omega\alpha $ has large interaction range, the LL formula leads to different results at small source size.</description>

      <title>Probing Lambda-Gravity with Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a precise test of two fundamental gravitational constants using a novel detector concept that exploits the dynamics of quantum phononic excitations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), operable at the scale of table-top experiments. In this setup, the sensitivity is enhanced by approximately two orders of magnitude through the use of a tritter operation, which mixes phononic excitations with the BEC's ground state. The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\Lambda r^2$. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by two orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment could establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\Lambda$ at $&lt;10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behaviour of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a novel means to test modified gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: We establish the anisotropic hydrodynamics (aHydro) equations based on a boost-non-invariant longitudinally expanding system. Good consistency is found in the comparison between the aHydro results with those from the Boltzmann equation under relaxation time approximation. We also obtain corresponding attractor solution and observe the time delay of convergence when increasing the absolute value of the rapidity. We finally show that the rapidity dependence is solved by introducing the redefined attractor variables to compensate the time delay effect.</description>

Abstract: The MAgnetized Disk and Mirror Axion eXperiment (MADMAX) is a future experiment aiming to detect dark matter axions from the galactic halo by resonant conversion to photons in a strong magnetic field. It uses a stack of dielectric disks in front of a mirror, called booster, to enhance the potential signal from axion-photon conversion over a significant mass range. Several small scale prototype systems have been developed and tested to verify the experimental principles. The current status of the experiment and its prototypes, including the ongoing research and development and remaining challenges, are presented in this contribution.</description>

Abstract: According to the microscopic formulation of Landauer's principle, when information is deleted the Von Neumann entropy of the system gets reduced with a corresponding energy cost. Although within the same perspective the growth of the entropy should remain unconstrained we show that during quantum amplification the heat flow does restrict the increase of the Von Neumann entropy. When applied to the case of relic gravitons (with frequencies between the aHz region and the THz domain) the bounds obtained here set a limit on initial thermal gravitons and on the total duration of inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an $\mathrm{SO}(10)$ grand unification scenario where the complex 10-dimensional scalar multiplet, containing the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, resides at the TeV scale altogether. The resulting low-energy model is a 2-Higgs-doublet model augmented with two $S_1$-type leptoquarks. The gauge-coupling unification is achieved with only one intermediate scale at which the Pati-Salam gauge group is broken down to the SM. Proton stability is ensured by a discrete symmetry, leftover from the breaking of the U(1)$_{\mathrm{PQ}}$ global symmetry. The axion corresponding to this broken U(1)$_{\mathrm{PQ}}$ provides a solution to the strong CP problem, and also serves as an important dark matter candidate. We discuss how the simultaneous explanation for the $R_{D^{(*)}}$ and $a_\mu$ anomalies comes about in the model, and investigate some of its phenomenological implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass-induced neutrino oscillation is a well established phenomenon that is based on the unitary mixing among three light active neutrinos. Remarkable precision on neutrino mixing parameters over the last decade or so has opened up the prospects for testing the possible non-unitarity of the standard 3$\nu$ mixing matrix, which may arise in the seesaw extensions of the Standard Model due to the admixture of three light active neutrinos with heavy isosinglet neutrinos. Because of this non-unitary neutrino mixing (NUNM), the oscillation probabilities among the three active neutrinos would be altered as compared to the probabilities obtained assuming a unitary 3$\nu$ mixing matrix. In such a NUNM scenario, neutrinos can experience an additional matter effect due to the neutral current interactions with the ambient neutrons. Atmospheric neutrinos having access to a wide range of energies and baselines can experience a significant modifications in Earth's matter effect due to NUNM. In this paper, we study in detail how the NUNM parameter $\alpha_{32}$ affects the muon neutrino and antineutrino survival probabilities in a different way. Then, we place a comparable and complementary constraint on $\alpha_{32}$ in a model independent fashion using the proposed 50 kt magnetized Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector under the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) project, which can efficiently detect the atmospheric $\nu_\mu$ and $\bar\nu_\mu$ separately in the multi-GeV energy range. Further, we discuss the advantage of charge identification capability of ICAL and the impact of uncertainties in oscillation parameters while constraining $\alpha_{32}$. We also compare the $\alpha_{32}$ sensitivity of ICAL with that of future long-baseline experiments DUNE and T2HK in isolation and combination.</description>

      <title>Complete electroweak O(Nc^2) two-loop contributions to the Higgs boson masses in the MSSM and aspects of two-loop renormalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results for the full electroweak two-loop contributions of O(Nc^2), where Nc is the colour factor, to the Higgs-boson masses in the MSSM are obtained using a Feynman-diagrammatic approach including the full dependence on the external momentum. These corrections are expected to constitute the dominant part of the two-loop corrections that were still missing up to now. As a consequence of working at O(Nc^2), the relevant two-loop self-energies decompose into products of one-loop integrals, giving rise to a transparent analytical structure of the self-energies. We compare different renormalisation schemes for tanb, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, and demonstrate under which conditions different renormalisation schemes can be related to each other via a simple reparametrisation. We explicitly show that this is in general not possible for mixed renormalisation schemes due to the presence of evanescent terms. In our numerical analysis, the new corrections are compared with already known two-loop contributions and the experimental uncertainty of the mass of the observed Higgs boson. While smaller than the already known two-loop corrections, the new terms are typically larger in size than the experimental uncertainty. This underlines the relevance of the so-far unknown electroweak two-loop contributions.</description>

      <title>Estimate for the bulk viscosity of strongly coupled quark matter using perturbative QCD and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star mergers require knowledge not only of the equilibrium properties of strongly interacting matter, but also of the system's response to perturbations, encoded in various transport coefficients. Using perturbative and holographic tools, we derive here an improved weak-coupling and a new strong-coupling result for the most important transport coefficient of unpaired quark matter, its bulk viscosity. These results are combined in a simple analytic pocket formula for the quantity that is rooted in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics at high densities but takes into account nonperturbative holographic input at neutron-star densities, where the system is strongly coupled. This expression can be used in the modeling of unpaired quark matter at astrophysically relevant temperatures and densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning, particularly deep neural networks, has been widely used in high-energy physics, demonstrating remarkable results in various applications. Furthermore, the extension of machine learning to quantum computers has given rise to the emerging field of quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose the Quantum Complete Graph Neural Network (QCGNN), which is a variational quantum algorithm based model designed for learning on complete graphs. QCGNN with deep parametrized operators offers a polynomial speedup over its classical and quantum counterparts, leveraging the property of quantum parallelism. We investigate the application of QCGNN with the challenging task of jet discrimination, where the jets are represented as complete graphs. Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis with classical models to establish a performance benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a class of supersymmetric (SUSY) GUT models that can explain the apparent discrepancy between the SM predictions and experimental values of muon g-2 while providing testable signals for lepton flavor violation in charged lepton decays. Moreover, these models predict LSP neutralino abundance that is compatible with the Planck dark matter bounds. We find that scenarios in the framework of $SU(4)_c\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ unification, with additional symmetries to explain fermion masses and neutrino oscillations, provide interesting benchmarks for the search of SUSY by correlating a possible manifestation of it in dark matter, rare lepton decays and LHC signals.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of post-fragmentation reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After cosmic inflation, coherent oscillations of the inflaton field about a monomial potential $V(\phi)\sim \phi^k$ result in an expansion phase characterized by a stiff equation-of-state $w\simeq(k-2)/(k+2)$. Sourced by the oscillating inflaton condensate, parametric (self)resonant effects can induce the exponential growth of inhomogeneities eventually backreacting and leading to the fragmentation of the condensate. In this work, we investigate realizations of inflation giving rise to such dynamics, assuming an inflaton weakly coupled to its decay products. As a result, the transition to a radiation-dominated universe, i.e. reheating, occurs after fragmentation. We estimate the consequences on the production of gravitational waves by computing the contribution induced by the stiff equation-of-state era in addition to the signal generated by the fragmentation process for $k=4,6,8,10$. We find that the signal generated during the fragmentation process gives a larger contribution than the one induced by the stiff equation-of-state era in given frequency ranges for all values of $k$. Our results are independent of the reheating temperature provided that reheating is achieved posterior to fragmentation. Our work shows that the dynamics of such weakly-coupled inflaton scenario can actually result in characteristic gravitational wave spectra with frequencies from Hz to GHz, in the reach of future gravitational wave observatories, in addition to the complementarity between upcoming detectors in discriminating (post)inflation scenarios. We advocate the need of developing high-frequency gravitational wave detectors to gain insight into the dynamics of inflation and reheating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of a one-boson-exchange model, we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the $\Xi_cN/\Lambda_c\Sigma/\Xi_c^{\prime}N/\Sigma_c\Lambda/\Xi_c^*N/\Sigma_c^*\Lambda/\Sigma_c\Sigma/\Sigma_c^*\Sigma$ interactions. We consider the $S$-$D$-wave mixing effects and the coupled-channel effects to derive the relevant effective potentials. Our results can predict several possible charm-strange deuteronlike $\Xi_c^{(',*)}N$ hexaquarks, the $\Xi_c^{\prime}N$ molecules with $I(I^P)=0(0^+)$, $0(1^+)$, $1(1^+)$, the $\Xi_c^*N$ molecules with $0(1^+)$, $0(2^+)$, $1(2^+)$, and the coupled $\Xi_cN/\Xi_c^{\prime}N/\Xi_c^*N/\Sigma_c\Sigma/\Sigma_c^*\Sigma$ molecule with $0(1^+)$. We expect the experiments to search for our predictions of the $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}N$ bound states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral trajectories of dynamically generated resonances are intimately connected to the SU(3) breaking pattern and their nature. From an analysis of a recent LQCD simulation on the $\pi\Sigma-\bar{K}N$ scattering for $I=0$ and the study of the quark mass dependence of the octet baryon masses, we determine for the first time unambiguously the trajectories of the two poles associated to the $\Lambda(1405)$ towards the symmetric point over the $\mathrm{Tr}[M]=C$ trajectory accurately. At $m_\pi\simeq 200$ MeV, our results are consistent with the lattice simulations, and the extrapolations to the physical point, based on the NLO chiral Lagrangians, agree well with existing experimental analyses. We predict qualitatively similar trajectories at LO and up to NLO, consistent with the LO interaction's dominance. At the SU(3) symmetric point up to NLO in this trajectory, the lower pole is located at $E^{(1)}=1583(5)(1)$ MeV, being dominantly a SU(3) singlet, while the higher pole belongs to the octet representation with a mass of $E^{(8)}=1585(8)(2)$ MeV. We also make predictions on the evolution of the two poles over the $m_s=m_{s,\mathrm{phy}}$ trajectory. This can be tested in future LQCD simulations and experimental measurements.</description>

Abstract: The exact analytic form of cross sections including initial state radiation with Kuraev-Fadin radiative function are obtained for $e^+e^-$ annihilation around a resonance. Despite accounting for vacuum polarization and center-of-mass energy spread effects, the precision remains below 0.1\%, meeting the accuracy requirements of quantum electrodynamics corrections up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^2)$. The analytic forms lead to an enhancement in the precision of experimental measurements of physical parameters, such as branching fractions, and demonstrate significantly improved computational efficiency in the regression procedures.</description>

      <title>Targeting (Pseudo)-Scalar CP Violation with $B_s \to \mu^+\mu^-$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The leptonic decay $B_s \to \mu^+\mu^-$ is both rare and theoretically clean, making it an excellent probe for New Physics searches. Due to its helicity suppression in the Standard Model, this decay is particularly sensitive to new (pseudo)-scalar contributions. We present a new strategy for detecting CP-violating New Physics contributions of this kind, exploiting two observables: $\mathcal{A}_{\Delta\Gamma_s}^{\mu\mu}$, which is accessible due to the sizeable decay width difference of the $B_s$ system, and the mixing-induced CP asymmetry $\mathcal{S}_{\mu\mu}$. The strategy also uses information from $B\to K^{(*)} \mu^+\mu^-$ and $B_s\to \phi \mu^+\mu^-$ decays. We find remarkably constrained regions in the $\mathcal{A}_{\Delta\Gamma_s}^{\mu\mu}$-$\mathcal{S}_{\mu\mu}$ plane that serve as promising targets for future measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine how the existence of a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) influences cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) for spin-0 and spin-1 particles. In addition to the known effects of particle production and entropy dilution resulting from PBH evaporation, we find that the generation of dark matter (DM) through CGPP is profoundly influenced by a possible era of PBH matter domination. This early matter dominated era results in an enhancement of the particle spectrum from CGPP. Specifically, it amplifies the peak comoving momentum $k_\star$ for spin-1 DM, while enhancing the plateau of the spectrum for minimally coupled spin-0 particles for low comoving momenta. At the same time, the large entropy dilution may partially or completely compensate for the increase of the spectrum and strongly mitigates the DM abundance produced by CGPP. Our results show that, in the computation of the final abundance, CGPP and PBH evaporation cannot be disentangled, but the parameters of both sectors must be considered together to obtain the final result. Furthermore, we explore the potential formation of PBHs from density fluctuations arising from CGPP and the associated challenges in such a scenario.</description>

      <title>Heavy baryons in the relativized quark model with chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the work of Capstick and Isgur [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.34.2809}{Phys.~Rev.~D~34,~2809~(1986)}], we systematically study the mass spectrum of the heavy baryons in the relativized quark potential model with chromodynamics. Besides the original Godfrey-Isgur (GI) model, we also adopt a modified GI model which replaces the linear confinement by a screened one. The two models give similar results in our work. All heavy baryons observed so far can be explained as three-quark states. In particular, we identify the $\Omega_{c}(3000)$/$\Omega_{b}(6316)$, $\Omega_{c}(3050)$/$\Omega_{b}(6330)$, $\Omega_{c}(3065)$/$\Omega_{b}(6340)$ and $\Omega_{c}(3090)$/$\Omega_{b}(6350)$ states as the $p_{\lambda}$ excitations with quantum numbers $1/2^{-}$, $3/2^{-}$, $3/2^{-}$ and $5/2^{-}$. The $\Omega_{c}(3120)$ is a $3/2^{-}$ state with the $p_{\rho}$ excitation, whose bottom partner is predicted to be $\Omega_{b}(6446/6457,3/2^{-})$. The higher state $\Omega_{c}(3188)$ is the $2s_{\lambda}$ excitation with quantum numbers $1/2^{+}$, and $\Omega_{c}(3327)$ is a $d_{\lambda}$ excitation with quantum numbers $3/2^{+}$ or $5/2^{+}$. In addition, the $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ with quantum numbers $J^{P}=3/2^{-}$ could be explained as the $p_{\rho}$ excitation.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino fast flavor evolution. Part I. Linear response theory and stability conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino-neutrino refraction leads to collective flavor evolution that can include fast flavor conversion, an ingredient still missing in numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae. We provide a theoretical framework for the linear regime of this phenomenon using the language of response theory. In analogy to electromagnetic waves, we introduce a flavor susceptibility as the linear response to an external flavor field. By requiring self-consistency, this approach leads to the usual dispersion relation for growing modes, but differs from the traditional treatment in that it predicts Landau damping of subluminal collective modes. The new dispersion relation has definite analyticity properties and can be expanded for small growth rates. This approach simplifies and intuitively explains Morinaga's proof of sufficiency for the occurrence of growing modes. We show that weakly growing modes arise as soon as an angular crossing is formed, due to their resonant interaction with individual neutrino modes. For longitudinal plasma waves, a similar resonance causes Landau damping or conversely, the two-stream instability.</description>

Abstract: We build upon the intriguing possibility that the recently reported nano-Hz gravitational wave signal by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments is sourced by a strong first-order phase transition from a nearly conformal dark sector. The phase transition has to be strongly supercooled to explain the signal amplitude, while the critical temperature has to be in the $\cal{O}$(GeV) range, as dictated by the peak frequency of the gravitational wave spectrum. However, the resulting strong supercooling exponentially dilutes away any pre-existing baryon asymmetry and dark matter, calling for a new paradigm of their productions. We then develop a mechanism of cold darkogenesis that generates a dark asymmetry during the phase transition from the textured dark $SU(2)_{\rm D}$ Higgs field. This dark asymmetry is transferred to the visible sector via neutron portal interactions, resulting in the observed baryon asymmetry. Furthermore, the mechanism naturally leads to the correct abundance of asymmetric dark matter, with self-interaction of the scale that is of the right order to solve the diversity problem in galactic rotation curves. Collider searches for mono-jets and dark matter direct detection experiments can dictate the viability of the model.</description>

Abstract: Using the one-boson-exchange model, we investigate the interactions between the doubly charmed baryon $\Xi_{cc}(3621)$ and the $S-$wave (anti-)kaon accounting for the $S-D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects. We find the coupled $\Xi_{cc}K/\Xi_{cc}K^*$ state with $I(J^P)=0(1/2^-)$, the $\Xi_{cc}K^*$ state with $0(1/2^-)$, the $\Xi_{cc}\bar{K}$ state with $0(1/2^-)$, and the $\Xi_{cc}\bar{K}^*$ states with $0(1/2^-,3/2^-)$ can be recommended as good doubly charmed molecular candidates with strangeness $|S|=1$. We further examine their M1 radiative decay behaviors and magnetic moments within the constituent quark model framework. This information can enhance our understanding of their inner structures, including the distribution of electric charge and the orientation of the constituent quarks' spins.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of ultralight bosons around compact objects: in-medium suppression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixing between ultralight bosons and the Standard Model photon may allow access to the hitherto invisible Universe. In the presence of plasma, photons are dressed with an effective mass which will influence the conversion between the two. We study this phenomenon, known as in-medium suppression, in the context of black hole physics. We consider both axion-photon mixing around charged black holes and dark photon-photon mixing around neutral black holes. We find that the presence of plasma indeed influences the conversion rate, possibly quenching it altogether for large plasma densities, and discuss implications for superradiance and observational signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the explicit form of the Regge trajectory relations for the triply heavy bottom-charm baryons, which can be applied to investigate both the $\lambda$-mode excited states and the $\rho$-mode excited states. We estimate the masses of the $\lambda$-excited states and the $\rho$-excited states. The results are in agreement with other theoretical predictions. Both the $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories are discussed. Moreover, the behaviors of the $\lambda$- and $\rho$-trajectories for various baryons are discussed. It is shown that both the $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories for baryons are concave downwards in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane. The Regge trajectories for the light baryons are approximately linear and become concave as the masses of the light constituents are considered.</description>

      <title>Towards UV Models of Kinetic Mixing and Portal Matter: A More Complex Dark Matter Sector?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01296v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Portal Matter, with both SM and dark charges, induces KM between the $U(1)_D$ dark photon and the SM gauge fields offering an attractive mechanism by which light thermal DM can obtain its observed relic density. If DM is fermionic, the CMB informs us that it must be Majorana/pseudo-Dirac in nature to avoid temperature-independent $s$-wave annihilation to SM states. How does this fit into a more complete picture with the SM? A first step along this path may not lie far away in energy due to the RGE running of the dark gauge coupling which can becomes non-perturbative before the $\sim 10$'s of TeV range. This implies that $U(1)_D$ must become embedded in a non-Abelian group, $G_D$, before this occurs. The breaking of this group then produces the PM masses and the heavy gauge fields associated with $G_D$ lead to new interactions between the SM and the dark sector. In the past we have examined a set of distinctive phenomenological features associated with this setup, based upon a number of simplifying assumptions. It behooves us to explore the impact of these assumptions on the predictions for possible experimental tests of these models. In past analyses we assumed that DM is a VL, complex singlet under $G_D$. If this assumption is relaxed, the dark sector must be augmented by additional fermion(s) and the scalar fields needed to break the symmetries while generating the needed Majorana-like mass terms for the DM. Here we analyze the simplest extension of this kind wherein the DM lies in a VL doublet of $G_D$, which we take to have the structure $SU(2)_I\times U(1)_{Y_I}$, leading to new phenomenology. We find that given the current LHC search constraints on the masses of heavy gauge bosons, the production of these new dark states with large rates is unlikely at colliders unless they are produced singly in $gg$-fusion or are resonantly enhanced.</description>

      <title>Model-independent predictions for decays of double-heavy hadrons into pairs of heavy hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double-heavy hadrons can decay into pairs of heavy hadrons through transitions from confining Born-Oppenheimer potentials to heavy-hadron-pair potentials with the same Born-Oppenheimer quantum numbers. The states of the double-heavy hadron are constrained by a Born-Oppenheimer exclusion principle from the identical heavy quarks. The states of a pair of identical heavy hadrons are constrained by exclusion principles from identical particles. The transitions are also constrained by conservation of angular momentum and parity. From these constraints, we derive model-independent selection rules for decays of double-heavy hadrons into pairs of heavy hadrons. The coupling potentials are expressed as sums of products of Born-Oppenheimer transition amplitudes and angular-momentum coefficients. If there is a single dominant Born-Oppenheimer transition amplitude, it factors out of the coupling potentials between double-heavy hadrons in the same Born-Oppenheimer multiplet and pairs of heavy hadrons in specific heavy-quark-spin-symmetry multiplets and out of the corresponding partial decay rates. As examples, we discuss the Born-Oppenheimer potentials and multiplets for conventional double-heavy baryons and for double-heavy tetraquark mesons. We also discuss the relative partial decay rates for conventional double-heavy baryons into pairs of heavy hadrons.</description>

Abstract: By introducing a Higgs-Dilaton potential, the 2T model has full triggering for a first order electroweak phase transition, namely for the mass of Dilaton between $300 $ GeV and $550$ GeV. We have also compared the transition strengths in the case with and without daisay loops, the difference being always less than $0.2$. The effective Higgs potential has given a sphaleron energy less than $8.4$ TeV. The value of $\beta/H^*$ is larger than $25$ and less than $34$ in all cases that are sufficient to trigger the first order electroweak phase transition. Gravitational wave energy density caused by this transition, may be sufficiently detected by future detectors, could indirectly confirm Dilaton.</description>

      <title>Twin electroweak bubble nucleation and gravitational wave under the $S_3$ symmetry of two-Higgs-doublet model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sphaleron electroweak phase transition (EWPT) is calculated in two phase transition stages, thereby showing that the twin (or double) bubble nucleation structure of the phase transition and gravitational wave is in the investigation area of future detectors. With $v^2=v^2_1+v^2_2$ ($v_1$ and $v_2$ are two vacuum average values (VEV)), the parameter $\tan\beta=v_2/v_1$, is the ratio between two VEVs although it does not affect the strength of EWPT but affect the sphaleron energy. However, it only causes this energy to increase slightly. As $a=v^2/v_2^2$ increases, the maximum difference of sphaleron energy in one stage is about $6.15$ TeV. $a$ affects the expansion of bubbles during two phase transitions. The more $a$ increases, the more the expansion of two bubbles is at the same time. This ratio does not greatly affect the sphaleron energy but has an impact on gravitational waves. The larger the masses of the charged Higgs particles are, the greater the gravitational wave energy density ($\Omega h^2$) is. When the frequency is in the range $0-1.2$ mHz, $\Omega h^2$ will has a maximum value in the range $10^{-12}-10^{-11}$ for all values of $a$ so this can be detected in the future.</description>

Abstract: Cascade parameterization of hadronic reactions is a central tool in hadron spectroscopy for modeling matrix elements and extracting parameters of hadronic states. Implementing the helicity formalism consistently presents challenges, particularly for particles with spin, due to the need for matching spin states of final-state particles, known as the Wigner rotations. This paper discusses these challenges in detail and offers solutions, including a practical method for implementation. Equipped with a general algorithm for computing Wigner rotations, we extend the studies to alternative amplitude formulations, the minus-phi and canonical conventions.</description>

Abstract: After very little memories we review slightly Paul Frampton's memories from the discovery of Veneziano model being indeed string theory with Y. Nambu and secondly his 3-3-1 theory.This latter is an indeed not excluded replacement for the Standard Model with triangle anomalies cancelling as they must in a truly viable theory. It even needs (essentially) 3 as the family number! Also primordial black holes as dark matter is mentioned, we end with review of a my own very speculative utterly recent idea, that for the purpose of the classical approximation, we could, using the functional integral as our rudimentary assumption taken over from quantum mechanics, obtain the equations of motion without the in our opinion very mysterious imaginary unit i, which usually occurs as a factor in the exponent of the functional integrand, which is this i times the action. The functional integral without the mysterious i leads to predicting some of the most strong features in cosmology, and also seems to argue for as little black holes as possible.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino fast flavor conversions. Part II. Solutions at the edge of instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dense neutrino environments, such as provided by core-collapse supernovae or neutron-star mergers, neutrino angular distributions may be unstable to collective flavor conversions, whose outcome remains to be fully understood. These conversions are much faster than hydrodynamical scales, suggesting that self-consistent configurations may never be strongly unstable. With this motivation in mind, we study weakly unstable modes, i.e., those with small growth rates. We show that our newly developed dispersion relation (Paper~I of this series) allows for an expansion in powers of the small growth rate. For weakly unstable distributions, we show that the unstable modes must either move with subluminal phase velocity, or very close to the speed of light. The instability is fed from neutrinos moving resonantly with the waves, allowing us to derive explicit expressions for the growth rate. For axisymmetric distributions, often assumed in the literature, numerical examples show the accuracy of these expressions. We also note that for the often-studied one-dimensional systems one should not forget the axial-symmetry-breaking modes, and we provide explicit expressions for the range of wavenumbers that exhibit instabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In hidden-sector models, axion-like particles (ALPs) can couple to heavy neutral leptons (HNLs), leading to rich phenomenologies. We study ALPs produced from $D$- and $B$-meson decays via quark-flavor-violating couplings, and decaying exclusively into a pair of HNLs which mix with active neutrinos. The ALP can be either short- or long-lived, depending on the masses of the ALP and the HNL, as well as the corresponding coupling strength. Such GeV-scale HNLs are necessarily long-lived given the current bounds on their mixing parameters. We assess the sensitivities of the LHC far detectors and SHiP, to the long-lived HNLs in such theoretical scenarios. We find that for currently allowed values of the ALP couplings, most of these experiments can probe the active-sterile-neutrino mixing parameters multiple orders of magnitude beyond the present bounds, covering large parameter region targeted with the type-I seesaw mechanism. In addition, our results show that compared to the case of a promptly decaying ALP, considering an ALP of longer lifetimes weakens the sensitivities of the considered experiments to the long-lived HNLs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose relativistic Luttinger fermions as a new ingredient for the construction of fundamental quantum field theories. We construct the corresponding Clifford algebra and the spin metric for relativistic invariance of the action using the spin-base invariant formalism. The corresponding minimal spinor has 32 complex components, matching with the degrees of freedom of a standard-model generation including a right-handed neutrino. The resulting fermion fields exhibit a canonical scaling different from Dirac fermions and thus support the construction of novel relativistic and perturbatively renormalizable, interacting quantum field theories. In particular, new asymptotically free self-interacting field theories can be constructed, representing first examples of high-energy complete quantum field theories based on pure matter degrees of freedom. Gauge theories with relativistic Luttinger fermions exhibit a strong paramagnetic dominance, requiring large nonabelian gauge groups to maintain asymptotic freedom. We comment on the possibility to use Luttinger fermions for particle physics model building and the expected naturalness properties of such models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early matter-dominated eras (EMDEs) are a natural feature arising in many models of the early universe and can generate a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) during the transition from an EMDE to the radiation-dominated universe required by the time of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. While there are calculations of the SGWB generated in the linear regime, no detailed study has been made of the nonlinear regime. We perform the first comprehensive calculation of GW production in the nonlinear regime, using a hybrid $N$-body and lattice simulation to study GW production from both a metastable matter species and the radiation produced in its decay. We find that nonlinearities significantly enhance GW production up to frequencies at least as large as the inverse light-crossing time of the largest halos that form prior to reheating. The resulting SGWB is within future observational reach for curvature perturbations as small as those probed in the cosmic microwave background, depending on the reheating temperature. Out-of-equilibrium dynamics could further boost the induced SGWB, while a fully relativistic gravitational treatment is required to resolve the spectrum at even higher frequencies.</description>

      <title>Intermediate inflation in generalized non-minimal derivative coupling model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider intermediate inflation in context of the Generalized Non-Minimal Derivative Coupling (GNMDC) model. In this model, inflation is driven by a canonical scalar field that is coupled not only to gravity but also to the derivative of the scalar field. The GNMDC model introduces new dynamics and features during the inflationary epoch. We find inflationary solutions with a power law scalar field for the power law coupling function. Additionally, we determine the inflaton potential that generates intermediate expansion of the scale factor. We also discuss the background equations in the high friction limit and derive constraints on the parameters of our model. Furthermore, we investigate the cosmological perturbations in the slow roll approximation within the GNMDC model, We calculate the scalar and tensor spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio during the intermediate inflation. We compare the results of this model with the observational data that can be used to test the model using the cosmic microwave background radiation data. Overall, we establish conditions for the inflaton potential that ensure the continuation of accelerated expansion during the slow roll inflation. We numerically analyze the power spectrum and spectral index for scalar and tensor modes in intermediate inflation in the high friction limit. Moreover, we use the Planck 2018 data, to obtain constraints on the parameters of the model. We demonstrate that intermediate inflation in the GNMDC model is successful in evaluation and explanation of the background and perturbational quantities using observational data.</description>

      <title>Thermal production of charm quarks in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal production of charm quarks in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) created in heavy-ion collisions at relativistic energies. Our study is based on the off-shell parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport approach describing the full time evolution of heavy-ion collisions on a microscopic basis with hadronic and partonic degrees of freedom. The sQGP is realized within the effective dynamical quasi-particle model (DQPM) which is adjusted to reproduce the lattice QCD results for the thermodynamic observables of the sQGP. Relying on the fact that the DQPM successfully describes the spatial diffusion coefficients $D_s$ from the lQCD, which control the interaction of charm quarks with thermal partons (expressed in terms of strongly interacting off-shell quasiparticles), we evaluate the production of charm quark pairs through the rotation of Feynman diagrams such that the incoming charm quark and outgoing light parton in elastic scattering diagrams are exchanged. The charm quark annihilation is realized by detailed balance. We find that the number of produced thermal charm quark pairs strongly depends on the charm quark mass in the QGP. While for the heavy charm quarks of mass $m_c=1.8$ GeV it is subdominant compared to the primary charm production by binary nucleon-nucleon collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, the numbers of primary and thermal charm quarks become comparable for a smaller (bare) $m_c=1.2$ GeV. Compared with the experimental data on the $R_{\rm AA}$ of $D$-mesons in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, it is more favorable for charm quarks in the QGP to gain additional mass due to thermal effects rather than to have a low bare mass.</description>

      <title>Searching for cosmological stochastic backgrounds by notching out resolvable compact binary foregrounds with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds can be of either cosmological or astrophysical origin. The detection of an astrophysical stochastic gravitational-wave background with ground-based interferometers is expected in the near future. Perhaps even more excitingly, the detection of stochastic backgrounds of cosmological origin by future ground-based interferometers could reveal invaluable information about the early Universe. From this perspective, the astrophysical background is a {\it foreground} that can prevent the extraction of this information from the data. In this paper, we revisit a time-frequency domain notching procedure previously proposed to remove the astrophysical foreground in the context of next-generation ground-based detectors, but we consider the more realistic scenario where we remove individually detectable signals by taking into account the uncertainty in the estimation of their parameters. We find that time-frequency domain masks can still efficiently remove the astrophysical foreground and suppress it to about $5\%$ of its original level. Further removal of the foreground formed by unresolvable events (in particular, unresolvable binary neutron stars), which is about $10$ times larger than the residual foreground from realistic notching, would require detector sensitivity improvements. Therefore, the main limitation in the search for a cosmological background is the unresolvable foreground itself, and not the residual of the notching procedure.</description>

      <title>Scale setting and hadronic properties in light quark sector with $(2+1)$-flavor Wilson fermions at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report scale setting and hadronic properties for our new lattice QCD gauge configuration set (HAL-conf-2023). We employ $(2+1)$-flavor nonperturbatively improved Wilson fermions with stout smearing and the Iwasaki gauge action on a $96^4$ lattice, and generate configurations of 8,000 trajectories at the physical point. We show the basic properties of the configurations such as the plaquette value, topological charge distribution and their auto-correlation times. The scale setting is performed by detailed analyses of the $\Omega$ baryon mass. We calculate the physical results of quark masses, decay constants of pseudoscalar mesons and single hadron spectra in light quark sector. The masses of the stable hadrons are found to agree with the experimental values within a sub-percent level.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Emulation of Flow in Heavy-Ion Collisions at Intermediate Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applications of new techniques in machine learning are speeding up progress in research in various fields. In this work, we construct and evaluate a deep neural network (DNN) to be used within a Bayesian statistical framework as a faster and more reliable alternative to the Gaussian Process (GP) emulator of an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) transport model simulator of heavy-ion reactions at intermediate beam energies. We found strong evidence of DNN being able to emulate the IBUU simulator's prediction on the strengths of protons' directed and elliptical flow very efficiently even with small training datasets and with accuracy about ten times higher than the GP. Limitations of our present work and future improvements are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A simple explanation of the absence of the spherical nuclei with the hidden-color states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05723v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the EMC effect, the Cd puzzle and the SU3-IBM, a hypothesis can be given for a nucleus, that only the nucleus itself is a trivial (0,0) representation of the SU(3) group, which leads to the simple conclusion that spherical nucleus does not exist and the spherical mean field is not allowed. The key conclusion is that the whole nucleus should have many hidden-color states, and the quark-gluon degrees of freedom are required even at the low-energy excitation of the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on $\Xi\alpha$ correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\Xi$-$^4{\mathrm{He}}$ ($\alpha$) momentum correlation functions in the high-energy nuclear collisions to investigate the nature of the $\Xi N$ interactions. We employ the folding $\Xi \alpha$ potential based on the lattice QCD $\Xi N$ interactions to compute the correlation function. The $\Xi \alpha$ potential supports a Coulomb-assisted bound state ${}^5_{\Xi}\mathrm{H}$ in the $\Xi^-\alpha$ channel, while the $\Xi^0\alpha$ channel is unbound. To examine the sensitivity of the correlation function to the nature of the $\Xi \alpha$ interaction, we vary the potential strength simulating stronger and weaker interactions. The result of the correlation function is sensitive to the existence of the bound state in the $\Xi^0 \alpha$ channel, and the characteristic behavior of the bound state remains also in the $\Xi^-\alpha$ correlation with the Coulomb interaction. The effect of the repulsive core of the $\Xi\alpha$ potential can be found in the correlation from the small source as the distinctive dip in the intermediate momentum region.</description>

      <title>Gauge Loop-String-Hadron Formulation on General Graphs and Applications to Fully Gauge Fixed Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a gauge invariant, Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) based representation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory defined on a general graph consisting of vertices and half-links. Inspired by weak coupling studies, we apply this technique to maximal tree gauge fixing. This allows us to develop a fully gauge fixed representation of the theory in terms of LSH quantum numbers. We explicitly show how the quantum numbers in this formulation directly relate to the variables in the magnetic description. In doing so, we will also explain in detail the way that the Kogut-Susskind formulation, prepotentials, and point splitting, work for general graphs. In the appendix of this work we provide a self-contained exposition of the mathematical details of Hamiltonian pure gauge theories defined on general graphs.</description>
