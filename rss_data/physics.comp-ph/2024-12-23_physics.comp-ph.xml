      <title>Learning charges and long-range interactions from energies and forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of long-range forces is critical in atomistic simulations, as they play a central role in determining the properties of materials and chemical systems. However, standard machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often rely on short-range approximations, limiting their applicability to systems with significant electrostatics and dispersion forces. We recently introduced the Latent Ewald Summation (LES) method, which captures long-range electrostatics without explicitly learning atomic charges or charge equilibration. Extending LES, we incorporate the ability to learn physical partial charges, encode charge states, and the option to impose charge neutrality constraints. We benchmark LES on diverse and challenging systems, including charged molecules, ionic liquid, electrolyte solution, polar dipeptides, surface adsorption, electrolyte/solid interfaces, and solid-solid interfaces. Our results show that LES can effectively infer physical partial charges, dipole and quadrupole moments, as well as achieve better accuracy compared to methods that explicitly learn charges. LES thus provides an efficient, interpretable, and generalizable MLIP framework for simulating complex systems with intricate charge transfer and long-range</description>

      <title>Case Studies of Using the Partial-Structure R1 and the Single-Atom R1 to Assemble Small-Molecule Crystal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how pre-knowledge of a crystal structure, including the constituent fragments, the atomic connectivity, and the approximate bond lengths, etc., can be utilized in the partial-structure R1 (pR1) and the single-atom R1 (sR1) calculations. It has been shown that taking advantage of pre-known information the calculations can proceed in an orderly and well-planned manner. Furthermore, in the case of the sR1 calculation, computer time can also be greatly reduced. Because the pR1 calculation is more time-consuming than the sR1 calculation, when there is a choice between the pR1 and the sR1, the former should be avoided. So, the usual strategy of assembling a light-atom-only structure should start with the normal sR1 method to determine a basic framework of the structure, and then uses the connectivity-guided sR1 method to complete the model. However, when the data resolution is low, the first step is necessary to use the pR1 method to assemble the known fragments. For a heavy-atom-containing structure, the correct strategy starts with the normal sR1 method to determine the heavy-atom substructure, and then uses the connectivity-guided sR1 to complete the model.</description>

      <title>Machine learning assisted canonical sampling (MLACS)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The acceleration of material property calculations while maintaining ab initio accuracy (1 meV/atom) is one of the major challenges in computational physics. In this paper, we introduce a Python package enhancing the computation of (finite temperature) material properties at the ab initio level using machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIP). The Machine-Learning Assisted Canonical Sampling (MLACS) method, grounded in a self-consistent variational approach, iteratively trains a MLIP using an active learning strategy in order to significantly reduce the computational cost of ab initio simulations.
  MLACS offers a modular and user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrates Density Functional Theory (DFT) codes, MLIP potentials, and molecular dynamics packages, enabling a wide range of applications, while maintaining a near-DFT accuracy. These include sampling the canonical ensemble of a system, performing free energy calculations, transition path sampling, and geometry optimization, all by utilizing surrogate MLIP potentials, in place of ab initio calculations.
  This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations and implementation of the MLACS method. We also demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency through various examples, showcasing the capabilities of the MLACS package.</description>

      <title>A Decision Transformer Approach to Grain Boundary Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As microstructure property models improve, additional information from crystallographic degrees of freedom and grain boundary networks (GBNs) can be included in microstructure design problems. However, the high dimensional nature of including this information precludes the use of many common optimization approaches and requires less efficient methods to generate quality designs. Previous work demonstrated that human-in-the-loop optimization, instantiated as a video game, achieved high-quality, efficient solutions to these design problems. However, such data is expensive to obtain. In the present work, we show how a Decision Transformer machine learning (ML) model can be used to learn from the optimization trajectories generated by human players, and subsequently solve materials design problems. We compare the ML optimization trajectories against players and a common global optimization algorithm: simulated annealing (SA). We find that the ML model exhibits a validation accuracy of 84% against player decisions, and achieves solutions of comparable quality to SA (92%), but does so using three orders of magnitude fewer iterations. We find that the ML model generalizes in important and surprising ways, including the ability to train using a simple constitutive structure-property model and then solve microstructure design problems for a different, higher-fidelity, constitutive structure-property model without any retraining. These results demonstrate the potential of Decision Transformer models for the solution of materials design problems.</description>

      <title>Conformal approach to physics simulations for thin curved 3D membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional nanoarchitectures are widely used across various areas of physics, including spintronics, photonics, and superconductivity. In this regard, thin curved 3D membranes are especially interesting for applications in nano- and optoelectronics, sensorics, and information processing, making physics simulations in complex 3D geometries indispensable for unveiling new physical phenomena and the development of devices. Here, we present a general-purpose approach to physics simulations for thin curved 3D membranes, that allows for performing simulations using finite difference methods instead of meshless methods or methods with irregular meshes. The approach utilizes a numerical conformal mapping of the initial surface to a flat domain and is based on the uniformization theorem stating that any simply-connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to an open unit disk, a complex plane, or a Riemann sphere. We reveal that for many physical problems involving the Laplace operator and divergence, a flat-domain formulation of the initial problem only requires a modification of the equations of motion and the boundary conditions by including a conformal factor and the mean/Gaussian curvatures. We demonstrate the method's capabilities for case studies of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a charged particle in static electric and magnetic fields for 3D geometries, including C-shaped and ring-shaped structures, as well as for the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation.</description>

      <title>A detailed examination of polysilicon resistivity incorporating the grain size distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current transport in polysilicon is a complicated process with many factors to consider. The inhomogeneous nature of polysilicon with its differently shaped and sized grains is one such consideration. We have developed a method that enhances existing resistivity models with a two-dimensional extension that incorporates the grain size distribution using a Voronoi-based resistor network. We obtain grain size distributions both from our growth simulations (700 K, 800 K, and 900 K) and experimental analysis. Applying our method, we investigate the effect that variation in grain size produces with cases of different average grain sizes (2 nm to 3 $\mu$m). For example, the resistivity of polysilicon with an average grain size of 175 nm drops from 11 k$\Omega$ $\cdot$ cm to 4.5 k$\Omega$ $\cdot$ cm when compared to conventional one-dimensional modeling. Our study highlights the strong effect of grain size variation on resistivity, revealing that wider distributions result in significant resistivity reductions of up to more than 50%. Due to the larger grains present with a grain size distribution, current transport encounters fewer grain boundaries while the average grain size remains the same resulting in fewer barriers along the current transport path. Incorporating the grain structure into the resistivity modeling facilitates a more detailed and comprehensive characterization of the electrical properties of polysilicon.</description>

      <title>Cross-sectional Topology Optimization of Slender Soft Pneumatic Actuators using Genetic Algorithms and Geometrically Exact Beam Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of soft robots is still commonly driven by manual trial-and-error approaches, requiring the manufacturing of multiple physical prototypes, which in the end, is time-consuming and requires significant expertise. To reduce the number of manual interventions in this process, topology optimization can be used to assist the design process. The design is then guided by simulations and numerous prototypes can be tested in simulation rather than being evaluated through laborious experiments. To implement this simulation-driven design process, the possible design space of a slender soft pneumatic actuator is generalized to the design of the circular cross-section. We perform a black-box topology optimization using genetic algorithms to obtain a cross-sectional design of a soft pneumatic actuator that is capable of reaching a target workspace defined by the end-effector positions at different pressure values. This design method is evaluated for three different case studies and target workspaces, which were either randomly generated or specified by the operator of the design assistant. The black-box topology optimization based on genetic algorithms proves to be capable of finding good designs under given plausible target workspaces. We considered a simplified simulation model to verify the efficacy of the employed method. An experimental validation has not yet been performed. It can be concluded that the employed black-box topology optimization can assist in the design process for slender soft pneumatic actuators. It supports at searching for possible design prototypes that reach points specified by corresponding actuation pressures. This helps reduce the trial-and-error driven iterative manual design process and enables the operator to focus on prototypes that already offer a good viable solution.</description>

Abstract: The ability to model and sample from conditional densities is important in many physics applications. Implicit quantile networks (IQN) have been successfully applied to this task in domains outside physics. In this work, we illustrate the potential of IQNs as components of emulators using the simulation of jets as an example. Specifically, we use an IQN to map jets described by their 4-momenta at the generation level to jets at the event reconstruction level. The conditional densities emulated by our model closely match those generated by $\texttt{Delphes}$, while also enabling faster jet simulation.</description>

      <title>NIPG-DG schemes for transformed master equations modeling open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a numerical analysis of a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for a transformed master equation modeling an open quantum system: a quantum sub-system interacting with a noisy environment. It is shown that the presented transformed master equation has a reduced computational cost in comparison to a Wigner-Fokker-Planck model of the same system for the general case of non-harmonic potentials via DG schemes. Specifics of a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) numerical scheme adequate for the system of convection-diffusion equations obtained for our Lindblad master equation in position basis are presented. This lets us solve computationally the transformed system of interest modeling our open quantum system problem. The benchmark case of a harmonic potential is then presented, for which the numerical results are compared against the analytical steady-state solution of this problem. Two non-harmonic cases are then presented: the linear and quartic potentials are modeled via our DG framework, for which we show our numerical results.</description>

      <title>Magnetic mesh generation and field line reconstruction for scrape-off layer and divertor modeling in stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of divertor targets and baffles for optimal heat and particle exhaust from magnetically confined fusion plasmas requires a combination of fast, low-fidelity models (such as EMC3-lite [1]) for scoping studies and high-fidelity ones (such as EMC3-EIRENE [2]) for verification. Both of those approaches benefit from a magnetic flux tube mesh for fast interpolation and mapping of field line segments [3]. A new mesh generator for unstructured quadrilateral flux tubes with adaptive refinement is presented and integrated into FLARE [4]. For HSX with an extended first wall, it is found that several layers of flux tubes can span the entire half field period before splitting is required. This is an advantage over the traditional setup of the EMC3-EIRENE mesh where careful construction of several sub-domains is required already for the much tighter present first wall. The divide and conquer paradigm with unstructured mesh layout offers a powerful alternative for integration into optimization workflows. Further examples for W7-X and CTH are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a superconducting order featuring spatial pair modulations on the kagome lattice subject to onsite Hubbard U and nearest neighbor V interactions. Within our functional renormalization group analysis, this state appears with a concomitant d-wave superconducting (SC) instability at zero lattice momentum, where it distinguishes itself through intra-unit cell modulations of the pairing function thus breaking the discrete space group symmetry. The relative weight of the sublattice modulated superconductor (SMS) and d-wave SC is influenced by the absolute interaction strength and coupling ratio V /U . Parametrically adjacent to this domain at weak coupling, we find an intra-unit cell modulated vestigial charge density wave and an s-wave SC instability. Our study provides a microscopic setting and thorough description of this novel SMS arising within a translation symmetry broken background.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Denoising to Non-Equilibrium Structures Improves Equivariant Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions of atoms such as forces in 3D atomistic systems is fundamental to many applications like molecular dynamics and catalyst design. However, simulating these interactions requires compute-intensive ab initio calculations and thus results in limited data for training neural networks. In this paper, we propose to use denoising non-equilibrium structures (DeNS) as an auxiliary task to better leverage training data and improve performance. For training with DeNS, we first corrupt a 3D structure by adding noise to its 3D coordinates and then predict the noise. Different from previous works on denoising, which are limited to equilibrium structures, the proposed method generalizes denoising to a much larger set of non-equilibrium structures. The main difference is that a non-equilibrium structure does not correspond to local energy minima and has non-zero forces, and therefore it can have many possible atomic positions compared to an equilibrium structure. This makes denoising non-equilibrium structures an ill-posed problem since the target of denoising is not uniquely defined. Our key insight is to additionally encode the forces of the original non-equilibrium structure to specify which non-equilibrium structure we are denoising. Concretely, given a corrupted non-equilibrium structure and the forces of the original one, we predict the non-equilibrium structure satisfying the input forces instead of any arbitrary structures. Since DeNS requires encoding forces, DeNS favors equivariant networks, which can easily incorporate forces and other higher-order tensors in node embeddings. We study the effectiveness of training equivariant networks with DeNS on OC20, OC22 and MD17 datasets and demonstrate that DeNS can achieve new state-of-the-art results on OC20 and OC22 and significantly improve training efficiency on MD17.</description>

      <title>Realizability-Informed Machine Learning for Turbulence Anisotropy Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the context of machine learning-based closure mappings for RANS turbulence modelling, physical realizability is often enforced using ad-hoc postprocessing of the predicted anisotropy tensor. In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data. We make our code available for use and modification by others. Moreover, as part of this study, we explore the applicability of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to turbulence modeling, assessing its potential to address non-linear mappings in the anisotropy tensor predictions and demonstrating promising results for the flat plate case.</description>

Abstract: We present and analyze a variational front-tracking method for a sharp-interface model of multiphase flow. The fluid interfaces between different phases are represented by curve networks in two space dimensions (2d) or surface clusters in three space dimensions (3d) with triple junctions where three interfaces meet, and boundary points/lines where an interface meets a fixed planar boundary. The model is described by the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in the bulk domains, with classical interface conditions on the fluid interfaces, and appropriate boundary conditions at the triple junctions and boundary points/lines. We propose a weak formulation for the model, which combines a parametric formulation for the evolving interfaces and an Eulerian formulation for the bulk equations. We employ an unfitted discretization of the coupled formulation to obtain a fully discrete finite element method, where the existence and uniqueness of solutions can be shown under weak assumptions. The constructed method admits an unconditional stability result in terms of the discrete energy. Furthermore, we adapt the introduced method so that an exact volume preservation for each phase can be achieved for the discrete solutions. Numerical examples for three-phase flow and four-phase flow are presented to show the robustness and accuracy of the introduced methods.</description>

      <title>Tensor-involved peridynamics: A unified framework for isotropic and anisotropic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10175</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce tensor involved peridynamics, a unified framework for simulating both isotropic and anisotropic materials. While traditional peridynamics models effectively simulate isotropic materials, they face challenges with anisotropic materials and are prone to instability caused by zero energy modes. Our novel model extend the linear bond based peridynamics framework by incorporating the elastic tensor into the micrmodulus function, thereby ensuring stability for anisotropic materials without the need for additional corrections. For isotropic materials. the model mantains compatibility with conventional bond based peridynamics, assuming Possion's rations of 1/4 in 3D and 1/3 in 2D.Numerical experiments confirm the model's stability and accuracy across various scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a damage model for isotropic materials. validating its performance in predicting crack propagation paths in a 2D plate. The results show superior alignment with experimental date compared to traditional model.</description>

      <title>X-MeshGraphNet: Scalable Multi-Scale Graph Neural Networks for Physics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant traction for simulating complex physical systems, with models like MeshGraphNet demonstrating strong performance on unstructured simulation meshes. However, these models face several limitations, including scalability issues, requirement for meshing at inference, and challenges in handling long-range interactions. In this work, we introduce X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable, multi-scale extension of MeshGraphNet designed to address these challenges. X-MeshGraphNet overcomes the scalability bottleneck by partitioning large graphs and incorporating halo regions that enable seamless message passing across partitions. This, combined with gradient aggregation, ensures that training across partitions is equivalent to processing the entire graph at once. To remove the dependency on simulation meshes, X-MeshGraphNet constructs custom graphs directly from tessellated geometry files (e.g., STLs) by generating point clouds on the surface or volume of the object and connecting k-nearest neighbors. Additionally, our model builds multi-scale graphs by iteratively combining coarse and fine-resolution point clouds, where each level refines the previous, allowing for efficient long-range interactions. Our experiments demonstrate that X-MeshGraphNet maintains the predictive accuracy of full-graph GNNs while significantly improving scalability and flexibility. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming mesh generation at inference, offering a practical solution for real-time simulation across a wide range of applications. The code for reproducing the results presented in this paper is available through NVIDIA Modulus.</description>
