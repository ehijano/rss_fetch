      <title>Two-dimensional Synchrotron Beam Shape Characterization using Interferometric Closure Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron radiation interferometry (SRI) is widely used in particle accelerators to monitor the transverse beam profile, and thus the critical beam emittance parameter. We introduce a novel technique to SRI using closure amplitudes, inspired by radio interferometry, to determine the two-dimensional profile of the synchrotron beam. Previous techniques have required multiple interferograms or accurate estimates of the non-uniform aperture illuminations. In contrast, our method using closure amplitudes avoids the need to estimate the aperture illuminations while determining the two-dimensional beam shape from a single interferogram. The invariance of closure amplitudes to even time-varying aperture illuminations makes it suitable to longer averaging intervals, with potential to reducing data rates and computational overheads. Using data from the ALBA synchrotron light source and having validated the results against existing methods, this paper represents one of the first real-world applications of interferometric closure amplitudes to directly determine the light source shape.</description>

      <title>Lateral Cavity-Enhanced Guided Mode Resonance Structures for Mid-wave Infrared Photodetector Pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and optical characterization of ultra-compact mid-wave infrared photodetector pixels. Our design relies on a guided mode resonance structure to confine incident mid-infrared light to the 250 nm-thick absorber region of all-epitaxially-grown material stack, and a hybrid cavity-guided mode resonance to confine the mode in the lateral direction. The resulting pixel, with deep subwavelength thickness and lateral dimensions on the order of almost two times free space operating wavelength is predicted to achieve external quantum efficiency of the order of 50%. Our work opens the door for truly compact mid-wave infrared pixels that offer the combined benefits of low dark current, room temperature operation, and small lateral size.</description>

      <title>OAM-Assisted Self-Healing Is Directional, Proportional and Persistent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we demonstrate the postulated mechanism of self-healing specifically due to orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) in radio vortex beams having equal beam-widths. In previous work we experimentally demonstrated self-healing effects in OAM beams at 28 GHz and postulated a theoretical mechanism to account for them. In this work we further characterize the OAM self-healing mechanism theoretically and confirm those characteristics with systematic and controlled experimental measurements on a 28 GHz outdoor link. Specifically, we find that the OAM self-healing mechanism is an additional self-healing mechanism in structured electromagnetic beams which is directional with respect to the displacement of an obstruction relative to the beam axis. We also confirm our previous findings that the amount of OAM self-healing is proportional to the OAM order, and additionally find that it persists beyond the focusing region into the far field. As such, OAM-assisted self-healing brings an advantage over other so-called non-diffracting beams both in terms of the minimum distance for onset of self-healing and the amount of self-healing obtainable. We relate our findings by extending theoretical models in the literature and develop a unifying electromagnetic analysis to account for self-healing of OAM-bearing non-diffracting beams more rigorously.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Waves Determined by the Tangential Electric Field of Incident Plane Wave at a Charged and Lossy Planar Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the new decomposition of wave vectors and electric fields with respect to a charged planar interface between two isotropic lossy media, the incident, reflected, and refracted plane waves are found to be only determined by the tangential electric field of the incident plane wave. The complex wave vectors and their corresponding complex angles of the incident, reflected and refracted waves are easily calculated from the tangential wave vector based on the phase matching condition and Snell's law. The relationship between two different schemes of electric field compositions is interpreted and the electric field magnitudes of the incident, reflected and refracted waves were deduced from the tangential electric field magnitude of the incident wave where the tangential boundary condition of electric fields is directly utilized. The time-averaged Poynting vectors and the surface Joule heat density at the interface are also given to demonstrate the validity of our proposed methodology by the energy balance condition together with a specific example. It is also found that the external surface charges with a practical surface charge density have little effect on the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves since the surface conductivity of interface is negligibly small. Our work opens a new and fast route for calculating the reflected and transmitted waves at a charged and lossy planar interface without the need to perform the traditional polarization decomposition of arbitrarily polarized incident plane waves.</description>

      <title>In-situ three-dimensional strain engineering of solid-state quantum emitters in photonic structures towards scalable quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters are pivotal for modern photonic quantum technology, yet their inherent spectral inhomogeneity imposes a critical challenge in pursuing scalable quantum network. Here, we develop a cryogenic-compatible strain-engineering platform based on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp that is not obviously working properly at cryogenic temperature. In-situ three-dimensional (3D) strain control is achieved for quantum dots (QDs) embedded in photonic nanostructures. The compliant PDMS enables independent tuning of emission energy and elimination of fine structure splitting (FSS) of single QDs, as demonstrated by a 7 meV spectral shift with a near-vanishing FSS in circular Bragg resonators and an unprecedented 15 meV tuning range in the micropillar. The PDMS-based 3D strain-engineering platform, compatible with diverse photonic structures at cryogenic temperature, provides a powerful and versatile tool for exploring fundamental strain-related physics and advancing integrated photonic quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Third-Order Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion in Dielectric Nonlinear Resonant Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general scheme to investigate photon triplet generation (PTG) via third-order spontaneous parametric downconversion (TOSPDC) in $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear structures. Our approach leverages the quantum-classical correspondence between TOSPDC and its reverse classical process, three-wave sum-frequency generation (TSFG), to efficiently estimate the PTG rate. We apply this framework to nonlinear metasurfaces supporting quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs) in the optical range. From numerical analysis of non-collinear TSFG with degenerate input waves at qBIC wavelengths, we predict wavelength-tunable three-photon emission with spatio-angular correlations. These findings establish a novel method for modelling TOSPDC and also highlight the potential of nonlinear resonant metasurfaces as compact free-space photon triplet sources with quantum state control.</description>

      <title>Digital-twin imaging based on descattering Gaussian splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional imaging through scattering media is important in medical science and astronomy. We propose a digital-twin imaging method based on Gaussian splatting to observe an object behind a scattering medium. A digital twin model built through data assimilation, emulates the behavior of objects and environmental changes in a virtual space. By constructing a digital twin using point clouds composed of Gaussians and simulating the scattering process through the convolution of a point spread function, three-dimensional objects behind a scattering medium can be reproduced as a digital twin. In this study, a high-contrast digital twin reproducing a three-dimensional object was successfully constructed from degraded images, assuming that data were acquired from wavefronts disturbed by a scattering medium. This technique reproduces objects by integrating data processing with image measurements.</description>

      <title>Thermo-optic bistability in 2D all-dielectric resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider thermo-optic bistability in resonant excitation of high-quality modes in two-dimensional dielectric resonators. We develop a coupled-mode theory approach which account for the frequency shift due to a temperature dependent dielectric permittivity. The model is applied to rectangular and hexagonal resonators supporting an isolated high-quality resonant mode. The results are verified in comparison with straightforward finite-element simulations. It is shown that the model accurately describes the effect bistabily which occurs under variation of the angle of incidence or the intensity of the incident wave. In particular, it is demonstrated that variation of the incident angle can optimize the coupling between the resonator and the incident waves leading to bistabily with low intensity incident waves $W_0 = 0.35 {\rm \mu W/\mu m}^2$. The bistability threshold is shown to be extremely sensitive to the imaginary part of the dielectric permittivity $\epsilon''$.</description>

      <title>High harmonic generation in monolayer MoS2 controlled by resonant and near-resonant pulses on ultrashort time scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on experimental investigation of nonperturbative high harmonic generation (HHG) in monolayer MoS2 in the ultraviolet spectral region driven by mid-infrared light. We study how the HHG is influenced by pre-excitation of the monolayer using resonant and near-resonant pulses in a pump-probe-like scheme. The resonant light creates high density exciton population. Due to ultrafast dephasing caused by electron-electron scattering, the HHG is suppressed in the presence of pre-excited carriers. In the case of near-resonant excitation with photon energy below the exciton transition, the dynamics of the observed suppression of the HHG yield contains a fast component which is a consequence of momentum scattering at carriers, which are excited by two-photon transition when the two pulses temporally overlap in the sample. This interpretation is supported by comparison of the experimental data with theoretical calculations of two-photon absorption spectrum of MoS2 monolayer. This work demonstrates a possibility to control HHG in lowdimensional materials on ultrashort timescales by combining the driving strong-field pulse with a weak near-resonant light.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains with strong coupling amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmonic many-particle systems with precisely tuned resonances and coupling strengths can exhibit emergent collective properties governed by universal principles. In one-dimensional chains with alternating couplings, known as Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) systems, this includes the formation of topologically protected mid-gap modes whose intensities localize at the chain's ends. This subwavelength localization at optical frequencies is crucial for achieving strong coupling of mid-gap modes to two-level systems under ambient conditions, extending topological protection to hybrid light-matter states. Here, we have fabricated SSH chains from plasmonic nanoslit resonators with strong inter-resonator coupling. The alternating distance between the nanoslit resonators is controlled with sub-nanometer precision, enabling accurate prediction and experimental observation of topologically protected mid-gap modes via photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). Our results open the path towards experimental realizations of two-dimensional photonic metasurfaces exhibiting higher-order topological modes that can be strongly coupled to single emitters and quantum materials at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-interband hybridization and anomalous production of hot electrons in aluminum nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong coupling typically occurs between two separate objects or between an object and its environment (such as an atom and a cavity). However, it can also occur between two different excitations within the same object, a situation that has been much less studied. In this study, we observe strong coupling between localized surface plasmon resonances and the interband transition in aluminum nanorods, as evidenced by optical spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, and corroborated with numerical simulations. Strong coupling is observed between the interband transition and multiple orders of the surface plasmon mode, including dark ones. We also obtain experimental maps of the hybrid modes at the nanoscale. In each case, the associated Rabi energy, which corresponds to the energy splitting between the two polaritonic branches, is obtained. Finally, a dedicated numerical model was employed to calculate the hot electron generation rate in the nanorods. The calculations demonstrate that efficient generation of hot electrons can be achieved in the near-infrared region, when the interband transition is strongly coupled with a plasmon resonance. This high generation rate stems from the hybrid nature of the mode, as its plasmonic component provides a high absorption cross-section, while the IT part ensures efficient conversion to hot electrons. Consequently, aluminum nanorods represent an efficient source of hot electrons in the visible and near-infrared regions, with potential applications in local photochemistry, photodetection, and solar energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Large-scale quantum-dot-lithium-niobate hybrid integrated photonic circuits enabling on-chip quantum networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid integrated quantum photonics combines solid-state artificial atoms with reconfigurable photonic circuits, enabling scalable chip-based quantum networks. Self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) are ideal for this goal due to their ability to generate highly indistinguishable single photons with exceptional brightness. Integrating QDs into low-loss photonic circuits can facilitate complex quantum networks by enabling entanglement transfer via two-photon interference. However, challenges such as limited scalability, spectral inhomogeneity, and quantum interference between independent sources remain. We present a hybrid photonic architecture that integrates QD-containing waveguides with low-loss lithium niobate (LN) circuits, incorporating 20 deterministic single-photon sources (SPSs). Using the piezoelectric properties of thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN), we achieve on-chip local spectral tuning of QD emissions by up to 7.7 meV,three orders of magnitude greater than the transform-limited linewidth. This approach enables on-chip quantum interference with a visibility of 0.73 between two spatially separated QD SPSs connected by 0.48 mm long waveguides, establishing a functional quantum network.The large-scale integration of spectrally tunable QD-based SPSs into low-loss LN circuits, combined with fast electro-optical switching, paves the way for compact, lightweight, and scalable photonic quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Photon-number-resolving single-photon detector with a system detection efficiency of 98% and photon-number resolution of 32</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently distinguishing photon numbers is a crucial yet challenging technology for various quantum information and quantum metrology applications. While superconducting transition edge sensors offer good photon-number-resolving (PNR) capabilities, they are hampered by low detection speed, timing jitter, and complex cooling and readout requirements. In this work, we present a significant advancement toward achieving high-fidelity PNR single-photon detectors. The unique twin-layer configuration of superconducting nanowire atop a dielectric mirror ensures the near-unity detection efficiency. The segmented design enables spatial multiplexing, establishing a mapping relationship between pulse amplitude and registered photons. The fabricated detector exhibits impressive performance metrics, including a single-photon system detection efficiency (SDE) of ~ 98% at a dark count rate of 20 cps and photon-number resolution capability up to 32. Further characterization through detector tomography reveals high fidelities for two-, three-, and four-photon events, approximately 87%,73%, and 40% respectively. Moreover, the detector operates at a high count rate of 41 MHz at 3dB-SDE, with a low timing jitter of as low as 40 ps. With its near-unity efficiency, high photon-number resolution, low dark count rate and fast detection speed, we expect significant interest in these detectors, promising substantial benefits for weak light detection and optical quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>High Numerical Aperture Achromatic Meta-Devices through Dispersion Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dispersion engineering is a long-standing challenge in optical systems, and it is particularly important for metasurfaces, which naturally suffer from strong chromatic aberrations due to their ultralow profile. Stacks of metasurfaces have recently implemented dispersion control to address these challenges. However, these approaches still suffer from bottlenecks in terms of the available material refractive index and required aspect ratios, resulting in limited phase and group delay coverage, constraining their numerical aperture (NA), size and operating bandwidth. To address these challenges, we explore a dispersion compensation strategy combined with full-wave simulation-free inverse design to implement ultra-high NA, broadband dispersion control in metasurfaces, not requiring large refractive index materials and high aspect ratio processing technology. We experimentally demonstrate multiple meta-devices with highly customized dispersion engineering in the microwave regime, including broadband achromatic diffraction-limited meta-devices with NA=0.98 and 60% fractional bandwidth. Our proposed platform explores a paradigm for dispersion control with metasurfaces, which may facilitate advanced and scalable dispersion functionalities.</description>

      <title>Robust entangled photon generation by Floquet-engineered two-colour pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters driven by resonant two-photon excitation are a leading source for deterministically generated entangled photon pairs, essential for scalable photonic quantum technologies. However, conventional resonant schemes are highly sensitive to laser power fluctuations and pose additional experimental challenges for emitters with small biexciton binding energies. Here, we demonstrate how biexciton preparation schemes with significantly improved robustness and reduced laser filtering requirements can be identified using a novel design principle beyond resonant and adiabatic driving: ultrafast all-optical Floquet engineering. This is achieved by employing two strongly and symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulses, whose superposition generates a stroboscopic Hamiltonian that enables direct coupling between ground and biexciton states. Moreover, a pulse delay serves as a tuning knob, introducing an effective magnetic field that concentrates the Bloch sphere trajectory at the biexciton state for a wide range of parameters, making biexciton preparation particularly robust. Experimentally, we achieve a biexciton occupation exceeding 96% and preserve photon-pair entanglement with a fidelity of 93.4%. Our scheme highlights the great impact of Floquet-engineered multicolour excitation protocols for on-demand quantum light sources.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the transition dipole moment of quantum dots with absorption and angle resolved photo-luminescence spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, the evaluation procedure of transition dipole moment (TDM) is discussed. Semiconducting Cd_{x}Zn_{1-x}Se_{y}S_{1-y} alloyed quantum dots (AQDs) are used as the two level emitting system. The AQDs are then self-assembled into monolayers by the Langmuir-Schaefer method. The TDM magnitude and orientation of AQDs are extracted from the absorption spectrum and the angle resolved Photo-luminescence emission spectrum measurements respectively. The TDM of AQDs in vacuum is evaluated as 9.07 D and the anisotropy coefficient shows that the AQD emission is isotropic.</description>

      <title>Fast Calculation of Nonuniform Plane Waves at Arbitrarily Oriented and Charged Planar Interfaces of Isotropic Lossy Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fast method for calculating the reflected and transmitted waves for a given nonuniform plane wave incident on an arbitrarily oriented and charged planar interface between two isotropic and possibly lossy media is proposed based on the decomposition of the complex wave vector and complex wave numbers with respect to the unit normal vector of the interface. According to the complex vector analysis, the exact definition of the complex angles of incidence, reflection and refraction are presented and applied in the complex forms of Snell's law and Fresnel equations to quickly and correctly calculate the complex wave vectors and the complex electric fields of the reflected and refracted waves at a charged interface where the surface charge and current densities are considered. The calculation procedure and two practical examples are also given to demonstrate the validity and powerfulness of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Polarization Decoupling Multi-Port Beam-Splitting Metasurface for Miniaturized Magneto-Optical Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In regular magneto-optical trap (MOT) systems, the delivery of six circularly polarized (CP) cooling beams requires complex and bulky optical arrangements including waveplates, mirrors, retroreflectors, etc. To address such technique challenges, we have proposed a beam delivery system for miniaturized MOT entirely based on meta-devices. The key component is a novel multi-port beam-splitting (PD-MPBS) metasurface that relies on both propagation phase and geometric phase. The fabricated samples exhibit high beam-splitting power uniformity (within 4.4%) and polarization purities (91.29%~93.15%). By leveraging such beam-splitting device as well as reflective beam-expanding meta-device, an integrated six-beam delivery system for miniaturized MOT application has been implemented. The experimental results indicate that six expanded beams have been successfully delivered with uniform power (within 9.5%), the desired CP configuration and large overlapping volume (76.2 mm^3). We believe that a miniaturized MOT with the proposed beam delivery system is very promising for portable application of cold atom technology in precision measurement, atomic clock, quantum simulation and computing, etc.</description>

      <title>Photon distillation schemes with reduced resource costs based on multiphoton Fourier interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14262v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scalable scheme to achieve photon distillation, i.e. the preparation of a single photon with reduced indistinguishability error out of multiple imperfect photons, based on multiphoton interference in Fourier matrices. Our scheme achieves arbitrary error reduction in a single step, removing the need to concatenate multiple rounds of the protocol. Our scheme has resource costs linear in the error reduction, and a constant probability of success for arbitrary error reductions. We find that the scheme both raises the threshold of error correcting codes in photonic quantum computers, as well as reduces the resources required to construct a photonic quantum computer, making it highly promising for implementation in such devices.</description>

      <title>Imaging Ultrafast Dynamical Diffraction wavefronts of femtosecond laser-induced lattice distortions inside crystalline semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Material processing with femtosecond lasers has attracted enormous attention because of its potential for technology and industry applications. In parallel, time-resolved x-ray diffraction has been successfully used to study ultrafast structural distortion dynamics in semiconductor thin films. Gracing incident x-ray geometry has been also used to look to distortion dynamics, but this technique is only sensitive to the surface of bulk materials with a limited temporal resolution. However, 'real-world' processing applications deal mostly with bulk materials, which prevent the use of such techniques. For processing applications, a fast and depth-sensitive probe is needed. To address this, we present a novel technique based on ultrafast dynamical diffraction (UDD) capable of imaging transient strain distributions inside bulk crystals upon single-pulse excitation. This pump-probe technique provides a complete picture of the temporal evolution of ultrafast distortion depth profiles. Our measurements were obtained in a thin crystalline Si wafer upon single pulse femtosecond optical excitation revealing that even below the melting threshold strong lattice distortions appear on ps time scales due to the formation and propagation of high-amplitude strain waves into the bulk.</description>
