      <title>Universal emergence of local Zipf's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plethora of natural and socio-economic phenomena share a striking statistical regularity, that is the magnitude of elements decreases with a power law as a function of their position in a ranking of magnitude. Such regularity is commonly known as Zipf's law, and plenty of problem-specific explanations for its emergence have been provided in different fields. Yet, an explanation for Zipf's law ubiquity is currently lacking. In this paper, we demonstrate from first principles that Zipf's behavior naturally emerges as a local approximation to the order statistics generated by any ranking process. We validate our results against several relevant examples.</description>

      <title>Scenarios of future annual carbon footprints of astronomical research infrastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research infrastructures have been identified as an important source of greenhouse gas emissions of astronomical research. Based on a comprehensive inventory of 1,211 ground-based observatories and space missions, we assessed the evolution of the number of astronomical facilities and their carbon footprint from 1945 to 2022. We found that space missions dominate greenhouse gas emissions in astronomy, showing an important peak at the end of the 1960ies, followed by a decrease that has turned again into a rise over the last decade. Extrapolating past trends, we predict that greenhouse gas emissions from astronomical facilities will experience no strong decline in the future, and may even rise substantially, unless research practices are changed. We demonstrate that a continuing growth in the number of operating astronomical facilities is not environmentally sustainable. These findings should motivate the astronomical community to reflect about the necessary evolutions that would put astronomical research on a sustainable path.</description>

      <title>Random walks on bifractal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that networks possessing the scale-free and fractal properties may exhibit the bifractal nature, in which local structures are described by two different fractal dimensions. In this study, we investigate random walks on fractal scale-free networks (FSFNs) by examining the walk dimension $d_{\text{w}}$ and the spectral dimension $d_{\text{s}}$, to understand how the bifractality of FSFNs affects their dynamical properties. The walk dimension is found to be unaffected by the difference in local fractality of an FSFN and remains constant regardless of the starting node of a random walk, whereas the spectral dimension takes two values, $d_{\text{s}}^{\text{min}}$ and $d_{\text{s}}^{\text{max}}(&gt; d_{\text{s}}^{\text{min}})$, depending on the starting node. The dimension $d_{\text{s}}^{\text{min}}$ characterizes the return probability of a random walker starting from an infinite-degree hub node in the thermodynamic limit, while $d_{\text{s}}^{\text{max}}$ describes that of a random walker starting from a finite-degree non-hub node infinitely distant from hub nodes and is equal to the global spectral dimension $D_{\text{s}}$. The existence of two local spectral dimensions is a direct consequence of the bifractality of the FSFN. Furthermore, analytical expressions of $d_{\text{w}}$, $d_{\text{s}}^{\text{min}}$, and $d_{\text{s}}^{\text{max}}$ are presented for FSFNs formed by the generator model and the giant components of critical scale-free random graphs, and are numerically confirmed.</description>

      <title>q-deformed evolutionary dynamics in simple matrix games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider evolutionary games in which the agent selected for update compares their payoff to q neighbours, rather than a single neighbour as in standard evolutionary game theory. Through studying fixed point stability and fixation times for 2x2 games with all-to-all interactions, we find that the flow changes significantly as a function of q. Further, we investigate the effects of changing the underlying topology from an all-to-all interacting system to an uncorrelated graph via the pair approximation. We also develop the framework for studying games with more than two strategies, such as the rock-paper-scissors game where we show that changing q leads to the emergence of new types of flow.</description>

      <title>Highly engaging events reveal semantic and temporal compression in online community discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People nowadays express their opinions in online spaces, using different forms of interactions such as posting, sharing and discussing with one another. How do these digital traces change in response to events happening in the real world? We leverage Reddit conversation data, exploiting its community-based structure, to elucidate how offline events influence online user interactions and behavior. Online conversations, as posts and comments, are analysed along their temporal and semantic dimensions. Conversations tend to become repetitive with a more limited vocabulary, develop at a faster pace and feature heightened emotions. As the event approaches, the shifts occurring in conversations are reflected in the users' dynamics. Users become more active and they exchange information with a growing audience, despite using a less rich vocabulary and repetitive messages. The recurring patterns we discovered are persistent across a wide range of events and several contexts, representing a fingerprint of how online dynamics change in response to real-world occurrences.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of the Reddit collective action leading to the GameStop short squeeze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In early 2021, the stock prices of GameStop, AMC, Nokia, and BlackBerry experienced dramatic increases, triggered by short squeeze operations that have been largely attributed to Reddit's retail investors. These events showcased, for the first time, the potential of online social networks to catalyze financial collective action. How, when and to what extent Reddit users played a role in driving up these prices, however, remains unclear. We address these questions by statistical analysis of time series with high temporal resolution, about social activity on Reddit and Twitter as well as stock trading volumes. We find that increasing Reddit discussions anticipated high trading volume before the GameStop short squeeze, with their predictive power being particularly strong on hourly time scales. This effect emerged abruptly a few weeks before the event, but waned once the community of investors gained widespread visibility through Twitter. Meanwhile, the collective investment of the Reddit community, quantified through each user's financial position on GameStop, closely mirrored the market capitalization of the stock. These evidences suggest a coordinated action by Reddit users in developing a shared financial strategy through social media. Towards the end of January, users talking about GameStop contributed to raise the popularity of BlackBerry, AMC and Nokia, which emerged as the most popular stocks as the community gained global recognition. Overall, our results shed light on the dynamics behind the first large-scale financial collective action driven by social media users.</description>

      <title>Identifying vegetation patterns for a qualitative assessment of land degradation using a cellular automata model and satellite imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to identify the spatial distribution of vegetation and its growth dynamics with the purpose of obtaining a qualitative assessment of vegetation health and land degradation. To do so, we compare a statistical model of vegetation growth and real-world Earth observation data. Specifically, we analyze a stochastic cellular automata model and data obtained from satellite images, namely using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Leaf Area Index (LAI). In the experimental data, we look for areas where vegetation is broken into small patches and qualitatively compare it to the percolating, fragmented, and degraded states that appear in the cellular automata model. We model the periodic effect of seasons, finding numerical evidence of a periodic fragmentation and recovery phenomenology if the model parameters are sufficiently close to the model's percolation transition. We qualitatively recognize these effects in real-world vegetation images and consider them a signal of increased environmental stress and vulnerability. Finally, we show an estimation of the environmental stress in land images by considering both the vegetation density and its clusterization.</description>
