      <title>Dynamics and Contracts for an Agent with Misspecified Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a single-agent contracting environment where the agent has misspecified beliefs about the outcome distributions for each chosen action. First, we show that for a myopic Bayesian learning agent with only two possible actions, the empirical frequency of the chosen actions converges to a Berk-Nash equilibrium. However, through a constructed example, we illustrate that this convergence in action frequencies fails when the agent has three or more actions. Furthermore, with multiple actions, even computing an $\varepsilon$-Berk-Nash equilibrium requires at least quasi-polynomial time under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) for the PPAD-class. This finding poses a significant challenge to the existence of simple learning dynamics that converge in action frequencies. Motivated by this challenge, we focus on the contract design problems for an agent with misspecified beliefs and two possible actions. We show that the revenue-optimal contract, under a Berk-Nash equilibrium, can be computed in polynomial time. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that even a minor degree of misspecification can result in a significant reduction in optimal revenue.</description>

      <title>Paying to Do Better: Games with Payments between Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In repeated games, such as auctions, players typically use learning algorithms to choose their actions. The use of such autonomous learning agents has become widespread on online platforms. In this paper, we explore the impact of players incorporating monetary transfers into their agents' algorithms, aiming to incentivize behavior in their favor. Our focus is on understanding when players have incentives to make use of monetary transfers, how these payments affect learning dynamics, and what the implications are for welfare and its distribution among the players. We propose a simple game-theoretic model to capture such scenarios. Our results on general games show that in a broad class of games, players benefit from letting their learning agents make payments to other learners during the game dynamics, and that in many cases, this kind of behavior improves welfare for all players. Our results on first- and second-price auctions show that in equilibria of the ``payment policy game,'' the agents' dynamics can reach strong collusive outcomes with low revenue for the auctioneer. These results highlight a challenge for mechanism design in systems where automated learning agents can benefit from interacting with their peers outside the boundaries of the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Online Fisher Markets: Static Pricing Limits and Adaptive Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.00825v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fisher markets are one of the most fundamental models for resource allocation. However, the problem of computing equilibrium prices in Fisher markets typically relies on complete knowledge of users' budgets and utility functions and requires transactions to happen in a static market where all users are present simultaneously. Motivated by these practical considerations, we study an online variant of Fisher markets, wherein users with privately known utility and budget parameters, drawn i.i.d. from a distribution, arrive sequentially. In this setting, we first study the limitations of static pricing algorithms, which set uniform prices for all users, along two performance metrics: (i) regret, i.e., the optimality gap in the objective of the Eisenberg-Gale program between an online algorithm and an oracle with complete information, and (ii) capacity violations, i.e., the over-consumption of goods relative to their capacities. Given the limitations of static pricing, we design adaptive posted-pricing algorithms, one with knowledge of the distribution of users' budget and utility parameters and another that adjusts prices solely based on past observations of user consumption, i.e., revealed preference feedback, with improved performance guarantees. Finally, we present numerical experiments to compare our revealed preference algorithm's performance to several benchmarks.</description>
