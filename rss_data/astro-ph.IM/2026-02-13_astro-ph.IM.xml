      <title>DeepRed: an architecture for redshift estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating redshift is a central task in astrophysics, but its measurement is costly and time-consuming. In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys.</description>

      <title>Design and characterization of W-band and D-band calibration sources for the AliCPT-1 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ali Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization Telescope (AliCPT-1) is the first Chinese cosmic microwave background experiment aiming to make sensitive polarization maps of the potential B-mode signal from inflationary gravitational waves. The telescope was deployed on the Tibet Ali site at 5250 m above sea level in early 2025. Before and after each observation season, the instrument performance must be carefully calibrated, including the far field beam performance, far sidelobe, spectral response, polarization angle, and cross-polar beam response. To characterize these optical performances, several calibrators have been developed. We developed a W-band source and a D-band source for the AliCPT-1 telescope's beam characterizations. We present the design and performance of the two calibration sources.</description>

      <title>Beyond One-Thousandth Energy Resolution with an AlMn TES Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) is a critical technology for next-generation X-ray spectrometers, known for its exceptional energy resolution. In the last decade, TESs based on AlMn alloy films have been extensively used in several cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. The advantages of simple fabrication process and easily tunable critical temperature make them an alternative to bilayer TESs. However, they have rarely been applied to X-ray detection until now. We developed an annular AlMn TES for X-ray detection and tested it in a dilution refrigerator with a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) amplifier, achieving an Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 12.1 +- 0.3 eV at 17.48 keV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an AlMn TES achieving an energy resolution below 0.1%, highlighting its potential for high-resolution X-ray detection.</description>

      <title>Testing and Validation of the Updated Pixel-Based Non-Linearity Calibration File for WFC3/IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The WFC3\IR channel has an innate non-linear response to incident photons, which is corrected for in the calwf3 pipeline with the NLINFILE reference file. The 2009 solution is based on an average polynomial correction for each IR quadrant and is found to be poorly constrained at high fluence levels (e-) approaching the saturation limit. Using a variety of image types, sources, and sample sequences, we test a new pixel-based linearity correction developed by Shenoy et al. (2025). In nearly all cases, the new correction improves the linearity at fluence levels higher than 50,000 e-, with improvements up to 7% for pixels with fluences approaching the saturation limit (80,000 e-) in the last ima reads. The pixel-based solution also significantly decreases the number of cosmic rays erroneously flagged (due to non-linearity correction errors) during ramp fitting in calwf3, leading to improved photometric accuracy in the calibrated flt data and higher signal-to-noise ratios, particularly in Quad 1 (upper-left detector quadrant). Because the new solution tends to make sources brighter, we recalibrate the five HST flux standards used to compute the IR zeropoints and find a negligible impact (0.1-0.2%) on the published values by Calamida et al. (2024), smaller than the RMS dispersion (0.5%) in the observed to synthetic flux ratios for all five flux standards. The new NLINFILE 9au15283i lin.fits was delivered to CRDS in October 2025 and will be used to reprocess all WFC3/IR imaging and grism observations in the MAST archive. An updated reference file a2412448i lin.fits was delivered in February 2026, improving the results at the highest fluence levels by a few tenths of a percent.

      <title>Tailored mass estimators for Milky Way dwarf Spheroidals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium within a given gravitational potential, a dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy's globally averaged stellar velocity dispersion depends entirely on the shape of its stellar density profile. Thus, the dynamical inference of a dSph's gravitational potential is necessarily sensitive to assumptions about that shape. Relaxing standard assumptions, we fit flexible stellar density models to observations of the Milky Way's known dSph satellites. Considering various choices for the density profile shape and spatial extent of a host dark matter halo, we use the virial theorem to propagate observational uncertainties about the shapes of the inferred dSph stellar density profiles to uncertainties in the inferred dynamical masses. We find that the observed structural diversity of the Milky Way dSph population implies a large range of potential systematic errors (up to factors of 10) associated with standard dynamical mass estimators. We show that accounting for these observational and systematic uncertainties can significantly alter the appearance and behavior of dSph dynamical scaling relations, including enclosed dynamical mass vs. stellar mass and the Radial Acceleration Relation.</description>

      <title>Measurement prospects for the pair-instability mass cutoff with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae leave behind no compact remnants, resulting in a predicted gap in the distribution of stellar black-hole masses. Gravitational waves from binary black-hole mergers probe the relevant mass range and analyses of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog (GWTC-4) indicate a possible mass cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$. However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\gtrsim20\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\,\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\gtrsim125\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{b}$ at $90\%$ credibility by the end of O4. Relative uncertainties on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from gravitational-wave data alone can still be up to $100\%$. We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present. We use the simple focus of this study to emphasize that such tests are necessary to make astrophysical claims from gravitational-wave catalogs going forward.</description>

      <title>An optical transient candidate of $\lesssim$ 2-second duration captured by wide-field video observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent time-domain surveys have revealed rapid transients that evolve on timescales of $\lesssim 10$ days, expanding the transient population into the short-duration regime. The transient search on even shorter timescales, particularly those lasting only seconds or less, remains a largely unexplored frontier. Very short-duration optical transients could serve as potential counterparts to millisecond-duration fast radio bursts (FRBs), providing clues to their origins. However, the optical search for transients on such short timescales has been limited primarily by instrumental constraints. Here we report the discovery of an optical transient candidate (TMG20200322) with a duration of $\lesssim 2$~s by wide-field video observations in the direction of the Earth's shadow. TMG20200322 was detected in just two consecutive images of 1-second exposure time, with its shape becoming elongated in the second frame. PSF shape variability analysis of field stars reveals that such an elongated PSF cannot be explained by atmospheric fluctuations. We investigate the potential origins of TMG20200322 in two scenarios: meteoroid impact flashes on near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and head-on meteors in the Earth's atmosphere. None of the scenarios provides a satisfactory explanation for this transient. We derive a sky-projected rate of the TMG20200322 event of $R_{\mathrm{trans}} = (3.4 \times 10^{-2})^{+0.13}_{-0.028}$~deg$^{-2}$~day$^{-1}$ and an upper limit on second-timescale transients with durations of $1~\mathrm{s} \leq \tau \lesssim 15~\mathrm{s}$ of $R_{\mathrm{trans}} \lesssim 0.10$~deg$^{-2}$~day$^{-1}$ for the non-detection case. We highlight that continuous monitoring observations in the direction of the Earth's shadow could be a key strategy to unveil a new population of optical transients on timescales of seconds or less.</description>

      <title>Selecting Optimal Stellar Calibration Fields for the CSST Imaging Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) will perform a decade-long high-precision wide-field imaging survey that relies on rigorous on-orbit calibration. This necessitates stable celestial benchmark fields to maintain photometric and astrometric consistency throughout the mission lifetime. We establish comprehensive selection criteria including observational visibility, stellar number density, bright-star contamination, and interstellar dust extinction. Using the CSST Observation Strategy Analysis Tool (COSAT) and all-sky dust maps from Planck and SFD, we constrain eligible regions to the ranges of ecliptic latitude $ |\beta| &gt; 50^\circ$ and galactic latitude $|b| &gt; 15^\circ$. From an initial sample of 29 candidate clusters meeting these spatial constraints, six globular clusters (M13, M92, NGC 104, NGC 362, NGC 1261, and NGC 1851) are identified as optimal calibration fields, fulfilling all the critical criteria. These selected clusters are recommended as optimal calibration field candidates for CSST's on-orbit calibration program, and are fundamental to achieving unprecedented photometric precision in CSST's space-based survey.</description>

      <title>pespace: A new tool of GPU-accelerated and auto-differentiable response generation and likelihood evaluation for space-borne gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detectors will expand the scope of gravitational wave astronomy to the milli-Hertz band in the near future. The development of data analysis software infrastructure at the current stage is crucial. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{pespace} which can be used for the full Bayesian parameter estimation of massive black hole binaries with detectors including LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The core computations are implemented using the high-performance parallel programming framework \texttt{taichi-lang} which enables automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration across different architectures. We also reimplement the waveform models \texttt{PhenomXAS} and \texttt{PhenomXHM} in the separate package \texttt{tiwave} to integrate waveform generation within the \texttt{taichi-lang} scope, making the entire computation accelerated and differentiable. To demonstrate the functionality of the tool, we use a typical signal from a massive black hole binary to perform the full Bayesian parameter estimation with the complete likelihood function for three scenarios: including a single detector using the waveform with only the dominant mode; a single detector using the waveform including higher modes; and a detector network with higher modes included. The results demonstrate that higher modes are essential in breaking degeneracies, and coincident observations by the detector network can significantly improve the measurement of source properties. Additionally, automatic differentiation provides an accurate way to obtain the Fisher matrix without manual fine-tuning of the finite difference step size. Using a subset of extrinsic parameters, we show that the approximated posteriors obtained by the Fisher matrix agree well with those derived from Bayesian parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Efficient parallel finite-element methods for planetary gravitation: DtN and multipole expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Poisson equation governing a planet's gravitational field is posed on the unbounded domain, $\mathbb{R}^3$, whereas finite-element computations require bounded meshes. We implement and compare three strategies for handling the infinite exterior in the finite-element method: (i) naive domain truncation; (ii) Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map on a truncated boundary; (iii) multipole expansion on a truncated boundary. While all these methods are known within the geophysical literature, we discuss their parallel implementations within modern open-source finite-element codes, focusing specifically on the widely-used MFEM package. We consider both calculating the gravitational potential for a static density structure and computing the linearised perturbation to the potential caused by a displacement field - a necessary step for coupling self-gravitation into planetary dynamics. In contrast to some earlier studies, we find that the domain truncation method can provide accurate solutions at an acceptable cost, with suitable coarsening of the mesh within the exterior domain. Nevertheless, the DtN and multipole methods provide superior accuracy at a lower cost within large-scale parallel geophysical simulations despite their need for non-local communication associated with spherical harmonic expansions. The DtN method, in particular, admits an efficient parallel implementation based on an MPI-communicator limited to processors that contain part of the mesh's outer boundary. A series of further illustrative calculations are provided to show the potential of the DtN and multipole methods within realistic geophysical modelling.</description>

      <title>Oxygen left behind: Atmospheric Enrichment due to Fractionation in Sub-Neptunes using BOREAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of exoplanetary atmospheres is strongly influenced by atmospheric escape, particularly for close-in planets. Fractionation during atmospheric loss can preferentially remove lighter elements such as hydrogen, while retaining heavier species like oxygen. In this study, we investigate how and under what conditions hydrodynamic escape and chemical fractionation jointly shape the mass and composition of exoplanet atmospheres, especially for mixed H2 + H2O atmospheres. We develop BOREAS, a self-consistent mass loss model coupling a 1D Parker wind formulation with a mass-dependent fractionation scheme, which we apply across a range of planet masses, radii, equilibrium temperatures, and incident XUV fluxes, allowing us to track hydrogen and oxygen escape rates at different snapshots in time. We find that oxygen is efficiently retained over most of the parameter space. Significant oxygen loss occurs under high incident XUV fluxes, while at intermediate fluxes oxygen loss is largely confined to low-gravity planets. Where oxygen is retained, irradiation is too weak to drive significant escape of hydrogen and thus limiting atmospheric enrichment. By contrast, our model predicts that sub-Neptunes undergo substantial atmospheric enrichment over approx. 200 Myr when hydrogen escape is efficient and accompanied by partial oxygen entrainment. Notably, our results imply that sub-Neptunes near the radius valley can evolve into water-rich planets, in agreement with GJ 9827 d. Present-day water-rich atmospheres may have originated from water-poor envelopes under some conditions, highlighting the need to include chemical fractionation in evolution models. BOREAS is publicly available.</description>

      <title>The democratic detrender: Ensemble-Based Removal of the Nuisance Signal in Stellar Time-Series Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate, precise, and computationally efficient removal of unwanted activity that exists as a combination of periodic, quasi-periodic, and non-periodic systematic trends in time-series photometric data is a critical step in exoplanet transit analysis. Throughout the years, many different modeling methods have been used for this process, often called "detrending." However, there is no community-wide consensus regarding the favored approach. In order to mitigate model dependency, we present an ensemble-based approach to detrending via community-of-models and the democratic detrender: a modular and scalable open-source coding package that implements ensemble detrending. The democratic detrender allows users to select from a number of packaged detrending methods (including cosine filtering, Gaussian processes, and polynomial fits) or provide their own set of detrended light curves via methods of their choosing. It then combines the individually detrended light curves into a single method marginalized light curve. Additionally, the democratic detrender inflates each data point's uncertainty based on the scatter between detrenders, thereby propagating model-selection uncertainty into the final light curve. This ensemble strategy does not guarantee improvement over the single best-performing detrending method, but it substantially reduces the risk of selecting a detrending solution that is poorly calibrated or overfit to noise.</description>

      <title>Impact of Charge Transfer Inefficiency on transit light-curves: A correction strategy for PLATO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PLATO is designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets around solar-type stars and to measure their radii with accuracy better than \(2\%\) via the transit method. Charge transfer inefficiency (CTI), a by-product of radiation damage to CCDs, can jeopardise this accuracy and therefore must be corrected. We assessed and quantified the impact of CTI on transit-depth measurements and developed a correction strategy that restores CTI-biased depths within the accuracy budget. Using a calibration dataset generated with PLATOSim to simulate a realistic stellar field, we modelled the parallel overscan signal as a sum of exponential decays and used least-squares fitting to infer the number of trap species and initial estimates for the release times (\(\tau_{r,k}\)). Smearing was modelled with an exponential-plus-constant function and removed on a column-wise basis. We modelled the spatial variation in trap density with a quadratic polynomial in radial distance from the focal-plane center. The polynomial coefficients (\(a_{p,k}\)), the well-fill power index (\(\beta\)), and the release times (\(\tau_{r,k}\)) were adjusted via an iterative application of the extended pixel edge response (EPER) method combined with a CTI correction algorithm, yielding the final calibration model. In the worst-case scenario (8-year mission, high-CTI zone), CTI induced a bias of about \(4\%\) in measured transit depth, reduced to a residual of \(0.06\%\) after correction - well within PLATO's accuracy requirements. From the calibrated parameters, we derived a correction scheme that brought the photometric measurements within PLATO's noise budget, ensuring that the mission's precision requirements are met.</description>

      <title>Simulated Operational Testing of the Prototype Implementation of the SOFIE Model: The 2025 Space Weather Prediction Testbed Exercise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CLEAR Space Weather Center of Excellence's solar energetic particle (SEP) model, SOlar wind with FIeld lines and Energetic particles (SOFIE), was run and evaluated on-site during the Space Weather Prediction Testbed (SWPT) exercise at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center (NOAA/SWPC) in May 2025. As a physics-based SEP model, SOFIE simulates the acceleration and transport of energetic particles by the coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock in the solar corona and inner heliosphere, and has been validated against historical events. However, questions remain regarding whether a physics-based model, traditionally considered computationally expensive, could meet operational needs. The SWPT exercise offered a valuable opportunity to evaluate SOFIE under simulated operational conditions. On-site interactive feedback from SWPC forecasters, Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG) console operators, Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) personnel, and Moon-to-Mars Space Weather Analysis Office (M2M SWAO) analysts led to significant strategic improvements in the model configuration. The simulation grid was optimized by combining a coarser background grid with higher-resolution regions along the CME path and toward Earth, reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy. In this work, we present the simulated operational performance of SOFIE and its capability to predict SEP fluxes significantly faster than real time. During the SWPT exercise, SOFIE completed a 4-day SEP simulation within 5 hours using 1,000 central processing unit cores, although the earliest SEP forecast was obtained a few hours after CME onset. This marks a milestone in demonstrating SOFIE's operational usefulness and robustness to support future human space exploration.</description>

      <title>The Astrometric Resoeccentric Degeneracy: Eccentric Single Planets Mimic 2:1 Resonant Planet Pairs in Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detections of long-period giant exoplanets will expand dramatically with Gaia Data Release 4 (DR4), but interpreting these signals will require care. We derive the astrometric resoeccentric degeneracy: an astrometric analogue of the well-known radial velocity degeneracy in which a single eccentric planet can mimic two circular planets near a 2:1 period ratio. To first order in eccentricity, the sky-projected motion of a single eccentric orbit decomposes into a fundamental mode and first harmonic with an amplitude proportional to that eccentricity. A pair of coplanar, circular planets in a 2:1 orbital resonance produces the same harmonic structure: the outer planet sets the fundamental mode, while the inner planet supplies an apparent first harmonic. We present a mapping between the harmonic amplitudes and effective eccentricity ($e_\mathrm{eff}$) of a single planet that mimics a 2:1 configuration, demonstrating that $e_\mathrm{eff} = \, 2^{1/3}(M_{p,2}/M_{p,1})$, the masses of the inner and outer planets, respectively. Using simulated Gaia data we show that (1) coplanar 2:1 systems are statistically indistinguishable from a single eccentric planet and (2) mutual inclination can break this degeneracy. This bias favors detecting mutually inclined systems, often fingerprints of a dynamically hot history -- traces for processes such as planet-planet scattering or secular chaos. Determining the planetary architectures in which this degeneracy holds will be essential for measuring cool-giant occurrence rates with Gaia and for inferring their dynamical evolution histories.</description>

      <title>Fastest or Significant: A Systematic Framework for Validating Global Minimum Variability Timescale Measurements of Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimum variability timescale (MVT) is a key observable used to probe the central engines of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) by constraining the emission region size and the outflow Lorentz factor. However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved.
  We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.</description>

      <title>Efficient reduction of stellar contamination and noise in planetary transmission spectra using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: JWST has enabled transmission spectroscopy at unprecedented precision, but stellar heterogeneities (spots and faculae) remain a dominant contamination source that can bias atmospheric retrievals if uncorrected. Aims: We present a fast, unsupervised methodology to reduce stellar contamination and instrument-specific noise in exoplanet transmission spectra using denoising autoencoders, improving the reliability of retrieved atmospheric parameters. Methods: We design and train denoising autoencoder architectures on large synthetic datasets of terrestrial (TRAPPIST-1e analogues) and sub-Neptune (K2-18b analogues) planets. Reconstruction quality is evaluated with the $\chi^2$ statistic over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, and atmospheric retrieval experiments on contaminated spectra are used to compare against standard correction approaches in accuracy and computational cost. Results: The autoencoders reconstruct uncontaminated spectra while preserving key molecular features, even at low S/N. In retrieval tests, pre-processing with denoising autoencoders reduces bias in inferred abundances relative to uncorrected baselines and matches the accuracy of simultaneous stellar-contamination fitting while reducing computational time by a factor of three to six. Conclusions: Denoising autoencoders provide an efficient alternative to conventional correction strategies and are promising components of future atmospheric characterization pipelines for both rocky and gaseous exoplanets.</description>
