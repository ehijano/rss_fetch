      <title>Boxicity of Zero Divisor Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $d$-dimensional box is the cartesian product $R_i\times\cdots\times R_d$ where each $R_i$ is a closed interval on the real line. The boxicity of a graph, denoted as $box(G)$, is the minimum integer $d\geq 0$ such that $G$ is the intersection graph of a collection of $d$-dimensional boxes. The study of graph classes associated with algebraic structures is a fascinating area where graph theory and algebra meet. A well-known class of graphs associated with rings is the class of zero divisor graphs introduced by Beck in 1988. Since then, this graph class has been studied extensively by several researchers. Denote by $Z(R)$ the set of zero divisors of a ring $R$. The zero divisor graph $\Gamma(R)$ for a ring $R$ is defined as the graph with the vertex set $V(\Gamma(R))=Z(R)$ and $E(\Gamma(R))=\{\{a_i,a_j\}:a_ia_j\in Z(R)\text{ and }a_ia_j=0 \}$. Let $N=\Pi_{i=1}^ap_i^{n_i}$ be the prime factorization of $N$. In Discrete Applied Mathematics 365 (2025), pp. 260-269, it was shown that $box(\Gamma(\mathbb{Z}_N))\leq\Pi_{i=1}^a(n_i+1)-\Pi_{i=1}^a(\lfloor n_i/2\rfloor+1)-1$. In this paper we exactly determine the boxicity of $\Gamma(\mathbb{Z}_N)$: We show that when $N\equiv 2\pmod 4$ and $N$ is not divisible by $p^3$ for any prime divisor $p$, we have $box(\Gamma(\mathbb{Z}_N))=a-1$. Otherwise $box(\Gamma(\mathbb{Z}_N))=a$. Suppose $R$ is a non-zero commutative ring with identity that is also a reduced ring and let $k$ be the size of the set of minimal prime ideals of $R$. In the same paper, it was showed that $box(\Gamma(R))\leq 2^k-2$. We improve this result by showing $\lfloor k/2\rfloor\leq box(\Gamma(R))\leq k$ with the same assumption on $R$. In this paper we also show that $a-1\leq\dim_{TH}(\Gamma(\mathbb{Z}_N))\leq a$ and $\lfloor k/2\rfloor\leq\dim_{TH}(\Gamma(R))\leq k$, where $\dim_{TH}$ is another dimensional parameter associated with graphs known as the threshold dimension.</description>

      <title>A Necessary Condition for Connectedness of Solutions to Integer Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integer linear system is a set of inequalities with integer constraints. The solution graph of an integer linear system is an undirected graph defined on the set of feasible solutions to the integer linear system. In this graph, a pair of feasible solutions is connected by an edge if the Hamming distance between them is one. In this paper, we consider a condition under which the solution graph is connected for any right-hand side vector. First, we prove that if the solution graph is connected for any right-hand side vector, then the coefficient matrix of the system does not contain some forbidden pattern as a submatrix. Next, we prove that if at least one of (i) the number of rows is at most 3, (ii) the number of columns is at most 2, (iii) the number of rows is 4 and the number of columns is 3 holds, then the condition that the coefficient matrix of the system does not contain the forbidden pattern is a sufficient condition under which the solution graph is connected for any right-hand side vector. This result is stronger than a known necessary and sufficient condition since the set of coefficient matrix dimensions is strictly larger.</description>

      <title>Which Phylogenetic Networks are Level-k Networks with Additional Arcs? Structure and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reticulate evolution gives rise to complex phylogenetic networks, making their interpretation challenging. A typical approach is to extract trees within such networks. Since Francis and Steel's seminal paper, "Which Phylogenetic Networks are Merely Trees with Additional Arcs?" (2015), tree-based phylogenetic networks and their support trees (spanning trees with the same root and leaf set as a given network) have been extensively studied. However, not all phylogenetic networks are tree-based, and for the study of reticulate evolution, it is often more biologically relevant to identify support networks rather than trees. This study generalizes Hayamizu's structure theorem for rooted binary phylogenetic networks, which yielded optimal algorithms for various computational problems on support trees, to extend the theoretical framework for support trees to support networks. This allows us to obtain a direct-product characterization of each of three sets: all, minimal, and minimum support networks, for a given network. Each characterization yields optimal algorithms for counting and generating the support networks of each type. Applications include a linear-time algorithm for finding a support network with the fewest reticulations (i.e., the minimum tier). We also provide exact and heuristic algorithms for finding a support network with the minimum level, both running in exponential time but practical across a reasonably wide range of reticulation numbers.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Sets for Proving Bounds on Rado Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a linear equation $\cal E$ of the form $ax + by = cz$ where $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive integers, the $k$-colour Rado number $R_k({\cal E})$ is the smallest positive integer $n$, if it exists, such that every $k$-colouring of the positive integers $\{1, 2, \dotsc, n\}$ contains a monochromatic solution to $\cal E$. In this paper, we consider $k = 3$ and the linear equations $ax + by = bz$ and $ax + ay = bz$. Using SAT solvers, we compute a number of previously unknown Rado numbers corresponding to these equations. We prove new general bounds on Rado numbers inspired by the satisfying assignments discovered by the SAT solver. Our proofs require extensive case-based analyses that are difficult to check for correctness by hand, so we automate checking the correctness of our proofs via an approach which makes use of a new tool we developed with support for operations on symbolically-defined sets -- e.g., unions or intersections of sets of the form $\{f(1), f(2), \dotsc, f(a)\}$ where $a$ is a symbolic variable and $f$ is a function possibly dependent on $a$. No computer algebra system that we are aware of currently has sufficiently capable support for symbolic sets, leading us to develop a tool supporting symbolic sets using the Python symbolic computation library SymPy coupled with the Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver Z3.</description>

      <title>Independent Set Enumeration in King Graphs by Tensor Network Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the enumeration of independent sets in king graphs of size $m \times n$, based on the tensor network contractions algorithm given in reference~\cite{tilEnum}. We transform the problem into Wang tiling enumeration within an $(m+1) \times (n+1)$ rectangle and compute the results for all cases where $m + n \leq 79$ using tensor network contraction algorithm, and provided an approximation for larger $m, n$.
  Using the same algorithm, we also enumerated independent sets with vertex number restrictions. Based on the results, we analyzed the vertex number that maximize the enumeration for each pair $(m, n)$. Additionally, we compute the corresponding weighted enumeration, where each independent set is weighted by the number of its vertices (i.e., the total sum of vertices over all independent sets). The approximations for larger $m, n$ are given as well.
  Our results have added thousands of new items to the OEIS sequences A089980 and A193580. In addition, the combinatorial problems above are closely related to the hard-core model in physics. We estimate some important constants based on the existing results, and the relative error between our estimation of the entropy constant and the existing results is less than $10^{-9}$.</description>

      <title>Ergodic properties of concurrent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A concurrent system is defined as a monoid action of a trace monoid on a finite set of states. Concurrent systems represent state models where the state is distributed and where state changes are local. Starting from a spectral property on the combinatorics of concurrent systems, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a Markov measure on the space of infinite trajectories relatively to any weight distributions. In turn, we obtain a combinatorial result by proving that the kernel of the associated M\"obius matrix has dimension 1; the M\"obius matrix extends in this context the M\"obius polynomial of a trace monoid. We study ergodic properties of irreducible concurrent systems and we prove a Strong law of large numbers. It allows us to introduce the speedup as a measurement of the average amount of concurrency within infinite trajectories. Examples are studied.</description>

      <title>On expectations and variances in the hard-core model on bounded degree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the study of the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model in two novel directions. One direction gives a tight lower bound in terms of individual vertex degrees, extending work of Sah, Sawhney, Stoner and Zhao which bounds the partition function. The other bounds the variance of the size of an independent set drawn from the model, which is strictly stronger than bounding the occupancy fraction.
  In the setting of triangle-free graphs, we make progress on a recent conjecture of Buys, van den Heuvel and Kang on extensions of Shearer's classic bounds on the independence number to the occupancy fraction of the hard-core model.
  Sufficiently strong lower bounds on both the expectation and the variance in triangle-free graphs have the potential to improve the known bounds on the off-diagonal Ramsey number $R(3,t)$, and to shed light on the algorithmic barrier one observes for independent sets in sparse random graphs.</description>

      <title>Causal Graph Dynamics and Kan Extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the one side, the formalism of Global Transformations comes with the claim of capturing any transformation of space that is local, synchronous and deterministic. The claim has been proven for different classes of models such as mesh refinements from computer graphics, Lindenmayer systems from morphogenesis modeling and cellular automata from biological, physical and parallel computation modeling. The Global Transformation formalism achieves this by using category theory for its genericity, and more precisely the notion of Kan extension to determine the global behaviors based on the local ones. On the other side, Causal Graph Dynamics describe the transformation of port graphs in a synchronous and deterministic way and has not yet being tackled. In this paper, we show the precise sense in which the claim of Global Transformations holds for them as well. This is done by showing different ways in which they can be expressed as Kan extensions, each of them highlighting different features of Causal Graph Dynamics. Along the way, this work uncovers the interesting class of Monotonic Causal Graph Dynamics and their universality among General Causal Graph Dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unique expansions in number systems via refinement equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the subdivision schemes theory, we develop a criterion to check if any natural number has at most one representation in the $n$-ary number system with a set of non-negative integer digits $A=\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n\}$ that contains zero. This uniqueness property is shown to be equivalent to a certain restriction on the roots of the trigonometric polynomial $\sum_{k=1}^n e^{-2\pi i a_k t}$. From this criterion, under a natural condition of irreducibility for $A$, we deduce that in case of prime $n$ the uniqueness holds if and only if the digits of $A$ are distinct modulo $n$, whereas for any composite $n$ we show that the latter condition is not necessary. We also establish the connection of this uniqueness to the semigroup freeness problem for affine integer functions of equal integer slope; this together with the two criteria allows to fill the gap in the work of D.Klarner on Erd\"os question about densities of affine integer orbits and establish a simple algorithm to check the freeness and the positivity of density when the slope is a prime number.</description>

      <title>GraphOmni: A Comprehensive and Extendable Benchmark Framework for Large Language Models on Graph-theoretic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces GraphOmni, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs on graph-theoretic tasks articulated in natural language. GraphOmni encompasses diverse graph types, serialization formats, and prompting schemes, significantly exceeding prior efforts in both scope and depth. Through extensive systematic evaluation, we identify critical interactions among these dimensions, demonstrating their substantial impact on model performance. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art models like Claude-3.5 and o4-mini consistently outperform other models, yet even these leading models exhibit substantial room for improvement. Performance variability is evident depending on the specific combinations of factors we considered, underscoring the necessity of comprehensive evaluations across these interconnected dimensions. Additionally, we observe distinct impacts of serialization and prompting strategies between open-source and closed-source models, encouraging the development of tailored approaches. Motivated by the findings, we also propose a reinforcement learning-inspired framework that adaptively selects the optimal factors influencing LLM reasoning capabilities. This flexible and extendable benchmark not only deepens our understanding of LLM performance on structured tasks but also provides a robust foundation for advancing research in LLM-based graph reasoning.</description>

      <title>Isomorphisms of unit distance graphs of layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any $\varepsilon\in (0,+\infty)$, consider the metric spaces $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon]$ in the Euclidean plane named layers or strips. B. Baslaugh in 1998 found the minimal width $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ of a layer such that its unit distance graph contains a cycle of a given odd length $k$. The first of the main results of this paper is the fact that the unit distance graphs of two layers $\mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon_1], \mathbb{R} \times [0,\varepsilon_2]$ are non-isomorphic for any different values $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2 \in (0,+\infty)$. We also get a multidimensional analogue of this theorem. For given $n,m \in \mathbb{N}, p \in (1,+\infty), \varepsilon \in (0,+\infty)$, we say that the metric space on $\mathbb{R}^n \times [0,\varepsilon]^m$ with the metric space distance generated by $l_p$-norm in $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$ is a layer $L(n,m,p,\varepsilon)$. We show that the unit distance graphs of multi-layers $L(n,m,p,\varepsilon_1), L(n,m,p,\varepsilon_2)$ are non-isomorphic for $\varepsilon_1 \neq \varepsilon_2$. This result is related to the Beckman-Quarles theorem of 1953 that any unit-preserving mapping of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an isometry, and to the rational analogue of this theorem obtained by A. Sokolov in 2023.</description>
