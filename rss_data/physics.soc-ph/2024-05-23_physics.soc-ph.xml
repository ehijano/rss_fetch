      <title>Integrating behavioral experimental findings into dynamical models to inform social change interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing global challenges -- from public health to climate change -- often involves stimulating the large-scale adoption of new products or behaviors. Research traditions that focus on individual decision making suggest that achieving this objective requires better identifying the drivers of individual adoption choices. On the other hand, computational approaches rooted in complexity science focus on maximizing the propagation of a given product or behavior throughout social networks of interconnected adopters. The integration of these two perspectives -- although advocated by several research communities -- has remained elusive so far. Here we show how achieving this integration could inform seeding policies to facilitate the large-scale adoption of a given behavior or product. Drawing on complex contagion and discrete choice theories, we propose a method to estimate individual-level thresholds to adoption, and validate its predictive power in two choice experiments. By integrating the estimated thresholds into computational simulations, we show that state-of-the-art seeding methods for social influence maximization might be suboptimal if they neglect individual-level behavioral drivers, which can be corrected through the proposed experimental method.</description>

      <title>What is a typical signalized intersection in a city? A pipeline for intersection data imputation from OpenStreetMap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signalized intersections, arguably the most complicated type of traffic scenario, are essential to urban mobility systems. With recent advancements in intelligent transportation technologies, signalized intersections have great prospects for making transportation greener, safer, and faster. Several studies have been conducted focusing on intersection-level control and optimization. However, arbitrarily structured signalized intersections that are often used do not represent the ground-truth distribution, and there is no standardized way that exists to extract information about real-world signalized intersections. As the largest open-source map in the world, OpenStreetMap (OSM) has been used by many transportation researchers for a variety of studies, including intersection-level research such as adaptive traffic signal control and eco-driving. However, the quality of OSM data has been a serious concern.
  In this paper, we propose a pipeline for effectively extracting information about signalized intersections from OSM and constructing a comprehensive dataset. We thoroughly discuss challenges related to this task and we propose our solution for each challenge. We also use Salt Lake City as an example to demonstrate the performance of our methods. The pipeline has been published as an open-source Python library so everyone can freely download and use it to facilitate their research. Hopefully, this paper can serve as a starting point that inspires more efforts to build a standardized and systematic data pipeline for various types of transportation problems.</description>

      <title>Through energy droughts: hydropower's ability to sustain a high output</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research has raised concerns about energy droughts in renewables-based energy systems. This study explores the ability of reservoir hydropower to sustain a high output and, thereby, mitigate such energy droughts. Using detailed modelling, we estimate that Swedish hydropower can sustain 67-92% of its installed capacity for 3 weeks, with higher values possible in springtime. The variation of the sustained output, equivalent to the capacity of 3-4 Swedish nuclear reactors, under-scores the importance of understanding the potential output levels when devising strategies to counteract energy droughts. Moreover, we find that regulations imposed on the flows in river bottlenecks hinder higher sustained output levels. With the upcoming renewal of environmental permits for hydropower plants in Sweden, these findings provide valuable insights for policymakers. Furthermore, the sustained output capabilities demonstrated in this study challenge the prevalent simplified representations of hydropower in energy models, suggesting a need for more-sophisticated modelling approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most pragmatic first step in the all-but-inevitable 3rd-millennium V\"olkerwanderung of humanity throughout the Solar System is the establishment of a permanent human presence on the Moon. This research examines: 1. the human, agricultural, and technical water needs of a 100-person, 500 m x 100 m x 6 m self-sustaining lunar colony; 2. choosing a strategic location for the moonbase; 3. a heat drill model by which the needed lunar water ice could be sublimated; and 4. the robust water treatment and recovery infrastructure and water management personnel that would be needed for a self-sustaining moonbase.</description>

      <title>Radial analysis and scaling of housing prices in French urban areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban scaling laws summarize how urban attributes evolve with city size. Recent criticism questions notably the aggregate view of this approach, which leads to neglecting the internal structure of cities. This is all the more relevant for housing prices due to their important variations across space. Based on a dataset compiling millions of real estate transactions over the period 2017-2021, we investigate the regularities of the radial (center-periphery) profiles of housing prices across cities, with respect to their size. Results are threefold. First, they corroborate prior findings in the urban scaling literature stating that largest cities agglomerate higher housing prices. Second, we find that housing price radial profiles scale in three dimensions with the power 1/5 of city population. After rescaling, great regularities between radial profiles can be observed, although some locational amenities have a significant impact on prices. Third, it appears that our rescaled profiles approach fails to explain housing price variations in the city center across cities. In fact, prices near the city center rise much faster with city size than those in the periphery. This has strong implications for low-income households seeking homeownership, because prohibitive prices in the center may contribute to pushing them out into peripheral locations.</description>

      <title>Initial Burst of Disruptive Efforts over Individual Scientific Careers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite persistent efforts to understand the dynamics of creativity of scientists over careers in terms of productivity, impact, and prize, little is known about the dynamics of scientists' disruptive efforts that affect individual academic careers and drive scientific advance. Drawing on millions of data over six decades and across nineteen disciplines, associating the publication records of individual scientists with the disruption index, we systematically quantify the temporal pattern of disruptive ideas over individual scientific careers, providing a detailed understanding of the macro phenomenon of scientific stagnation from the individual perspective. We start by checking the relationship between disruption-based and citation-based publication profiles. Next, we observe the finite inequality in the disruptive productivity of scientists, diminishing gradually as the level of disruption increases. We then identify the initial burst phenomenon in disruption dynamics. It is further revealed that while early engagement in high disruption frictions away initial productivity, compared to initial advantage in productivity or impact, initial high disruption ensures more subsequent academic viability evidenced by a longer career span and relatively final higher productivity, but does not necessarily guarantee academic success throughout careers. Further analysis shows that increasing disruptive work is uncorrelated to overall productivity but negatively correlated with the overall impact. However, increasing disruptive work in the early career is associated with higher overall productivity, yet lower overall productivity in the later career. Our research underscores the urgent need for a policy shift that encourages a balance between the pursuit of disruptive efforts and the achievement of impactful outcomes.</description>

      <title>The impact of temporal hydrogen regulation on hydrogen exporters and their domestic energy transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As global demand for green hydrogen rises, potential hydrogen exporters move into the spotlight. However, the large-scale installation of on-grid hydrogen electrolysis for export can have profound impacts on domestic energy prices and energy-related emissions. Our investigation explores the interplay of hydrogen exports, domestic energy transition and temporal hydrogen regulation, employing a sector-coupled energy model in Morocco. We find substantial co-benets of domestic climate change mitigation and hydrogen exports, whereby exports can reduce domestic electricity prices while mitigation reduces hydrogen export prices. However, increasing hydrogen exports quickly in a system that is still dominated by fossil fuels can substantially raise domestic electricity prices, if green hydrogen production is not regulated. Surprisingly, temporal matching of hydrogen production lowers domestic electricity cost by up to 31% while the effect on exporters is minimal. This policy instrument can steer the welfare (re-)distribution between hydrogen exporting firms, hydrogen importers, and domestic electricity consumers and hereby increases acceptance among actors.</description>

      <title>Increasing the Earth's Albedo: The K\"ohler Equation at Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08029v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing marine haze and clouds has been considered as a possible means of increasing the Earth's albedo. This would reduce Solar heating and global warming, counteracting the effects of the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gases. One proposed method of doing so would inject small droplets of seawater or condensation nuclei into the marine boundary layer, creating artificial haze and cloud. The equilibrium size of such droplets is described by the K\"{o}hler equation that includes the vapor pressure reduction attributable to the solute according to Raoult's law and the vapor pressure increase of a small droplet as a result of surface tension according to Kelvin. Here we apply this classic result to small droplets in the marine boundary layer, where the partial pressure of water vapor is less than the equilibrium vapor pressure because it is in equilibrium with the saline ocean. We calculate the equilibrium size of a droplet containing dissolved ions and find that the radius of a droplet of seawater shrinks greatly before it achieves equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Wealth inequality and utility: Effect evaluation of redistribution and consumption morals using macro-econophysical coupled approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing wealth inequality and increasing utility are critical issues. This study reveals the effects of redistribution and consumption morals on wealth inequality and utility. To this end, we present a novel approach that couples the dynamic model of capital, consumption, and utility in macroeconomics with the interaction model of joint business and redistribution in econophysics. With this approach, we calculate the capital (wealth), the utility based on consumption, and the Gini index of these inequality using redistribution and consumption thresholds as moral parameters. The results show that: under-redistribution and waste exacerbate inequality; conversely, over-redistribution and stinginess reduce utility; and a balanced moderate moral leads to achieve both reduced inequality and increased utility. These findings provide renewed economic and numerical support for the moral importance known from philosophy, anthropology, and religion. The revival of redistribution and consumption morals should promote the transformation to a human mutual-aid economy, as indicated by philosopher and anthropologist, instead of the capitalist economy that has produced the current inequality. The practical challenge is to implement bottom-up social business, on a foothold of worker coops and platform cooperatives as a community against the state and the market, with moral consensus and its operation.</description>

      <title>A generative model for community types in directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large complex networks are often organized into groups or communities. In this paper, we introduce and investigate a generative model of network evolution that reproduces all four pairwise community types that exist in directed networks: assortative, core-periphery, disassortative, and the newly introduced source-basin type. We fix the number of nodes and the community membership of each node, allowing node connectivity to change through rewiring mechanisms that depend on the community membership of the involved nodes. We determine the dependence of the community relationship on the model parameters using a mean-field solution. It reveals that a difference in the swap probabilities of the two communities is a necessary condition to obtain a core-periphery relationship and that a difference in the average in-degree of the communities is a necessary condition for a source-basin relationship. More generally, our analysis reveals multiple possible scenarios for the transition between the different structure types, and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the observation of the different types of communities in network data.</description>

      <title>Representative electricity price profiles for European day-ahead and intraday spot markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to construct representative price profiles of the day-ahead (DA) and the intraday (ID) electricity spot markets and use this method to provide examples of ready-to-use price data sets. In contrast to common scenario generation approaches, the method is deterministic and relies on a small number of degrees of freedom, with the aim to be well defined and easy to use. We thereby target an enhanced comparability of future research studies on demand-side management and energy cost optimization. We construct the price profiles based on historical time series from the spot markets of interest, e.g., European Power Exchange (EPEX) spot. To this end, we extract key price components from the data while also accounting for known dominant mechanisms in the price variation. Further, the method is able to preserve key statistical features of the historical data (e.g., mean and standard deviation) when constructing the benchmark profile. Finally, our approach ensures comparability of ID and DA price profiles by design, as their cumulative (integral) price can be made identical if needed.</description>

      <title>Effective &amp; Ethical Mentorship in Physics and Astronomy through Grassroots Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective and ethical mentorship practices are crucial to improving recruitment and retention especially for historically minoritized groups (HMGs). Spectrum is a diversity, inclusion, equity, and accessibility (DEIA) grassroots organization committed to empowering equitable excellence through sustainable change. By improving transparency and DEIA within the fields of physics and astronomy, we can empower the next generation of diverse scientists and increase field retention. Starting within our home department at George Mason University and moving outwards, we ensure our students leave as advocates for DEIA and AJEDI (access, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion) through education and mentorship. Spectrum is providing professionally trained peer mentors to aid students in all facets of their academic and personal lives. Although the peer mentoring program existed since the creation of Spectrum in Spring 2020, we have recently developed and implemented a formal mentorship training for both student and faculty mentors thus increasing the quality, trustworthiness, and confidence of our mentors. Using the latest mentorship research available, this training is developed by Spectrum for George Mason University, with the ability to implement the training at any institution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure of a complex network plays a crucial role in determining its dynamical properties. In this work, we show that the the degree to which a network is directed and hierarchically organised is closely associated with the degree to which its dynamics break detailed balance and produce entropy. We consider a range of dynamical processes and show how different directed network features affect their entropy production rate. We begin with an analytical treatment of a 2-node network followed by numerical simulations of synthetic networks using the preferential attachment and Erd\"os-Renyi algorithms. Next, we analyse a collection of 97 empirical networks to determine the effect of complex real-world topologies. Finally, we present a simple method for inferring broken detailed balance and directed network structure from multivariate time-series and apply our method to identify non-equilibrium dynamics and hierarchical organisation in both human neuroimaging and financial time-series. Overall, our results shed light on the consequences of directed network structure on non-equilibrium dynamics and highlight the importance and ubiquity of hierarchical organisation and non-equilibrium dynamics in real-world systems.</description>

Abstract: Evolutionary game theory has impacted many fields of research by providing a mathematical framework for studying the evolution and maintenance of social and moral behaviors. This success is owed in large part to the demonstration that the central equation of this theory - the replicator equation - is the deterministic limit of a stochastic imitation (social learning) dynamics. Here we offer an alternative elementary proof of this result, which holds for the scenario where players compare their instantaneous (not average) payoffs to decide whether to maintain or change their strategies, and only more successful individuals can be imitated.</description>

Abstract: Tertiary buildings could be an important lever to meet the goals necessitated by the energy transition. The availability of high-quality datasets from this sector will be a crucial enabler in meeting these goals by developing and testing new energy management approaches in the buildings. In this paper, we present the thermal energy datasets available and published online for the PREDIS-MHI zone of the GreEn-ER building, a tertiary building with more than a thousand sensors used for research, teaching, and administrative activities in Grenoble. PREDIS-MHI platform is a net-zero sub-section that is energetically isolated from the rest of the building. Its data has been used in a wide range of applications from indoor temperature forecasting, thermal simulation calibration, and even occupant comfort experiments</description>

Abstract: Uni-directional social interactions are ubiquitous in real social networks whereas undirected interactions are intensively studied. We establish a voter model in a dynamical directed network. We analytically obtain the degree distribution of the evolving network at any given time. Furthermore, we find that the average degree is captured by an emergent game. On the other hand, we find that the fate of opinions is captured by another emergent game. Beyond expectation, the two emergent games are typically different due to the unidirectionality of the evolving networks. The Nash equilibrium analysis of the two games facilitates us to give the criterion under which the minority opinion with few disciples initially takes over the population eventually for in-group bias. Our work fosters the understanding of opinion dynamics ranging from methodology to research content.</description>

      <title>Mapping low-resolution edges to high-resolution paths: the case of traffic measurements in cities</title>

Abstract: We consider the following problem : we have a high-resolution street network of a given city, and low-resolution measurements of traffic within this city. We want to associate to each measurement the set of streets corresponding to the observed traffic. To do so, we take benefit of specific properties of these data to match measured links to links in the street network. We propose several success criteria for the obtained matching. They show that the matching algorithm generally performs very well, and they give complementary ways to detect data discrepancies that makes any matching highly dubious.</description>

      <title>Initialisation and Topology Effects in Decentralised Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15855</link>

Abstract: Fully decentralised federated learning enables collaborative training of individual machine learning models on distributed devices on a communication network while keeping the training data localised. This approach enhances data privacy and eliminates both the single point of failure and the necessity for central coordination. Our research highlights that the effectiveness of decentralised federated learning is significantly influenced by the network topology of connected devices. We propose a strategy for uncoordinated initialisation of the artificial neural networks, which leverages the distribution of eigenvector centralities of the nodes of the underlying communication network, leading to a radically improved training efficiency. Additionally, our study explores the scaling behaviour and choice of environmental parameters under our proposed initialisation strategy. This work paves the way for more efficient and scalable artificial neural network training in a distributed and uncoordinated environment, offering a deeper understanding of the intertwining roles of network structure and learning dynamics.</description>
