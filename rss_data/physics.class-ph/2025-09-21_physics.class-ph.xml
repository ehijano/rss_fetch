      <title>Classical Mechanics on Finite Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between topology and quantum mechanics is one of the cornerstones of modern physics. Several examples of current interest like the Aharonov-Bohm effect in quantum mechanics, monopoles and instantons in quantum field theory, the quantum Hall effect in condensed matter physics, anyons in topological quantum computation, and the AdS-CFT correspondence in string theory illustrate this connection.
  Since classical mechanics is a limiting case of quantum mechanics, it behooves us to ask how topology impacts classical mechanics. Topological considerations do play an important role in the classical context too, for example in fluid vortices and atmospheric dynamics.
  With a desire to understand this connection more deeply, we study classical mechanics on finite spaces. Towards this end, we use the formalism developed by Bering and identify the corrections to the Klein-Gordon equation due to the presence of the boundary. We solve the modified equation in various dimensions under suitable assumptions of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Pedagogical study of the image of a magnetic dipole in front of a superconducting sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of images to solve certain electrostatic boundary-value problems is taught worldwide in undergraduate-level physics courses. Though it is also possible to employ this technique for solving magnetostatic boundary value problems, examples of this usage are rarely found in textbooks or physics pedagogy literature. In particular, the problem of finding the field due to a magnetic dipole kept in front of a superconducting sphere is an interesting one, because (i) it helps the students to compare with the grounded conducting sphere image problem in electrostatics, and (ii) offers a greater degree of difficulty since the source is a dipole (vector), rather than an electric charge (scalar). The present work demonstrates an intuitive way of solving the problem. The case in which the source dipole is oriented radially with respect to the sphere is solved with a single dipole image. In the case of the transverse orientation of the source dipole, we model the dipole as a current loop. Then, we find the image of the radial and transverse current elements that satisfy the boundary conditions. Then, we show that this method can be used to deduce the form of the image dipoles when the dipole is oriented in the transverse direction. This method is very much intuitive and accessible for undergraduate-level students.</description>
