      <title>Simulating X-ray absorption spectroscopy of battery materials on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a crucial experimental technique for elucidating the mechanisms of structural degradation in battery materials. However, extracting information from the measured spectrum is challenging without high-quality simulations. In this work, we propose simulating near-edge X-ray absorption spectra as a promising application for quantum computing. It is attractive due to the ultralocal nature of X-ray absorption that significantly reduces the sizes of problems to be simulated, and because of the classical hardness of simulating spectra. We describe three quantum algorithms to compute the X-ray absorption spectrum and provide their asymptotic cost. One of these is a Monte-Carlo based time-domain algorithm, which is cost-friendly to early fault-tolerant quantum computers. We then apply the framework to an industrially relevant example, a CAS(22e,18o) active space for an O-Mn cluster in a Li-excess battery cathode, showing that practically useful simulations could be obtained with much fewer qubits and gates than ground-state energy estimation of the same material.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the entanglement evolution of three-qubit states in the presence of a spin chain environment. Utilizing negativity as a metric for entanglement assessment, we focus on the GHZ, W, and W_zeta quantum states as the initial system states. We explore and analyze the entanglement dynamics of these states based on various parameters.</description>

      <title>Microstructured optical fibres for quantum applications: perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in the development and applications of microstructured optical fibres for quantum technologies is summarised. The optical nonlinearity of solid-core and gas-filled hollow-core fibres provides a valuable medium for the generation of quantum resource states, as well as for quantum frequency conversion between the operating wavelengths of existing quantum photonic material architectures. The low loss, low latency and low dispersion of hollow-core fibres make these fibres particularly attractive for both short- and long-distance links in quantum networks. Hollow-core fibres also promise to replace free-space optical components in a wide range of atomic experiments.</description>

      <title>Enforcing exact permutation and rotational symmetries in the application of quantum neural network on point cloud datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the field of quantum machine learning have promoted the idea of incorporating physical symmetries in the structure of quantum circuits. A crucial milestone in this area is the realization of $S_{n}$-permutation equivariant quantum neural networks (QNN) that are equivariant under permutations of input objects. In this work, we focus on encoding the rotational symmetry of point cloud datasets into the QNN. The key insight of the approach is that all rotationally invariant functions with vector inputs are equivalent to a function with inputs of vector inner products. We provide a novel structure of QNN that is exactly invariant to both rotations and permutations, with its efficacy demonstrated numerically in the problems of two-dimensional image classifications and identifying high-energy particle decays, produced by proton-proton collisions, with the $SO(1,3)$ Lorentz symmetry.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantum controls robust against detuning error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of quantum systems is one of the most important milestones for achieving practical quantum technologies, such as computation, sensing, and communication. Several factors deteriorate the control precision and thus their suppression is strongly demanded. One of the dominant factors is systematic errors, which are caused by discord between an expected parameter in control and its actual value. Error-robust control sequences, known as composite pulses, have been invented in the field of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). These sequences mainly focus on the suppression of errors in one-qubit control. The one-qubit control, which is the most fundamental in a wide range of quantum technologies, often suffers from detuning error. As there are many possible control sequences robust against the detuning error, it will practically be important to find ``optimal" robust controls with respect to several cost functions such as time required for operation, and pulse-area during the operation, which corresponds to the energy necessary for control. In this paper, we utilize the Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP), a tool for solving optimization problems under inequality constraints, to solve the time and pulse-area optimization problems. We analytically obtain pulse-area optimal controls robust against the detuning error. Moreover, we found that short-CORPSE, which is the shortest known composite pulse so far, is a probable candidate of the time optimal solution according to the PMP. We evaluate the performance of the pulse-area optimal robust control and the short-CORPSE, comparing with that of the direct operation.</description>

      <title>QuaLITi: Quantum Machine Learning Hardware Selection for Inferencing with Top-Tier Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an accelerating field of study that leverages the principles of quantum computing to enhance and innovate within machine learning methodologies. However, Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers suffer from noise that corrupts the quantum states of the qubits and affects the training and inferencing accuracy. Furthermore, quantum computers have long access queues. A single execution with a pre-defined number of shots can take hours just to reach the top of the wait queue, which is especially disadvantageous to Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms that are iterative in nature. Many vendors provide access to a suite of quantum hardware with varied qubit technologies, number of qubits, coupling architectures, and noise characteristics. However, present QML algorithms do not use them for the training procedure and often rely on local noiseless/noisy simulators due to cost and training timing overhead on real hardware. Additionally, inferencing is generally performed on reduced datasets with fewer datapoints. Taking these constraints into account, we perform a study to maximize the inferencing performance of QML workloads based on the choice of hardware selection. Specifically, we perform a detailed analysis of quantum classifiers (both training and inference through the lens of hardware queue wait times) on Iris and reduced Digits datasets under noise and varied conditions such as different hardware and coupling maps. We show that using multiple readily available hardware for training rather than relying on a single hardware, especially if it has a long queue depth of pending jobs, can lead to a performance impact of only 3-4% while providing up to 45X reduction in training wait time.</description>

      <title>Storage and retrieval of von Neumann measurements via indefinite causal order structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the problem of learning an unknown von Neumann measurement of dimension $d$ using indefinite causal structures. In the considered scenario, we have access to $N$ copies of the measurement. We use formalism of process matrices to store information about the given measurement, that later will be used to reproduce its best possible approximation. Our goal is to compute the maximum value of the average fidelity function $F_d(N)$ of our procedure. We prove that $F_d(N) = 1 - \Theta \left( \frac{1}{N^2}\right)$ for arbitrary but fixed dimension $d$. Furthermore, we present the SDP program for computing $F_d(N)$. Basing on the numerical investigation, we show that for the qubit von Neumann measurements using indefinite causal learning structures provide better approximation than quantum networks, starting from $N \ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Capacities of a two-parameter family of noisy Werner-Holevo channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $d=2j+1$ dimensions, the Landau-Streater quantum channel is defined on the basis of spin $j$ representation of the $su(2)$ algebra. Only for $j=1$, this channel is equivalent to the Werner-Holevo channel and enjoys covariance properties with respect to the group $SU(3)$. We extend this class of channels to higher dimensions in a way which is based on the Lie algebra $so(d)$ and $su(d)$. As a result it retains its equivalence to the Werner-Holevo channel in arbitrary dimensions. The resulting channel is covariant with respect to the unitary group $SU(d)$. We then modify this channel in a way which can act as a noisy channel on qudits. The resulting modified channel now interpolates between the identity channel and the Werner-Holevo channel and its covariance is reduced to the subgroup of orthogonal matrices $SO(d)$. We then investigate some of the propeties of the resulting two-parameter family of channels, including their spectrum, their regions of lack of indivisibility, their one-shot classical capacity, entanglement-assisted capacity and the closed form of their complement channel and a possible lower bound for their quantum capacity.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Train: Rethinking Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning in the Model Compression Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduces the Quantum-Train(QT) framework, a novel approach that integrates quantum computing with classical machine learning algorithms to address significant challenges in data encoding, model compression, and inference hardware requirements. Even with a slight decrease in accuracy, QT achieves remarkable results by employing a quantum neural network alongside a classical mapping model, which significantly reduces the parameter count from $M$ to $O(\text{polylog} (M))$ during training. Our experiments demonstrate QT's effectiveness in classification tasks, offering insights into its potential to revolutionize machine learning by leveraging quantum computational advantages. This approach not only improves model efficiency but also reduces generalization errors, showcasing QT's potential across various machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>New Uncertainty Principle for a particle on a Torus Knot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work deals with quantum Uncertainty Relations (UR) subjected to the Standard Deviations (SD) of the relevant dynamical variables for a particle constrained to move on a torus knot. It is important to note that these variables have to obey the two distinct periodicities of the knotted paths embedded on the torus. We compute generalized forms of the SDs and the subsequent URs (following the Kennard-Robertson formalism). These quantities explicitly involve the torus parameters and the knot parameters where restrictions on the latter have to be taken into account. These induce restrictions on the possible form of wave functions that are used to calculate the SDs and URs and in our simple example, two distinct SDs and URs are possible. In a certain limit (thin torus limit), our results will reduce to the results for a particle moving in a circle.
  An interesting fact emerges that in the case of the SDs and URs, the local geometry of the knots plays the decisive role and not their topological properties.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of Free Fermions with a Random Matrix as a One-Body Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a quantum system of large size $N$ and its subsystem of size $L$ assuming that $N$ is much larger than $L$, which can also be sufficiently large, i.e., $1 \ll L \lesssim N $. A widely accepted mathematical version of this heuristic inequality is the asymptotic regime of successive limits: first the macroscopic limit $N \to \infty$, then an asymptotic analysis of the entanglement entropy as $L \to \infty$. In this paper, we consider another version of the above heuristic inequality: the regime of asymptotically proportional $L$ and $N$, i.e., the simultaneous limits $L \to \infty,\; N \to \infty, L/N \to \lambda &gt;0$. Specifically, we consider the system of free fermions which is in its ground state and such that its one-body Hamiltonian is a large random matrix, that is often used to model the long-range hopping. By using random matrix theory, we show that in this case, the entanglement entropy obeys the volume law known for systems with short-ranged hopping but described either by a mixed state or a pure strongly excited state of the Hamiltonian. We also give a streamlined proof of Page's formula for the entanglement entropy of the black hole radiation for a wide class of typical ground states, thereby proving the universality of the formula.</description>

      <title>Charging a Quantum Battery Mediated by Parity-Deformed Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of parity deformation of the environmental field modes on the wireless charging performance of a qubit-based open quantum battery (QB) consisting of a qubit-battery and a qubit-charger, where there is no direct interaction between the qubits and battery is charged by the mediation of the environment. The parity deformation introduces field nonlinearities as well as qubit-environment intensity-dependent couplings. We analyze in detail charging characteristics, including the charging energy, efficiency and ergotropy in both the weak and strong coupling regimes, and show that the memory effects of mediator environment are critical in enhancing the charging performance. In the strong coupling regime, parity deformation of the environment fields can further trigger non-Markovian quantum memory of the charger-battery system, thereby enhancing the QB charging performance based on the non-Markovianity. Surprisingly, if the charging process is Markovian in the absence of the parity deformation, parity deformation is able to induce memory effects in the charger-battery dynamics and transforms the Markovian process to the non-Markovian one. This work highlights that proper engineering of the coupling to an environment can introduce an extra quantum memory source to the underlying charging process in favor of environment-mediated charging of the battery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces quantum edge detection, aimed at locating boundaries of quantum domains where all particles share the same pure state. Focusing on the 1D scenario of a string of particles, we develop an optimal protocol for quantum edge detection, efficiently computing its success probability through Schur-Weyl duality and semidefinite programming techniques. We analyze the behavior of the success probability as a function of the string length and local dimension, with emphasis in the limit of long strings. We present a protocol based on square root measurement, which proves asymptotically optimal. Additionally, we explore a mixed quantum change point detection scenario where the state of particles transitions from known to unknown, which may find practical applications in detecting malfunctions in quantum devices</description>

      <title>Symmetrically Threaded SQUIDs As Next Generation Kerr-cat Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kerr-cat qubits are bosonic qubits with autonomous protection against bit-flips. They have been studied widely using driven Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLement (SNAIL) oscillators. We theoretically investigate an alternate circuit for the Kerr-cat qubit, namely Symmetrically Threaded SQUIDs (STS). We perform the circuit analysis and derive the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKLS) master equation for the Kerr-cat qubit attached to a thermal environment. We find that the lifetime time of the coherent states ($T_\alpha$) of the Kerr-cat qubit is the same in both the STS and SNAIL circuits for weak Kerr nonlinearity. However, the STS Kerr-cat qubits have the additional benefit of being resistant against higher order photon dissipation effects, resulting in significantly longer $T_\alpha$ even with stronger Kerr nonlinearity on the order of $10{~\rm MHz}$. We also examine the effects of strong flux driving and asymmetric Josephson junctions on $T_\alpha$. Unlike the SNAIL design, we find a dip in $T_\alpha$ of the STS Kerr-cat qubit for weak two-photon drive. However, we show that the dip can be mitigated by applying a suitable drive-dependent detuning. With the proposed design and considering a cat size of 10 photons, we predict $T_\alpha$ of the order of tens of milliseconds even in the presence of multi-photon heating and dephasing effects. The robustness of the STS Kerr-cat qubit makes it a promising component for fault-tolerant quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Conditions for enhancement of chemical reactions in gas phase inside a dark cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing chemical reactions, such as $A+B \to [\textit{activated complex}]^\# \to C+D$, in gas phase through its coupling to quantum-electrodynamics (QED) modes in a dark cavity is investigated. The main result is that the enhancement of the reaction rate by a dark cavity is for asymmetric reactions (products different from reactants.) Notice that in addition to the cavity been dark, the reactants are in their ground electronic and vibrational states, i.e., it is indeed dark. Theoretical derivation, utilizing the non-Hermitian formalism of quantum mechanics (NHQM), provides conditions and guidelines for selecting the proper type of reactions that can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Nevertheless, the time-dependent simulations of such experiments can be carried out using the standard (Hermitian) scattering theory (but including the conditions derived via NHQM). We believe that this work opens a gate to new types of studies and hopefully helps to close the gap between theory and experiments in this fascinating, relatively new field of research. As an example, we demonstrate that the asymmetric reaction rates of $O+D_2\to [ODD]^{\#} \to OD+D$ and $H+ArCl \to [ArHCl]^{\#} \to H+Ar+Cl$ can be enhanced by a dark cavity. Contrary, the dark cavity effect on the symmetric reaction of hydrogen exchange in methane will be negligible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Errors are the fundamental barrier to the development of quantum systems. Quantum networks are complex systems formed by the interconnection of multiple components and suffer from error accumulation. Characterizing errors introduced by quantum network components becomes a fundamental task to overcome their depleting effects in quantum communication. Quantum Network Tomography (QNT) addresses end-to-end characterization of link errors in quantum networks. It is a tool for building error-aware applications, network management, and system validation. We provide an overview of QNT and its initial results for characterizing quantum star networks. We apply a previously defined QNT protocol for estimating bit-flip channels to estimate depolarizing channels. We analyze the performance of our estimators numerically by assessing the Quantum Cram\`er-Rao Bound (QCRB) and the Mean Square Error (MSE) in the finite sample regime. Finally, we provide a discussion on current challenges in the field of QNT and elicit exciting research directions for future investigation.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Approach and Coherent States for the Modified Dirac Oscillator in Curved Spacetime with Spin and Pseudospin Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we investigate and solve exactly the modified Dirac oscillator in curved spacetime with spin and pseudospin symmetries through an algebraic approach. By focusing on the radial part of this problem, we use the Schr\"odinger factorization method to show that this problem possesses an SU(1; 1) symmetry. This symmetry allowed us to obtain the wave functions and their corresponding energy spectrum. From these results, we calculate the radial coherent states of the modified Dirac oscillator and their temporal evolution in the spin and pseudospin limits, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantum Neural Networks for Solving Power System Transient Simulation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing, leveraging principles of quantum mechanics, represents a transformative approach in computational methodologies, offering significant enhancements over traditional classical systems. This study tackles the complex and computationally demanding task of simulating power system transients through solving differential algebraic equations (DAEs). We introduce two novel Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs): the Sinusoidal-Friendly QNN and the Polynomial-Friendly QNN, proposing them as effective alternatives to conventional simulation techniques. Our application of these QNNs successfully simulates two small power systems, demonstrating their potential to achieve good accuracy. We further explore various configurations, including time intervals, training points, and the selection of classical optimizers, to optimize the solving of DAEs using QNNs. This research not only marks a pioneering effort in applying quantum computing to power system simulations but also expands the potential of quantum technologies in addressing intricate engineering challenges.</description>

      <title>Quantum sampling algorithms for quantum state preparation and matrix block-encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problems of quantum state preparation and matrix block-encoding are ubiquitous in quantum computing: they are crucial parts of various quantum algorithms for the purpose for initial state preparation as well as loading problem relevant data. We first present an algorithm based on QRS that prepares a quantum state $|\psi_f\rangle \propto \sum^N_{x=1} f(x)|x\rangle$. When combined with efficient reference states the algorithm reduces the cost of quantum state preparation substantially, if certain criteria on $f$ are met. When the preparation of the reference state is not the dominant cost, and the function $f$ and relevant properties are efficiently computable or provided otherwise with cost $o(N)$, the QRS-based method outperforms the generic state preparation algorithm, which has cost $O(N)$. We demonstrate the detailed performance (in terms of the number of Toffoli gates) of the QRS-based algorithm for quantum states commonly appearing in quantum applications, e.g., those with coefficients that obey power law decay, Gaussian, and hyperbolic tangent, and compare it with other methods. Then, we adapt QRS techniques to the matrix block-encoding problem and introduce a QRS-based algorithm for block-encoding a given matrix $A = \sum_{ij} A_{ij} |i\rangle \langle j|$. We work out rescaling factors for different access models, which encode how the information about the matrix is provided to the quantum computer. We exemplify these results for a particular Toeplitz matrix with elements $A_{{\mathbf{ij}}}= 1/\|{\mathbf{i}}-{\mathbf{j}}\|^2$, which appears in quantum chemistry, and PDE applications, e.g., when the Coulomb interaction is involved. Our work unifies, and in certain ways goes beyond, various quantum state preparation and matrix block-encoding methods in the literature, and gives detailed performance analysis of important examples that appear in quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Disturbance Evaluation Circuit in Quantum Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the uncertainty principle, every quantum measurement accompanies disturbance. In particular, accurate sequential measurements need the accurate control of disturbance. However, the correct role of disturbance in the uncertainty principle has been known only recently. Understanding the disturbance is crucial for understanding the fundamentals of physics, and accurately evaluating the disturbance is important for quantum technologies such as quantum information processing and quantum metrology. Therefore, the experimental evaluation of the disturbance is a significant challenge in those fields. In this study, we propose a novel evaluation method for the quantum root-mean-square (QRMS) disturbance and compare its performance with the existing approaches, known as the three-state method (TSM) and the weak measurement method (WMM). Our method establishes a correspondence between the QRMS disturbance of the measurement and the second-order derivative of the decoherence induced in a newly introduced weak probe system with respect to the coupling strength of the weak interaction at its zero-limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison with the other two through a simulation and experiment using a quantum computer. The results capture the key features of the TSM, WMM, and our method, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of these methods.</description>

      <title>Ion-Based Quantum Computing Hardware: Performance and End-User Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series of papers providing an overview of different quantum computing hardware platforms from an industrial end-user perspective. It follows our first paper on neutral-atom quantum computing.
  In the present paper, we provide a survey on the current state-of-the-art in trapped-ion quantum computing, taking up again the perspective of an industrial end-user. To this end, our paper covers, on the one hand, a comprehensive introduction to the physical foundations and mechanisms that play an important role in operating a trapped-ion quantum computer. On the other hand, we provide an overview of the key performance metrics that best describe and characterise such a device's current computing capability. These metrics encompass performance indicators such as qubit numbers, gate times and errors, native gate sets, qubit stability and scalability as well as considerations regarding the general qubit types and trap architectures. In order to ensure that these metrics reflect the current state of trapped-ion quantum computing as accurate as possible, they have been obtained by both an extensive review of recent literature and, more importantly, from discussions with various quantum hardware vendors in the field. We combine these factors and provide - again from an industrial end-user perspective - an overview of what is currently possible with trapped-ion quantum computers, which algorithms and problems are especially suitable for this platform, what are the relevant end-to-end wall clock times for calculations, and what might be possible with future fault-tolerant trapped-ion quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a set of private and secure delegated quantum computing protocols and techniques tailored to user-level and industry-level use cases, depending on the computational resources available to the client, the specific privacy needs required, and the type of algorithm. Our protocols are presented at a high level as they are independent of the particular algorithm used for such encryption and decryption processes. Additionally, we propose a method to verify the correct execution of operations by the external server.</description>

      <title>Polyadic Cantor potential of minimum lacunarity: Special case of super periodic generalized unified Cantor potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To bridge the fractal and non-fractal potentials we propose a new generalised version of unified Cantor potential (GUCP), where $\frac{1}{\rho^{\mu+\nu G}}\ \ \ (\mu,\ \nu $ are real numbers) portion of the potential is removed and is characterised by a integer N which represents the potential count at the stage $S=1$. Notably, the polyadic Cantor potential (PCP) with minimal lacunarity is a specific instance within the GUCP paradigm. Employing the super periodic potential (SPP) formalism, we calculate a closed-form expression for transmission probability $T_{S}(k, N)$ using the $q$-Pochhammer symbol. We further show that GUCP system exhibits sharp transmission resonances, differing from traditional quantum systems. Our analysis reveals saturation in the transmission profile with evolving stages $S$ and establishes a significant scaling relationship between reflection probability and wave-vector ($k$) through analytical derivations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random unitaries are an important resource for quantum information processing. While their universal properties have been thoroughly analyzed, it is not known what happens to these properties when the unitaries are sampled on the present-day noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. We implement parameterized circuits, which have been proposed as a means to generate random unitaries, on a transmon platform and model these implementations as quantum maps. To retrieve the maps, a machine-learning assisted tomography is used. We find the spectrum of a map to be either an annulus or a disk depending on the circuit depth and detect an annulus-disk transition. By their spectral properties, the retrieved maps appear to be very similar to a recently introduced ensemble of random maps, for which spectral densities can be analytically evaluated.</description>

      <title>Attention to Quantum Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imminent era of error-corrected quantum computing urgently demands robust methods to characterize complex quantum states, even from limited and noisy measurements. We introduce the Quantum Attention Network (QuAN), a versatile classical AI framework leveraging the power of attention mechanisms specifically tailored to address the unique challenges of learning quantum complexity. Inspired by large language models, QuAN treats measurement snapshots as tokens while respecting their permutation invariance. Combined with a novel parameter-efficient mini-set self-attention block (MSSAB), such data structure enables QuAN to access high-order moments of the bit-string distribution and preferentially attend to less noisy snapshots. We rigorously test QuAN across three distinct quantum simulation settings: driven hard-core Bose-Hubbard model, random quantum circuits, and the toric code under coherent and incoherent noise. QuAN directly learns the growth in entanglement and state complexity from experimentally obtained computational basis measurements. In particular, it learns the growth in complexity of random circuit data upon increasing depth from noisy experimental data. Taken to a regime inaccessible by existing theory, QuAN unveils the complete phase diagram for noisy toric code data as a function of both noise types. This breakthrough highlights the transformative potential of using purposefully designed AI-driven solutions to assist quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic enhancement of a quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum system which can store energy, and from which one can extract useful work, is known as a quantum battery. Such a device raises interesting issues surrounding how quantum physics can provide certain advantages in the charging, energy storage or discharging of the quantum battery as compared to their classical equivalents. However, the pernicious effect of dissipation degrades the performance of any realistic battery. Here we show how one can circumvent this problem of energy loss by proposing a quantum battery model which benefits from quantum squeezing. Namely, charging the battery quadratically with a short temporal pulse induces a hyperbolic enhancement in the stored energy, such that the dissipation present becomes essentially negligible in comparison. Furthermore, we show that when the driving is strong enough the useful work which can be extracted from the quantum battery, that is the ergotropy, is exactly equal to the stored energy. These impressive properties imply a highly efficient quantum energetic device with abundant amounts of ergotropy. Our theoretical results suggest a possible route to realizing high-performance quantum batteries, which could be realized in a variety of platforms exploiting quantum continuous variables.</description>

      <title>Crossing The Gap Using Variational Quantum Eigensolver: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the evolving domain of quantum computational chemistry, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) has been developed to explore not only the ground state but also the excited states of molecules. In this study, we compare the performance of Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) and Subspace-Search Variational Quantum Eigensolver (SSVQE) methods in determining the low-lying excited states of $LiH$. Our investigation reveals that while VQD exhibits a slight advantage in accuracy, SSVQE stands out for its efficiency, allowing the determination of all low-lying excited states through a single parameter optimization procedure. We further evaluate the effectiveness of optimizers, including Gradient Descent (GD), Quantum Natural Gradient (QNG), and Adam optimizer, in obtaining $LiH$'s first excited state, with the Adam optimizer demonstrating superior efficiency in requiring the fewest iterations. Moreover, we propose a novel approach combining Folded Spectrum VQE (FS-VQE) with either VQD or SSVQE, enabling the exploration of highly excited states. We test the new approaches for finding all three $H_4$'s excited states. Folded Spectrum SSVQE (FS-SSVQE) can find all three highly excited states near $-1.0$ Ha with only one optimizing procedure, but the procedure converges slowly. In contrast, although Folded spectrum VQD (FS-VQD) gets highly excited states with individual optimizing procedures, the optimizing procedure converges faster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how squeezing techniques can improve measurement precision in multiphase quantum metrology. While these methods are well-studied and used effectively in single-phase estimations, their use in multiphase situations has not been examined yet. We fill this gap by investigating the mechanism of quantum enhancement in these scenarios. Our analysis provides theoretical and numerical insights into the optimal condition for achieving the quantum Cramer-Rao bound, helping us understand the potential and mechanism for quantum-enhanced multiphase estimations with squeezing. This research opens up new possibilities for advancements in quantum metrology and sensing technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in 2+1d. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in 5+1d with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We use a Peierls argument to demonstrate the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probablistic local cellular-automaton decoder.</description>

      <title>Simulating a Chern Insulator with C = $\pm$2 on Synthetic Floquet Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthetic Floquet lattice, generated by multiple strong drives with mutually incommensurate frequencies, provides a powerful platform for the quantum simulation of topological phenomena. In this study, we propose a 4-band tight-binding model of the Chern insulator with a Chern number C = $\pm$2 by coupling two layers of the half-BHZ lattice and subsequently mapping it onto the Floquet lattice to simulate its topological properties. To determine the Chern number of our Floquet-version model, we extend the energy pumping method proposed by Martin et al. [Phys. Rev. X 7, 041008 (2017)] and the topological oscillation method introduced by Boyers et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 160505 (2020)], followed by numerical simulations for both methodologies. The simulation results demonstrate the successful extraction of the Chern number using either of these methods, providing an excellent prediction of the phase diagram that closely aligns with the theoretical one derived from the original bilayer half-BHZ model. Finally, we briefly discuss a potential experimental implementation for our model. Our work demonstrates significant potential for simulating complex topological matter using quantum computing platforms, thereby paving the way for constructing a more universal simulator for non-interacting topological quantum states and advancing our understanding of these intriguing phenomena.</description>

      <title>Differential-phase-shift QKD with practical Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential-phase-shift (DPS) quantum key distribution stands as a promising protocol due to its simple implementation, which can be realized with a train of coherent pulses and a passive measurement unit. Besides, this protocol has the advantage of being robust against imperfections in the light source. Unfortunately, however, as for the measurement unit, existing security proofs put unrealistic assumptions on it, which could be security loopholes in actual implementations. In this paper, we enhance the implementation security of the DPS protocol by incorporating a major imperfection in the measurement unit. Specifically, our proof enables us to employ practical beam splitters with a known range of the transmittance rather than the one with exactly $50\%$, as was assumed in the existing security proofs. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that even with fluctuations of $\pm0.5\%$ in the transmittance from the ideal value, the key rate degrades only by a factor of 0.57. This result highlights the feasibility of the DPS protocol with practical measurement setups.</description>

      <title>An Improved Design for All-Photonic Quantum Repeaters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-photonic quantum repeaters use multi-qubit photonic graph states, called repeater graph states (RGS), instead of matter-based quantum memories, for protection against predominantly loss errors. The RGS comprises tree-graph-encoded logical qubits for error correction at the repeaters and physical {\em link} qubits to create entanglement between neighboring repeaters. The two methods to generate the RGS are probabilistic stitching -- using linear optical Bell state measurements (fusion) -- of small entangled states prepared via multiplexed-probabilistic linear optical circuits fed with single photons, and a direct deterministic preparation using a small number of quantum-logic-capable solid-state emitters. The resource overhead due to fusions and the circuit depth of the quantum emitter system both increase with the size of the RGS. Therefore engineering a resource-efficient RGS is crucial. We propose a new RGS design, which achieves a higher entanglement rate for all-photonic quantum repeaters using fewer qubits than the previously known RGS would. We accomplish this by boosting the probability of entangling neighboring repeaters with tree-encoded link qubits. We also propose a new adaptive scheme to perform logical BSM on the link qubits for loss-only errors. The adaptive BSM outperforms the previous schemes for logical BSM on tree codes when the qubit loss probability is uniform. It reduces the number of optical modes required to perform logical BSM on link qubits to improve the entanglement rate further.</description>

      <title>Formulation and evaluation of ocean dynamics problems as optimization problems for quantum annealing machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing suggest the potential to revolutionize computational algorithms across various scientific domains including oceanography and atmospheric science. The field is still relatively young and quantum computation is so different from classical computation that suitable frameworks to represent oceanic and atmospheric dynamics are yet to be explored. Quantum annealing, one of the major paradigms, focuses on combinatorial optimization tasks. In this paper, we solve the classical Stommel problem by quantum annealing (QA) and simulated annealing (SA), a classical counterpart of quantum annealing. We cast the linear partial differential equation into an optimization problem by the least-squares method and discretize the cost function in two ways: finite difference and truncated basis expansion. In either case, SA successfully reproduces the expected solution when appropriate parameters are chosen, demonstrating that annealing has the potential. In contrast, QA using the D-Wave quantum annealing machine fails to obtain good solutions for some cases owing to hardware limitations; in particular, the highly limited connectivity graph of the machine limits the size of the solvable problems, at least under currently available algorithms. Either expanding the connectivity graph or improving the graph embedding algorithms would probably be necessary for quantum annealing machines to be usable for oceanic and atmospheric dynamics problems. While this finding emphasizes the need for hardware improvements and enhancements in graph embedding algorithms for practical applications of quantum annealers, the results from simulated annealing suggest its potential to address practical geophysical dynamics problems. As quantum calculation continues to evolve, addressing these challenges may lead to transformative advancements in ocean and atmosphere modeling.</description>

      <title>Application of time-series quantum generative model to financial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite proposing a quantum generative model for time series that successfully learns correlated series with multiple Brownian motions, the model has not been adapted and evaluated for financial problems. In this study, a time-series generative model was applied as a quantum generative model to actual financial data. Future data for two correlated time series were generated and compared with classical methods such as long short-term memory and vector autoregression. Furthermore, numerical experiments were performed to complete missing values. Based on the results, we evaluated the practical applications of the time-series quantum generation model. It was observed that fewer parameter values were required compared with the classical method. In addition, the quantum time-series generation model was feasible for both stationary and nonstationary data. These results suggest that several parameters can be applied to various types of time-series data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-linear Lindblad master equation to describe the postselection dynamics of open quantum systems described by the Lindblad master equation, which continuously interpolates between the Lindblad master equation and the dynamical equation governed by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Within the framework of the non-linear Lindblad master equation, we study a prototypical model and demonstrate the existence of the postselected skin effect with the distribution of a steady state characterized by the accumulation of particles on one side, as long as some quantum jumping terms are discarded by postselction processes. Moreover, we show that the trajectory-averaged entanglement entropy can reflect the different influences from the environment and postselection, and unveil it exhibiting a special distribution with algebraic growth in the short chain and saturation in the long chain induced by the postselected skin effect.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of the von Neumann entropy in open quantum system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of open quantum dynamics is of great interest for realizing quantum technologies. Therefore, it is an important task to quantify and characterize the entropy for open quantum systems under decoherence. In this paper, we study the time evolution of the von Neumann entropy for open quantum systems described by the Lindblad master equation. Note that, in particular, when the decoherence corresponds to the measurement for the observable in the system, the von Neumann entropy tends to monotonically increases as the variance becomes larger. Furthermore, we present a lower bound of the von Neumann entropy in the long-time limit. This lower bound has advantages of being straightforwardly calculated and applicable to a general Markovian open quantum system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and estimation of quantum entanglement are the essential issues in the theory of quantum entanglement. We construct matrices based on the realignment of density matrices and the vectorization of the reduced density matrices, from which a family of separability criteria are presented for both bipartite and multipartite systems. Moreover, new lower bounds of concurrence and convex-roof extended negativity are derived. Criteria are also given to detect the genuine tripartite entanglement. Lower bounds of the concurrence of genuine tripartite entanglement are presented. By detailed examples we show that our results are better than the corresponding ones in identifying and estimating quantum entanglement as well as genuine multipartite entanglement.</description>

      <title>Open Quantum Dynamics: Memory Effects and Superactivation of Backflow of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the divisibility properties of the tensor products $\Lambda^{(1)}_t\otimes\Lambda^{(2)}_t$ of open quantum dynamics $\Lambda^{(1,2)}_t$ with time-dependent generators. These dynamical maps emerge from a compound open system $S_1+S_2$ that interacts with its own environment in such a way that memory effects remain when the environment is traced away. This study is motivated by the following intriguing effect: one can have Backflow of Information (BFI) from the environment to $S_1+S_2$ without the same phenomenon occurring for either $S_1$ and $S_2$. We shall refer to this effect as the Superactivation of BFI (SBFI).</description>

      <title>Model-Based Qubit Noise Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit noise spectroscopy (QNS) is a valuable tool for both the characterization of a qubit's environment and as a precursor to more effective qubit control to improve qubit fidelities. Existing approaches to QNS are what the classical spectrum estimation literature would call "non-parametric" approaches, in that a series of probe sequences are used to estimate noise power at a set of points or bands. In contrast, model-based approaches to spectrum estimation assume additional structure in the form of the spectrum and leverage this for improved statistical accuracy or other capabilities, such as superresolution. Here, we derive model-based QNS approaches using inspiration from classical signal processing, primarily though the recently developed Schrodinger wave autoregressive moving-average (SchWARMA) formalism for modeling correlated noise. We show, through both simulation and experimental data, how these model-based QNS approaches maintain the statistical and computational benefits of their classical counterparts, resulting in powerful new estimation approaches. Beyond the direct application of these approaches to QNS and quantum sensing, we anticipate that the flexibility of the underlying models will find utility in adaptive feedback control for quantum systems, in analogy with their role in classical adaptive signal processing and control.</description>

      <title>A Competitive Showcase of Quantum versus Classical Algorithms in Energy Coalition Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of energy communities is pivotal for advancing decentralized and sustainable energy management. Within this context, Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) emerges as a promising framework. The complexity of CSG grows rapidly with the number of agents, making classical solvers impractical for even moderate sizes (number of agents&gt;30). Therefore, the development of advanced computational methods is essential. Motivated by this challenge, this study conducts a benchmark comparing classical solvers with quantum annealing on Dwave hardware and the Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on both simulator and IBMQ hardware to address energy community formation. Our classical solvers include Tabu search, simulated annealing, and an exact classical solver. Our findings reveal that Dwave surpasses QAOA on hardware in terms of solution quality. Remarkably, QAOA demonstrates comparable runtime scaling with Dwave, albeit with a significantly larger prefactor. Notably, Dwave exhibits competitive performance compared to the classical solvers, achieving solutions of equal quality with more favorable runtime scaling.</description>

This holds both when the affected qubit is one of the log(n) index qubits and when it is the target qubit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communications harness quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement to enhance information transfer between remote nodes. Coherent quantum communications, essential for phase-based quantum internet architecture, require optical coherence among nodes and typically involve single-photon interference. Challenges like preserving optical coherence and integrating advanced single-photon detectors have impeded their deployment in existing telecommunication networks. This study introduces innovative approaches to the architecture and techniques supporting coherent quantum communications, marking their first successful integration within a commercial telecom infrastructure between Frankfurt and Kehl, Germany. Employing the Twin Field Quantum Key Distribution protocol, we achieved encryption key distribution at 110 bit/s over 254 km. This system features measurement-device-independent properties and non-cryogenically cooled detectors, and represents the first effective quantum repeater implementation on telecom infrastructure, the longest practical quantum key distribution deployment to date, and validates the feasibility of a phase-based quantum internet architecture.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum thermometry scheme based collision model with Gaussian systems. A key open question of these schemes concerns the scaling of the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) with the number of ancillae. In qubit-based implementations this question is difficult to assess, due to the exponentially growing size of the Hilbert space. Here we focus on Gaussian collision models, which allow for the scaling of the QFI to be evaluated for arbitrarily large sizes. This numerical flexibility enables us to explore the thermometric properties of the model for a wide range of configurations. Despite the infinite Markov order of the stochastic process of the model, we provide a simple phenomenological analysis for the behavior of the QFI, estimating the asymptotic Fisher information density and how the transient effects of correlations for an increasing number of ancillae depend on the physical parameters of the model.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel method of efficiently simulating the non-equilibrium steady state of large many-body open quantum systems with highly non-local interactions, based on a variational Monte Carlo optimization of a matrix product operator ansatz. Our approach outperforms and offers several advantages over comparable algorithms, such as an improved scaling of the computational cost with respect to the bond dimension for periodic systems. We showcase the versatility of our approach by studying the phase diagrams and correlation functions of the dissipative quantum Ising model with collective dephasing and long-ranged power law interactions for spin chains of up to $N=100$ spins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the main theoretical support of quantum metrology, quantum parameter estimation must follow the steps of quantum metrology towards the applied science and industry. Hence, optimal scheme design will soon be a crucial and core task for quantum parameter estimation. To efficiently accomplish this task, software packages aimed at computer-aided design are in high demand. In response to this need, we hereby introduce QuanEstimation.jl, an open-source Julia framework for scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation. It can be used either as an independent package or as the computational core of the recently developed hybrid-language (Python-Julia) package QuanEstimation [Phys. Rev. Res. 4, 043057 (2022)]. Utilizing this framework, the scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation can be readily performed, especially when quantum noises exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interactions provide an ideal testground for interplay of critical phenomena, topological transitions, quantum metrology and non-Hermitian physics. We consider two fundamental non-Hermitian Jaynes-Cummings models which possess real energy spectra in parity-time (PT) symmetry and anti-PT symmetry. We show that the quantum Fisher information is critical around the transitions at the exceptional points and exhibits a super universality with respect to different parameters, all energy levels, both models, symmetric phases and symmetry-broken phases. The transitions are found to be both symmetry-breaking Landau-class transitions (LCTs) and symmetry-protected topological-class of transitions (TCTs), thus realizing a simultaneous occurrence of critical LCTs and TCTs which are conventionally incompatible due to contrary symmetry requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the learnability of unknown quantum circuits in the near term. We prove the natural robustness of quantum statistical queries for learning quantum processes and provide an efficient way to benchmark various classes of noise from statistics, which gives us a powerful framework for developing noise-tolerant algorithms. We adapt a learning algorithm for constant-depth quantum circuits to the quantum statistical query setting with a small overhead in the query complexity. We prove average-case lower bounds for learning random quantum circuits of logarithmic and higher depths within diamond distance with statistical queries. Additionally, we show the hardness of the quantum threshold search problem from quantum statistical queries and discuss its implications for the learnability of shallow quantum circuits. Finally, we prove that pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) cannot be constructed using circuits of constant depth by constructing an efficient distinguisher and proving a new variation of the quantum no-free lunch theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an optomechanical scheme for reaching quantum entanglement in vibration polaritons. The system involves $N$ molecules, whose vibrations can be fairly entangled with plasmonic cavities. We find that the vibration-photon entanglement can exist at room temperature and is robust against thermal noise. We further demonstrate the quantum entanglement between the vibrational modes through the plasmonic cavities, which shows a delocalized nature and an incredible enhancement with the number of molecules. The underlying mechanism for the entanglement is attributed to the strong vibration-cavity coupling which possesses collectivity. Our results provide a molecular optomechanical scheme which offers a promising platform for the study of noise-free quantum resources and macroscopic quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Insecurity of Quantum Two-Party Computation with Applications to Cheat-Sensitive Protocols and Oblivious Transfer Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oblivious transfer (OT) is a fundamental primitive for secure two-party computation. It is well known that OT cannot be implemented with information-theoretic security if the two players only have access to noiseless communication channels, even in the quantum case. As a result, weaker variants of OT have been studied. In this work, we rigorously establish the impossibility of cheat-sensitive OT, where a dishonest party can cheat, but risks being detected. We construct a general attack on any quantum protocol that allows the receiver to compute all inputs of the sender and provide an explicit upper bound on the success probability of this attack. This implies that cheat-sensitive quantum Symmetric Private Information Retrieval cannot be implemented with statistical information-theoretic security. Leveraging the techniques devised for our proofs, we provide entropic bounds on primitives needed for secure function evaluation. They imply impossibility results for protocols where the players have access to OT as a resource. This result significantly improves upon existing bounds and yields tight bounds for reductions of 1-out-of-n OT to a resource primitive. Our results hold in particular for transformations between a finite number of primitives and for any error.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic spin-wave theory tailored to describe quantum trajectories in continuously monitored long-range interacting spin systems. Our method, based on the bosonization of spin-wave excitations on top of a strong collective polarization, enables the efficient simulation of large-scale interacting spins, offering insights into nonlinear features of the dynamics such as entanglement and trajectory correlations. We showcase the versatility of our framework by exploring an entanglement phase transition in a monitored spin system with power-law interactions and dwelling on how our method mitigates the experimental challenges of post-selection in detecting monitored quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Auger photoemission as a laser-like coherent cathode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pursuit of quantum advancements across disciplines, a bright and coherent electron source is expected to be a cornerstone of diverse applications including electron microscopy, laser accelerators, and free electron lasers. Current cathodes, such as cold field and photoemission, can generate high-quality electron beams with different cathode materials, geometric configurations, and laser excitation profiles, but their maintenance of both quantum coherence and high beam brightness suffers from the space-charge repulsion of many electrons. Here, we propose a new mechanism to provide collective emission of coherent electrons based on Auger photoemission. Our approach leverages a photon-induced four-level Auger process that necessitates a combination of photoemission and Auger recombination. The Auger electrons, energized through a recycling process of photoelectrons, emit collectively into the vacuum as secondary electrons. We compare coherent and incoherent Auger photoemission, identifying that the working condition of the coherent photoemission requires population inversion, akin to the four-level laser system. Our work provides insights for experimental realization and nanofabrication of Auger photocathodes, addressing a critical need in advancing quantum technologies relating to correlated coherent sources.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg dynamics of mixed quantum-classical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of interacting quantum and classical systems in the Heisenberg representation. Unlike the usual construction in standard quantum mechanics, mixed quantum-classical systems involve the interplay of unitary operators acting on the quantum observables and the Lagrangian trajectories sweeping the classical degrees of freedom. This interplay reflects an intricate structure which is made particularly challenging by the backreaction excerpted on the classical trajectories by the quantum degrees of freedom. While the backreaction is underestimated in the common Ehrenfest model, more recent methodologies succeed in capturing this important effect by resorting to Koopman wavefunctions in classical mechanics. Luckily, both Ehrenfest and Koopman models enjoy a variational framework which is exploited here to unfold the geometric structure underlying quantum-classical coupling. A special role is played by the action of the diffeomorphic Lagrangian paths on a non-Abelian pure-gauge potential which comprises statistical correlations. After presenting the treatment in the simple case of Ehrenfest dynamics, we move on to the Koopman model and present the role of the backreaction terms therein. Finally, we compare both models in the context of pure-dephasing systems.</description>

      <title>Describing the critical behavior of the Anderson transition in infinite dimension by random-matrix ensembles: logarithmic multifractality and critical localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their analytical tractability, random matrix ensembles serve as robust platforms for exploring exotic phenomena in systems that are computationally demanding. Building on a companion letter [arXiv:2312.17481], this paper investigates two random matrix ensembles tailored to capture the critical behavior of the Anderson transition in infinite dimension, employing both analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations. Our study unveils two types of critical behaviors: logarithmic multifractality and critical localization. In contrast to conventional multifractality, the novel logarithmic multifractality features eigenstate moments scaling algebraically with the logarithm of the system size. Critical localization, characterized by eigenstate moments of order $q&gt;1/2$ converging to a finite value indicating localization, exhibits characteristic logarithmic finite-size or time effects, consistent with the critical behavior observed in random regular and Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs of effective infinite dimensionality. Using perturbative methods, we establish the existence of logarithmic multifractality and critical localization in our models. Furthermore, we explore the emergence of novel scaling behaviors in the time dynamics and spatial correlation functions. Our models provide a valuable framework for studying infinite-dimensional quantum disordered systems, and the universality of our findings enables broad applicability to systems with pronounced finite-size effects and slow dynamics, including the contentious many-body localization transition, akin to the Anderson transition in infinite dimension.</description>

      <title>Research on the Quantum confinement of Carriers in the Type-I Quantum Wells Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum confinement is recognized to be an inherent property in low-dimensional structures. Traditionally it is believed that the carriers trapped within the well cannot escape due to the discrete energy levels. However, our previous research has revealed efficient carrier escape in low-dimensional structures, contradicting this conventional understanding. In this study, we review the energy band structure of quantum wells considering it as a superposition of the bulk material dispersion and quantization energy dispersion resulting from the quantum confinement across the whole Brillouin zone. By accounting for all wave vectors, we obtain a certain distribution of carrier energy at each quantization energy level, giving rise to the energy subbands. These results enable carriers to escape from the well under the influence of an electric field. Additionally, we have compiled a comprehensive summary of various energy band scenarios in quantum well structures, relevant to carrier transport. Such a new interpretation holds significant value in deepening our comprehension of low-dimensional energy bands, discovering new physical phenomena, and designing novel devices with superior performance.</description>

Abstract: We describe a process for fabricating a wafer-scale array of alkali metal vapor cells with low residual gas pressure. We show that by etching long, thin channels between the cells on the Si wafer surface, the residual gas pressure in the evacuated vapor cell can be reduced to below 0.5 kPa (4 Torr) with a yield above 50 %. The low residual gas pressure in these mass-producible alkali vapor cells can enable a new generation of low-cost chip-scale atomic devices such as vapor cell optical clocks, wavelength references, and Rydberg sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) enables us to calculate bosonic quantum many-body dynamics while accounting for the effects of quantum fluctuations. In this work, we formulate the TWA for bosonic Markovian open quantum systems described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation from the coherent-state path-integral approach using the Wigner function. We derive an analytical expression for the GKSL equation in the TWA where we consider a bosonic system with an arbitrary Hamiltonian with jump operators that do not couple different states. We numerically confirm that the time evolution of physical quantities and the non-equal time correlation functions obtained in our formulation agree well with the exact ones in the numerically solvable models.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Quantum Key Distribution for Microgrids with Distributed Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) has often been hailed as a reliable technology for secure communication in cyber-physical microgrids. Even though unauthorized key measurements are not possible in QKD, attempts to read them can disturb quantum states leading to mutations in the transmitted value. Further, inaccurate quantum keys can lead to erroneous decryption producing garbage values, destabilizing microgrid operation. QKD can also be vulnerable to node-level manipulations incorporating attack values into measurements before they are encrypted at the communication layer. To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure QKD protocol that can identify errors in keys and/or nodal measurements by observing violations in control dynamics. Additionally, the protocol uses a dynamic adjacency matrix-based formulation strategy enabling the affected nodes to reconstruct a trustworthy signal and replace it with the attacked signal in a multi-hop manner. This enables microgrids to perform nominal operations in the presence of adversaries who try to eavesdrop on the system causing an increase in the quantum bit error rate (QBER). We provide several case studies to showcase the robustness of the proposed strategy against eavesdroppers and node manipulations. The results demonstrate that it can resist unwanted observation and attack vectors that manipulate signals before encryption.</description>

      <title>Spread and Spectral Complexity in Quantum Spin Chains: from Integrability to Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore spread and spectral complexity in quantum systems that exhibit a transition from integrability to chaos, namely the mixed-field Ising model and the next-to-nearest-neighbor deformation of the Heisenberg XXZ spin chain. We corroborate the observation that the presence of a peak in spread complexity before its saturation, is a characteristic feature in chaotic systems. We find that, in general, the saturation value of spread complexity post-peak depends not only on the spectral statistics of the Hamiltonian, but also on the specific state. However, there appears to be a maximal universal bound determined by the symmetries and dimension of the Hamiltonian, which is realized by the thermofield double state (TFD) at infinite temperature. We also find that the time scales at which the spread complexity and spectral form factor change their behaviour agree with each other and are independent of the chaotic properties of the systems. In the case of spectral complexity, we identify that the key factor determining its saturation value and timescale in chaotic systems is given by minimum energy difference in the theory's spectrum. This explains observations made in the literature regarding its earlier saturation in chaotic systems compared to their integrable counterparts. We conclude by discussing the properties of the TFD which, we conjecture, make it suitable for probing signatures of chaos in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Combined Classical and Quantum Accelerometers For the Next Generation of Satellite Gravity Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold atom interferometry (CAI)-based quantum accelerometers are very promising for future satellite gravity missions thanks to their strength in providing long-term stable and precise measurements of non-gravitational accelerations. However, their limitations due to the low measurement rate and the existence of ambiguities in the raw sensor measurements call for hybridization of the quantum accelerometer (Q-ACC) with a classical one (e.g., electrostatic) with higher bandwidth. While previous hybridization studies have so far considered simple noise models for the Q-ACC and neglected the impact of satellite rotation on the phase shift of the accelerometer, we perform here a more advanced hybridization simulation by implementing a comprehensive noise model for the satellite-based quantum accelerometers and considering the full impact of rotation, gravity gradient, and self-gravity on the instrument. We perform simulation studies for scenarios with different assumptions about quantum and classical sensors and satellite missions. The performance benefits of the hybrid solutions, taking the synergy of both classical and quantum accelerometers into account, will be quantified. We found that implementing a hybrid accelerometer onboard a future gravity mission improves the gravity solution by one to two orders in lower and higher degrees. In particular, the produced global gravity field maps show a drastic reduction in the instrumental contribution to the striping effect after introducing measurements from the hybrid accelerometers.</description>

Abstract: We outline a general formalism for treating vacuum polarization phenomena within an effective field expansion. The coupling between source charges and virtual fields is examined from the perspectives of electrostatic potentials, induced charge densities and form factors in momentum space. A strategy for the efficient calculation of vacuum polarization potentials is outlined, implemented, and applied towards the construction of fitting potentials that are suitable for molecular electronic structure calculations, which enclose no overall charge by construction. The order $\alpha(Z \alpha)$, $\alpha (Z \alpha)^{3}$ and $\alpha^{2}(Z\alpha)$ effects of a Gaussian nuclear charge on the electron-positron field are applied variationally towards the E119F molecule, as well as the order $\alpha(Z \alpha)$ effects arising from the virtual muon and charged pion fields.</description>

Abstract: Radiative corrections to electronic structure are characterized by perturbative expansions in $\alpha$ and $Z\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant and $Z$ is the nuclear charge. A formulation of the leading-order $\alpha(Z\alpha)$ Uehling contribution to the renormalized vacuum polarization is reported in a form that is convenient for implementation in computational studies of the relativistic electronic structures of molecules. Benchmark calculations based on these methods are reported that include the leading-order vacuum polarization effects within relativistic mean-field methods for the E119$^+$ ion and the closed-shell diatomic species E119F.</description>

Abstract: In quantum gravity, it is expected that the Big Bang singularity is resolved and the universe undergoes a bounce. We find that for generic initial data, matter-gravity entanglement entropy rises rapidly during the bounce, declines, and then approaches a steady-state value following the bounce. These observations suggest that matter-gravity entanglement is a feature of the macroscopic universe and that there is no Second Law of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recently developed methodology termed photon induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), the inelastic scattering of electrons off illuminated nanostructures provides direct experimental access to the structure of optical near-field modes and their population. Whereas the inelastic scattering probability can be quantitatively linked to the near field distribution, analytical results for simple light scattering geometries are scarce. Here we derive a fully analytical expression for the coupling strength between free electrons and optical near-fields in planar geometries representing dielectric thin films. Contributions to the overall coupling from the electric field above, below and within the sample are analyzed in detail. By carefully choosing the relative angles between electron beam, light and thin film and by accounting for a broad spectrum of photon energies, we demonstrate that one can imprint optical material properties like the reflectivity onto the electron energy distribution.</description>

      <title>Shortcut to Chemically Accurate Quantum Computing via Density-based Basis-set Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises a computational advantage over classical methods in electronic-structure calculations, with expected applications in drug design and materials science. Accessing a quantitative description of chemical systems while minimizing quantum resources, such as the number of qubits, is an essential challenge given the limited capabilities of current quantum processors. We provide a shortcut towards quantum computations at chemical accuracy by approaching the complete-basis-set limit (CBS) through integrating density-functional theory into quantum algorithms via density-based basis-set corrections coupled to basis-sets crafted on-the-fly and specifically adapted to a given system/user-defined qubit budget. The approach self-consistently accelerates the basis-set convergence, improving electronic densities, ground-state energies, and first-order properties such as dipole moments. It can also serve as a classical, \textit{a posteriori}, energy correction to quantum hardware calculations. The strategy is assessed using GPU-accelerated state-vector emulation up to 32 qubits. We converge the ground-state energies of four systems (He, Be, H$_2$, LiH) within chemical accuracy of the CBS full-configuration-interaction reference, while offering a systematic increase of accuracy beyond a double-zeta quality for various molecules up to the H$_8$ hydrogen chain. We also obtain dissociation curves for H$_2$ and LiH that reach the CBS limit whereas for the challenging simulation of the N$_2$ triple-bond breaking, we achieve a near-triple-zeta quality at the cost of a minimal basis-set. This hybrid strategy allows us to obtain quantitative results that would otherwise require brute-force quantum simulations using far more than 100 logical qubits, thereby opening up opportunities to explore real-world chemistry with reasonable computational resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise control of the electron phase accumulated during its sub-cycle motion within intense laser fields is essential in strong-field physics, yet remains mostly indirect and complicated so far. In this Letter, we develop a novel approach to control this sub-cycle electron phase by tuning a low-frequency electric field applied on a centrosymmetric gaseous target during its interaction with a few-cycle infrared laser pulse. Our method is based on a universal analytical relation between the low-frequency electric field and its induced harmonic frequency shift, derived by the strong-field approximation. This simple relation and its universality are confirmed numerically by directly solving the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. Moreover, we discuss the benefits of the discovered relation in \textit{in situ} applications, including continuously and precisely tuning XUV waves and developing a new method of comprehensively sampling THz pulse.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Metal-Organic Frameworks Using Quantum Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of using quantum natural language processing (QNLP) to inverse design metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with targeted properties. Specifically, by analyzing 150 hypothetical MOF structures consisting of 10 metal nodes and 15 organic ligands, we categorize these structures into four distinct classes for pore volume and $H_{2}$ uptake values. We then compare various QNLP models (i.e. the bag-of-words, DisCoCat (Distributional Compositional Categorical), and sequence-based models) to identify the most effective approach to process the MOF dataset. Using a classical simulator provided by the IBM Qiskit, the bag-of-words model is identified to be the optimum model, achieving validation accuracies of 85.7% and 86.7% for binary classification tasks on pore volume and $H_{2}$ uptake, respectively. Further, we developed multi-class classification models tailored to the probabilistic nature of quantum circuits, with average test accuracies of 88.4% and 80.7% across different classes for pore volume and $H_{2}$ uptake datasets. Finally, the performance of generating MOF with target properties showed accuracies of 93.5% for pore volume and 89% for $H_{2}$ uptake, respectively. Although our investigation covers only a fraction of the vast MOF search space, it marks a promising first step towards using quantum computing for materials design, offering a new perspective through which to explore the complex landscape of MOFs.</description>

      <title>Graviton physics: Quantum field theory of gravitons, graviton noise and gravitational decoherence -- a concise tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves in 2015 ushered in a new era of gravitational wave astronomy capable of probing into the strong field dynamics of black holes and neutron stars. It has opened up an exciting new window for laboratory and space tests of Einstein's theory of classical general relativity. In recent years there are two interesting proposals aimed at revealing the quantum natures of perturbative gravity: 1) theoretical predictions in how graviton noise from the early universe after the vacuum of the gravitational field was strongly squeezed by inflationary expansion; 2) experimental proposals using the quantum entanglement between two masses each in a superposition state. The first proposal invokes the stochastic properties of quantum fields, the second invokes a key concept of quantum information. An equally basic and interesting idea is to ask whether and how gravity might be responsible for a quantum system becoming classical in appearance, known as gravitational decoherence. Decoherence due to gravity is of special interest because gravity is universal. This is an important issue in macroscopic quantum phenomena. To fully appreciate these exciting developments requires a working knowledge in classical GR, QF theory and QI plus some familiarity with stochastic processes, namely, noise in quantum fields. Traditionally a new researcher may be conversant in one or two of these four subjects: GR, QFT, QI, SP, depending on his/her background. This tutorial attempts to provide the necessary connections between them, helping an engaging reader from any one of these four subjects to leapfrog to the frontier of these interdisciplinary research topics. Here we shall treat the three topics listed in the title, save gravitational entanglement, because its nature and implications proclaimed in relation to quantum gravity still contain many controversial elements.</description>

      <title>Regularized Entanglement Entropy of Electron-Positron Scattering with a Witness Photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regularized quantum information metrics are calculated for the scattering process $e^-e^+ \rightarrow \gamma,Z\rightarrow \mu^-\mu^+$ that has a witness photon entangled with the initial electron-positron state. Unitarity implies the correct regularization of divergences that appear in both the final density matrix and von Neumann entanglement entropies. The entropies are found to quantify uncertainty or randomness. The variation of information, entanglement entropy, and correlation between the muon's and witness photon's helicities are found to convey equivalent information. The magnitude of the muon's expected helicity rises (falls) as the helicity entropy falls (rises). Area, or the scattering cross section, is a source of entropy for the muon's helicity entropy and momentum entropy. The muon's differential angular entropy distribution is similar to the differential angular cross section distribution, capturing the forward-backward asymmetry at high center of mass energies.</description>

Abstract: Nowadays, predominant asymmetric cryptographic schemes are considered to be secure because discrete logarithms are believed to be hard to be computed. The algorithm of Shor can effectively compute discrete logarithms, i.e. it can brake such asymmetric schemes. But the algorithm of Shor is a quantum algorithm and at the time this algorithm has been invented, quantum computers that may successfully execute this algorithm seemed to be far out in the future. The latter has changed: quantum computers that are powerful enough are likely to be available in a couple of years. In this article, we first describe the relation between discrete logarithms and two well-known asymmetric security schemes, RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Next, we present the foundations of lattice-based cryptography which is the bases of schemes that are considered to be safe against attacks by quantum algorithms (as well as by classical algorithms). Then we describe two such quantum-safe algorithms (Kyber and Dilithium) in more detail. Finally, we give a very brief and selective overview of a few actions currently taken by governments and industry as well as standardization in this area. The article especially strives towards being self-contained: the required mathematical foundations to understand post-quantum cryptography are provided and examples are given.</description>

      <title>Randomized Gradient Descents on Riemannian Manifolds: Almost Sure Convergence to Global Minima in and beyond Quantum Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence properties of gradient descent algorithms on Riemannian manifolds. We study randomization of the tangent space directions of Riemannian gradient flows for minimizing smooth cost functions (of Morse--Bott type) to obtain convergence to local optima. We prove that through randomly projecting Riemannian gradients according to the Haar measure, convergence to local optima can be obtained almost surely despite the existence of saddle points. As an application we consider ground state preparation through quantum optimization over the unitary group. In this setting one can efficiently approximate the Haar-random projections by implementing unitary 2-designs on quantum computers. We prove that the respective algorithm almost surely converges to the global minimum that corresponds to the ground state of a desired Hamiltonian. Finally, we discuss the time required by the algorithm to pass a saddle point in a simple two-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of electron spin qubit during transfer between two semiconductor quantum dots at low magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron shuttling is one of the currently pursued avenues towards the scalability of semiconductor quantum dot-based spin qubits. We theoretically analyze the dephasing of a spin qubit adiabatically transferred between two tunnel-coupled quantum dots. We focus on the regime where the Zeeman splitting is lower than the tunnel coupling, at which interdot tunneling with spin flip is absent, and analyze the sources of errors in spin-coherent electron transfer for Si- and GaAs-based quantum dots. Apart from the obvious effect of fluctuations in spin splitting in each dot (e.g., due to nuclear Overhauser fields) leading to finite $ T_{2}^{*} $ of the stationary spin qubit, we consider effects activated by detuning sweeps aimed at adiabatic qubit transfer between the dots: failure of charge transfer caused by charge noise and phonons, spin relaxation due to enhancement of spin-orbit mixing of levels, and spin dephasing caused by low- and high-frequency noise coupling to the electron's charge in the presence of differences in Zeeman splittings between the two dots. Our results indicate that achieving coherent transfer of electron spin in a $10\,\mu$m long dot array necessitates a large and uniform tunnel coupling, with a typical value of $ 2t_c \gtrsim 60 \, \mu$eV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an open-source tensor network Python library for quantum many-body simulations. At its core is an abelian-symmetric tensor, implemented as a sparse block structure managed by logical layer on top of dense multi-dimensional array backend. This serves as the basis for higher-level tensor networks algorithms, operating on matrix product states and projected entangled pair states, implemented here. Using appropriate backend, such as PyTorch, gives direct access to automatic differentiation (AD) for cost-function gradient calculations and execution on GPUs or other supported accelerators. We show the library performance in simulations with infinite projected entangled-pair states, such as finding the ground states with AD, or simulating thermal states of the Hubbard model via imaginary time evolution. We quantify sources of performance gains in those challenging examples allowed by utilizing symmetries.</description>

      <title>Digitization and subduction of $SU(N)$ gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of lattice gauge theories on quantum computers necessitates digitizing gauge fields. One approach involves substituting the continuous gauge group with a discrete subgroup, but the implications of this approximation still need to be clarified. To gain insights, we investigate the subduction of $ SU(2) $ and $ SU(3)$ to discrete crystal-like subgroups. Using classical lattice calculations, we show that subduction offers valuable information based on subduced direct sums, helping us identify additional terms to incorporate into the lattice action that can mitigate the effects of digitization. Furthermore, we compute the static potentials of all irreducible representations of $ \Sigma(360 \times 3) $ at a fixed lattice spacing. Our results reveal a percent-level agreement with the Casimir scaling of \( SU(3) \) for irreducible representations that subduce to a single $ \Sigma(360 \times 3) $ irreducible representation. This provides a diagnostic measure of approximation quality, as some irreducible representations closely match the expected results while others exhibit significant deviations.</description>

      <title>Why the wavefunction already is an object on space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.14604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the discovery of quantum mechanics, the fact that the wavefunction is defined on the $3\mathbf{n}$-dimensional configuration space rather than on the $3$-dimensional space seemed uncanny to many, including Schr\"odinger, Lorentz, and Einstein. Even today, this continues to be seen as an important problem in the foundations of quantum mechanics.
  In this article it will be shown that the wavefunction already is a genuine object on space. While this may seem surprising, the wavefunction has no qualitatively new features that were not previously encountered in the objects known from Euclidean geometry and classical physics. This will be shown to be true also in Felix Klein's Erlangen Program. This fits naturally in the classification of quantum particles by the representations of the spacetime isometries realized by Wigner and Bargmann, adding another layer of confirmation. Once we realize that all quantum experiments take place in space, they can be interpreted naturally and consistently with the wavefunction being an object on space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00198v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general entanglement-based witness of non-classicality has recently been proposed, which can be applied to testing quantum effects in gravity. This witness is based on generating entanglement between two quantum probes via a mediator. In this paper we provide a "temporal" variant of this witness, using a single quantum probe to assess the non-classicality of the mediator. Within the formalism of quantum theory, we show that if a system $M$ is capable of inducing a coherent dynamical evolution of a quantum system $Q$, in the presence of a conservation law, then $M$ must be non-classical. This argument supports witnesses of non-classicality relying on a single quantum probe, which can be applied to a number of open issues, notably in quantum gravity or quantum biology.</description>

Abstract: Classical shadow tomography is a sample-efficient technique for characterizing quantum systems and predicting many of their properties. Circuit cutting is a technique for dividing large quantum circuits into smaller fragments that can be executed more robustly using fewer quantum resources. We introduce a divide-and-conquer circuit cutting method for estimating the expectation values of observables using classical shadows. We derive a general formula for making predictions using the classical shadows of circuit fragments from arbitrarily cut circuits, and provide the sample complexity analysis for the case when observables factorize across fragments. Then, we numerically show that our divide-and-conquer method outperforms traditional uncut shadow tomography when estimating high-weight observables that act non-trivially on many qubits, and discuss the mechanisms for this advantage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy is a fundamental concept in quantum information theory that allows to quantify entanglement and investigate its properties, for example its monogamy over multipartite systems. Here, we derive variational formulas for relative entropies based on restricted measurements of multipartite quantum systems. By combining these with multivariate matrix trace inequalities, we recover and sometimes strengthen various existing entanglement monogamy inequalities. In particular, we give direct, matrix-analysis-based proofs for the faithfulness of squashed entanglement by relating it to the relative entropy of entanglement measured with one-way local operations and classical communication, as well as for the faithfulness of conditional entanglement of mutual information by relating it to the separably measured relative entropy of entanglement. We discuss variations of these results using the relative entropy to states with positive partial transpose, and multipartite setups. Our results simplify and generalize previous derivations in the literature that employed operational arguments about the asymptotic achievability of information-theoretic tasks.</description>

Abstract: Topological subsystem codes in three spatial dimensions allow for quantum error correction with no time overhead, even in the presence of measurement noise. The physical origins of this single-shot property remain elusive, in part due to the scarcity of known models. To address this challenge, we provide a systematic construction of a class of topological subsystem codes in three dimensions built from abelian quantum double models in one fewer dimension. Our construction not only generalizes the recently introduced subsystem toric code [Kubica and Vasmer, Nat. Commun. 13, 6272 (2022)] but also provides a new perspective on several aspects of the original model, including the origin of the Gauss law for gauge flux, and boundary conditions for the code family. We then numerically study the performance of the first few codes in this class against phenomenological noise to verify their single-shot property. Lastly, we discuss Hamiltonians naturally associated with these codes, and argue that they may be gapless.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Hamiltonian structure to the QAOA energy and Fourier landscape structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to expand the understanding of the relationship between the composition of the Hamiltonian in the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the corresponding cost landscape characteristics. QAOA is a prominent example of a Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA), which is most commonly used for combinatorial optimization. The success of QAOA heavily relies on parameter optimization, which is a great challenge, especially on scarce noisy quantum hardware. Thus understanding the cost function landscape can aid in designing better optimization heuristics and therefore potentially provide eventual value. We consider the case of 1-layer QAOA for Hamiltonians with up to 5-local terms and up to 20 qubits. In addition to visualizing the cost landscapes, we calculate their Fourier transform to study the relationship with the structure of the Hamiltonians from a complementary perspective. Furthermore, we introduce metrics to quantify the roughness of the landscape, which provide valuable insights into the nature of high-dimensional parametrized landscapes. While these techniques allow us to elucidate the role of Hamiltonian structure, order of the terms and their coefficients on the roughness of the optimization landscape, we also find that predicting the intricate landscapes of VQAs from first principles is very challenging and unlikely to be feasible in general.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a novel noise model for quantum measurements motivated by an indirect measurement scheme with faulty preparation. Averaging over random dynamics governing the interaction between the quantum system and a probe, a natural, physical noise model emerges. We compare it to existing noise models (uniform and depolarizing) in the framework of incompatibility robustness. We observe that our model allows for larger compatibility regions for specific classes of measurements.</description>

Abstract: Quantum memories are essential for quantum repeaters that will form the backbone of the future quantum internet. Such memory can capture a signal state for a controllable amount of time after which this state can be retrieved. In this work, we theoretically investigated how atomic material and engineering parameters affect the performance and bandwidth of a quantum memory. We have applied a theoretical model for quantum memory operation based on the Lindblad master equation and adiabatic quantum state manipulation. The materials properties and their uncertainty are evaluated to determine the performance of Raman-type quantum memories by showcasing two defects in two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We have derived a scheme to calculate the signal bandwidth based on the material parameters as well as the maximum efficiency that can be realized. The bandwidth depends on four factors: the signal photon frequency, the dipole transition moments in the electronic structure, cavity volume, and the strength of the external control electric field. As our scheme is general and independent of materials, it can be applied to many other quantum materials with a suitable three-level structure. We therefore provided a promising route for designing and selecting materials for quantum memories. Our work is therefore an important step toward the realization of a large-scale quantum network.</description>

      <title>Enhanced entanglement in multi-bath spin-boson models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin-boson model usually considers a spin coupled to a single bosonic bath. However, some physical situations require coupling of the spin to multiple environments. For example, spins interacting with phonons in three-dimensional magnetic materials. Here, we consider a spin coupled isotropically to three independent baths. We show that coupling to multiple baths can significantly increase entanglement between the spin and its environment at zero temperature. The effect of this is to reduce the spin's expectation values in the mean force equilibrium state. In contrast, the classical three-bath spin equilibrium state turns out to be entirely independent of the environmental coupling. These results reveal purely quantum effects that can arise from multi-bath couplings, with potential applications in a wide range of settings, such as magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>On the Bipartite Entanglement Capacity of Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of multi-path entanglement distribution to a pair of nodes in a quantum network consisting of devices with non-deterministic entanglement swapping capabilities. Multi-path entanglement distribution enables a network to establish end-to-end entangled links across any number of available paths with pre-established link-level entanglement. Probabilistic entanglement swapping, on the other hand, limits the amount of entanglement that is shared between the nodes; this is especially the case when, due to architectural and other practical constraints, swaps must be performed in temporal proximity to each other. Limiting our focus to the case where only bipartite entangled states are generated across the network, we cast the problem as an instance of generalized flow maximization between two quantum end nodes wishing to communicate. We propose a mixed-integer quadratically constrained program (MIQCP) to solve this flow problem for networks with arbitrary topology. We then compute the overall network capacity, defined as the maximum number of EPR states distributed to users per time unit, by solving the flow problem for all possible network states generated by probabilistic entangled link presence and absence, and subsequently by averaging over all network state capacities. The MIQCP can also be applied to networks with multiplexed links. While our approach for computing the overall network capacity has the undesirable property that the total number of states grows exponentially with link multiplexing capability, it nevertheless yields an exact solution that serves as an upper bound comparison basis for the throughput performance of easily-implementable yet non-optimal entanglement routing algorithms. We apply our capacity computation method to several networks, including a topology based on SURFnet -- a backbone network used for research purposes in the Netherlands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an exact solution for the steady state of a setup where two $XX$-coupled $N$-qubit spin chains (with possibly non-uniform couplings) are subject to boundary Rabi drives, and common boundary loss generated by a waveguide (either bidirectional or unidirectional). For a wide range of parameters, this system has a pure entangled steady state, providing a means for stabilizing remote multi-qubit entanglement without the use of squeezed light. Our solution also provides insights into a single boundary-driven dissipative $XX$ spin chain that maps to an interacting fermionic model. The non-equilibrium steady state exhibits surprising correlation effects, including an emergent pairing of hole excitations that arises from dynamically constrained hopping. Our system could be implemented in a number of experimental platforms, including circuit QED.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent and measurement feedback control based on atoms coupled with a semi-infinite waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that quantum feedback control may be applied to generate desired states for atomic and photonic systems based on a semi-infinite waveguide coupled with multiple two-level atoms. In this set-up, an initially excited atom can emit one photon into the waveguide, which can be reflected by the terminal mirror or other atoms to establish different feedback loops via the coherent interactions between the atom and photon. When there are at most two excitations in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics (waveguide QED) system, the evolution of quantum states can be interpreted using random graph theory. While this process is influenced by the environment, and we clarify that the environment-induced dynamics can be eliminated by measurement-based feedback control or coherent drives. Thus, in the open system atom-waveguide interactions, measurement-based feedback can modulate the final steady quantum state, while simultaneously, the homodyne detection noise in the measurement process can induce oscillations, which is treated by the coherent feedback designs.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement Distribution in Quantum Networks using Subgraph Complementations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks are important for quantum communication and allow for several tasks such as quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, quantum sensing, and quantum error correction. Graph states are a specific class of multipartite entangled states that can be represented by graphs. We propose a novel approach for distributing graph states across a quantum network. We show that the distribution of graph states can be characterized by a system of subgraph complementations, which we also relate to the minimum rank of the underlying graph and the degree of entanglement quantified by the Schmidt-rank of the quantum state. We analyze resource usage for our algorithm and show that it improves on the number of qubits, bits for classical communication, and EPR pairs utilized, as compared to prior work. In fact, the number of local operations and resource consumption for our approach scales linearly in the number of vertices. This produces a quadratic improvement in completion time for several classes of graph states represented by dense graphs, which translates into an exponential improvement by allowing parallelization of gate operations. This leads to improved fidelities in the presence of noisy operations, as we show through simulation in the presence of noisy operations. Common classes of graph states are classified along with their optimal distribution time using subgraph complementations. We find a close to optimal sequence of subgraph complementation operations to distribute an arbitrary graph state, and establish upper bounds on distribution time along with providing approximate greedy algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We report feedback cooling of translational and librational degrees of freedom of a levitated micromagnet cylinder, utilizing a piezoelectric actuator to apply linear feedback to high-Q mechanical modes. The normal modes are measured with a superconducting pick-up coil coupled to a DC SQUID, and phase information is fed back to the piezoelectric actuator to feedback cool a center-of-mass mode to ~$\sim$~7~K, and a librational mode to $830 \pm 200$~mK. Q-factors of $1.0 \times 10^7$ are evaluated for the center-of-mass mode. We find that it is plausible to achieve ground state cooling of the center-of-mass mode by introducing vibration isolation, optimizing the geometry of the pick-up coil to focus on the specific mode of interest and utilizing a state-of-the-art SQUID for detection.</description>

      <title>Making Every Photon Count: A Quantum Polyspectra Approach to the Dynamics of Blinking Quantum Emitters at Low Photon Rates Without Binning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The blinking statistics of quantum emitters and their corresponding Markov models play an important role in high resolution microscopy of biological samples as well as in nano-optoelectronics and many other fields of science and engineering. Current methods for analyzing the blinking statistics like the full counting statistics or the Viterbi algorithm break down for low photon rates. We present an evaluation scheme that eliminates the need for both a minimum photon flux and the usual binning of photon events which limits the measurement bandwidth. Our approach is based on higher order spectra of the measurement record which we model within the recently introduced method of quantum polyspectra from the theory of continuous quantum measurements. By virtue of this approach we can determine on- and off-switching rates of a semiconductor quantum dot at light levels 1000 times lower than in a standard experiment and 20 times lower than achieved with a scheme from full counting statistics. Thus a very powerful high-bandwidth approach to the parameter learning task of single photon hidden Markov models has been established with applications in many fields of science.</description>

      <title>Native two-qubit gates in fixed-coupling, fixed-frequency transmons beyond cross-resonance interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixed-frequency superconducting qubits demonstrate remarkable success as platforms for stable and scalable quantum computing. Cross-resonance gates have been the workhorse of fixed-coupling, fixed-frequency superconducting processors, leveraging the entanglement generated by driving one qubit resonantly with a neighbor's frequency to achieve high-fidelity, universal CNOTs. Here, we use on-resonant and off-resonant microwave drives to go beyond cross-resonance, realizing natively interesting two-qubit gates that are not equivalent to CNOTs. In particular, we implement and benchmark native ISWAP, SWAP, $\sqrt{\text{ISWAP}}$, and BSWAP gates. Furthermore, we apply these techniques for an efficient construction of the B-gate: a perfect entangler from which any two-qubit gate can be reached in only two applications. We show these native two-qubit gates are better than their counterparts compiled from cross-resonance gates. We elucidate the resonance conditions required to drive each two-qubit gate and provide a novel frame tracking technique to implement them in Qiskit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum optics, measurement statistics -- for example, photocounting statistics -- are considered nonclassical if they cannot be reproduced with statistical mixtures of classical radiation fields. We have formulated a necessary and sufficient condition for such nonclassicality. This condition is given by a set of inequalities that tightly bound the convex set of probabilities associated with classical electromagnetic radiation. Analytical forms for full sets and subsets of these inequalities are obtained for important cases of realistic photocounting measurements and unbalanced homodyne detection. As an example, we consider photocounting statistics of phase-squeezed coherent states. Contrary to a common intuition, the analysis developed here reveals distinct nonclassical properties of these statistics that can be experimentally corroborated with minimal resources.</description>

Abstract: Unitary t-designs are distributions on the unitary group whose first t moments appear maximally random. Previous work has established several upper bounds on the depths at which certain specific random quantum circuit ensembles approximate t-designs. Here we show that these bounds can be extended to any fixed architecture of Haar-random two-site gates. This is accomplished by relating the spectral gaps of such architectures to those of 1D brickwork architectures. Our bound depends on the details of the architecture only via the typical number of layers needed for a block of the circuit to form a connected graph over the sites. When this quantity is independent of width, the circuit forms an approximate t-design in linear depth. We also give an implicit bound for nondeterministic architectures in terms of properties of the corresponding distribution over fixed architectures.</description>

Abstract: The time evolution of quantum many-body systems is one of the most promising applications for near-term quantum computers. However, the utility of current quantum devices is strongly hampered by the proliferation of hardware errors. The minimization of the circuit depth for a given quantum algorithm is therefore highly desirable, since shallow circuits generally are less vulnerable to decoherence. Recently, it was shown that variational circuits are a promising approach to outperform current state-of-the-art methods such as Trotter decomposition, although the optimal choice of parameters is a computationally demanding task. In this work, we demonstrate a simplification of the variational optimization of circuits implementing the time evolution operator of local Hamiltonians by directly encoding constraints of the physical system under consideration. We study the expressibility of such constrained variational circuits for different models and constraints. Our results show that the encoding of constraints allows a reduction of optimization cost by more than one order of magnitude and scalability to arbitrary large system sizes, without loosing accuracy in most systems. Furthermore, we discuss the exceptions in locally-constrained systems and provide an explanation by means of an restricted lightcone width after incorporating the constraints into the circuits.</description>

Abstract: Estimation of physical observables for unknown quantum states is an important problem that underlies a wide range of fields, including quantum information processing, quantum physics, and quantum chemistry. In the context of quantum computation, in particular, existing studies have mainly focused on holistic state tomography or estimation on specific observables with known classical descriptions, while this lacks the important class of problems where the estimation target itself relies on the measurement outcome. In this work, we propose an adaptive measurement optimization method that is useful for the quantum subspace methods, namely the variational simulation methods that utilize classical postprocessing on measurement outcomes. The proposed method first determines the measurement protocol for classically simulatable states, and then adaptively updates the protocol of quantum subspace expansion (QSE) according to the quantum measurement result. As a numerical demonstration, we have shown for excited-state simulation of molecules that (i) we are able to reduce the number of measurements by an order of magnitude by constructing an appropriate measurement strategy (ii) the adaptive iteration converges successfully even for a strongly correlated molecule of H$_4$. Our work reveals that the potential of the QSE method can be empowered by elaborated measurement protocols, and opens a path to further pursue efficient quantum measurement techniques in practical computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and benchmark a quantum computing approach to calculate the two-dimensional coherent spectrum (2DCS) of high-spin models. Our approach is based on simulating their real-time dynamics in the presence of several magnetic field pulses, which are spaced in time. We utilize the adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) algorithm for the study due to its compact circuits, which enables simulations over sufficiently long times to achieve the required resolution in frequency space. Specifically, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin model that incorporates Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and single-ion anisotropy. The obtained 2DCS spectra exhibit distinct peaks at multiples of the magnon frequency, arising from transitions between different eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian. By comparing the one-dimensional coherent spectrum with 2DCS, we demonstrate that 2DCS provides a higher resolution of the energy spectrum. We further investigate how the quantum resources scale with the magnitude of the spin using two different binary encodings of the high-spin operators: the standard binary encoding and the Gray code. At low magnetic fields both encodings require comparable quantum resources, but at larger field strengths the Gray code is advantageous. Numerical simulations for spin models with increasing number of sites indicate a polynomial system-size scaling for quantum resources. Lastly, we compare the numerical 2DCS with experimental results on a rare-earth orthoferrite system. The observed strength of the magnonic high-harmonic generation signals in the 2DCS of the quantum high-spin model aligns well with the experimental data, showing significant improvement over the corresponding mean-field results.</description>

      <title>On the approximability of random-hypergraph MAX-3-XORSAT problems with quantum algorithms</title>

Abstract: A canonical feature of the constraint satisfaction problems in NP is approximation hardness, where in the worst case, finding sufficient-quality approximate solutions is exponentially hard for all known methods. Fundamentally, the lack of any guided local minimum escape method ensures both exact and approximate classical approximation hardness, but the equivalent mechanism(s) for quantum algorithms are poorly understood. For algorithms based on Hamiltonian time evolution, we explore this question through the prototypically hard MAX-3-XORSAT problem class. We conclude that the mechanisms for quantum exact and approximation hardness are fundamentally distinct. We review known results from the literature, and identify mechanisms that make conventional quantum methods (such as Adiabatic Quantum Computing) weak approximation algorithms in the worst case. We construct a family of spectrally filtered quantum algorithms that escape these issues, and develop analytical theories for their performance. We show that, for random hypergraphs in the approximation-hard regime, if we define the energy to be $E = N_{\mathrm{unsat}}-N_{\mathrm{sat}}$, spectrally filtered quantum optimization will return states with $E \leq q_m E_{\mathrm{GS}}$ (where $E_{\rm GS}$ is the ground state energy) in sub-quadratic time, where conservatively, $q_m \simeq 0.59$. This is in contrast to $q_m \to 0$ for the hardest instances with classical searches. We test all of these claims with extensive numerical simulations. We do not claim that this approximation guarantee holds for all possible hypergraphs, though our algorithm's mechanism can likely generalize widely. These results suggest that quantum computers are more powerful for approximate optimization than had been previously assumed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics Happens Only on Paper: QBism's Account of Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QBism has long recognized quantum states, POVM elements, Kraus operators, and even unitary operations to be cut from the same cloth: They express aspects of an agent's personal belief system concerning the consequences (for her) of actions she might take on her external world. Such action-consequence pairs have conventionally been called "quantum measurements." The calculus of quantum theory is then viewed as an empirically motivated addition to Bayesian decision theory when brought to this notion of measurement. This radical approach has allowed QBism to eliminate conceptual problems that plague other interpretations of quantum mechanics. However, one issue has remained elusive: If a QBist does not believe in the existence of an ontic (agent-independent) dynamical variable evolving over time, why would there be any constraints on her quantum-state assignment in the absence of performing a measurement? Why would she introduce unitary or open-system quantum dynamics at all? Here, we present a representation theorem based on van Fraassen's reflection principle to answer these questions. Simply put, an agent's assignment of quantum dynamics represents her belief that a measurement action she is contemplating would not change her current odds for future gambles. A corollary to this approach is that one can make sense of "open-system dynamics" without introducing an "environment with a measurement record" as is common in decoherence accounts of quantum measurement. Instead, the QBist understanding of decoherence rests entirely on an agent's beliefs about the system of interest (not system plus environment) and her judgments about measurements she might perform on that system. More broadly, this result establishes QBism's contention that measurement itself is the central concept of quantum theory and thus the framework upon which any future QBist ontology must hang.</description>

      <title>Rigorous results on approach to thermal equilibrium, entanglement, and nonclassicality of an optical quantum field mode scattering from the elements of a non-equilibrium quantum reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rigorous derivations of the approach of individual elements of large isolated systems to a state of thermal equilibrium, starting from arbitrary initial states, are exceedingly rare. This is particularly true for quantum mechanical systems. We demonstrate here how, through a mechanism of repeated scattering, an approach to equilibrium of this type actually occurs in a specific quantum system, one that can be viewed as a natural quantum analog of several previously studied classical models. In particular, we consider an optical mode passing through a reservoir composed of a large number of sequentially-encountered modes of the same frequency, each of which it interacts with through a beam splitter. We then analyze the dependence of the asymptotic state of this mode on the assumed stationary common initial state $\sigma$ of the reservoir modes and on the transmittance $\tau=\cos\lambda$ of the beam splitters. These results allow us to establish that at small $\lambda$ such a mode will, starting from an arbitrary initial system state $\rho$, approach a state of thermal equilibrium even when the reservoir modes are not themselves initially thermalized. We show in addition that, when the initial states are pure, the asymptotic state of the optical mode is maximally entangled with the reservoir and exhibits less nonclassicality than the state of the reservoir modes.</description>

      <title>Ancilla-Assisted Process Tomography with Bipartiete Mixed Separable States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that the entanglement between the system state and the ancillary state is not a strict requirement for performing ancilla-assisted process tomography(AAPT). Instead, it only requires that the system-ancilla state be faithful, which, in practice, is the invertibility of a certain matrix representing the state. Our paper takes on the operational definition of faithfulness, i.e., a state is faithful if one can extract complete information about the quantum process, and we restrict the process to single-qubit operations on a two-qubit system-ancilla state. We present a theoretical analysis to connect the invertibility problem to the concept of Sinisterness, which quantifies the correlation of two qubits. Using Sinisterness, we derive a way of constructing two-qubit states that are guaranteed to be faithful in an operational sense and estimate the bound on the average error of the process. Our analysis agrees that the maximally entangled states provided the smallest error amplification. Nevertheless, it maps out a numerical region where the advantage of the entanglement starts.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous ground-state cooling of two levitated nanoparticles by coherent scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous ground-state cooling of two levitated nanoparticles is a crucial prerequisite for investigation of macroscopic quantum effects such as quantum entanglement and quantum correlation involving translational motion of particles. Here we consider a coupled cavity-levitated-particle system and present a detailed derivation of its Hamiltonian. We find that the $y$-direction motions of the two particles are decoupled from the cavity field and both the $x$- and $z$-direction motions, and that the $z$-direction motions can be further decoupled from the cavity field and the $x$-direction motions by choosing proper locations of the particles. We study the simultaneous cooling of these mechanical modes in both the three-mode and five-mode cavity-levitated optomechanical models. It is found that there exists the dark-mode effect when the two tweezers have the same powers, which suppress the simultaneous ground-state cooling. Nevertheless, the simultaneous ground-state cooling of these modes can be realized by breaking the dark-mode effect under proper parameters. Our system provides a versatile platform to study quantum effects and applications in cavity-levitated optomechanical systems.</description>

      <title>ILP-based Resource Optimization Realized by Quantum Annealing for Optical Wide-area Communication Networks -- A Framework for Solving Combinatorial Problems of a Real-world Application by Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resource allocation of wide-area internet networks is inherently a combinatorial optimization problem that if solved quickly, could provide near real-time adaptive control of internet-protocol traffic ensuring increased network efficacy and robustness, while minimizing energy requirements coming from power-hungry transceivers. In recent works we demonstrated how such a problem could be cast as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem that can be embedded onto the D-Wave AdvantageTM quantum annealer system, demonstrating proof of principle. Our initial studies left open the possibility for improvement of D-Wave solutions via judicious choices of system run parameters. Here we report on our investigations for optimizing these system parameters, and how we incorporate machine learning (ML) techniques to further improve on the quality of solutions. In particular, we use the Hamming distance to investigate correlations between various system-run parameters and solution vectors. We then apply a decision tree neural network (NN) to learn these correlations, with the goal of using the neural network to provide further guesses to solution vectors. We successfully implement this NN in a simple integer linear programming (ILP) example, demonstrating how the NN can fully map out the solution space that was not captured by D-Wave. We find, however, for the 3-node network problem the NN is not able to enhance the quality of space of solutions.</description>

      <title>Amplification of genuine tripartite nonlocality and entanglement in the Schwarzschild spacetime under decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the amplification of the genuine tripartite nonlocality(GTN) and the genuine tripartite entanglement(GTE) of Dirac particles in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole by a local filtering operation under decoherence. It is shown that the physically accessible GTN will be completely destroyed by decoherence, which means that the physically accessible GTN will not exist in the system. Particularly, the local filtering operation can make the physically accessible GTN appear within a certain range of Hawking temperature, namely, the local filtering operation can cause the physically accessible GTN to be generated in the system coupled with the environment, which is not discovered before and is benefit for the quantum information processing. Furthermore, we also find that the physically accessible GTE approaches a stable value in the limit of infinite Hawking temperature for most cases, but if the decoherence parameter $p$ is less than 1, the ``sudden death'' of GTE will take place when the decoherence strength is large enough. It is worth noting that the nonzero stable value of GTE can be increased by performing the local filtering operation, even in the presence of decoherence. Finally, we explore the generation of physically inaccessible GTN and GTE of other tripartite subsystems under decoherence, it is shown that the physically inaccessible GTN cannot be produced, but the physically inaccessible GTE can be produced. In addition, we can see that the generated physically inaccessible GTE can be increased by applying the local filtering operation.</description>

      <title>Thresholds for the distributed surface code in the presence of memory decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the search for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing, distributed quantum computers are promising candidates. These systems can be realized in large-scale quantum networks or condensed onto a single chip with closely situated nodes. We present a framework for numerical simulations of a memory channel using the distributed toric surface code, where each data qubit of the code is part of a separate node, and the error-detection performance depends on the quality of four-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states generated between the nodes. We quantitatively investigate the effect of memory decoherence and evaluate the advantage of GHZ creation protocols tailored to the level of decoherence. We do this by applying our framework for the particular case of color centers in diamond, employing models developed from experimental characterization of nitrogen-vacancy centers. For diamond color centers, coherence times during entanglement generation are orders of magnitude lower than coherence times of idling qubits. These coherence times represent a limiting factor for applications, but previous surface code simulations did not treat them as such. Introducing limiting coherence times as a prominent noise factor makes it imperative to integrate realistic operation times into simulations and incorporate strategies for operation scheduling. Our model predicts error probability thresholds for gate and measurement reduced by at least a factor of three compared to prior work with more idealized noise models. We also find a threshold of $4\cdot10^2$ in the ratio between the entanglement generation and the decoherence rates, setting a benchmark for experimental progress.</description>

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a versatile paradigm in computational neuroscience and machine learning, that exploits the non-linear dynamics of a dynamical system - the reservoir - to efficiently process time-dependent information. Since its introduction, it has exhibited remarkable capabilities in various applications. As widely known, classes of reservoir computers serve as universal approximators of functionals with fading memory. The construction of such universal classes often appears context-specific, but in fact, they follow the same principles. Here we present a unified theoretical framework and we propose a ready-made setting to secure universality. We test the result in the arising context of quantum reservoir computing.The analysis sheds light on a unified view of classical and quantum reservoir computing.</description>

      <title>Minimum Detection Efficiencies for Loophole-free Genuine Nonlocality Tests</title>

Abstract: The certification of quantum nonlocality, which has immense significance in architecting device-independent technologies, confronts severe experimental challenges. Detection loophole, originating from the unavailability of perfect detectors, is one of the major issues amongst them. In the present study we focus on the minimum detection efficiency (MDE) required to detect various forms of genuine nonlocality, originating from the type of causal constraints imposed on the involved parties. In this context, we demonstrate that the MDE needed to manifest the recently suggested $T_2$-type nonlocality deviates significantly from perfection. Additionally, we have computed the MDE necessary to manifest Svetlichny's nonlocality, with state-independent approach markedly reducing the previously established bound. Finally, considering the inevitable existence of noise we demonstrate the robustness of the imperfect detectors to certify $T_2$-type nonlocality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a heralded single-photon source based on injecting a superposition of oppositely squeezed states onto a beam splitter. Our superposition of squeezed states is composed of only even photon number states (the number of photons is equal to $2,6,10,...$) meaning the probability for an emitted single photon given as a heralded single-photon event is higher than what one can achieve from the usual two-mode squeezed state. This enables one to realize an enhanced heralded single-photon source. We discuss how to create this superposition of squeezed states utilizing a single-mode squeezed state and the cross-Kerr nonlinearity. Our proposed method significantly improves the probability of emitting the heralded single photon compared to spontaneous parametric down-conversion.</description>

Abstract: Bosonic systems with negative Wigner function superposition states are fundamentally witnessing nonlinear quantum dynamics beyond linearized systems and, recently, have become essential resources of quantum technology with many applications. Typically, they appear due to sophisticated combination of external drives, nonlinear control, measurements or strong nonlinear dissipation of subsystems to an environment. Here, we propose a conceptually different and more autonomous way to obtain such states, avoiding these ingredients, using purely sudden interaction decay in the paradigmatic interacting qubit-oscillator system weakly coupled to bath at thermal equilibrium in a low-temperature limit. We demonstrate simultaneously detectable unconditional negative Wigner function and quantum coherence and their qualitative enhancement employing more qubits.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state purification plays a pivotal role in quantum communication and quantum computation, aiming to recover the purified state from multiple copies of an unknown noisy state. This work introduces a general state purification framework designed to achieve the highest fidelity with a specified probability and characterize the associated trade-offs. In particular, for i.i.d. quantum states under depolarizing noise, we propose an explicit purification protocol capable of achieving maximal fidelity with a target probability. Furthermore, we present quantum circuits for implementing the optimal purification protocols via the block encoding technique and propose recursive protocols for stream purification. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of our protocols in terms of efficiency and flexibility in purifying noisy quantum states under various quantum noise models of interest, showcasing the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The constraint coordinate-momentum phase space (CPS) formulation of finite-state quantum systems has recently revealed that the triangle window function approach is an isomorphic representation of the exact population-population correlation function of the two-state system. We use the triangle window (TW) function and the CPS mapping kernel element to formulate a novel useful representation of discrete electronic degrees of freedom (DOFs). When it is employed with nonadiabatic field (NaF) dynamics, a new variant of the NaF approach (i.e., NaF-TW) is proposed. Extensive benchmark tests of model systems in both the condensed phase and gas phase demonstrate that the NaF-TW approach is competent in faithfully capturing the dynamical interplay between electronic and nuclear DOFs. In comparison to the symmetrical quasi-classical (SQC) method where triangle window functions were originally proposed, the performance of NaF-TW is significantly better when the bifurcation characteristic of nuclear motion in the asymptotic region is important.</description>

Abstract: Using the principles of the ETH - Approach to Quantum Mechanics we study fluorescence and the phenomenon of ``quantum jumps'' in idealized models of atoms coupled to the quantized electromagnetic field. In a limiting regime where the orbital motion of the atoms is neglected and the velocity of light tends to infinity we derive explicit non-linear stochastic differential equations describing the effective time evolution of states of individual atoms. These equations give rise to a measure on state-trajectories with quantum jumps which is a quantum-mechanical analogue of the Wiener measure of Brownian motion. Our results amount to a derivation of the fundamental randomness in the quantum-mechanical description of microscopic systems from basic principles in the context of some simple models.</description>

Abstract: We develop a simple model and propose a scheme that allows the production of twisted atoms in free space using the absorption of twisted photons by a bound electron. We show that in the inelastic collision of a photon and an atom, the twisted state of the photon is transferred to the center-of-mass state, so that the projection of the orbital momentum of the atom becomes $m_\gamma-\Delta m_e$. We also show that, depending on the experimental conditions, the twistedness of the photon is either transferred to the atomic center-of-mass quantum state or modifies the selection rule for the bound electron transition. Proposed scheme is general and enables complex shaping of the atomic wavefront.</description>

Solid sorbents, such as metal-organic frameworks, are currently being tested for DAC application. However, their potential for deployment at scale has not been fully realized. The computational discovery of solid sorbents is challenging, given the vast chemical search space and the DAC requirements for molecular selectivity. Quantum computing can potentially accelerate the discovery of solid sorbents for DAC by predicting molecular binding energies. In this work, we explore simulation methods and algorithms for predicting gas adsorption in metal-organic frameworks using a quantum computer. Specifically, we simulate the potential energy surfaces of CO2, N2, and H2O molecules at the Mg+2 metal center that represents the binding sites of typical metal-organic frameworks. We apply the qubit-ADAPT-VQE technique to run simulations on both classical computing and quantum computing hardware, and achieve reasonable accuracy while maintaining hardware efficiency.</description>

Abstract: The preparation of mechanical quadrature-squeezed states holds significant importance in cavity optomechanics because the squeezed states have extensive applications in understanding fundamental quantum mechanics and exploiting modern quantum technonogy. Here, we propose a reliable scheme for generating mechanical quadrature squeezing in a typical cavity optomechanical system via seeking for optimal cavity-field driving pulses using the gradient-descent algorithm. We realize strong quadrature squeezing in a mechanical resonator that exceeds the 3 dB steady-state limit, even with a thermal phonon occupancy of one hundred. Furthermore, the mechanical squeezing can be ultrafastly created within one mechanical oscillation period. We also obtain the optimal pulsed drivings associated with the created mechanical squeezings and analyze the mechanism for mechanical squeezing generation. This work will promote the application of optimal quantum control in quantum optics and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>High-Coherence Kerr-cat qubit in 2D architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kerr-cat qubit is a bosonic qubit in which multi-photon Schrodinger cat states are stabilized by applying a two-photon drive to an oscillator with a Kerr nonlinearity. The suppressed bit-flip rate with increasing cat size makes this qubit a promising candidate to implement quantum error correction codes tailored for noise-biased qubits. However, achieving strong light-matter interactions necessary for stabilizing and controlling this qubit has traditionally required strong microwave drives that heat the qubit and degrade its performance. In contrast, increasing the coupling to the drive port removes the need for strong drives at the expense of large Purcell decay. By integrating an effective band-block filter on-chip, we overcome this trade-off and realize a Kerr-cat qubit in a scalable 2D superconducting circuit with high coherence. This filter provides 30 dB of isolation at the qubit frequency with negligible attenuation at the frequencies required for stabilization and readout. We experimentally demonstrate quantum non-demolition readout fidelity of 99.6% for a cat with 8 photons. Also, to have high-fidelity universal control over this qubit, we combine fast Rabi oscillations with a new demonstration of the X(90) gate through phase modulation of the stabilization drive. Finally, the lifetime in this architecture is examined as a function of the cat size of up to 10 photons in the oscillator achieving a bit-flip time higher than 1 ms and only a linear decrease in the phase-flip time, in good agreement with the theoretical analysis of the circuit. Our qubit shows promise as a building block for fault-tolerant quantum processors with a small footprint.</description>

      <title>Exploiting many-body localization for scalable variational quantum simulation</title>

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms have emerged as a promising approach to achieving practical quantum advantages using near-term quantum devices. Despite their potential, the scalability of these algorithms poses a significant challenge. This is largely attributed to the "barren plateau" phenomenon, which persists even in the absence of noise. In this work, we explore the many-body localization (MBL)-thermalization phase transitions within a framework of Floquet-initialized variational quantum circuits and investigate how MBL could be used to avoid barren plateaus. The phase transitions are observed through calculations of the inverse participation ratio, the entanglement entropy, and a metric termed low-weight stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. By initializing the circuit in the MBL phase and employing an easily preparable initial state, we find it is possible to prevent the formation of a unitary 2-design, resulting in an output state with entanglement that follows an area- rather than a volume-law, and which circumvents barren plateaus throughout the optimization. Utilizing this methodology, we successfully determine the ground states of various model Hamiltonians across different phases and show that the resources required for the optimization are significantly reduced. We have further validated the MBL approach through experiments carried out on the 127-qubit $ibm\_brisbane$ quantum processor. These experiments confirm that the gradients needed to carry out variational calculations are restored in the MBL phase of a Heisenberg model subject to random unitary "kicks". These results provide new insights into the interplay between MBL and quantum computing, and suggest that the role of MBL states should be considered in the design of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Enhanced Superradiance of a Ryderg-Atom Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the superradiant phase transition of an array of Rydberg atoms in a dissipative microwave cavity. Under the interplay of the cavity field and the long-range Rydberg interaction, the steady state of the system exhibits an interaction-enhanced superradiance, with vanishing critical atom-cavity coupling rates at a discrete set of interaction strengths. We find that, while the phenomenon can be analytically understood in the case of a constant all-to-all interaction, the enhanced superradiance persists under typical experimental parameters with spatially dependent interactions, but at modified critical interaction strengths. The diverging susceptibility at these critical points is captured by emergent quantum Rabi models, each of which comprises a pair of collective atomic states with different numbers of atomic excitations. These collective states become degenerate at the critical interaction strengths, resulting in a superradiant phase for an arbitrarily small atom-cavity coupling.</description>

Abstract: A quantum advantage can be achieved in the unitary charging of quantum batteries if their cells are interacting. Here, we try to clarify with some analytical calculations whether and how this quantum advantage is achieved for sparse Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) interactions. By performing a simple modelization, we find that for $q$-point rescaled sparse SYK interactions the quantum advantage goes as $\Gamma\sim N^{\frac{\alpha-q}{2}+\frac{1}{2}}$ for $\alpha\geq q/2$ and $\Gamma\sim N^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ for $q/2&gt;\alpha\geq 0$, where $\alpha$ is related to the connectivity and $N$ is the number of cells.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state transfer (QST) describes the coherent passage of quantum information from one node in a network to another. Experiments on QST span a diverse set of platforms and currently report transport across up to tens of nodes in times of several hundred nanoseconds with fidelities that can approach 90% or more. Theoretical studies examine both the lossless time evolution associated with a given (Hermitian) lattice Hamiltonian and methods based on the master equation that allows for losses. In this paper, we describe Monte Carlo techniques which enable the discovery of a Hamiltonian that gives high-fidelity QST. We benchmark our approach in geometries appropriate to coupled optical cavity-emitter arrays and discuss connections to condensed matter Hamiltonians of localized orbitals coupled to conduction bands. The resulting Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard and periodic Anderson models can, in principle, be engineered in appropriate hardware to give efficient QST.</description>

      <title>Simulation of feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization for a realistic neutral atom system with an optimized small-angle controlled-phase gate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contrast to the classical optimization process required by the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, FALQON, a feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization [A. B. Magann {\it et al.,} {\color{blue}Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf129}, 250502 (2022)}], enables one to obtain approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems without any classical optimization effort. In this study, we leverage the specifications of a recent experimental platform for the neutral atom system [Z. Fu {\it et al.,} {\color{blue}Phys. Rev. A {\bf105}, 042430 (2022)}] and present a scheme to implement an optimally tuned small-angle controlled-phase gate. By examining the 2- to 4-qubit FALQON algorithms in the Max-Cut problem and considering the spontaneous emission of the neutral atomic system, we have observed that the performance of FALQON implemented with small-angle controlled-phase gates exceeds that of FALQON utilizing CZ gates. This approach has the potential to significantly simplify the logic circuit required to simulate FALQON and effectively address the Max-Cut problem, which may pave a way for the experimental implementation of near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms with neutral-atom systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.10158v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting transition-edge sensors (TES) are extremely sensitive microcalorimeters used as photon detectors with unparalleled energy resolution. They have found application from measuring astronomical spectra through to determining the quantum property of photon-number, $\hat{n} {=} \hat{a}^{\dag} \hat{a}$, for energies from 0.6-2.33eV. However, achieving optimal energy resolution requires considerable data acquisition -- on the order of 1GB/min -- followed by post-processing, which does not allow access to energy information in real time. Here we use a custom hardware processor to process TES pulses while new detections are still being registered, allowing photon-number to be measured in real time as well as reducing data requirements by orders-of-magnitude. We resolve photon number up to n=16 -- achieving up to parts-per-billion discrimination for low photon numbers on the fly -- providing transformational capacity for applications of TES detectors from astronomy through to quantum technology.</description>

Abstract: Rayleigh's criterion posits that resolving point sources below point spread function width is impossible. Statistical estimation overcomes this but suffers from increasing error at shorter distances, known as Rayleigh's curse. Target mode shaping solves this for equal sources but not for multi-parameter objects like emitters with unknown brightness ratio. We propose BLESS technique, utilizing Beam moduLation and Examination of Shot Statistics, breaking Rayleigh's curse for unbalanced sources. Demonstrated through classical and quantum Cramer-Rao bound calculations, BLESS shows significant potential for real imaging experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum gravity is expected to introduce quantum aspects into the description of reference frames. Here we set the stage for exploring how quantum gravity induced deformations of classical symmetries could modify the transformation laws among reference frames in an effective regime. We invoke the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ as a description of deformed spatial rotations and interpret states of a representation of its algebra as describing the relative orientation between two reference frames. This leads to a quantization of one of the Euler angles and to the new paradigm of agency-dependence: space is reconstructed as a collection of fuzzy points, exclusive to each agent, which depends on their choice of reference frame. Each agent can choose only one direction in which points can be sharp, while points in all other directions become fuzzy in a way that depends on this choice. Two agents making different choices will thus observe the same points with different degrees of fuzziness.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases with Average Symmetries: the Decohered, the Disordered, and the Intrinsic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global symmetries greatly enrich the landscape of topological quantum phases, playing an essential role from topological insulators to fractional quantum Hall effect. Topological phases in mixed quantum states, originating from \textit{decoherence} in open quantum systems or \textit{disorders} in imperfect crystalline solids, have recently garnered significant interest. Unlike pure states, mixed quantum states can exhibit \textit{average symmetries} -- symmetries that keep the total ensemble invariant but not on each individual state. In this work, we present a systematic classification and characterization of average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phases applicable to generic symmetry groups, encompassing both average and exact symmetries, for bosonic and fermionic systems. Moreover, we formulate the theory of average symmetry-enriched topological (ASET) orders in disordered bosonic systems. Our systematic approach helps clarify nuanced issues in previous literature and uncovers compelling new physics. Notably, we discover that (1) the definition and classification of ASPT phases in decohered and disordered systems exhibit subtle differences; (2) despite these differences, ASPT phases in both settings can be classified and characterized under a unified framework of defect decoration and spectral sequence; (3) this systematic classification uncovers a plethora of ASPT phases that are \textit{intrinsically mixed}, implying they can exclusively manifest in decohered or disordered systems where part of the symmetry is average; (4) similarly for ASET, we find intrinsically disordered phases exhibiting exotic anyon behaviors -- the ground states of such phases necessarily contain localized anyons, with gapless (yet still localized) excitation spectral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several methods in nonadiabatic molecular dynamics are based on Madelung's hydrodynamic description of nuclear motion, while the electronic component is treated as a finite-dimensional quantum system. In this context, the quantum potential leads to severe computational challenges and one often seeks to neglect its contribution, thereby approximating nuclear motion as classical. The resulting model couples classical hydrodynamics for the nuclei to the quantum motion of the electronic component, leading to the structure of a complex fluid system. This type of mixed quantum-classical fluid models have also appeared in solvation dynamics to describe the coupling between liquid solvents and the quantum solute molecule. While these approaches represent a promising direction, their mathematical structure requires a certain care. In some cases, challenging higher-order gradients make these equations hardly tractable. In other cases, these models are based on phase-space formulations that suffer from well-known consistency issues. Here, we present a new complex fluid system that resolves these difficulties. Unlike common approaches, the current system is obtained by applying the fluid closure at the level of the action principle of the original phase-space model. As a result, the system inherits a Hamiltonian structure and retains energy/momentum balance. After discussing some of its structural properties and dynamical invariants, we illustrate the model in the case of pure-dephasing dynamics. We conclude by presenting some invariant planar models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experiment involving the entanglement of two massive particles through gravitational fields has been devised to discern the quantum attributes of gravity. In this paper, we present a scheme to extend this experiment's applicability to more generalized curved spacetimes, with the objective of validating universal quantum gravity within broader contexts. Specifically, we direct our attention towards the quantum gravity induced entanglement of mass (QGEM) in astrophysical phenomena, such as particles traversing the interstellar medium. Notably, we ascertain that the gravitational field within curved spacetime can induce observable entanglement between particle pairs in both scenarios, even when dealing with particles significantly smaller than mesoscopic masses. Furthermore, we obtain the characteristic spectra of QGEM across diverse scenarios, shedding light on potential future experimental examinations. This approach not only establishes a more pronounced and extensive manifestation of the quantum influences of gravity compared to the original scheme but also opens avenues for prospective astronomical experiments. These experiments, aligned with our postulates, hold immense advantages and implications for the detection of quantum gravity and can be envisioned for future design.</description>

Abstract: We study the electronic excitation spectra in solid molecular hydrogen (phase I) at ambient temperature and 5-90 GPa pressures using Quantum Monte Carlo methods and Many-Body Perturbation Theory. In this range, the system changes from a wide gap molecular insulator to a semiconductor, altering the nature of the excitations from localized to delocalized. Computed gaps and spectra agree with experiments, proving the ability to predict accurately band gaps of many-body systems in presence of nuclear quantum and thermal effects.</description>

      <title>A Modified Cosmic Brane Proposal for Holographic Renyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new formula for computing holographic Renyi entropies in the presence of multiple extremal surfaces. Our proposal is based on computing the wave function in the basis of fixed-area states and assuming a diagonal approximation for the Renyi entropy. For Renyi index $n\geq1$, our proposal agrees with the existing cosmic brane proposal for holographic Renyi entropy. For $n&lt;1$, however, our proposal predicts a new phase with leading order (in Newton's constant $G$) corrections to the cosmic brane proposal, even far from entanglement phase transitions and when bulk quantum corrections are unimportant. Recast in terms of optimization over fixed-area states, the difference between the two proposals can be understood to come from the order of optimization: for $n&lt;1$, the cosmic brane proposal is a minimax prescription whereas our proposal is a maximin prescription. We demonstrate the presence of such leading order corrections using illustrative examples. In particular, our proposal reproduces existing results in the literature for the PSSY model and high-energy eigenstates, providing a universal explanation for previously found leading order corrections to the $n&lt;1$ Renyi entropies.</description>

      <title>ResQuNNs:Towards Enabling Deep Learning in Quantum Convolution Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing the performance of Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by introducing trainable quanvolutional layers and addressing the critical challenges associated with them. Traditional quanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely been static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our research overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers, significantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the introduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities in gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing gradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel architecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging the concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by adding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between quanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the network, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within QuNNs. Through extensive experimentation, we identify an efficient configuration of residual blocks, which enables gradients across all the layers in the network that eventually results in efficient training. Our findings suggest that the precise location of residual blocks plays a crucial role in maximizing the performance gains in QuNNs. Our results mark a substantial step forward in the evolution of quantum deep learning, offering new avenues for both theoretical development and practical quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Majorana zero-modes in a dissipative Rashba nanowire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Condensed matter systems are continuously subjected to dissipation, which often has adverse effects on quantum phenomena. We focus on the impact of dissipation on a superconducting Rashba nanowire. We reveal that the system can still host Majorana zero-modes (MZMs) with a finite lifetime in the presence of dissipation. Most interestingly, dissipation can also generate two kinds of dissipative boundary states: four robust zero-modes (RZMs) and two MZMs, in the regime where the non-dissipative system is topologically trivial. The MZMs appear via bulk gap closing and are topologically characterized by a winding number. The RZMs are not associated with any bulk states and possess no winding number, but their emergence is instead tied to exceptional points. Further, we confirm the stability of the dissipation-induced RZMs and MZMs in the presence of random disorder. Our study paves the way for both realizing and stabilizing MZMs in an experimental setup, driven by dissipation.</description>

      <title>Queue-aware Network Control Algorithm with a High Quantum Computing Readiness-Evaluated in Discrete-time Flow Simulator for Fat-Pipe Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emerging technology of quantum computing has the potential to change the way how problems will be solved in the future. This work presents a centralized network control algorithm executable on already existing quantum computer which are based on the principle of quantum annealing like the D-Wave Advantage. We introduce a resource reoccupation algorithm for traffic engineering in wide-area networks. The proposed optimization algorithm changes traffic steering and resource allocation in case of overloaded transceivers. Settings of active components like fiber amplifiers and transceivers are not changed for the reason of stability. This algorithm is beneficial in situations when the network traffic is fluctuating in time scales of seconds or spontaneous bursts occur. Further, we developed a discrete-time flow simulator to study the algorithm's performance in wide-area networks. Our network simulator considers backlog and loss modeling of buffered transmission lines. Concurring flows are handled equally in case of a backlog.
  This work provides an ILP-based network configuring algorithm that is applicable on quantum annealing computers. We showcase, that traffic losses can be reduced significantly by a factor of 2 if a resource reoccupation algorithm is applied in a network with bursty traffic. As resources are used more efficiently by reoccupation in heavy load situations, overprovisioning of networks can be reduced. Thus, this new form of network operation leads toward a zero-margin network. We show that our newly introduced network simulator enables analyses of short-time effects like buffering within fat-pipe networks. As the calculation of network configurations in real-sized networks is typically time-consuming, quantum computing can enable the proposed network configuration algorithm for application in real-sized wide-area networks.</description>

      <title>The Application of Tailored Fields for Studying Chirality and Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort laser pulses pose unique tools to trigger and probe the fastest charge dynamics in matter, allowing the investigation of fundamental physical phenomena with unprecedented resolution in space, time, and energy. One of the most fascinating opportunities that ultrashort pulses offer is the possibility of modulating and investigating symmetries by tailoring the properties of the laser beam in the spatial and polarization domains, effectively controlling symmetry breaking on multiple levels. In particular, this allows probing chiral matter and ultrafast chiral dynamics. In recent years, the development of highly sensitive approaches for studying chirality has been a hot topic in physics and chemistry that has developed largely separately from the field of tailored light. This perspective discusses the individual and joint evolution of these fields with an emphasis on how the fields have already cross-fertilized, opening new opportunities in science. We outline a future outlook of how the topics are expected to fully merge and mutually evolve, emphasizing outstanding open issues.</description>

      <title>Gravitational entropy is observer-dependent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum gravity, it has been argued that a proper accounting of the role played by an observer promotes the von Neumann algebra of observables in a given spacetime subregion from Type III to Type II. While this allows for a mathematically precise definition of its entropy, we show that this procedure depends on which observer is employed. We make this precise by considering a setup in which many possible observers are present; by generalising previous approaches, we derive density operators for the subregion relative to different observers (and relative to arbitrary collections of observers), and we compute the associated entropies in a semiclassical regime, as well as in some specific examples that go beyond this regime. We find that the entropies seen by distinct observers can drastically differ. Our work makes extensive use of the formalism of quantum reference frames (QRF); indeed, as we point out, the 'observers' considered here and in the previous works are nothing but QRFs. In the process, we demonstrate that the description of physical states and observables invoked by Chandrasekaran et al. [arXiv:2206.10780] is equivalent to the Page-Wootters formalism, leading to the informal slogan "PW=CLPW". It is our hope that this paper will help motivate a long overdue union between the QRF and quantum gravity communities. Further details will appear in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Higher-Order Topology via Polarized Topological Charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-space topological invariants were widely used to characterize chiral-symmetric higher-order topological phases (HOTPs). However, a momentum-space characterization to these HOTPs, which essentially reveals their intrinsic bulk-boundary correspondence and facilitates their detection in quantum simulation systems, is still lacking. Here, we propose an experimentally observable momentum-space characterization to the chiral-symmetric HOTPs by the concept of polarized topological charges. It provides a unified description to topological phase transitions caused by the closing and reopening of band gap not only of the bulk states but also the edge states. Remarkably, these polarized topological charges can be identified by measuring the pseudospin structures. A feasible scheme to detect the HOTPs in the $^{87}$Rb cold atomic system is given. Our work opens an avenue for characterization and experimental detection of the chiral-symmetric HOTPs in momentum space.</description>

      <title>Feynman Paradox about the Josephson effect and a sawtooth current in the double junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Feynman approach to the Josephson effect, which employs a pair of linear coupling equations for its modeling. It is found that while the exact solutions can account for the AC Josephson effect when the coupling strength is significantly less than the voltage, they fail to produce the DC Josephson effect in any practical scenario. To address this fundamental discrepancy, we derive the coupled Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations for two interconnected superconductors based on BCS theory. These equations reveal that the nonlinear coupling, which is overlooked in the Feynman method, is crucial in describing the spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, a critical factor for achieving the DC Josephson effect. When the coupled GL equations are applied to a double junction, a sawtooth current pattern emerges, a result unattainable via the Feynman approach.</description>

      <title>The Magic in Nuclear and Hypernuclear Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Toward an improved understanding of the role of quantum information in nuclei and exotic matter, we examine the magic (non-stabilizerness) in low-energy strong interaction processes. As stabilizer states can be prepared efficiently using classical computers, and include classes of entangled states, it is magic and fluctuations in magic, along with entanglement, that determine resource requirements for quantum simulations. As a measure of fluctuations in magic induced by scattering, the "magic power" of the S-matrix is introduced. Using experimentally-determined scattering phase shifts and mixing parameters, the magic power in nucleon-nucleon and hyperon-nucleon scattering, along with the magic in the deuteron, are found to exhibit interesting features. The $\Sigma^-$-baryon is identified as a potential candidate catalyst for enhanced spreading of magic and entanglement in dense matter, depending on in-medium decoherence.</description>

      <title>Fast transport and splitting of spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of tunable spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates confined within a harmonic trap, focusing on rapid transport, spin manipulation, and splitting dynamics. Using shortcuts to adiabaticity, we design time-dependent trap trajectories and spin-orbit-coupling strength to facilitate fast transport with simultaneous spin flip. Additionally, we showcase the creation of spin-dependent coherent states via engineering the spin-orbit-coupling strength. To deepen our understanding, we elucidate non-adiabatic transport and associated spin dynamics, contrasting them with simple scenarios characterized by constant spin-orbit coupling and trap velocity. Furthermore, we discuss the transverse Zeeman potential and nonlinear effect induced by interatomic interactions using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, highlighting the stability and feasibility of the proposed protocols for the state-of-the-art experiments with cold atoms.</description>
