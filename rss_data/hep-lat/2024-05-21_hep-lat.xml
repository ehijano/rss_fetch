      <title>Chiral symmetry and Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem for staggered fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer (APS) index theorem corresponding to the chiral symmetry of a continuum formulation of staggered fermions called K\"ahler-Dirac fermions, which have been recently investigated as an ingredient in lattice constructions of chiral gauge theories. We point out that there are two notions of chiral symmetry for K\"ahler-Dirac fermions, both having a mixed perturbative anomaly with gravity leading to index theorems on closed manifolds. By formulating these theories on a manifold with boundary, we find the APS index theorems corresponding to each of these symmetries, necessary for a complete picture of anomaly inflow, using a recently discovered physics-motivated proof. We comment on a fundamental difference between the nature of these two symmetries by showing that a sensible local, symmetric boundary condition only exists for one of the two symmetries. This sheds light on how these symmetries behave under lattice discretization, and in particular on their use for recent symmetric-mass generation proposals.</description>

      <title>Digitization and subduction of $SU(N)$ gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of lattice gauge theories on quantum computers necessitates digitizing gauge fields. One approach involves substituting the continuous gauge group with a discrete subgroup, but the implications of this approximation still need to be clarified. To gain insights, we investigate the subduction of $ SU(2) $ and $ SU(3)$ to discrete crystal-like subgroups. Using classical lattice calculations, we show that subduction offers valuable information based on subduced direct sums, helping us identify additional terms to incorporate into the lattice action that can mitigate the effects of digitization. Furthermore, we compute the static potentials of all irreducible representations of $ \Sigma(360 \times 3) $ at a fixed lattice spacing. Our results reveal a percent-level agreement with the Casimir scaling of \( SU(3) \) for irreducible representations that subduce to a single $ \Sigma(360 \times 3) $ irreducible representation. This provides a diagnostic measure of approximation quality, as some irreducible representations closely match the expected results while others exhibit significant deviations.</description>

      <title>Study on the electromagnetic properties of the $[sc] [\bar q \bar b]$ and $[sc] [\bar s \bar b]$ states with $J^P = 1^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A systematic study of the electromagnetic properties of exotic states is conducted to elucidate their nature, which continues to be the subject of controversy and incomplete understanding in the field. In this study, the magnetic dipole and quadrupole moments of the tetraquarks $[sc] [\bar q \bar b]$ and $[sc] [\bar s \bar b]$ with spin-parity quantum numbers $J^P = 1^+$ are extracted in the context of a compact diquark-antidiquark configuration with the help of the QCD sum rules method. The magnetic dipole moments are given as $\mu_{[sc] [\bar u \bar b]} = -2.12^{+0.74}_{-0.59} \mu_N$, $\mu_{[sc] [\bar d \bar b]} = 1.66^{+0.60}_{-0.46} \mu_N$, and $\mu_{[sc] [\bar s \bar b]} = 2.01^{+0.61}_{-0.50} \mu_N$. The order of magnitude of the magnetic dipole moments would suggest that these outcomes may be achievable in forthcoming experiments. The magnetic and quadrupole moments of hadrons represent another important observable, along with their mass and decay width, which contribute to our understanding of the underlying quark structure and dynamics. Therefore, we hope that the results of this study will prove useful in theoretical and experimental investigations, which we anticipate will be an interesting research topic.</description>

      <title>Theory of CP angles measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early 80's Sanda-san and collaborators wrote key papers on the direct and clean determination of the unitarity angle $\phi_1$ ($\beta$). This motivated many of us for analogously coming up with ways for direct and clean determinations of the other two unitarity angles, $\phi_2 (\alpha)$ and $\phi_3 (\gamma)$. Current status of these direct determinations as well as our expectations for when Belle-II has 50 $ab^{-1}$ of luminosity and LHCb with some upgrades, will be given. In particular, it is emphasized that for direct determination of $\phi_3$, Belle-II should be able to handle final states in $D^0$ or $\bar D^0$ Dalitz decays, that contain one $\pi^0$ (which are difficult for LHCb) then they may make further inroads in improving the accuracy of $\phi_3$ determination. Early lattice inputs for constraining the unitarity triangle (UT) are briefly recalled. Its crucial role in supporting the Kobayashi-Maskawa theory of CP violation is emphasized. Over the years lattice methods have made significant progress and latest constraints from these for the UT will be discussed as well as compatibility with current direct determinations and some comments on future outlook will be made.</description>

      <title>Revisiting $O(N)$ $\sigma$ model at unphysical pion masses and high temperatures. II. The vacuum structure and thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory with cross-channel improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective potential of $O(N)$ model at large $N$ limit is reinvestigated for varying pion mass and temperature. For large pion masses and high temperatures, we find the phenomenologically favored vacuum, located on the upper branch of the double-branched effective potential for physical $m_\pi$, moves to the lower branch and becomes no longer a local minimum but a saddle point. The existence and running of the tachyon pole are also discussed. With the effective coupling constant defined from the effective potential, the possible correspondence relation between the two branches of the effective potential and the two phases of the theory (distinguished by positive or negative coupling) is verified even with nonzero explicit symmetry breaking and at finite temperature. Also, we generalize the $N/D$ modified $O(N)$ model to study the thermal trajectory of the $\sigma$ pole with the cross-channel contributions considered and find the thermal $\sigma$ pole trajectory resembles its counterpart with varying pion mass at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Unpolarized Transverse-Momentum-Dependent Parton Distributions of the Nucleon from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first lattice QCD calculation of the unpolarized nucleon's isovector transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs), which are essential to predict observables of multi-scale, semi-inclusive processes in the standard model. We use a $N_f=2+1+1$ MILC ensemble with valence clover fermions on a highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) sea to compute the quark momentum distributions in a large-momentum nucleon on the lattice. The state-of-the-art techniques in renormalization and extrapolation in the correlation distance on the lattice are adopted. {The perturbative kernel up to next-to-next-to-leading order is taken into account}, and the dependence on the pion mass and the hadron momentum is explored. Our results are qualitatively comparable with phenomenological TMDPDFs, which provide an opportunity to predict high energy scatterings from first principles.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for fractional topological objects in SU(3) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continued development of models that propose the existence of fractional topological objects in the Yang-Mills vacuum has called for a quantitative method to study the topological structure of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theory. We present an original numerical algorithm that can identify distinct topological objects in the nontrivial ground-state fields and approximate the net charge contained within them. This analysis is performed for $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ colour at a range of temperatures crossing the deconfinement phase transition, allowing for an assessment of how the topological structure evolves with temperature. We find a promising consistency with the instanton-dyon model for the structure of the QCD vacuum at finite temperature. Several other quantities, such as object density and radial size, are also analysed to elicit a further understanding of the fundamental structure of ground-state gluon fields.</description>

      <title>Why magnetic monopole becomes dyon in topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13954v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Witten effect predicts that a magnetic monopole acquires a fractional electric charge inside topological insulators.
  In this work, we give a microscopic description of this phenomenon, as well as an analogous two-dimensional system with a vortex. We solve the Dirac equation of electron field both analytically in continuum and numerically on a lattice, by adding the Wilson term and smearing the gauge field within a finite range to regularize the short-distance behavior of the system. Our results reveal that the Wilson term induces a strong positive mass shift, creating a domain-wall around the monopole/vortex. This small, yet finite-sized domain-wall localizes the chiral zero modes and ensures their stability through the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, whose cobordism invariance is crucial in explaining why the electric charge is fractional.</description>

      <title>Pole trajectories of the $\Lambda(1405)$ helps establish its dynamical nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral trajectories of dynamically generated resonances are connected to the SU(3) breaking pattern and their nature. From an analysis of a recent LQCD simulation on the $\pi\Sigma-\bar{K}N$ scattering for $I=0$, and the study of the quark mass dependence of the octet baryons, we determine for the first time the trajectory of the two poles associated to the $\Lambda(1405)$ towards the symmetric point $(\mathrm{Tr}[M]=\mathrm{cte})$ accurately. Our result at unphysical pion mass is consistent with the lattice simulation at $m_\pi\simeq 200$ MeV and the extrapolation to the physical point, based on the NLO chiral lagrangian, agrees perfectly well with previous analyses of experimental data. Contrary to other works, we predict qualitatively similar trajectories at LO and up to NLO, being consistent with the dominance of the LO interaction. At the SU(3) symmetric point up to NLO, we obtain that the lower pole is located at $E^{(1)}=1595\pm8$ MeV, being a singlet representation, while the higher pole belongs to the octet with a mass $E^{(8)}=1600\pm4$ MeV. This can be tested in the future LQCD simulations.</description>
