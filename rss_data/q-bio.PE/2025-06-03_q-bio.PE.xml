      <title>Cost of institutional incentives for promoting cooperation in $2\times2$ games and collective risk games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prosocial behaviours, which appear to contradict Darwinian principles of individual payoff maximisation, have been extensively studied across multiple disciplines. Cooperation, requiring a personal cost for collective benefits, is widespread in nature and has been explained through mechanisms such as kin selection, direct and indirect reciprocity, and network reciprocity. Institutional incentives, which reward cooperation and punish anti-social behaviour, offer a promising approach to fostering cooperation in groups of self-interested individuals. This study investigates the behaviour of the cost functions associated with these types of interventions, using both analytical and numerical methods. Focusing on reward, punishment, and hybrid schemes, we analyse their associated cost functions under evolutionary dynamics governed by Fermi's rule, exploring their asymptotic behaviour in the limits of neutral drift and strong selection. Our analysis focuses on two game types: General $2\times2$ Games (with particular attention paid to the cooperative and defective Prisoner's Dilemma) and the Collective Risk Game. In addition to deriving key analytical results, we use numerical simulations to study how parameters such as the intensity of selection affect the behaviour of the aforementioned incentive cost functions.</description>

      <title>Branch lengths for geodesics in the directed landscape and mutation patterns in growing spatially structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a population that is expanding in two-dimensional space. Suppose we collect data from a sample of individuals taken at random either from the entire population, or from near the outer boundary of the population. A quantity of interest in population genetics is the site frequency spectrum, which is the number of mutations that appear on $k$ of the $n$ sampled individuals, for $k = 1, \dots, n-1$. As long as the mutation rate is constant, this number will be roughly proportional to the total length of all branches in the genealogical tree that are on the ancestral line of $k$ sampled individuals. While the rigorous literature has primarily focused on models without any spatial structure, in many natural settings, such as tumors or bacteria colonies, growth is dictated by spatial constraints. A large number of such two dimensional growth models are expected to fall in the KPZ universality class exhibiting similar features as the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.
  In this article we adopt the perspective that for population models in the KPZ universality class, the genealogical tree can be approximated by the tree formed by the infinite upward geodesics in the directed landscape, a universal scaling limit constructed in \cite{dov22}, starting from $n$ randomly chosen points. Relying on geodesic coalescence, we prove new asymptotic results for the lengths of the portions of these geodesics that are ancestral to $k$ of the $n$ sampled points and consequently obtain exponents driving the site frequency spectrum as predicted in \cite{fgkah16}. An important ingredient in the proof is a new tight estimate of the probability that three infinite upward geodesics stay disjoint up to time $t$, i.e., a sharp quantitative version of the well studied N3G problem, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Inferring birth versus death dynamics for ecological interactions in stochastic heterogeneous populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the significance of ecological interactions and separation of birth and death dynamics in stochastic heterogeneous populations via general birth-death processes. Interactions can manifest through the birth dynamics, the death dynamics, or some combination of the two. The underlying microscopic mechanisms are important but often implicit in population-level data. We propose an inference method for disambiguating the types of interaction and the birth and death processes from population size time series data of a stochastic $n$-type heterogeneous population. The interspecies interactions considered can be competitive, antagonistic, or mutualistic. We show that different pairs of birth and death rates with the same net growth rate result in different time series statistics. Then, the inference method is validated in the example of a birth-death process inspired by the two-type Lotka-Volterra interaction dynamics. Utilizing stochastic fluctuations enables us to estimate additional parameters in this stochastic Lotka-Volterra model, which are not identifiable in a deterministic model.</description>

      <title>Controllable Sequence Editing for Biological and Clinical Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional generation models for longitudinal sequences can generate new or modified trajectories given a conditioning input. While effective at generating entire sequences, these models typically lack control over the timing and scope of the edits. Most existing approaches either operate on univariate sequences or assume that the condition affects all variables and time steps. However, many scientific and clinical applications require more precise interventions, where a condition takes effect only after a specific time and influences only a subset of variables. We introduce CLEF, a controllable sequence editing model for conditional generation of immediate and delayed effects in multivariate longitudinal sequences. CLEF learns temporal concepts that encode how and when a condition alters future sequence evolution. These concepts allow CLEF to apply targeted edits to the affected time steps and variables while preserving the rest of the sequence. We evaluate CLEF on 6 datasets spanning cellular reprogramming and patient health trajectories, comparing against 9 state-of-the-art baselines. CLEF improves immediate sequence editing accuracy by up to 36.01% (MAE). Unlike prior models, CLEF enables one-step conditional generation at arbitrary future times, outperforming them in delayed sequence editing by up to 65.71% (MAE). We test CLEF under counterfactual inference assumptions and show up to 63.19% (MAE) improvement on zero-shot conditional generation of counterfactual trajectories. In a case study of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, CLEF identifies clinical interventions that generate realistic counterfactual trajectories shifted toward healthier outcomes.</description>

      <title>Lotka-Volterra-type kinetic equations for interacting species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine a kinetic framework for modeling the time evolution of size distribution densities of two populations governed by predator-prey interactions. The model builds upon the classical Boltzmann-type equations, where the dynamics arise from elementary binary interactions between the populations. The model uniquely incorporates a linear redistribution operator to quantify the birth rates in both populations, inspired by wealth redistribution operators. We prove that, under a suitable scaling regime, the Boltzmann formulation transitions to a system of coupled Fokker-Planck-type equations. These equations describe the evolution of the distribution densities and link the macroscopic dynamics of their mean values to a Lotka-Volterra system of ordinary differential equations, with parameters explicitly derived from the microscopic interaction rules. We then determine the local equilibria of the Fokker-Planck system, which are Gamma-type densities, and investigate the problem of relaxation of its solutions toward these kinetic equilibria, in terms of their moments' dynamics. The results establish a bridge between kinetic modeling and classical population dynamics, offering a multiscale perspective on predator-prey systems.</description>
