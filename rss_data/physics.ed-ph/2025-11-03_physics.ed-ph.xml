      <title>Teaching competencies in physics for engineering education: A qualitative analysis from teaching practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics teaching in engineering programmes poses discipline-specific demands that intertwine conceptual modelling, experimental inquiry, and computational analysis. This study examines nine teaching competences for physics instruction derived from international and regional frameworks and interpreted within engineering contexts. Nineteen university instructors from the Technological Institute of Toluca completed an open-ended questionnaire; responses were analysed using a grounded theory approach (open and axial coding) complemented by descriptive frequencies. Results indicate stronger development in technical mastery, methodological/digital integration, technology-mediated communication, and innovation (C1, C2, C6, C9), while information literacy for digital content creation/adaptation and digital ethics/safety (C7, C8) remain underdeveloped. A recurrent understanding-application gap was identified, revealing uneven transfer from conceptual awareness to enacted classroom practice. We conclude that advancing physics education for engineers requires institutionally supported, discipline-specific professional development that aligns modelling, laboratory work, and computation with ethical and reproducible digital practices; such alignment can move instructors from adoption/adaptation toward sustained appropriation and innovation in multimodal settings.</description>
