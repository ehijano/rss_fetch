      <title>Multi-Group Dynamics with Tolerant Switching in the Kolkata Paise Restaurant Problem with Dining Clubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Kolkata Paise Restaurant Problem (KPRP) with multiple dining clubs, extending work in [A. Harlalka, A. Belmonte and C. Griffin, \textit{Physica A}, 620:128767, 2023]. In classical KPRP, $N$ agents chose among $N$ restaurants at random. If multiple users choose the same restaurant, only one will eat. In a dining club, agents coordinate to avoid choosing the same restaurant, but may collide with users outside the club. We consider a dynamic in which agents switch among clubs or the unaffiliated (free agent) group based on their comparative probability of eating. Agents' affiliations are sticky in the sense that they are insensitive (tolerate) to differences in eating probability below a threshold $\tau$ without switching groups. We study the tendency of one group (dining club or free agent group) to become dominant as a function of tolerance by studying the mean-field dynamics of group proportion. We then show empirically that the mean-field group dynamic (assuming infinite populations) differs from the finite population group dynamic. We derive a mathematical approximation in the latter case, showing good agreement with the data. The paper concludes by studying the impact of (food) taxation, redistribution and freeloading in the finite population case. We show that a group that redistributes food tends to become dominant more often as a function of increasing tolerance to a point, at which point agents do not switch frequently enough to enable group dynamics to emerge. This is negatively affected by freeloaders from the non-redistributing group.</description>

      <title>Antifragility and response to damage in the synchronization of oscillators on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework to assess the impact of damage, defined as the reduction of weight in a specific link, on identical oscillator systems governed by the Kuramoto model and coupled through weighted networks. We analyze how weight modifications in a single link affect the system when its global function is to achieve the synchronization of coupled oscillators starting from random initial phases. We introduce different measures that allow the identification of cases where damage enhances synchronization (antifragile response), deteriorates it (fragile response), or has no significant impact. Using numerical solutions of the Kuramoto model, we investigate the effects of damage on network links where antifragility emerges. Our analysis includes lollipop graphs of varying sizes and a comprehensive evaluation and all the edges of 109 non-isomorphic graphs with six nodes. The approach is general and can be applied to study antifragility in other oscillator systems with different coupling mechanisms, offering a pathway for the quantitative exploration of antifragility in diverse complex systems.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the mystery of tropical monsoon long-term prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropical monsoons play a critical role in shaping regional and global climate systems, with profound ecological and socio-economic impacts. However, their long-term prediction remains challenging due to the complex interplay of regional dynamics, global climate drivers, and large-scale teleconnections. Here, we introduce a unified network-based framework for predicting monsoon precipitation across diverse tropical regions. By leveraging global 2-meter air temperature fields, this approach captures large-scale climate teleconnections, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Rossby waves, enabling accurate forecasts for four key monsoon systems: the South American, East Asian, African, and Indian monsoons. Our framework achieves remarkable forecasting accuracy with lead times of 4-10 months, outperforming traditional systems such as SEAS5 and CFSv2. Beyond its predictive capabilities, the framework offers flexibility for application to other regions and climate phenomena, advancing our understanding of global climate dynamics. These findings have far-reaching implications for disaster preparedness, resource management, and sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Highly engaging events reveal semantic and temporal compression in online community discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: People nowadays express their opinions in online spaces, using different forms of interactions such as posting, sharing and discussing with one another. How do these digital traces change in response to events happening in the real world? We leverage Reddit conversation data, exploiting its community-based structure, to elucidate how offline events influence online user interactions and behavior. Online conversations, as posts and comments, are analysed along their temporal and semantic dimensions. Conversations tend to become repetitive with a more limited vocabulary, develop at a faster pace, and feature heightened emotions. As the event approaches, the shifts occurring in conversations are reflected in the users' dynamics. Users become more active and they exchange information with a growing audience, despite using a less rich vocabulary and repetitive messages. The recurring patterns we discovered are persistent across a wide range of events and several contexts, representing a fingerprint of how online dynamics change in response to real-world occurrences.</description>
