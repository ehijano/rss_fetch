      <title>Robust undulatory locomotion via neuromechanical adjustments in a dissipative medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative environments are ubiquitous in nature, from microscopic swimmers in low-Reynolds-number fluids to macroscopic animals in frictional media. In this study, motivated by various behaviours of {\it Caenorhabditis elegans} during swimming and crawling locomotion, we consider a mathematical model of a slender elastic locomotor with an internal rhythmic neural pattern generator. By analysing the dynamical systems of the model using a Poincar\'e section, we found that local neuromechanical adjustments to the environment can create robust undulatory locomotion. This progressive behaviour emerges as a global stable periodic orbit in a broad range of parameter regions. Further, by controlling the mechanosensation, we were able to design the dynamical systems to manoeuvre with progressive, reverse, and turning motions as well as apparently random, complex behaviours, as experimentally observed in {\it C. elegans}. The mechanisms found in this study, together with our methodologies with the dynamical systems viewpoint, are useful for deciphering complex animal adaptive behaviours and also designing adaptive robots for a wide range of dissipative environments.</description>

      <title>Cohesive urban bicycle infrastructure design through optimal transport routing in multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bicycle infrastructure networks must meet the needs of cyclists to position cycling as a viable transportation choice in cities. In particular, protected infrastructure should be planned cohesively for the whole city and spacious enough to accommodate all cyclists safely and prevent cyclist congestion -- a common problem in cycling cities like Copenhagen. Here, we devise an adaptive method for optimal bicycle network design and for evaluating congestion criticalities on bicycle paths. The method goes beyond static network measures, using computationally efficient adaptation rules inspired by Optimal Transport on the dynamically updating multilayer network of roads and protected bicycle lanes. Street capacities and cyclist flows reciprocally control each other to optimally accommodate cyclists on streets with one control parameter that dictates the preference of bicycle infrastructure over roads. Applying our method to Copenhagen confirms that the city's bicycle network is generally well-developed. However, we are able to identify the network's bottlenecks, and we find, at a finer scale, disparities in network accessibility and criticalities between different neighborhoods. Our model and results are generalizable beyond this particular case study to serve as a scalable and versatile tool for aiding urban planners in designing cycling-friendly cities.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Opinion Dynamics with Adaptive Confidence Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People's opinions change with time as they interact with each other. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, individuals (which are represented by the nodes of a network) have continuous-valued opinions and are influenced by neighboring nodes whose opinions are sufficiently similar to theirs (i.e., are within a confidence bound). In this paper, we formulate and analyze discrete-time BCMs with heterogeneous and adaptive confidence bounds. We introduce two new models: (1) a BCM with synchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Hegselmann--Krause (HK) model and (2) a BCM with asynchronous opinion updates that generalizes the Deffuant--Weisbuch (DW) model. We analytically and numerically explore our adaptive BCMs' limiting behaviors, including the confidence-bound dynamics, the formation of clusters of nodes with similar opinions, and the time evolution of an "effective graph", which is a time-dependent subgraph of a network with edges between nodes that {are currently receptive to each other.} For a variety of networks and a wide range of values of the parameters that control the increase and decrease of confidence bounds, we demonstrate numerically that our adaptive BCMs result in fewer major opinion clusters and longer convergence times than the baseline (i.e., nonadaptive) BCMs. We also show that our adaptive BCMs can have adjacent nodes that converge to the same opinion but are not {receptive to each other.} This qualitative behavior does not occur in the associated baseline BCMs.</description>

      <title>New Trends on the Systems Approach to Modeling SARS-CoV-2 Pandemics in a Globally Connected Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a critical analysis of the literature and perspective research ideas for modeling the epidemics caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It goes beyond deterministic population dynamics to consider several key complexity features of the system under consideration. In particular, the multiscale features of the dynamics from contagion to the subsequent dynamics of competition between the immune system and the proliferating virus. Other topics addressed in this work include the propagation of epidemics in a territory, taking into account local transportation networks, the heterogeneity of the population, and the study of social and economic problems in populations involved in the spread of epidemics. The overall content aims to show how new mathematical tools can be developed to address the above topics and how mathematical models and simulations can contribute to the decision making of crisis managers.</description>
