      <title>Network Calculus-based Deadline-Adaptive Online Admission Control for ET Traffic in TSN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) has been a promising standard for deterministic communication in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Recent developments have necessitated dynamic reconfigurations during system operations. Current research on admission control in TSN mainly focuses on time-triggered (TT) traffic, but the more flexible event-triggered (ET) traffic with latency guarantee requirements also needs attention. The challenge in the admission control method for time-critical ET traffic is to quickly admit incremental flow while ensuring deadline guarantees for both incremental and existing flows. However, conventional configuration methods, which require ex-post schedulability feedback verification during solution space searches to ensure real-time requirements, are inappropriate for online admission control due to their high time consumption. Therefore, we propose a fast and high-utilization deadline-adaptive online admission control method for ET traffic based on a network calculus approach, leveraging the TSN/ATS+CBS (asynchronous traffic shaper and credit-based shaper) architecture and a novel prior performance analysis model. This method benefits from ATS in reducing the impact on existing flows and avoids the need for ex-post verification during the iterative optimization process used by conventional methods. Moreover, it adaptively balances residual resources with deadline awareness during the admission process to enhance network resource utilization. Evaluations on synthetic test cases demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art, our method achieves an average 59% increase in admitted flows and an average 95% reduction in admission time. Additionally, evaluations on realistic test cases reveal that our method postpones the occurrence of bottleneck egress ports and first rejection during the admission process, thereby enhancing adaptability.</description>

      <title>Charting 5G Energy Efficiency: Flexible Energy Modeling for Sustainable Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in 5G technology, accurately assessing the energy consumption of its Radio Access Networks (RANs) remains a challenge due to the diverse range of applicable technologies and implementation solutions. Designing a versatile power model for estimating the 5G RANspecific power consumption requires extensive data collection and experimental studies to capture the diverse range of technologies and implementation solutions. The objective is to outline a versatile energy model capable of estimating RAN-specific energy consumption, encompassing both mobile terminals and the physical layer (PHY) of base stations. In this paper, we focus on the computational complexity of the baseband part of the model. The developed (part of the) model is compared with the estimation of the number of cycles (and energy per cycle) used by a specific implementation (here a Matlab code ported on an Intel target), enabling the assessment of the model with the estimation of energy consumed on a real target. The study's results show a good agreement between the model and the implementation, even if some parts need to be refined to take specific algorithms into account. The key contribution is the development of an initial flexible energy model with finer granularity, enabling comparisons of energy use across various applications and contexts, and offering a comprehensive tool for optimizing 5G network energy consumption.</description>

      <title>IUP: Integrated and Programmable User Plane for Next-Generation Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile networks evolve on a regular basis to meet the requirements of a rapidly changing application ecosystem; hence, a future-proof design is key to getting the most out of their lifecycle. In comparison to other access networks, one major issue with the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN) is that it behaves as a "fat Layer 2" entity, resulting in disparities in Internet Protocol (IP) flow traffic control and radio resource allocation. In this article, we propose an innovative design - Integrated User Plane (IUP) - that incorporates User Plane Function (UPF) functionalities into RAN, and we introduce the Integrated Data Flow Control (IDFC) sublayer with a new traffic management pipeline and various programmable rules. To understand its implications for crucial mobility user cases, a detailed analysis of how IUP interacts with Control Plane (CP) network functions is conducted. Finally, our IUP prototype shows benefits including a 50% saving in both latency and overhead, converged IUP and non-Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks for seamless connectivity, and real-time UP programmability in both traffic control and resource allocation via the O-RAN framework.</description>

      <title>Experimental Analysis of a Self-Coherent M-QAM Receiver by Means of Recurrent Optical Spectrum Slicing and Direct Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High order modulation formats constitute the most prominent way for increasing spectral efficiency in transmission systems. Coherent transceivers that support such higher order formats require heavy digital signal processing (DSP), which increases the power consumption of coherent pluggables, well above the intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) counterparts. Self-coherent or phase retrieval methods have emerged as potential solutions, trying to combine the merits of coherent technology with the simplicity of direct detection. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the reception of quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) modulation formats based on direct detection aided by the recurrent optical spectrum slicing (ROSS) photonic accelerator, utilizing minimal DSP and low modulator driving voltages. We experimentally demonstrate 32 Gbaud QAM-4/16 for 25 km, 50 km and 75 km in the C-band aided by a linear digital equalization and the use of programmable photonics as recurrent optical spectrum slicers. We showcase successful detection with driving swings below V{\pi}/3 in contrast to the full swing required by conventional coherent transceivers. We further improve the system performance utilizing geometric constellation shaping. Finally, we explore the potential power consumption improvement for the next-generation 1.6T pluggables, showcasing over 40% reduction with respect to the most lightweight state of the art coherent solutions reported in literature</description>

      <title>A Time-Triggered Communication Method Based on Urgency-Based Scheduler in Time-Sensitive Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of the automotive industry and automation has led to a growing demand for time-critical systems to have low latency and jitter for critical traffic. To address this issue, the IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) task group proposed the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) to implement Time-Triggered (TT) communication, enabling deterministic transmission by assigning specific time windows to each stream. While Fixed Routing and Waiting-Allowed (FR-WA) scheduling algorithms offer flexibility, they suffer from inefficiencies in solution time and scalability. This study analyzes TAS implementation challenges, emphasizing how network scale expansion increases computational constraints. We propose an Urgency-Based Scheduler method (TT-UBS) to address these limitations to enhance deterministic transmission and computational efficiency under anomalies. A novel scheduling algorithm for TT-UBS parameter determination is developed, alongside simulations and comparative evaluations. Results show that TT-UBS guarantees deterministic traffic delivery while reducing solution time by 98.22% in test scenarios compared to traditional approaches. The methodology is extended to other scheduling algorithms to assess efficiency improvements. This advancement supports TSN's application in mission-critical systems by optimizing time-triggered communication performance and enabling reliable network deployment. The framework demonstrates significant potential for real-time in-vehicle networks requiring latency and jitter control.</description>

      <title>A Correlated Data-Driven Collaborative Beamforming Approach for Energy-efficient IoT Data Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An expansion of Internet of Things (IoTs) has led to significant challenges in wireless data harvesting, dissemination, and energy management due to the massive volumes of data generated by IoT devices. These challenges are exacerbated by data redundancy arising from spatial and temporal correlations. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel data-driven collaborative beamforming (CB)-based communication framework for IoT networks. Specifically, the framework integrates CB with an overlap-based multi-hop routing protocol (OMRP) to enhance data transmission efficiency while mitigating energy consumption and addressing hot spot issues in remotely deployed IoT networks. Based on the data aggregation to a specific node by OMRP, we formulate a node selection problem for the CB stage, with the objective of optimizing uplink transmission energy consumption. Given the complexity of the problem, we introduce a softmax-based proximal policy optimization with long short-term memory (SoftPPO-LSTM) algorithm to intelligently select CB nodes for improving transmission efficiency. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed OMRP and SoftPPO-LSTM methods, demonstrating significant improvements over existing routing protocols and node selection strategies. The results also reveal that the combined OMRP with the SoftPPO-LSTM method effectively mitigates hot spot problems and offers superior performance compared to traditional strategies.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Satellite-Based Data Offloading on Starlink Constellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) is a key research area in autonomous driving. As Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) continue to expand, ground vehicles (GVs) face the challenge of handling huge amounts of sensor data to drive safely. Specifically, due to energy and capacity limitations, GVs will need to offload resource-hungry tasks to external (cloud) computing units for faster processing. In 6th generation (6G) wireless systems, the research community is exploring the concept of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), where satellites can serve as space edge computing nodes to aggregate, store, and process data from GVs. In this paper we propose new data offloading strategies between a cluster of GVs and satellites in the Low Earth Orbits (LEOs), to optimize the trade-off between coverage and end-to-end delay. For the accuracy of the simulations, we consider real data and orbits from the Starlink constellation, one of the most representative and popular examples of commercial satellite deployments for communication. Our results demonstrate that Starlink satellites can support real-time offloading under certain conditions that depend on the onboard computational capacity of the satellites, the frame rate of the sensors, and the number of GVs.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Traffic Classification for Mixed-Critical Flows in Time-Sensitive Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) supports multiple traffic types with diverse timing requirements, such as hard real-time (HRT), soft real-time (SRT), and Best Effort (BE) within a single network. To provide varying Quality of Service (QoS) for these traffic types, TSN incorporates different scheduling and shaping mechanisms. However, assigning traffic types to the proper scheduler or shaper, known as Traffic-Type Assignment (TTA), is a known NP-hard problem. Relying solely on domain expertise to make these design decisions can be inefficient, especially in complex network scenarios. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept highlighting the advantages of a learning-based approach to the TTA problem. We formulate an optimization model for TTA in TSN and develop a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model, called ``TTASelector'', to assign traffic types to TSN flows efficiently. Using synthetic and realistic test cases, our evaluation shows that TTASelector assigns a higher number of traffic types to HRT and SRT flows compared to the state-of-the-art Tabu Search-based metaheuristic method.</description>
