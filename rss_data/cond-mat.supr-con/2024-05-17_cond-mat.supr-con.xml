      <title>Time-connected phase slips in current-driven two-band superconducting wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quasi-one dimensional wires of two-band superconductors driven by an electrical current. We find that the onset of dissipation can occur with the nucleation of time-connected phase slips (t-PS). The topological structure of the t-PS consists of two phase slips (one in each order parameter) separated in time and connected via an interband vortex string along the time direction. This shows as a two-peak structure in voltage vs. time. We discuss the conditions for observing t-PS, depending on the interband coupling strength and the relaxation time scales for each order parameter.</description>

      <title>Impurity bands, line-nodes, and anomalous thermal Hall effect in Weyl superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the anomalous thermal Hall effect (ATHE) in Weyl superconductors realized by the $E_{1u}$ ($p$-wave and $f$-wave) chiral superconducting order for the point group $D_{6h}$. Using the quasiclassical Eilenberger theory, we analyze the influence of the impurity scattering and the line nodal excitations on the ATHE, and compare it with the intrinsic (topological) contribution. Because the transverse response is sensitive to the slope of the density of states at the Fermi surface, the extrinsic ATHE vanishes in both the weak (Born) and strong (unitarity) scattering limits. The thermal Hall conductivity (THC) is maximal at intermediate impurity strengths when there is a large slope of the density states in the impurity bands close to the Fermi energy. Under these conditions, the extrinsic ATHE dominates the intrinsic ATHE even at low temperatures. The extrinsic ATHE is sensitive to line nodal excitations, whereas the intrinsic ATHE is not. When the line nodes in the gap involve the sign change of the order parameter, the extrinsic contribution to the THC is suppressed even though the phase space for low energy excitation is large. In contrast, if the nodes are not accompanied by such a sign change, the extrinsic ATHE is significantly enhanced. Our results form a basis for the comprehensive analysis of anomalous thermal transport in Weyl superconductors.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Domain Walls in Type-II Superconductors and Gradients of Temperature/Spin Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the motion of a domain wall in type-II superconductors driven by inhomogeneities of temperature or spin density. The model consists of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and the thermal/spin diffusion equation whose transport coefficients (the thermal/spin conductivity and the spin relaxation time) depend on the order parameter, interpolating the values for the superconducting and the normal states. Both numerical and analytical calculations suggest that the domain wall moves toward the higher temperature/spin-density region where the order parameter is suppressed. Both motions can be understood as dynamical processes minimizing the loss of the condensation energy. We also clearly define the forces on the domain wall according to their origins.</description>

      <title>Theory of possible sliding regimes in twisted bilayer WTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the observation of increasingly one-dimensional (1D) behavior with decreasing temperature in small-angle twisted bilayers of WTe$_2$ (tWTe$_2$), we theoretically explore the exotic sliding regimes that could be realized in tWTe$_2$. At zero displacement field, while hole-doped tWTe$_2$ can be thought of as an array of weakly coupled conventional two-flavor 1D electron gases (1DEGs), the electron-doped regime is equivalent to coupled four-flavor 1DEGs , due to the presence of an additional "valley'' degree of freedom. In the decoupled limit, the electron-doped system can thus realize phases with a range of interesting ordering tendencies, including $4k_F$ charge-density-wave and charge-$4e$ superconductivity. Dimensional crossovers and cross-wire transport due to inter-wire couplings of various kinds are also discussed. We find that a sliding Luther-Emery liquid with small inter-wire couplings is probably most consistent with current experiments on hole-doped tWTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Blueprint for all-to-all connected superconducting spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Andreev (or superconducting) spin qubits (ASQs) have recently emerged as a promising qubit platform that combines superconducting circuits with semiconductor spin degrees of freedom. While recent experiments have successfully coupled two ASQs, how to realize a scalable architecture for extending this coupling to multiple distant qubits remains an open question. In this work, we resolve this challenge by introducing an architecture that achieves all-to-all connectivity between multiple remote ASQs. Our approach enables selective connectivity between any qubit pair while maintaining all other qubit pairs uncoupled. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of efficient readout using circuit quantum electrodynamics techniques and compare different readout configurations. Our architecture shows promise both for gate-based quantum computing and for analog quantum simulation applications by offering higher qubit connectivity than alternative solid-state platforms.</description>

      <title>Impact of medium temperature heat treatment on flux trapping sensitivity in SRF cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of mid-T heat treatment on flux trapping sensitivity was measured on several 1.3 GHz single cell cavities subjected to vacuum annealing at temperature of 150 - 400 $^\circ$C for a duration of 3 hours. The cavity was cooldown with residual magnetic field $\sim$0 and $\sim$20 mG in the Dewar with cooldown condition of full flux trapping. The quality factor as a function of accelerating gradient was measured. The results show the correlation between the treatment temperature, quality factor, and sensitivity to flux trapping. Sensitivity increases with increasing heat treatment temperatures within the range of (200 - 325 $^\circ$C/3h). Moreover, variations in the effective penetration depth of the magnetic field and the density of quasi-particles can occur, influencing alterations in the cavity's electromagnetic response and resonance frequency.</description>

      <title>Formation of superconducting pair correlations in spherical even-even nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The appearance of like nucleon pair correlations in the ground state of spherical even-even nuclei is considered within a special Bogoliubov transformation. It is confirmed that in closed subshell nuclei superconducting pair correlations start to form if the coupling constant $G$ exceeds a certain threshold value. Rough upper and lower estimates are obtained for the threshold value. It is shown, that superconducting correlations exist in open subshell nuclei at any positive $G$. In this case, nucleon pairs are distributed over all subshells participating in the pairing interaction.</description>

      <title>Superconducting diode effect and interference patterns in Kagome CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay among frustrated lattice geometry, nontrivial band topology and correlation yields rich quantum states of matter in Kagome systems. A series of recent members in this family, AV3Sb5 (A= K, Rb, Cs), exhibit a cascade of symmetry-breaking transitions, involving the 3Q chiral charge ordering, electronic nematicity, roton pair-density-wave and superconductivity. The nature of the superconducting order is yet to be resolved. Here, we report an indication of chiral superconducting domains with boundary supercurrents in intrinsic CsV3Sb5 flakes. Magnetic field-free superconducting diode effect is observed with polarity modulated by thermal histories, suggesting dynamical superconducting order domains in a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking background. Strikingly, the critical current exhibits the double-slit superconducting interference patterns when subjected to an external magnetic field. Characteristics of the patterns are modulated by thermal cycling. These phenomena are proposed as a consequence of periodically modulated supercurrents flowing along certain domain boundaries constrained by fluxoid quantization. Our results imply a chiral superconducting order, opening a potential for exploring exotic physics, e.g. Majorana zero modes, in this intriguing topological Kagome system.</description>

      <title>High-$T_c$ Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in 2D superconducting systems with coupled deep and quasi-flat electronic bands with van Hove singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the pursuit of higher critical temperature of superconductivity, quasi-flat electronic bands and van Hove singularities in two dimensions (2D) have emerged as a potential approach to enhance Cooper pairing on the basis of mean-field expectations. However, these special electronic features suppress the superfluid stiffness and, hence, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in 2D superconducting systems, leading to the emergence of a significant pseudogap regime due to superconducting fluctuations. In the strong-coupling regime, one finds that superfluid stiffness is inversely proportional to the superconducting gap, which is the predominant factor contributing to the strong suppression of superfluid stiffness. Here we reveal that the aforementioned limitation is avoided in a 2D superconducting electronic system with a quasi-flat electronic band with a strong pairing strength coupled to a deep band with weak electronic pairing strength. Owing to the multiband effects, we demonstrate a screening-like mechanism that circumvents the suppression of the superfluid stiffness. We report the optimal conditions for achieving a large enhancement of the BKT transition temperature and a substantial shrinking of the pseudogap regime by tuning the intraband couplings and the pair-exchange coupling between the two band-condensates.</description>

      <title>Field, frequency and temperature dependence of the surface resistance of nitrogen diffused niobium superconducting radio frequency cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the RF performance of several single-cell superconducting radio-frequency cavities subjected to low temperature heat treatment in nitrogen environment. The cavities were treated at temperature 120 - 165 $^{\circ}$C for an extended period of time (24 - 48 hours) either in high vacuum or in a low partial pressure of ultra-pure nitrogen. The improvement in $Q_0$ with a Q-rise was observed when nitrogen gas was injected at $\sim$300 $^{\circ} $C during the cavity cooldown from 800 $^{\circ}$C and held at 165 $^{\circ}$C, without any degradation in accelerating gradient over the baseline performance. The treatment was applied to several elliptical cavities with frequency ranging from 0.75 GHz to 3.0 GHz, showing an improved quality factor as a result of low temperature nitrogen treatments. The Q-rise feature is similar to that achieved by nitrogen alloying Nb cavities at higher temperature, followed by material removal by electropolishing. The surface modification was confirmed by the change in electronic mean free path and tuned with the temperature and duration of heat treatment. The decrease of the temperature-dependent surface resistance with increasing RF field, resulting in a Q-rise, becomes stronger with increasing frequency and decreasing temperature. The data suggest a crossover frequency of $\sim 0.95$~GHz above which the Q-rise phenomenon occurs at 2~K. Some of these results can be explained qualitatively with an existing model of intrinsic field-dependence of the surface resistance with both equilibrium and nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution functions. The change in the Q-slope below 0.95 GHz may result from masking contribution of trapped magnetic flux to the residual surface resistance.</description>

      <title>Tensor network study of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ model: incommensurate spiral order, mixed valence-bond solids, and multicritical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the finite projected entangled pair state (PEPS) method to investigate the global phase diagram of the spin-1/2 square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ antiferromagnetic (AFM) Heisenberg model. The ground state phase diagram is established with a rich variety of phases: AFM, gapless quantum spin liquid, valence-bond solid (VBS), stripe, and incommensurate spiral phases. The nature of the VBS region is revealed, containing a plaquette VBS and a mixed columnar-plaquette VBS, with the emergence of short-range incommensurate spin correlations in some region. The long-range incommensurate magnetic phase is also explicitly characterized as a planar spiral with incommensurate spatial periodicities. Most interestingly, there exists several multicritical points connecting different phases. These findings elucidate the true nature of the long-standing square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ antiferromagnet at zero-temperature. Our results also pave the way to accurately simulate complex two-dimensional quantum systems that may host nonuniform features by means of finite PEPS.</description>
