      <title>Semantic Limits of Positive Existential Reasoning in Arithmetic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study structural limitations of purely algebraic reasoning in the analysis of arithmetic dynamical systems. Rather than addressing the truth of specific conjectures, we introduce a fragment - relative notion of algebraic refutability for dynamical properties defined by polynomial relations. Using preservation of positive existential formulas under ring homomorphisms, we show that any behavior realizable in a homomorphic extension of Z cannot be refuted as false by arguments confined to the positive existential fragment of first - order ring theory. Any argument that excludes such behaviors in the integers must invoke structure not preserved under ring homomorphisms, such as order, Archimedean properties, or global metric information. We illustrate the framework using the Collatz map as an example, clarifying the logical limitations of algebraic approaches without making claims about the conjecture's truth or provability.</description>

      <title>Multiple Solutions to Exponential Diophantine Equations of Ramanujan-Nagell type: $Cz^2 = D + A.B^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramanujan found five solutions to the exponential Diophantine equation $z^2+7= 2^n$ where $z$ and $n$ are positive integers, and posed the problem of determining whether there are any more. Nagell was the first to prove that there were not. It is natural to then ask if there are other similar Diophantine equations with multiple solutions. In particular, equations of the form $Cz^2=D+A.B^n$ are known as equations of Ramanujan-Nagell type. Three examples are known with six solutions. Summaries of multiple solutions for different cases are presented. In particular the equation $z^2=277665.17^6+34^n$ is found to have four solutions and is conjectured to be the only such non-trivial equation of Ramanujan-Nagell type with four solutions when $A=C=1$ and $B$ is not a power of 2.</description>

      <title>The Riemann $\Xi$-function from primitive Markovian cycles II: Strip rigidity and divisor identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the Riemann $\Xi$--function to a canonical real-entire reference family arising from the cycle Laplacian developed in Paper I. These spectral determinants have only real zeros by self-adjointness. Our main tool is a rigidity lemma for holomorphic functions on horizontal strips. Applied to a normalized seam ratio linking $\Xi(2\cdot)$ to the reference family, this lemma shows that, under explicit holomorphy and boundary nonvanishing hypotheses verified in the forthcoming Paper III, the seam ratio extends to a zero-free holomorphic function of bounded type on each overlap strip. It follows that, on every admissible overlap strip, $\Xi(2\cdot)$ and the reference family have the same zero divisor.</description>

      <title>Algorithm to Compute a Kharitonov-Type Sector Containing All Roots of Hurwitz Interval Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Kharitonov-type algorithm for complex interval Hurwitz polynomials that determines whether all roots of a given interval polynomial lie within a prescribed angular sector of the complex plane. The method requires evaluating a finite set of additional Kharitonov polynomials. For complex coefficient uncertainty, up to sixteen such polynomials are sufficient, while in the real-coefficient case up to eight are needed. A bisection-based refinement procedure is introduced to compute a containing sector that encloses the angles of all roots. The algorithm progressively tightens the sector bounds and can achieve arbitrarily small accuracy. In the real-coefficient case, the symmetry of the construction allows the real Kharitonov result to be derived directly from the complex case. Numerical experiments suggest that the minimal containing sector coincides with the sector determined by the vertex polynomials, or possibly by a subset of them.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Evaluation of Arctanh Power Sums via Infinite Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish closed-form expressions for the infinite series sum from n=2 to infinity of arctanh(n^-k) for all integers k &gt;= 2 by connecting these sums to infinite product formulas involving the gamma function. Our approach uses logarithmic manipulations, the Fubini-Tonelli theorem, and Frullani's integral theorem. As applications, we derive a structural identity relating the Riemann zeta function zeta(k) to these sums, establish a new series representation for the Euler-Mascheroni constant gamma, and show that this representation admits an exponentially convergent reformulation via zeta values. We further prove that h(k) = sum from n=2 to infinity of arctanh(n^-k) is strictly decreasing and strictly convex in k, and we establish explicit two-sided bounds and asymptotic expansions. The decimal expansions of the closed-form values and several auxiliary sequences arising from these identities are cataloged in the OEIS.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Stability of the Betke-Henk-Wills Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Betke-Henk-Wills conjecture proposes a sharp upper bound for the lattice point enumerator $G(K, \Lambda)$ of a convex body in terms of its successive minima. While the conjecture remains open for general convex bodies in dimensions $d \ge 5$, it is known to hold for orthogonal parallelotopes (boxes). In this paper, we establish the \textit{local stability} of the conjecture under small perturbations of the metric. Specifically, we prove that the inequality is strictly stable for integer boxes subjected to small rotations, owing to the discrete nature of the lattice point counting function. We derive explicit, geometry-invariant quantitative bounds on the permissible perturbation radius using the operator norm. Furthermore, we extend the validity of the conjecture to a class of $L_p$-balls for sufficiently large $p$, deriving a sharp threshold $p_0$ for the stability of the integer hull.</description>

      <title>A Quartic Identity Related to Fermat-Type Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1689</link>
      <description>arXiv:1412.1689v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a short proof of an algebraic identity. For integers $n\ge 2$ and variables $x,y,z$, it represents $(x^n+y^n-z^n)$ as a value of the quadratic form $\mathcal A^2+\mathcal B^2-\mathcal C^2$ after multiplication by an explicit factor. Consequently, any hypothetical solution of $x^n+y^n=z^n$ yields a Pythagorean triple $(\mathcal A,\mathcal B,\mathcal C)$ consisting of explicit polynomial expressions in $x,y,z$.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of the Cuboid Polynomial $P_{a,u}(t)$ via a Rank-Zero Elliptic Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the even monic degree-$8$ cuboid polynomial $P_{a,u}(t)$ introduced by R.A. Sharipov for coprime integers $a\neq u&gt;0$. We prove irreducibility over $\mathbb{Z}$ by excluding all possible splittings. Over the quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ the polynomial factors as a product of two conjugate quartics; any further factorization would force a rational point on a fixed genus-one quartic. Passing to its Jacobian (an elliptic curve of conductor $48$ and rank $0$) we determine all rational points and rule out the structural parameters that could yield a factorization. Consequently, $P_{a,u}(t)$ admits no nontrivial factorization in $\mathbb{Z}[t]$.</description>

      <title>Variants of the Damascus inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2016, Dannan and Sitnik established the notable Damascus inequality, which features a symmetric structure under a multiplicative constraint. In this study, we consider the natural generalisation of this inequality by characterising all positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that the inequality \[\sum_{j=1}^m\frac{x_j^n-1}{x_{j}^{n+1}+1}\leqslant 0\] holds for any positive real numbers $x_1, \ldots, x_m$ with $\prod_{j=1}^mx_j=1$. Our approach relies on the theories of GA-convexity and Sturm's sequence. For the cases where the inequality fails, we also investigate the topological properties of the set of non-solutions.</description>
