      <title>A Novel Cross-band CSI Prediction Scheme for Multi-band Fingerprint based Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the advantages of computation complexity compared with traditional localization algorithms, fingerprint based localization is getting increasing demand. Expanding the fingerprint database from the frequency domain by channel reconstruction can improve localization accuracy. However, in a mobility environment, the channel reconstruction accuracy is limited by the time-varying parameters. In this paper, we proposed a system to extract the time-varying parameters based on space-alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) algorithm, then used variational auto-encoder (VAE) to reconstruct the channel state information on another channel. The proposed scheme is tested on the data generated by the deep-MIMO channel model. Mathematical analysis for the viability of our system is also shown in this paper.</description>

      <title>TrimCaching: Parameter-sharing AI Model Caching in Wireless Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation mobile networks are expected to facilitate fast AI model downloading to end users. By caching models on edge servers, mobile networks can deliver models to end users with low latency, resulting in a paradigm called edge model caching. In this paper, we develop a novel model placement scheme, called parameter-sharing model caching (TrimCaching). TrimCaching exploits the key observation that a wide range of AI models, such as convolutional neural networks or large language models, can share a significant proportion of parameter blocks containing reusable knowledge, thereby improving storage efficiency. To this end, we formulate a parameter-sharing model placement problem to maximize the cache hit ratio in multi-edge wireless networks by balancing the fundamental tradeoff between storage efficiency and service latency. We show that the formulated problem is a submodular maximization problem with submodular constraints, for which no polynomial-time approximation algorithm exists. To overcome this challenge, we study an important special case, where a small fixed number of parameter blocks are shared across models, which often holds in practice. In such a case, a polynomial-time algorithm with $\left(1-\epsilon\right)/2$-approximation guarantee is developed. Subsequently, we address the original problem for the general case by developing a greedy algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TrimCaching framework significantly improves the cache hit ratio compared with state-of-the-art content caching without exploiting shared parameters in AI models.</description>

      <title>Effect of realistic oscillator phase noise on the performance of cell-free networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To keep supporting 6G requirements, the radio access infrastructure will increasingly densify. Cell-free (CF) networks offer extreme flexibility by coherently serving users with multiple Access points (APs). This paradigm requires precise and stable phase synchronization. In this article, we adapt the standardized 5G NR setup (subcarrier spacing, OFDM symbol duration and allocation) to investigate the effect of Phase Noise (PN) on the simulated performance of scalable CF networks. In contrast to the prior literature relying on the simplified model of a free-running oscillator with the Wiener process, we deploy a realistic hardware-inspired phase noise model reproducing the Local Oscillator (LO) phase drift. Our results demonstrate that even affordable LOs offer sufficient stability to ensure negligible loss of uplink Spectral Efficiency (SE) on the time scale of the standardized 5G Transmission Time Interval of 1 ms. This study substantiates the feasibility of CF networks based on 5G standards.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Deployment of Stateful FaaS Vertical Applications on Edge Data Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G and beyond support the deployment of vertical applications, which is particularly appealing in combination with network slicing and edge computing to create a logically isolated environment for executing customer services. Even if serverless computing has gained significant interest as a cloud-native technology its adoption at the edge is lagging, especially because of the need to support stateful tasks, which are commonplace in, e.g., cognitive services, but not fully amenable to being deployed on limited and decentralized computing infrastructures. In this work, we study the emerging paradigm of stateful Function as a Service (FaaS) with lightweight task abstractions in WebAssembly. Specifically, we assess the implications of deploying inter-dependent tasks with an internal state on edge computing resources using a stateless vs. stateful approach and then derive a mathematical model to estimate the energy consumption of a workload with given characteristics, considering the power used for both processing and communication. The model is used in extensive simulations to determine the impact of key factors and assess the energy trade-offs of stateless vs. stateful.</description>

      <title>GLIDS: A Global Latency Information Dissemination System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent advance in networking is the deployment of path-aware multipath network architectures, where network endpoints are given multiple network paths to send their data on. In this work, we tackle the challenge of selecting paths for latency-sensitive applications. Even today's path-aware networks, which are much smaller than the current Internet, already offer dozens and in several cases over a hundred paths to a given destination, making it impractical to measure all path latencies to find the lowest latency path. Furthermore, for short flows, performing latency measurements may not provide benefits as the flow may finish before completing the measurements. To overcome these issues, we argue that endpoints should be provided with a latency estimate before sending any packets, enabling latency-aware path choice for the first packet sent. As we cannot predict the end-to-end latency due to dynamically changing queuing delays, we measure and disseminate the propagation latency, enabling novel use cases and solving concrete problems in current network protocols. We present the Global Latency Information Dissemination System (GLIDS), which is a step toward global latency transparency through the dissemination of propagation latency information.</description>

      <title>PACIFISTA: Conflict Evaluation and Management in Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The O-RAN ALLIANCE is defining architectures, interfaces, operations, and security requirements for cellular networks based on Open Radio Access Network (RAN) principles. In this context, O-RAN introduced the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs) to enable dynamic control of cellular networks via data-driven applications referred to as rApps and xApps. RICs enable for the first time truly intelligent and self-organizing cellular networks. However, enabling the execution of many Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms taking autonomous control decisions to fulfill diverse (and possibly conflicting) goals poses unprecedented challenges. For instance, the execution of one xApp aiming at maximizing throughput and one aiming at minimizing energy consumption would inevitably result in diametrically opposed resource allocation strategies. Therefore, conflict management becomes a crucial component of any functional intelligent O-RAN system. This article studies the problem of conflict mitigation in O-RAN and proposes PACIFISTA, a framework to detect, characterize, and mitigate conflicts. PACIFISTA leverages a profiling pipeline to tests O-RAN applications in a sandbox environment, and combines hierarchical graphs with statistical models to detect the existence of conflicts and evaluate their severity. Experiments on Colosseum and OpenRAN Gym demonstrate PACIFISTA's ability to predict conflicts and provide valuable information before potentially conflicting xApps are deployed in production systems. We demonstrate that even O-RAN applications with similar goals can result in 16% throughput loss, and show how applications with conflicting goals might cause severe instability and result in up to 30% performance degradation. We also show that PACIFISTA can help operators to identify coexisting applications and maintain performance degradation below a tolerable threshold.</description>

      <title>Utility-driven Optimization of TTL Cache Hierarchies under Network Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We optimize hierarchies of Time-to-Live (TTL) caches under random network delays. A TTL cache assigns individual eviction timers to cached objects that are usually refreshed upon a hit where upon a miss the object requires a random time to be fetched from a parent cache. Due to their object decoupling property, TTL caches are of particular interest since the optimization of a per-object utility enables service differentiation. However, state-of-the-art exact TTL cache optimization does not extend beyond single TTL caches, especially under network delays. In this paper, we leverage the object decoupling effect to formulate the non-linear utility maximization problem for TTL cache hierarchies in terms of the exact object hit probability under random network delays. We iteratively solve the utility maximization problem to find the optimal per-object TTLs. Further, we show that the exact model suffers from tractability issues for large hierarchies and propose a machine learning approach to estimate the optimal TTL values for large systems. Finally, we provide numerical and data center trace-based evaluations for both methods showing the significant offloading improvement due to TTL optimization considering the network delays.</description>

      <title>Designing the Network Intelligence Stratum for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As network complexity escalates, there is an increasing need for more sophisticated methods to manage and operate these networks, focusing on enhancing efficiency, reliability, and security. A wide range of Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) models are being developed in response. These models are pivotal in automating decision-making, conducting predictive analyses, managing networks proactively, enhancing security, and optimizing network performance. They are foundational in shaping the future of networks, collectively forming what is known as Network Intelligence (NI). Prominent Standard-Defining Organizations (SDOs) are integrating NI into future network architectures, particularly emphasizing the closed-loop approach. However, existing methods for seamlessly integrating NI into network architectures are not yet fully effective. This paper introduces an in-depth architectural design for a Network Intelligence Stratum (NI Stratum). This stratum is supported by a novel end-to-end NI orchestrator that supports closed-loop NI operations across various network domains. The primary goal of this design is to streamline the deployment and coordination of NI throughout the entire network infrastructure, tackling issues related to scalability, conflict resolution, and effective data management. We detail exhaustive workflows for managing the NI lifecycle and demonstrate a reference implementation of the NI Stratum, focusing on its compatibility and integration with current network systems and open-source platforms such as Kubernetes and Kubeflow, as well as on its validation on real-world environments. The paper also outlines major challenges and open issues in deploying and managing NI.</description>

      <title>Designing, Developing, and Validating Network Intelligence for Scaling in Service-Based Architectures based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automating network processes without human intervention is crucial for the complex 6G environment. This requires zero-touch management and orchestration, the integration of Network Intelligence (NI) into the network architecture, and the efficient lifecycle management of intelligent functions. Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a key role in this context, offering intelligent decision-making capabilities suited to networks' dynamic nature. Despite its potential, integrating RL poses challenges in model development and application. To tackle those issues, we delve into designing, developing, and validating RL algorithms for scaling network functions in service-based network architectures such as Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN). It builds upon and expands previous research on RL lifecycle management by proposing several RL algorithms and Reward Functions (RFns). Our proposed methodology is anchored on a dual approach: firstly, it evaluates the training performance of these algorithms under varying RFns, and secondly, it validates their performance after being trained to discern the practical applicability in real-world settings. We show that, despite significant progress, the development stage of RL techniques for networking applications, particularly in scaling scenarios, still leaves room for significant improvements. This study underscores the importance of ongoing research and development to enhance the practicality and resilience of RL techniques in real-world networking environments.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning for Adaptive Video Streaming with Future Adversarial Information Bottleneck Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive video streaming plays a crucial role in ensuring high-quality video streaming services. Despite extensive research efforts devoted to Adaptive BitRate (ABR) techniques, the current reinforcement learning (RL)-based ABR algorithms may benefit the average Quality of Experience (QoE) but suffers from fluctuating performance in individual video sessions. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines imitation learning with the information bottleneck technique, to learn from the complex offline optimal scenario rather than inefficient exploration. In particular, we leverage the deterministic offline bitrate optimization problem with the future throughput realization as the expert and formulate it as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. To enable large-scale training for improved performance, we propose an alternative optimization algorithm that efficiently solves the MINLP problem. To address the issues of overfitting due to the future information leakage in MINLP, we incorporate an adversarial information bottleneck framework. By compressing the video streaming state into a latent space, we retain only action-relevant information. Additionally, we introduce a future adversarial term to mitigate the influence of future information leakage, where Model Prediction Control (MPC) policy without any future information is employed as the adverse expert. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in significantly enhancing the quality of adaptive video streaming, providing a 7.30\% average QoE improvement and a 30.01\% average ranking reduction.</description>

      <title>uTNT: Unikernels for Efficient and Flexible Internet Probing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The last twenty years have seen the development and popularity of network measurement infrastructures. Internet measurement platforms have become common and have demonstrated their relevance in Internet understanding and security observation. However, despite their popularity, those platforms lack of flexibility and reactivity, as they are usually used for longitudinal measurements. As a consequence, they may miss detecting events that are security or Internet-related. During the same period, operating systems have evolved to virtual machines (VMs) as self-contained units for running applications, with the recent rise of unikernels, ultra-lightweight VMs tailored for specific applications, eliminating the need for a host OS. In this paper, we advocate that measurement infrastructures could take advantage of unikernels to become more flexible and efficient. We propose uTNT, a proof-of-concept unikernel-based implementation of TNT, a traceroute extension able to reveal MPLS tunnels. This paper documents the full toolchain for porting TNT into a unikernel and evaluates uTNT performance with respect to more traditional approaches. The paper also discusses a use case in which uTNT could find a suitable usage. uTNT source code is publicly available on Gitlab.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Information Freshness in IoT Systems with Update Rate Constraints: A Token-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Internet of Things (IoT) status update systems, where information is sampled and subsequently transmitted from a source to a destination node, the imperative necessity lies in maintaining the timeliness of information and updating the system with optimal frequency. Optimizing information freshness in resource-limited status update systems often involves Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) problems with update rate constraints. Solving CMDP problems, especially with multiple constraints, is a challenging task. To address this, we present a token-based approach that transforms CMDP into an unconstrained MDP, simplifying the solution process. We apply this approach to systems with one and two update rate constraints for optimizing Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) and Age of Information (AoI) metrics, respectively, and explore the analytical and numerical aspects. Additionally, we introduce an iterative triangle bisection method for solving the CMDP problems with two constraints, comparing its results with the token-based MDP approach. Our findings show that the token-based approach yields superior performance over baseline policies, converging to the optimal policy as the maximum number of tokens increases.</description>

      <title>The Role of Federated Learning in a Wireless World with Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) models that have recently enabled multiple brand-new generative AI applications. The rapid advances in FMs serve as an important contextual backdrop for the vision of next-generation wireless networks, where federated learning (FL) is a key enabler of distributed network intelligence. Currently, the exploration of the interplay between FMs and FL is still in its nascent stage. Naturally, FMs are capable of boosting the performance of FL, and FL could also leverage decentralized data and computing resources to assist in the training of FMs. However, the exceptionally high requirements that FMs have for computing resources, storage, and communication overhead would pose critical challenges to FL-enabled wireless networks. In this article, we explore the extent to which FMs are suitable for FL over wireless networks, including a broad overview of research challenges and opportunities. In particular, we discuss multiple new paradigms for realizing future intelligent networks that integrate FMs and FL. We also consolidate several broad research directions associated with these paradigms.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Overview and Survey of O-RAN: Exploring Slicing-aware Architecture, Deployment Options, and Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open-radio access network (O-RAN) seeks to establish principles of openness, programmability, automation, intelligence, and hardware-software disaggregation with interoperable interfaces. It advocates for multi-vendorism and multi-stakeholderism within a cloudified and virtualized wireless infrastructure, aimed at enhancing the deployment, operation, and maintenance of RAN architecture. This enhancement promises increased flexibility, performance optimization, service innovation, energy efficiency, and cost efficiency in fifth-generation (5G), sixth-generation (6G), and future networks. One of the key features of the O-RAN architecture is its support for network slicing, which entails interaction with other slicing domains within a mobile network, notably the transport network (TN) domain and the core network (CN) domain, to realize end-to-end (E2E) network slicing. The study of this feature requires exploring the stances and contributions of diverse standards development organizations (SDOs). In this context, we note that despite the ongoing industrial deployments and standardization efforts, the research and standardization communities have yet to comprehensively address network slicing in O-RAN. To address this gap, this survey paper provides a comprehensive exploration of network slicing in O-RAN through an in-depth review of specification documents from O-RAN Alliance and research papers from leading industry and academic institutions. The paper commences with an overview of the ongoing standardization efforts and open-source contributions associated with O-RAN, subsequently delving into the latest O-RAN architecture with an emphasis on its slicing aspects. Further, the paper explores deployment scenarios for network slicing within O-RAN, examining options for the deployment and orchestration of O-RAN and TN network slice subnets...</description>

      <title>Quantum $X$-Secure $B$-Byzantine $T$-Colluding Private Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problems arising from the presence of Byzantine servers in a quantum private information retrieval (QPIR) setting. This is the first work to precisely define what the capabilities of Byzantine servers could be in a QPIR context. We show that quantum Byzantine servers have more capabilities than their classical counterparts due to the possibilities created by quantum encoding procedures. We focus on quantum Byzantine servers that can apply any reversible operation on their individual qudits. In this case, Byzantine servers can generate any error, i.e., this covers \emph{all} possible single qudit operations that can be applied by Byzantine servers on their qudits. We design a scheme based on cross-subspace alignment (CSA) and we show that this scheme achieves superdense coding gain in some cases.</description>
