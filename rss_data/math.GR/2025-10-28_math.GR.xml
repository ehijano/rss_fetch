      <title>Criteria for Classifying Prime Graphs of PSL(2, q)-Solvable Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, the prime graph $\Gamma(G)$ (also known as Gruenberg-Kegel graph) is defined to be the graph where the vertices are the primes that divide $|G|$ such that two vertices $p$ and $q$ share an edge if and only if there is an element of order $pq$ in $G$. The prime graphs of solvable groups have been classified. The prime graphs of groups whose noncyclic composition factors are isomorphic to a single nonabelian simple group $T$ where $|T|$ is divisible by three or four distinct primes have been classified except for the cases where $T = \operatorname{PSL}(2,q)$ for $q\neq 2^5$ and $|\operatorname{PSL}(2,q)|$ is divisible by exactly four primes.
  In this paper, we provide criteria for general classification results for certain classes of $T$, and then use them to classify the prime graphs of some $T$-solvable groups for $T$ a suitably small $\operatorname{PSL}(2, q)$-group. We also provide general results on the prime graphs of $T$-solvable groups where $T$ is a member of the possibly infinite family of groups $\operatorname{PSL}(2, 2^f)$ such that $f\geq 5, f$ is prime, and $|\operatorname{PSL}(2, 2^f)|$ is divisible by exactly four primes. This is the first paper to prove general results about the prime graphs of $T$-solvable groups where $T$ belongs to a large (probably infinite) family of groups.</description>

      <title>Systems of imprimitivity for rank two quaternionic reflection groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revise the enumeration of the imprimitive rank two quaternionic reflection groups, adding missing groups and establishing isomorphisms between groups in the published tables. The isomorphisms are obtained as a consequence of the determination of the reflection groups with more than one system of imprimitivity. We find that there are primitive complex reflection groups which have infinitely many systems of imprimitivity when represented as quaternionic reflection groups.</description>

      <title>Congruence subgroups of small Artin and Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small Coxeter groups are exactly those for which the Tits representation takes integral values, which makes the study of their congruence subgroups significant. In \cite{MR0938643}, Squier introduced a matrix representation of an Artin group defined over the ring $\mathbb Z[s^{\pm}, t^{\pm}]$ of Laurent polynomials in two variables. This representation simultaneously generalises the Tits representation of the associated Coxeter groups and the reduced Burau representation of braid groups. We define small Artin groups as those for which this representation becomes integral when evaluated at $s=1$ and $t=-1$. Consequently, the study of congruence subgroups of small Artin groups extends the classical notion of congruence subgroups of braid groups, which arise from the integral reduced Burau representation. In this paper, we examine Coxeter and Artin groups that possess the congruence subgroup property and identify several of their principal congruence subgroups at small levels.</description>

      <title>Group pairs, coherence and Farrell--Jones Conjecture for $K_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23518v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group pair $(G, X)$ consists of a group $G$ together with a $G$-set $X$. Such a pair encodes properties of $G$ relative to the stabilisers of points in $X$. In this paper, we show how to combine properties of group pairs and their stabilisers to prove coherence results for $G$ and its group algebra, as well as to study the quotient of $G$ obtained by killing the stabilisers.
  In particular, we prove that a torsion-free one-relator product of locally indicable groups is coherent provided that both factor groups are coherent. Moreover, we show that the group algebra of such a group over a field of characteristic $0$ is coherent whenever the group algebras of the factors are coherent.
  As other consequences of our methods, we also show that extensions of coherent locally indicable hyperbolic groups by $\mathbb{Z}$ are coherent and that groups admitting a Cohen--Lyndon presentation satisfy the Farrell--Jones Conjecture for $K_{0}$.</description>

      <title>A Galois Criterion for Good Reduction via Orbital Arboreal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let K be a non-archimedean local field and phi: P^1 -&gt; P^1 a rational endomorphism of degree d &gt;= 2 defined over K. We relate the reduction of phi to the Galois action on its preimage towers by introducing the *orbital colimit* G_{O+(x)} := colim_n Im(rho_{phi^n(x)}), a canonical Galois object encoding the dynamics along a forward orbit. Our main theorem (Theorem 3.1) gives a precise equivalence: phi has *strict good reduction* if and only if there exists a nonempty open set of integral points x in P^1(O_K) whose reductions avoid the reduced postcritical set PC(tilde{phi}), such that the reduced level-1 fibers have degree d and are etale -- equivalently, the associated fiber polynomials have unit leading coefficient and unit discriminant. In particular, for every such x, the extensions K(X_n(x))/K are unramified for all n &gt;= 1. This yields a dynamical Neron--Ogg--Shafarevich criterion in arboreal terms, valid on the natural open locus. We provide complete proofs and explicit examples over Q_p.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures on the space of measured laminations for subgroups of mapping class group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a non-elementary subgroup of the mapping class group of a surface, we study its invariant Radon measures on the space of measured laminations, by classifying them on the recurrent measured laminations. In particular, given a divergence-type subgroup, we show the uniquely ergodic by explicitly constructing the ergodic measure. This generalizes Lindenstrauss--Mirzakhani's result and Hamenst\"adt's result for the full mapping class group, in which case the ergodic measure is the Thurston measure. As a special case, we deduce that for a convex cocompact subgroup, every invariant ergodic Radon measure on the space of all measured laminations is either the unique measure on recurrent measured laminations, or a counting measure on the orbit of a non-recurrent measured lamination.
  Our method is geometric and does not rely on continuous or homogeneous flows on the ambient space or a dynamical system associated with a finite measure space. This leads to a unifying approach for various metric spaces, including Teichm\"uller spaces and partially $\operatorname{CAT}(-1)$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Classification of horospherical invariant measures in higher rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a product of rank-one simple real algebraic groups and let $\Gamma &lt; G$ be a Zariski dense Anosov subgroup, or relatively Anosov subgroup. In this paper, we prove a complete classification of invariant Radon measures for the maximal horospherical action on $\Gamma \backslash G$. In particular, when $\Gamma$ is Anosov, this solves the open problems proposed by Landesberg--Lee--Lindenstrauss--Oh for $\operatorname{rank} G \le 3$, and by Oh in general.
  More generally, we consider the horospherical foliation of a product of $\operatorname{CAT}(-1)$ spaces, and present a classification of Radon measures supported on a recurrent subfoliation that are invariant under the action of transverse subgroups.</description>

Abstract: Adapting Reiher's proof of Kemnitz's conjecture, we obtain two refinements of a theorem of Schmid and Zhuang. Our main results provide improved upper bounds for the Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv constant of rank-two-like $p$-groups, and their direct products with cyclic groups of order coprime to $p$. In particular, we determine the exact value of this constant, and also confirm a conjecture of Gao, for a new infinite family of groups of arbitrarily large rank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an axiomatic approach to combination theorems for various homological properties of groups and, more generally, of chain complexes. Examples of such properties include algebraic finiteness properties, $\ell^2$-invisibility, $\ell^2$-acyclicity, lower bounds for Novikov--Shubin invariants, and vanishing of homology growth. As a key example, we introduce an algebraic version of Ab\'ert--Bergeron--Fr\k{a}czyk--Gaboriau's cheap rebuilding property that implies vanishing of torsion homology growth and fits into our axiomatic framework for combination theorems. In particular, we obtain that certain graphs of groups with amenable vertex groups and elementary amenable edge groups have vanishing torsion homology growth.</description>

      <title>Graph Powers of Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lights Out Puzzle, played on a graph $\Gamma$, has been studied using linear algebra over $\mathbb{F}_2$ and more generally over $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$. We generalize the setting by allowing the states of vertices to be the elements of a group $G$, where a \textit{click} in vertex $v$ multiplies the state of $v$ and its neighbors by an element $g \in G$ on the right.
  Starting with the identity element $e \in G$ for all vertices, the totality of all achievable state configurations forms a group $G^{\Gamma}$. This group generalizes parallel products of group actions and provides a rich structure for analysis. For many graphs, which we term ``RA'' (reducible to abelian), the problem reduces -- regardless of $G$ -- to a linear algebra question over $\mathbb{Z}$. We discuss a chain of five different subgroups consisting of commutators and introduce techniques for showing that families of graphs are RA using each. In particular, using Heisenberg groups, we establish that a graph is RA precisely when a certain lattice spans $\mathbb{Z}^{|\Gamma|}$. While most graphs appear to be RA, we show the odd-dimensional cube graphs $Q_{2n+1}$ and folded cube graphs $\square_d$, for $d$ odd or 2, are not.</description>

      <title>Loops with squares in two nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although little can be gleaned about a loop with the property that its squares are, say, left nuclear ($xx\cdot yz = (xx\cdot y)z$), if its squares are also, say, middle nuclear ($(x\cdot yy)z = x(yy\cdot z)$), then the loop exhibits more structure than one might initially guess. Loops with squares in (at least) two nuclei include many well known classes of loops, such as C loops and extra loops, and not so well known classes such left C loops. In any loop with, say, left and middle nuclear squares, the intersection of the left and middle nuclei is a normal subloop; hence such a loop is simple if and only if it is a group or a simple unipotent loop. Loops in which squaring is a centralizing endomorphism have even more structure; they are power-associative, and a torsion loop in that class is a direct product of a loop of $2$-elements and a loop of elements of odd order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01390v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the dynamical properties of the geodesic flow for a proper metric space endowed with a proper action by isometries of a group with a contracting element. We show that the existence of a contracting isometry is a sufficient evidence of negative curvature to carry in this context various results borrowed from hyperbolic geometry. In particular, we extend the so-called Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy proving that the geodesic flow is either conservative and ergodic or dissipative.</description>

      <title>On semigroups that are prime in the sense of Tarski, and groups prime in the senses of Tarski and of Rhodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $\mathcal{C}$ is a category of algebras closed under finite direct products, and $M_\mathcal{C}$ the commutative monoid of isomorphism classes of members of $\mathcal{C},$ with operation induced by direct product, A.Tarski defined a nonidentity element $p$ of $M_\mathcal{C}$ to be prime if, whenever it divides a product of two elements in that monoid, it divides one of them, and called an object of $\mathcal{C}$ prime if its isomorphism class has this property.
  McKenzie, McNulty and Taylor ask whether the category of nonempty semigroups has any prime objects. We show in section 2 that it does not. However, for the category of monoids, and some other subcategories of semigroups, we obtain examples of prime objects in sections 3-4. In section 5, two related questions open so far as I know, are recalled.
  In section 6, which can be read independently of the rest of this note, we recall two related conditions that are called primeness by semigroup theorists, and obtain results and examples on the relationships among those two conditions and Tarski's, in categories of groups. Section 7 notes an interesting characterization of one of those conditions when applied to finite algebras in an arbitrary variety.
  Various questions are raised.</description>

      <title>Semirigidity and the enumeration of nilpotent semigroups of index three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is strong evidence for the belief that `almost all' finite semigroups, whether we consider multiplication operations on a fixed set or their isomorphism classes, are nilpotent of index 3 (3-nilpotent for short). The only known method for counting all semigroups of given order is exhaustive testing, but formulae exist for the numbers of 3-nilpotent ones, and it is also known that `almost all' of these are rigid (have only trivial automorphism).
  Here we express the number of distinct 3-nilpotent semigroup operations on a fixed set of cardinality $n$ as a sum of Stirling numbers, and provide a new expression for the number of isomorphism classes of 3-nilpotent semigroups of cardinality $n$. We introduce a notion of semirigidity for semigroups (as a generalization of rigidity) and find computationally tractable formulae giving an upper bound for the number of pairwise non-isomorphic semirigid 3-nilpotent semigroups, and thus an improved lower bound for the number of all 3-nilpotent semigroups up to isomorphism. Analogous formulae are also developed for isomorphism classes such as commutative and self-dual semigroups, and for equivalence classes (isomorphic or anti-isomorphic). The method relies on an application of the theory of orbit counting in permutation group actions. Our main results are accompanied by tables containing values of these numbers and bounds up to $n=10$ with computations carried out in GAP (but perfectly feasible well beyond this value of $n$).</description>

      <title>Pointed Hopf algebras, the Dixmier-Moeglin Equivalence and Noetherian group algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the interactions between three properties that a group algebra or more generally a pointed Hopf algebra may possess: being noetherian, having finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, and satisfying the Dixmier-Moeglin equivalence. First it is shown that the second and third of these properties are equivalent for group algebras $kG$ of polycyclic-by-finite groups, and are, in turn, equivalent to $G$ being nilpotent-by-finite. In characteristic $0$, this enables us to extend this equivalence to certain cocommutative Hopf algebras.
  In sections 3 and 4 of the paper finiteness conditions for group algebras are studied. Thus in $\S$3 we examine when a group algebra satisfies the Goldie conditions, while in the final section we discuss what can be said about a minimal counterexample to the conjecture that if $kG$ is noetherian then $G$ is polycyclic-by-finite.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of zero singular ideal in \'etale groupoid C*-algebras via compressible maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07262v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the singular ideal in a non-Hausdorff \'etale groupoid C*-algebra is zero if and only if every unit is contained, at the level of group representation theory, in the collection of subgroups of the unit's isotropy group obtained as limit sets of nets in the "Hausdorff part" of the unit space. This is achieved through a study of the interplay between the Hausdorff cover and restriction maps on C*-algebras of groupoids to reductions by closed locally invariant subsets, which we show are compressible to *-homomorphisms and therefore have many of the same properties. We also prove a simpler algebraic characterization of zero singular ideal that holds whenever the isotropy group C*-algebras satisfy a certain ideal intersection property. We prove this property holds for all direct limits of virtually torsion free solvable groups.</description>
