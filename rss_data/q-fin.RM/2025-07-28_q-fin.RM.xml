      <title>Modeling Excess Mortality and Interest Rates using Mixed Fractional Brownian Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have identified long-range dependence as a key feature in the dynamics of both mortality and interest rates. Building on this insight, we develop a novel bi-variate stochastic framework based on mixed fractional Brownian motions to jointly model their long-memory behavior and instantaneous correlation. Analytical solutions are derived under the risk-neutral measure for explicitly pricing zero-coupon bonds and extreme mortality bonds, while capturing the impact of persistent and correlated risk dynamics. We then propose a calibration procedure that sequentially estimates the model and risk premium parameters, including the Hurst parameters and the correlation parameter, using the most recent data on mortality rates, interest rates, and market conditions. Lastly, an extensive numerical analysis is conducted to examine how long-range dependence and mortality-interest correlation influence fair coupon rates, bond payouts and risk measures, providing practical implications for the pricing and risk management of mortality-linked securities in the post-pandemic environment.</description>

      <title>Implementing Credit Risk Analysis with Quantum Singular Value Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of credit risk is crucial for the efficient operation of financial institutions. Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) offers the potential for a quadratic speed-up over classical methods used to estimate metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). However, numerous limitations remain in efficiently scaling the implementation of quantum circuits that solve these estimation problems. One of the main challenges is the use of costly and restrictive arithmetic that must be implemented within the quantum circuit. In this paper, we propose using Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) to significantly reduce the cost of implementing the state preparation operator, which underlies QAE for credit risk analysis. We also present an end-to-end code implementation and the results of a simulation study to validate the proposed approach and demonstrate its benefits.</description>
