      <title>Unbounded Widom factors for orthogonal and residual polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Widom factors for (a) monic orthogonal polynomials in $L^2$ with respect to the equilibrium measure of a compact set $K\subset\mathbb{R}$ and (b) residual polynomials normalized at an exterior point. Using weakly equilibrium Cantor sets $K(\gamma)$, we prove:
  (1) Given any sequence $(c_n)$ with subexponential growth, there exists a non-polar Cantor set $K(\gamma)$, depending on $(c_n)$, such that the $L^2$ Widom factors of the associated orthogonal polynomials (with respect to the equilibrium measure of $K(\gamma)$) exceed $c_n$ for every $n$.
  (2) For the same $K(\gamma)$ built from $(c_n)$ and each exterior point $x_0\in\mathbb{R}\setminus K(\gamma)$, the residual Widom factors satisfy power-type lower bounds with a Harnack-distance exponent $\tau_{x_0}\in(0,1)$: they are bounded below by $c_n^{\tau_{x_0}}$ for all degrees when $x_0$ lies in an unbounded gap, and along a subsequence of degrees when $x_0$ lies in a bounded gap. Consequently, if, in addition, $(c_n)$ is monotone increasing and unbounded, then the sequence of residual Widom factors is unbounded for every $x_0\in\mathbb{R}\setminus K(\gamma)$.
  The proofs combine inverse-image constructions, capacity comparisons for period-$n$ sets, harmonic-measure representations for differences of Green functions, and alternation principles on nested approximants.</description>

      <title>$\zeta$-functions via contour integrals and universal sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops an analytic framework for the study of the $\zeta$-function associated with general sequences of complex numbers. We show that a contour integral representation, commonly used when studying spectral $\zeta$-functions associated with self-adjoint differential operators, can be extended far beyond its traditional setting. In contrast to representations utilizing integrals of $\theta$-functions, our method applies to arbitrary sequences of complex numbers with minimal assumptions. This leads to a set of universal identities, including sum rules and meromorphic properties, that hold across a broad class of $\zeta$-functions. Additionally, we discuss the connection to regularized (modified) Fredholm determinants of $p$-Schatten--von Neumann class operators. We illustrate the versatility of this representation by computing special values and residues of the $\zeta$-function for a variety of sequences of complex numbers, in particular, the zeros of Airy functions, parabolic cylinder functions, and confluent hypergeometric functions. Furthermore, we employ the adaptive Antoulas--Anderson (AAA) algorithm for rational interpolation in the study of the Airy $\zeta$-function.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a division problem for a class of overdetermined systems introduced by L. H{\"o}rmander, and establish an effective divisibility criterion. In addition, we prove a coherence theorem which extends Nadel's coherence theorem from complex structures to elliptic systems of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Hermitian Geometry of Complex Multivectors, Determinants and Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two geometric interpretations for complex multivectors and determinants: a little known one in terms of square roots of volumes, and a new one which uses fractions of volumes and allows graphical representations. The fraction corresponds to a holomorphy index, which measures the lack of holomorphy of real subspaces of $\mathds{C}^n$ via generalized K\"ahler angles or a disjointness angle. Their interpretations are completed with an unorthodox concept of complex orientation, linked to elementary complex transformations. We also discuss how Clifford algebras relate (or not) to the geometry of Hermitian spaces.</description>

      <title>Tight approximation for rationally simply connected varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that holomorphic maps from an open subset of a complex smooth projective curve to a complex smooth projective rationally simply connected variety can be approximated by algebraic maps for the compact-open topology. This theorem can be applied in particular when the target is a smooth hypersurface of degree d in P^n with n greater than or equal to d^2-1. We deduce it from a more general result: the tight approximation property holds for rationally simply connected varieties over function fields of complex curves.</description>

      <title>Infinite Ideal Polyhedra in Hyperbolic 3-Space: Existence and Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the seminal work [27], Rivin obtained a complete characterization of finite ideal polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space by the exterior dihedral angles. Since then,the characterization of infinite hyperbolic polyhedra has become an extremely challenging open problem. By studying ideal circle patterns (ICPs), we characterize the infinite ideal polyhedra (IIP) and resolve this problem. Specifically, we establish the existence and rigidity of embedded ICPs on the plane. We further prove the uniformization theorem for the embedded ICPs, which solves the type problem of infinite ICPs. This is an analog of the uniformization theorem obtained by He and Schramm in [22, 23]. Moreover, we demonstrate that, unlike He-Schramm's work, the type theory for infinite ICPs depends not only on the structure of the cellular decomposition but also on the selection of intersection angles. In fact, we construct Example 4.13 to show the difference. Consequently, we obtain the existence and rigidity of IIP with prescribed exterior angles. Due to the example, our results on the type problem of infinite ICPs and the existence of IIP are sharp. For ICPs with arbitrary angles, our example also demonstrates that the VEL-parabolicity and ICP-parabolicity are not equivalent (while in He and Schramm's settings, VEL-parabolicity and CP-parabolicity are equivalent), indicating that our setting is extremely distinct from He and Schramm's. To prove our results, we develop a uniform Ring Lemma via the technique of pointed Gromov-Hausdorff convergence for ICPs.</description>

      <title>The Derivative of a Constructible Function is Constructible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of constructible functions in the setting of tame real geometry has been introduced by Cluckers and Dan Miller in their work on parametric integration of globally subanalytic functions. A function on a globally subanalytic set is called constructible if it is a finite sum of finite products of globally subanalytic functions and the logarithm of positive globally subanalytic functions. We show that the class of constructible functions is stable under taking derivatives.</description>
