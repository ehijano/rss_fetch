      <title>Electro-thermal quench in metal-insulated nested REBCO coils for magnets over 40 T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting high field magnets have the capability to generate over 40 T, with multiple existing practical applications globally. However, at such high magnetic fields, these magnets are prone to rapid electrothermal quench which can affect the continuous operation of such magnets. A nested stack configuration, with multiple HTS inserts inside a LTS outsert, can be used for better thermal stability and compact design. We have performed detailed multiphysics quench analysis of such a nested stack high field magnet design under SuperEMFL project using our in-house software, which considers screening currents. Through various case studies, we have identified various weak spots in such a magnet, where thermal quench can be the most detrimental for magnet operation, and various ways are suggested to overcome this important issue.</description>

      <title>Model-based upscaling of vanadium redox flow battery systems: engineering challenges and solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale energy storage has become an inevitable solution for integrating stochastically available renewable energy sources into the electric grid. Vanadium redox flow batteries offer a viable option among other technologies, due to their long lifetime and independently scalable output power and capacity. The electrolyte temperature should be maintained within the range of 5-40 Celsius for safe operation; therefore, a thermal management system is necessary, which affects battery efficiency. The study presents a detailed, containerized battery model with a hybrid thermal management system that considers thermal radiation and real ambient temperatures. A total of 180 configurations were investigated in 10 cases, ranging from 4 to 400 kW, with 18 different discharging current-cell number ratios in each case, including multistack arrangements. Current-dependent ohmic losses influence the electric efficiency, which increases from a minimum of 68% to 89% in low-current configurations. However, the net system efficiency ranges between 43% and 66% due to the self-consumption of pumps, the inverter, and the thermal management system. In addition to the detailed efficiency analysis, a comprehensive investigation of thermal processes is provided in terms of the current-cell number ratio and output power, which is crucial for designing thermal management systems and sizing batteries.</description>

      <title>All-Optically Controlled Memristive Reservoir Computing Capable of Bipolar and Parallel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing (RC) utilizes the intrinsic dynamical evolution of physical systems for efficient data processing. Emerging optoelectronic RC platforms,such as light-driven memristors, merge the benefits of electronic and photonic computation. However, conventional designs are often limited by the unipolar photoresponse of optoelectronic devices, which restricts reservoir state diversity and reduces computational accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an all-optically controlled RC system employing an oxide memristor array that demonstrates exceptional uniformity and stability. The memristive devices exhibit wavelength-dependent bipolar photoresponse, originating from light-induced dynamic evolution of oxygen vacancies. Tuning the power density and irradiation mode of dual-wavelength light pulses enables dynamic control of photocurrent relaxation and nonlinearity. By leveraging these unique device properties, we develop bipolar and parallel coding strategies to significantly enrich reservoir dynamics and enhance nonlinear mapping capability. In word recognition and time-series prediction tasks, the bipolar coding demonstrates markedly improved accuracy compared to unipolar coding. The parallel coding supports multi-source signal fusion within a single reservoir, maintaining high computational accuracy while significantly reducing hardware consumption. This work provides a high-performance approach to physical RC, paving the way for intelligent edge computing.</description>

      <title>Design and Operation of Wafer-Scale Packages Containing &gt;500 Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Packages capable of supporting large arrays of high-coherence superconducting qubits are vital for the realisation of fault-tolerant quantum computers and the necessary high-throughput metrology required to optimise fabrication and manufacturing processes. We present a wafer-scale packaging architecture supporting over 500 qubits on a single 3-inch die. The package is engineered to suppress parasitic RF modes, and to mitigate material loss through simulation-informed design while managing differential thermal contraction to ensure robust operation at millikelvin temperatures. System-level heat-load calculations from a large wiring payload show this package may be operated in commercial dilution refrigerators. Measurements of the qubits loaded into the package show median $T_1$, $T_{2e} \sim 100~\mu$s ($\sim$100 qubits) alongside readout with median fidelity of 97.5% (54 qubits) and a median qubit temperature of 36 mK (54 qubits). These results validate the performance of these packages and demonstrate that large-scale integration can be achieved without compromising device performance. Finally, we highlight the utility of these packages as a tool for high throughput feedback on qubit figures of merit over large sample sizes, allowing identification of performance outliers in the tails of the coherence distribution, a critical capability for informing fabrication and manufacture of high-quality quantum qubits and quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Molecular Beam Epitaxy of Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N Nanowires: Towards Group-III Nitride Piezoelectric Nanogenerators with Enhanced Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the molecular beam epitaxy of self-assembled Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N nanowires on conductive TiN layers and demonstrate their application in piezoelectric nanogenerators. Wurtzite Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N nanowires with uniform Sc incorporation are grown across a wide composition range (0&lt;x&lt;0.35). At substrate temperatures below 700 $^\circ{}$C, these nanowires exhibit an inversely tapered morphology, whereas higher temperatures favor the nucleation of additional branches due to a phase separation of Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N into wurtzite AlN and rock-salt ScN. Phase-pure Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N nanowires are integrated into vertical nanogenerators, where the metallic TiN substrate serves as bottom electrode. The fabricated polymer-nanowire composite devices achieve effective piezoelectric charge coefficients of up to 8.5 pC N$^{-1}$ at x=0.32, thus exceeding the piezoelectric response of bulk AlN by nearly a factor of two. Although the charge response remains lower compared to Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N thin films, the reduced effective dielectric permittivity of the nanowire-polymer composites compensates the reduction in piezoelectric charge coefficient, eventually yielding a higher voltage response and comparable energy harvesting efficiency. Finally, effective medium modeling reveals that the device architecture is the primary factor limiting performance, providing general design principles for highly efficient nanowire-based piezoelectric energy harvesters.</description>

      <title>Absorption imaging of quantum gases near surfaces using incoherent light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an absorption imaging technique for ultracold gases that suppresses interference fringes and coherence-induced artifacts by reducing the transverse spatial coherence of the imaging light. The method preserves the narrow spectral bandwidth required for resonant absorption imaging and is implemented as a modular extension to standard imaging setups using a rotating diffuser. We demonstrate tunability of the illumination light's coherence without modifying the imaging optics. Using this approach, we achieve reliable imaging of ultracold atomic clouds in micron-scale proximity to complex surfaces, where standing waves, edge diffraction, and speckle severely limit conventional absorption imaging.</description>

      <title>The Role of Exceptional Points and Transmission Peak Degeneracies in Non-Hermitian Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09141v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs) have emerged as a promising alternative to exceptional points (EPs) for non-Hermitian sensing, providing square-root frequency splitting without the eigenbasis collapse and associated noise amplification that limit EP sensors. However, existing treatments of TPDs remain fragmented, lacking a unified theoretical framework, systematic figures of merit, or design principles for practical implementation. Here, we develop a comprehensive theory of two-dimensional TPDs that clarifies their relationship to EPs, maps their locations in parameter space, and provides analytic figures of merit for sensor design. We validate our theory using a tunable cavity-magnonics platform with in situ control of mode frequency, dissipation, and complex coupling via an effective synthetic gauge field. Our platform enables systematic exploration of six representative EP-TPD configurations spanning PT-symmetric, anti-PT-symmetric and anyonic-PT-symmetric regimes. Crucially, we show that TPDs, unlike EPs, retain square-root splitting even under nuisance parameter drift through generalized transmission extrema degeneracies (TEDs). We further identify specific robust TPD configurations that minimize the impact of nuisance drift. These findings establish a unified theoretical and experimental framework for TPD-based non-Hermitian sensing.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Role of Higher-Lying Excited States in Organic Emitters via Multistate Ab Initio Kinetic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher lying excited states beyond S1 and T1 are widely recognized in many photophysical systems, including thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). However, their explicit and quantitative impact on photophysical observables such as photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and lifetimes is difficult to be attained experimentally and it has not been systematically assessed within a fully ab initio kinetic modeling framework. To address this gap, we developed KinLuv, a multistate excited state kinetic model that includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2) and all possible monomolecular interconversion processes between all the electronic states, whose rate constants were computed using Fermi golden rule explicitly including the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling effect. We applied KinLuv to prototypical multi resonance TADF (MRTADF) emitters and their derivatives, as well as other representative organic chromophores, demonstrating its broad applicability across diverse photophysical playgrounds beyond TADF. The resulting simulations quantitatively reproduce key experimental observables, including PLQY and prompt and delayed fluorescence lifetimes. Beyond its predictive power, the present results establish clear criteria for identifying when higher lying excited states influence the excited state decay and when simplified models remain adequate. This framework enables rational selection of minimal kinetic models that balance physical insight with numerical robustness, with direct implications for the in silico design of high performance organic emitters.</description>

      <title>Biomechanically Informed Image Registration for Patient-Specific Aortic Valve Strain Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aortic valve (AV) biomechanics play a critical role in maintaining normal cardiac function. Pathological variations, particularly in bicuspid aortic valves, alter leaflet loading, increase strain, and accelerate disease progression. Accurate patient-specific characterization of valve geometry and deformation is therefore essential for predicting disease progression and guiding durable repair. Current imaging and computational methods often fail to capture rapid valve motion and complex patient-specific features, limiting precise biomechanical assessment. To address these limitations, we developed an image registration framework coupled with the finite element method (FEM) to improve AV tracking and biomechanical evaluation. The valve geometries derived from 4D echocardiography and CT were used to simulate AV closure and generate intermediate deformation states. These FEM-generated states facilitated leaflet tracking, while image registration corrected misalignment between simulations and imaging data. In 20 patients, FEM-augmented registration improved accuracy by 40% compared with direct registration. This improvement enabled more reliable strain estimation by measuring leaflet deformation directly from imaging and reducing uncertainties associated with boundary conditions and material assumptions. Areal, Green-Lagrange, and deviatoric strains were quantified in adult trileaflet/bicuspid valves, as well as pediatric patients, revealing distinct deformation patterns across valve groups. Convergence in mean deviatoric strain between adult trileaflet and pediatric valves suggests volumetric deformation underlies age- and size-related differences in AV mechanics. The FEM-augmented registration enhances tracking and biomechanical evaluation accuracy, providing clinically relevant insights into patient-specific AV deformation to support individualized medical and intervention planning.</description>

      <title>Reaching the intrinsic performance limits of superconducting strip photon detectors up to 0.1 mm wide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-photon detection underpins a wide range of emerging photonic technologies, from quantum information processing and secure communications to photon-starved biomedical imaging. Among the available detector technologies, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) combine high detection efficiency, low noise, and excellent timing resolution, making them a leading platform for photon-counting applications. However, despite decades of materials and fabrication research, detector performance has never been shown to match theoretical performance expectations. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from its typical, suboptimal operation, to a regime limited only by material quality, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting "rails" placed on either side of the detector that redistribute current across its width to achieve its peak performance. This technique not only reduces the dark count rate by ten orders of magnitude, but also enables future detectors to overcome the Pearl limit for device width, paving the way for arbitrarily large detectors. We show operation at this intrinsic performance limit for devices up to 0.1 mm wide, and also demonstrate near-unity internal detection efficiency (IDE) at a wavelength of 4um for a 20um-wide detector--a factor of 20 wider than the current state of the art.</description>
