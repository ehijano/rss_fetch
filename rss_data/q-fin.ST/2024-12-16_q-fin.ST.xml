      <title>Limit Order Book Event Stream Prediction with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limit order book (LOB) is a dynamic, event-driven system that records real-time market demand and supply for a financial asset in a stream flow. Event stream prediction in LOB refers to forecasting both the timing and the type of events. The challenge lies in modeling the time-event distribution to capture the interdependence between time and event type, which has traditionally relied on stochastic point processes. However, modeling complex market dynamics using stochastic processes, e.g., Hawke stochastic process, can be simplistic and struggle to capture the evolution of market dynamics. In this study, we present LOBDIF (LOB event stream prediction with diffusion model), which offers a new paradigm for event stream prediction within the LOB system. LOBDIF learns the complex time-event distribution by leveraging a diffusion model, which decomposes the time-event distribution into sequential steps, with each step represented by a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we propose a denoising network and a skip-step sampling strategy. The former facilitates effective learning of time-event interdependence, while the latter accelerates the sampling process during inference. By introducing a diffusion model, our approach breaks away from traditional modeling paradigms, offering novel insights and providing an effective and efficient solution for learning the time-event distribution in order streams within the LOB system. Extensive experiments using real-world data from the limit order books of three widely traded assets confirm that LOBDIF significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Sparse Portfolio Selection via Topological Data Analysis based Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper uses topological data analysis (TDA) tools and introduces a data-driven clustering-based stock selection strategy tailored for sparse portfolio construction. Our asset selection strategy exploits the topological features of stock price movements to select a subset of topologically similar (different) assets for a sparse index tracking (Markowitz) portfolio. We introduce new distance measures, which serve as an input to the clustering algorithm, on the space of persistence diagrams and landscapes that consider the time component of a time series. We conduct an empirical analysis on the S\&amp;P index from 2009 to 2022, including a study on the COVID-19 data to validate the robustness of our methodology. Our strategy to integrate TDA with the clustering algorithm significantly enhanced the performance of sparse portfolios across various performance measures in diverse market scenarios.</description>
