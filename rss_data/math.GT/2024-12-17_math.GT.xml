      <title>From spinors to horospheres: a geometric tour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is an exposition and elaboration of recent work of the first author on spinors and horospheres. It presents the main results in detail, and includes numerous subsidiary observations and calculations. It is intended to be accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students with some background in hyperbolic geometry.
  The main result is the spinor--horosphere correspondence, which is a smooth, $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$-equivariant bijection between two-component complex spin vectors and spin-decorated horospheres in three-dimensional hyperbolic space. The correspondence includes constructions of Penrose--Rindler and Penner, which respectively associate null flags in Minkowski spacetime to spinors, and associate horospheres to points on the future light cone. The construction is presented step by step, proceeding from spin vectors, through spaces of Hermitian matrices and Minkowski space, to various models of 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. Under this correspondence, we show that the natural inner product on spinors corresponds to a 3-dimensional, complex version of lambda lengths, describing a distance between horospheres and their decorations.
  We also discuss various applications of these results. An ideal hyperbolic tetrahedron with spin-decorations at its vertices obeys a Ptolemy equation, generalising the Ptolemy equation obeyed by 2-dimensional ideal quadrilaterals. More generally we discuss how real spinors describe 2-dimensional hyperbolic geometry. We also discuss the relationships between spinors, horospheres, and various sets of matrices.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of the diffeomorphism group of the connected sum of two generic lens spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the connected sum of two three-dimensional lens spaces $L_1\#L_2$, where $L_1$ and $L_2$ are non-diffeomorphic and are of a certain "generic" type. Our main result is the calculation of the cohomology ring $H^\ast(B\text{Diff}(L_1\#L_2);\mathbb{Q})$, where $\text{Diff}(L_1\#L_2)$ is the diffeomorphism group of $M$ equipped with the $C^\infty$-topology. We know the homotopy type of the diffeomorphism groups of generic lens spaces this, combined with a theorem of Hatcher forms the basis of our argument.</description>

      <title>Characterizing $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of Lens spaces, $S^2 \times S^1$, and torus bundles over the circle by certain Morse-Bott functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of Lens spaces, copies of $S^2 \times S^1$, and torus bundles over the circle by certain Morse-Bott functions. This adds to our previous result around 2024, classifying Morse functions whose preimages containing no singular points are disjoint unions of spheres and tori on $3$-dimensional manifolds represented as connected sums of connected sums of Lens spaces and copies of $S^2 \times S^1$: we have strengthened and explicitized Saeki's result, characterizing the manifolds via such functions, in 2006. We apply similar arguments. However we discuss in a self-contained way essentially.</description>

      <title>On the Last Kervaire Invariant Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the element $h_6^2$ is a permanent cycle in the Adams spectral sequence. As a result, we establish the existence of smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one in dimension 126, thereby resolving the final case of the Kervaire invariant problem.
  Combining this result with the theorems of Browder, Mahowald--Tangora, Barratt--Jones--Mahowald, and Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel, we conclude that smooth framed manifolds with Kervaire invariant one exist in and only in dimensions $2, 6, 14, 30, 62$, and $126$.</description>

      <title>$q$-Series Invariants of Three-Manifolds and Knots-Quivers Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa (GPPV) conjecture is a relationship between two three-manifold invariants: the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariant and the \(\widehat{Z}\) (``Z-hat'') invariant. In fact, WRT invariant is defined at roots of unity, $\mathbbm{q}\left(\exp\left(\frac{2\pi i}{k+2}\right),~k\in\mathbb{Z}_+,~\text{for}~SU(2)\right)$, and is generally a complex number, whereas $\widehat{Z}$-invariant is a $q$-series with integer coefficients such that $|q|&lt;1$. Therefore, $\widehat{Z}$-invariant can be obtained from WRT-invariant by performing a particular analytic continuation, $\mathbbm{q}\rightarrow q$. In this thesis, we first examine this conjecture for $SO(3)$ and the ortho-symplectic supergroup $OSp(1|2)$. This is done by setting up the WRT invariant for the respective groups and then performing the particular analytic continuation to extract $\widehat{Z}$. As a result of this exercise, we found that $\widehat{Z}^{SU(2)}=\widehat{Z}^{SO(3)}$ and identified a relation between $\widehat{Z}^{SU(2)}$ and $\widehat{Z}^{OSp(1|2)}$. Motivated by the equality of $\widehat{Z}$ for $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$ groups, we study this conjecture for $SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_m$ groups, where $\mathbb{Z}_m$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N$, in our second paper. We subsequently found that $\widehat{Z}^{SU(N)/\mathbb{Z}_m}=\widehat{Z}^{SU(N)}$.
  Another theme of the thesis is to study a conjecture between knot theory and quiver representation theory. More precisely, this conjecture relates the generating function of the symmetric $r$-colored HOMFLY-PT polynomial with the motivic generating series associated with a symmetric quiver. In particular, we obtain a quiver representation for a family of knots called double twist knots $K(p,-m)$. Primarily, we exploit the reverse engineering of Melvin-Morton-Rozansky (MMR) formalism to deduce the pattern of the matrix for these quivers.</description>

      <title>Salter's question on the image of the Burau representation of $B_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1974, Birman posed the problem of identifying the conditions under which a matrix with Laurent polynomial entries lies in the image of the Burau representation. Building on this, Salter, in 2021, refined the inquiry to ask whether the central quotient of the Burau image group coincides with the central quotient of a specific subgroup of the unitary group. Assuming the faithfulness of the $B_{4}$ Burau, we solve Salter's question negatively in the case $n=4$ constructing counterexamples. Additionally, we offer two remarks on the faithfulness of the $B_{4}$ Burau. First, we establish that the restriction to the centralizer of a standard generator in $B_{4}$ is faithful modulo $p$ for every prime $p$, extending both Smythe's result in 1979 and Moran's result in 1991. Second, we present a building-theoretic criterion for the faithfulness.</description>

Abstract: It is proved that any (repetitive) Riemannian manifold of bounded geometry can be realized as a leaf of some (minimal) Riemannian matchbox manifold without holonomy. Our methods can be adapted to achieve Cantor transversals or a prescribed holonomy covering, but then the manifold may not be realized as a dense leaf.</description>

      <title>On sections of configurations of points on orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the configuration space of distinct, unordered points on compact orientable surfaces of genus $g$, denoted $S_g$. Specifically, we address the section problem, which concerns the addition of $n$ distinct points to an existing configuration of $m$ distinct points on $S_g$ in a way that ensures the new points vary continuously with respect to the initial configuration. This problem is equivalent to the splitting problem in surface braid groups.
  For $g \geq 1$ and $m = 1$, we take a geometric approach to demonstrate that a section exists for all values of $n$. With an algebraic approach, for $g \geq 1$ and $m \geq 2$, we establish necessary conditions for the existence of a section, showing that if a section exists, then $n$ must be a multiple of $m + (2g - 2)$.
  Using the theory of Jenkins--Strebel differentials and the corresponding ribbon graph on $S_g$, we construct, for $g \geq 1$, sections for a wide range of values of $n$, while we equip $S_g$ with a Riemann structure, which we allow to vary. In particular, we construct sections for $n = 3km + 3k(2g - 2)$, $n = 2m + 2(2g - 2)$, and $n = (3k + 2)m + (3k + 2)(2g - 2)$, where $k \in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

Abstract: Khovanov homology has been the subject of much study in knot theory and low dimensional topology since 2000. This work introduces a Khovanov Laplacian and a Khovanov Dirac to study knot and link diagrams. The harmonic spectrum of the Khovanov Laplacian or the Khovanov Dirac retains the topological invariants of Khovanov homology, while their non-harmonic spectra reveal additional information that is distinct from Khovanov homology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In my 1993 paper, "Pappus's Theorem and the Modular Group", I explained how the iteration of Pappus's Theorem gives rise to a $2$-parameter family of representations of the modular group into the group of projective automorphisms. In this paper we realize these representations as isometry groups of patterns of geodesics in the symmetric space $X=SL_3(\R)/SO(3)$. The patterns have the same asymptotic structure as the geodesics in the Farey triangulation, so our construction gives a $2$ parameter family of deformations of the Farey triangulation inside $X$. We also describe a bending phenomenon associated to these patterns.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces and period mappings of genus one fibered K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct various moduli spaces of K3 surfaces $M$ equipped with a surjective holomorphic map $\pi:M\to\Pb^1$ with generic fiber a complex torus (e.g., an elliptic fibration). Examples include moduli spaces of such maps with primitive fibers; with reduced, irreducible fibers; equipped with a section; etc. Such spaces are closely related to the moduli space of Ricci-flat metrics on $M$. We construct period mappings relating these moduli spaces to locally symmetric spaces, and use these to compute their (orbifold) fundamental groups.
  These results lie in contrast to, and exhibit different behavior than, the well-studied case of moduli spaces of polarized K3 surfaces, and are more useful for applications to the mapping class group $\Mod(M)$. Indeed, we apply our results on moduli space to give two applications to the smooth mapping class group of $M$.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Trees and Exceptional Directions in FPP on Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of the geometry of infinite geodesics in first passage percolation (FPP) on Gromov-hyperbolic groups G, initiated by Benjamini-Tessera and developed further by the authors. It was shown earlier by the authors that, given any fixed direction $\xi\in \partial G$, and under mild conditions on the passage time distribution, there exists almost surely a unique semi-infinite FPP geodesic from each $v\in G$ to $\xi$. Also, these geodesics coalesce to form a tree. Our main topic of study is the set of (random) exceptional directions for which uniqueness or coalescence fails. We study these directions in the context of two random geodesics trees: one formed by the union of all geodesics starting at a given base point, and the other formed by the union of all semi-infinite geodesics in a given direction $\xi\in \partial G$. We show that, under mild conditions, the set of exceptional directions almost surely has a strictly smaller Hausdorff dimension than the boundary, and hence has measure zero with respect to the Patterson-Sullivan measure. We also establish an upper bound on the maximum number of disjoint geodesics in the same direction. For groups that are not virtually free, we show that almost surely exceptional directions exist and are dense in $\partial G$. When the topological dimension of $\partial G$ is greater than one, we establish the existence of uncountably many exceptional directions. When the topological dimension of $\partial G$ is $n$, we prove the existence of directions $\xi$ with at least $(n+1)$ disjoint geodesics. Our results hinge on deep facts about hyperbolic groups. En route, we also establish facts about the structure of random bigeodesics that substantially strengthen prior results.</description>

      <title>GeLoRA: Geometric Adaptive Ranks For Efficient LoRA Fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is computationally intensive because it requires updating all parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) improves efficiency by modifying only a subset of weights but introduces a trade-off between expressivity and computational cost: lower ranks reduce resources but limit expressiveness, while higher ranks enhance expressivity at increased cost. Despite recent advances in adaptive LoRA techniques, existing methods fail to provide a theoretical basis for optimizing the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We propose Geometric Low-Rank Adaptation (GeLoRA), a novel framework that computes the intrinsic dimensionality of hidden state representations to adaptively select LoRA ranks. We demonstrate that the intrinsic dimension provides a lower bound for the optimal rank of LoRA matrices, allowing for a principled selection that balances efficiency and expressivity. GeLoRA dynamically adjusts the rank for each layer based on the intrinsic dimensionality of its input and output representations, recognizing that not all model parameters equally impact fine-tuning. Empirical validation on multiple tasks shows that GeLoRA consistently outperforms recent baselines within the same parameter budget.</description>
