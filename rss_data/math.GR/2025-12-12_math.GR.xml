      <title>Flat groups of automorphisms of totally disconnected, locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group, $\fl{H}$, of automorphisms of a totally disconnected locally compact group, $G$, is flat if there is a compact open $U\leq G$ such that the index $[\alpha(U):U\cap \alpha(U)]$ is mininimized for every $\alpha\in\fl{H}$. The stabilizer of $U$ in $\fl{H}$ is a normal subgroup, $\fl{H}_u$; the quotient $\fl{H}/\fl{H}_u$ is a free abelian group; and the rank of $\fl{H}$ is the rank of this free abelian group. Each singly generated group $\langle\alpha\rangle$ is flat and has rank either $0$ or $1$. Higher rank groups may be seen in Lie groups over local fields and automorphism groups of buildings.
  Flat groups of automorphisms exhibit many of the features of these special examples, including analogues of roots and a factoring of $U$ into analogues of root subgroups. New proofs of improved versions of these results are presented here.</description>

      <title>HNN extensions and embedding theorems for groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Higman-Neumann-Neumann (HNN) paper of 1949 is a landmark of group theory in the twentieth century. The proof of its main theorem covers less than a page and uses only pre-existing technology, but the construction that it introduced -- the HNN extension -- quickly became one of the principal tools of combinatorial group theory, widely used to build new groups and to describe enlightening decompositions of existing groups. In this article, we shall describe the contents of the HNN paper, and then discuss some of the important developments that followed in its wake, leading up to the central role that HNN extensions play in the Bass--Serre theory of groups acting on trees.</description>

      <title>Small palindromic lengths in free groups and word equations with antimorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The palindromic length of a finite word $w$ is defined as the minimal number of palindromes such that their product is $w$. Clearly, this function may take different values depending on if we consider $w$ as an element a free semigroup or of a free group: for example, in the free semigroup, the palindromic length of $abca$ is 4 (here every letter is a palindrome), and in the free group, it is 3 since $abca=(aba)(a^{-1}a^{-1})(aca)$.
  In free semigroups, the palindromic length can clearly be computed, and there are fast algorithms for that. In free groups, the question is trickier. In this paper, we characterize words in the free group whose palindromic length is 2 and 3.</description>

      <title>The effective Chen ranks conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Koszul modules and their associated resonance schemes are objects appearing in a variety of contexts in algebraic geometry, topology, and combinatorics. We present a proof of an effective version of the Chen ranks conjecture describing the Hilbert function of any Koszul module verifying natural conditions inspired by geometry. We give applications to hyperplane arrangements, describing in a uniform effective manner the Chen ranks of the fundamental group of the complement of every arrangement whose projective resonance is reduced. Finally, we formulate a sharp generic vanishing conjecture for Koszul modules and present a parallel between this statement and the Prym--Green Conjecture on syzygies of general Prym canonical curves.</description>

      <title>The bicorn curves on closed surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on using the theory of bicorn curves in the context of closed surfaces to understand hyperbolic phenomena of the curve graphs of those surfaces. We prove that the curve graph of any closed surface is 15-hyperbolic with one exception. Furthermore, we provide significantly tighter bounds for the bounded geodesic image theorem, originally proven by Masur--Minsky.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous actions on cones, joins, and $n$-universal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that locally countably-compact Hausdorff topological groups $\mathbb{G}$ act continuously on their iterated joins $E_n\mathbb{G}:=\mathbb{G}^{*(n+1)}$ (the total spaces of the Milnor-model $n$-universal $\mathbb{G}$-bundles), and the converse holds under the assumption that $\mathbb{G}$ is first-countable. In the latter case other mutually equivalent conditions provide characterizations of local countable compactness: the fact that $\mathbb{G}$ acts continuously on its first self-join $E_1\mathbb{G}$, or on its cone $\mathcal{C}\mathbb{G}$, or the coincidence of the product and quotient topologies on $\mathbb{G}\times \mathcal{C}X$ for all spaces $X$ or, equivalently, for the discrete countably-infinite $X:=\aleph_0$. These can all be regarded as weakened versions of $\mathbb{G}$'s exponentiability, all to the effect that $\mathbb{G}\times -$ preserves certain colimit shapes in the category of topological spaces; the results thus extend the equivalence (under the separation assumption) between local compactness and exponentiability.</description>

      <title>Finite groups and arc-transitive maps of square-free Euler characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A characterization is completed for finite groups acting arc-transitively on maps with square-free Euler characteristic, associated with infinite families of regular maps of square-free Euler characteristic presented. This is based on a classification of finite groups of which each Sylow subgroup has a cyclic or dihedral subgroup of prime index.</description>

      <title>Random Lie bracket on $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbf{F}_p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random walk on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbf{F}_p)$ where new elements are produced by randomly applying adjoint operators of two generators. Focusing on the generic case where the generators are selected at random, we analyze the limiting distribution of the random walk and the speed at which it converges to this distribution. These questions reduce to the study of a random walk on a cyclic group. We show that, with high probability, the walk exhibits a pre-cutoff phenomenon after roughly $p$ steps. Notably, the limiting distribution need not be uniform and it depends on the prime divisors of $p-1$. Furthermore, we prove that by incorporating a simple random twist into the walk, we can embed a well-known affine random walk on $\mathbf{F}_p$ into the modified random Lie bracket, allowing us to show that the entire Lie algebra is covered in roughly $\log p$ steps in the generic case.</description>
