      <title>Mapping the gender attrition gap in academic psychology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although more women than men enter social science disciplines, they are underrepresented at senior levels. To investigate this leaky pipeline, this study analyzed the career trajectories of 78,216 psychology researchers using large-scale bibliometric data. Despite overall constituting over 60\% of these researchers, women experienced consistently higher attrition rates than men, particularly in the early years following their first publication. Academic performance, particularly first-authored publications, was strongly associated with early-career retention -- more so than collaboration networks or institutional environment. After controlling for gender differences in publication-, collaboration-, and institution-level factors, women remained more likely to leave academia, especially in early-career stages, pointing to persistent barriers that hinder women's academic careers. These findings suggest that in psychology and potentially other social science disciplines, the core challenge lies in retention rather than recruitment, underscoring the need for targeted, early-career interventions to promote long-term gender equity.</description>

      <title>The Price-Pareto growth model of networks with community structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new analytical framework for modelling degree sequences in individual communities of real-world networks, e.g., citations to papers in different fields. Our work is inspired by Price's model and its recent generalisation called 3DSI (three dimensions of scientific impact), which assumes that citations are gained partly accidentally, and to some extent preferentially. Our generalisation is motivated by existing research indicating significant differences between how various scientific disciplines grow, namely, minding different growth ratios, average reference list lengths, and preferential citing tendencies. Extending the 3DSI model to heterogeneous networks with a community structure allows us to devise new analytical formulas for, e.g., citation number inequality and preferentiality measures. We show that the distribution of citations in a community tends to a Pareto type II distribution. We also present analytical formulas for estimating its parameters and Gini's index. The new model is validated on real citation networks.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic goodness-of-fit tests and model selection in valued stochastic blockmodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A valued stochastic blockmodel (SBM) is a general way to view networked data in which nodes are grouped into blocks and links between them are measured by counts or labels. This family allows for varying dyad sampling schemes, thereby including the classical, Poisson, and labeled SBMs, as well as those in which some edge observations are censored. This paper addresses the question of testing goodness-of-fit of such non-Bernoulli SBMs, focusing in particular on finite-sample tests. We derive explicit Markov bases moves necessary to generate samples from reference distributions and define goodness-of-fit statistics for determining model fit, comparable to those in the literature for related model families.
  For the labeled SBM, which includes in particular the censored-edge model, we study the asymptotic behavior of said statistics. One of the main purposes of testing goodness-of-fit of an SBM is to determine whether block membership of the nodes influences network formation. Power and Type 1 error rates are verified on simulated data. Additionally, we discuss the use of asymptotic results in selecting the number of blocks under the latent-block modeling assumption. The method derived for Poisson SBM is applied to ecological networks of host-parasite interactions. Our data analysis conclusions differ in selecting the number of blocks for the species from previous results in the literature.</description>

      <title>T3former: Temporal Graph Classification with Topological Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies. Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.
  We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks. It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph learning.</description>

      <title>Effects of Antivaccine Tweets on COVID-19 Vaccinations, Cases, and Deaths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States and their effectiveness in reducing hospitalizations and mortality during the pandemic, a majority of Americans chose not to be vaccinated during 2021. Recent work shows that vaccine misinformation affects intentions in controlled settings, but does not link it to real-world vaccination rates. Here, we present observational evidence of a causal relationship between exposure to antivaccine content and vaccination rates, and estimate the size of this effect. We present a compartmental epidemic model that includes vaccination, vaccine hesitancy, and exposure to antivaccine content. We fit the model to data to determine that a geographical pattern of exposure to online antivaccine content across US counties explains reduced vaccine uptake in the same counties. We find observational evidence that exposure to antivaccine content on Twitter caused about 14,000 people to refuse vaccination between February and August 2021 in the US, resulting in at least 545 additional cases and 8 additional deaths. This work provides a methodology for linking online speech with offline epidemic outcomes. Our findings should inform social media moderation policy as well as public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Ensemble-Based Semi-Supervised Learning for Illicit Account Detection in Ethereum DeFi Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of smart contracts has enabled the rapid rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on the Ethereum blockchain, offering substantial rewards in financial innovation and inclusivity. This growth, however, is accompanied by significant security risks such as illicit accounts engaged in fraud. Effective detection is further limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the evolving tactics of malicious accounts. To address these challenges with a robust solution for safeguarding the DeFi ecosystem, we propose $\textbf{SLEID}$, a $\textbf{S}$elf-$\textbf{L}$earning $\textbf{E}$nsemble-based $\textbf{I}$llicit account $\textbf{D}$etection framework. SLEID uses an Isolation Forest model for initial outlier detection and a self-training mechanism to iteratively generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled accounts, enhancing detection accuracy. Experiments on 6,903,860 Ethereum transactions with extensive DeFi interaction coverage demonstrate that SLEID significantly outperforms supervised and semi-supervised baselines with $\textbf{+2.56}$ percentage-point precision, comparable recall, and $\textbf{+0.90}$ percentage-point F1 -- particularly for the minority illicit class -- alongside $\textbf{+3.74}$ percentage-points higher accuracy and improvements in PR-AUC, while substantially reducing reliance on labeled data.</description>

      <title>Timeliness, Consensus, and Composition of the Crowd: Community Notes on X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents the first large-scale quantitative analysis of the efficiency of X's Community Notes, a crowdsourced moderation system for identifying and contextualising potentially misleading content. Drawing on over 1.8 million notes, we examine three key dimensions of crowdsourced moderation: participation inequality, consensus formation, and timeliness. Despite the system's goal of collective moderation, we find substantial concentration effect, with the top 10% of contributors producing 58% of all notes (Gini Coefficient = 0.68). The observed consensus is rare-only 11.5% of notes reach agreement on publication, while 69% of posts receive conflicting classifications. A majority of noted posts (approximately 68%) are annotated as "Note Not Needed", reflecting the repurposing of the platform for debate rather than moderation. We found that such posts are paradoxically more likely to yield published notes (OR = 3.12). Temporal analyses show that the notes, on average, are published 65.7 hours after the original post, with longer delays significantly reducing the likelihood of consensus. These results portray Community Notes as a stratified, deliberative system dominated by a small contributor elite, marked by persistent dissensus, and constrained by timeliness. We conclude this study by outlining design strategies to promote equity, faster consensus, and epistemic reliability in community-based moderation.</description>

      <title>Metrics for Assessing Inclusivity and Empowerment of People for Supporting the Design of Inclusive Product Lifecycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design of an inclusive product lifecycle is important for empowering stakeholders through their meaningful inclusion in lifecycle processes. To achieve this, the inclusion of stakeholders must be structured in a way that supports their empowerment. Inclusivity addresses the lifecycle context to improve how diverse stakeholders are included across phases, supporting their empowerment. This study aims to build on current inclusive design approaches, which often focus on empowering users through the use of products. It proposes inclusive lifecycle processes as a way to empower a wider range of stakeholders for sustainable development. We apply a novel framework to real-life case studies from the literature to identify the dimensions of empowerment and inclusivity. By analysing the relationships between these dimensions, we propose specific metrics that show strong causal connections. These metrics allow measurable outcomes to support the fair development of stakeholders. Measuring inclusivity and empowerment can serve as a foundation for supporting sustainability, dignity, well-being, and fair stakeholder development, which are explored further in Part 2 and Part 3 of this study. This study contributes to design science by expanding the understanding of inclusive design through stakeholder inclusion in lifecycle phases and by shifting the focus from product to process design.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Quadratic Penalty Method for a Class of Graph Clustering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02187v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community-based graph clustering is one of the most popular topics in the analysis of complex social networks. This type of clustering involves grouping vertices that are considered to share more connections, whereas vertices in different groups share fewer connections. A successful clustering result forms densely connected induced subgraphs. This paper studies a specific form of graph clustering problems that can be formulated as semi-assignment problems, where the objective function exhibits block properties. We reformulate these problems as sparse-constrained optimization problems and relax them to continuous optimization models. We then apply the quadratic penalty method and the quadratic penalty regularized method to the relaxation problem, respectively. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that both methods effectively solve graph clustering tasks for both synthetic and real-world network datasets. For small-scale problems, the quadratic penalty regularized method demonstrates greater efficiency, whereas the quadratic penalty method proves more suitable for large-scale cases.</description>
