      <title>ouladFormat R package: Preparing the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset for analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08366v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysing educational data sets is fundamental to many fields of research focusing on improving student learning. However, large educational data sets are complex and can involve intensive preprocessing. These obstacles can be overcome through the development of educational tools which simplifies the preprocessing stages of analysis. The Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), available online, contains data from 32,593 students across 22 module presentations at the Open University. This paper introduces the R software package ouladFormat; which loads and formats the OULAD for data analysis. The paper summarizes the ouladFormat R package and explains the different functions within the package. In addition, two case studies are provided which discuss how the OULAD and ouladFormat R package could be used when preparing for an educational study, and in the early identification of at-risk students. The package increases the accessibility of the OULAD for researchers, practitioners, and educators, and supports reproducibility and comparability of educational studies.</description>

      <title>Continuation methods as a tool for parameter inference in electrophysiology modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameterizing mathematical models of biological systems often requires fitting to stable periodic data. In cardiac electrophysiology this typically requires converging to a stable action potential through long simulations. We explore this problem through the theory of dynamical systems, bifurcation analysis and continuation methods; under which a converged action potential is a stable limit cycle. Various attempts have been made to improve the efficiency of identifying these limit cycles, with limited success. We demonstrate that continuation methods can more efficiently infer the converged action potential as proposed model parameter sets change during optimization or inference routines. In an example electrophysiology model this reduces parameter inference computation time by 70%. We also discuss theoretical considerations and limitations of continuation method use in place of time-consuming model simulations. The application of continuation methods allows more robust optimization by making extra runs from multiple starting locations computationally tractable, and facilitates the application of inference methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo to gain more information on the plausible parameter space.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Parametric Bayesian Spatial Model for Rainfall Events in Geographically Complex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental phenomena are influenced by complex interactions among various factors. For instance, the amount of rainfall measured at different stations within a given area is shaped by atmospheric conditions, orography, and physics of water processes. Motivated by the need to analyze rainfall across complex spatial locations, we propose a flexible Bayesian semi-parametric model for spatially distributed data. This method effectively accounts for spatial correlation while incorporating dependencies on geographical characteristics in a highly flexible manner. Indeed, using latent Gaussian processes, indexed by spatial coordinates and topographical features, the model integrates spatial dependencies and environmental characteristics within a nonparametric framework. Posterior inference is conducted using an efficient rejection-free Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which eliminates the need for tuning parameter calibration, ensuring smoother and more reliable estimation. The model's flexibility is evaluated through a series of simulation studies, involving different rainfall and spatial correlation scenarios, to demonstrate its robustness across various conditions. We then apply the model to a large dataset of rainfall events collected from the Italian regions of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige, these areas are known for their complex orography and diverse meteorological drivers. By analyzing this data, we generate detailed maps that illustrate the mean and variance of rainfall and rainy days. The method is implemented in a new R package available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Nesterov Acceleration for Ensemble Kalman Inversion and Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) is a derivative-free, particle-based optimization method for solving inverse problems. It can be shown that EKI approximates a gradient flow, which allows the application of methods for accelerating gradient descent. Here, we show that Nesterov acceleration is effective in speeding up the reduction of the EKI cost function on a variety of inverse problems. We also implement Nesterov acceleration for two EKI variants, unscented Kalman inversion and ensemble transform Kalman inversion. Our specific implementation takes the form of a particle-level nudge that is demonstrably simple to couple in a black-box fashion with any existing EKI variant algorithms, comes with no additional computational expense, and with no additional tuning hyperparameters. This work shows a pathway for future research to translate advances in gradient-based optimization into advances in gradient-free Kalman optimization.</description>
