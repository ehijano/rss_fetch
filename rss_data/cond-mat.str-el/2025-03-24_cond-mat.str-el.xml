      <title>Finite-time scaling with two characteristic time scales: Driven critical dynamics with emergent symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical points with emergent symmetry exhibit intriguing scaling properties induced by two divergent length scales, attracting extensive investigations recently. We study the driven critical dynamics in a three-dimensional $q$-state clock model, in which the ordered phase breaks the $Z_q$ discrete symmetry, while an emergent $U(1)$ symmetry appears at the critical point. By increasing the temperature at a finite velocity $v$ to traverse the critical point from the ordered phase, we uncover rich dynamic scaling properties beyond the celebrated Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our findings reveal the existence of two finite-time scaling (FTS) regions, characterized by two driving-induced time scales $\zeta_d\propto v^{-z/r}$ and $\zeta_d'\propto v^{-z/r'}$, respectively. Here $z$ is the dynamic exponent, $r$ is the usual critical exponent of $v$, and $r'$ represents an additional critical exponent of $v$ associated with the dangerously irrelevant scaling variable. While the square of the order parameter $M^2$ obeys the usual FTS form, the angular order parameter $\phi_q$ shows remarkably distinct scaling behaviors controlled by both FTS regions. For small $v$, $\phi_q$ is dominated by the time scale $\zeta_d$, whereas for large $v$, $\phi_q$ is governed by the second time scale $\zeta_d'$. We verify the universality of these scaling properties in models with both isotropic and anisotropic couplings. Our theoretical insights provide a promising foundation for further experimental investigations in the hexagonal RMnO$_3$ (R=rare earth) materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Final report for a Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Eigenestelle Grant, summarizing work mainly on uniaxial-pressure-dependent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigations of BaFe$_2$As$_2$. We have conducted systematic $^{75}$As NMR experiments in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ under in-situ controlled conditions of uniaxial pressure. We find that the electric field gradient (EFG), spin--lattice relaxation rate T$_1^{-1}$, spin--spin relaxation rate T$_2^{-1}$, and Knight shift $K$ at the As site are sensitive to applied uniaxial pressure. These properties allow us to locally probe the nematic susceptibility, as well as orbital and spin degrees of freedom. Our spectral measurements in the magnetic state provide no evidence for spin reorientation below the T$_N$ for both positive and negative applied uniaxial pressure up to the point of sample failure.</description>

      <title>Giant Self Spin-Valve Effect in the Kagome Helimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome magnets can combine non-trivial band topology and electron correlations, offering a versatile playground for various quantum phenomena. In this work we propose that kagome magnets with frustrated interlayer interactions can intrinsically support a self spin-valve effect, and experimentally confirm this in the kagome helimagnet TmMn$_6$Sn$_6$. Under a magnetic field perpendicular to the helical axis, using magnetic force microscopy we observed stripe domains that stack strictly along the helical axis, which we attribute to the stability loss of the kagome helimagnetic state. Such a domain pattern spontaneously mimics the artificial multilayered structure in traditional spin valves, which, combined with the high spin polarization, leads to a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) ratio over 160%. This discovery opens an avenue to realize inherent spin valves in a variety of quantum magnets, and can hold promise in future spintronics.</description>

      <title>Multi-orbital effects on superconductivity in kagome metals: Parquet renormalization group analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Van Hove singularities (VHSs), where the electronic density of states diverges due to saddle points in the band structure, play a crucial role in enhancing electronic correlations and driving various instabilities. In particular, VHS-induced superconductivity has earned significant attention due to its potential to achieve high transition temperatures and its tendency to favor exotic pairing states beyond conventional electron-phonon mechanisms. Despite extensive research on VHS-driven superconductivity, the multi-orbital effect on such systems remains less explored. Motivated by recent experiments on several kagome metals under doping and pressure [Z.Zhang {\it et al.}, Phys.Rev.B {\bf 103}, 224513 (2021), Y.Sur {\it et al.}, Nat.Commun. {\bf 14}, 3899 (2023)], we explore the effects of multi-orbital physics and strong correlations induced by VHS in the kagome lattice, focusing on their impact on superconductivity. Using parquet renormalization group analysis, we uncover eight distinct superconducting instabilities, characterized by order parameters with mixed orbital degrees of freedom. Among these, we identify a parameter regime where $d$-wave-like orbital-singlet spin-triplet order parameters dominate as the leading instability. The degenerate spin-triplet states in this regime are capable of breaking time-reversal symmetry, which is a multi-orbital analogue of chiral spin-triplet superconductivity. These findings highlight the interplay between multi-orbital effects on superconductivity and can apply to the kagome metal systems such as $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) family.</description>

      <title>Atomic Origins of Magnetic Anisotropy in Ru-substituted Manganite Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy in complex oxides often originates from the complex interplay of several factors, including crystal structure, spin-orbit coupling, and electronic interactions. Recent studies on Ru-substituted $La_{0.70}Sr_{0.30}MnO_3$ (Ru-LSMO) films demonstrate emerging magnetic and magneto-transport properties, where magnetic anisotropy plays a crucial role. However, the atomic origin and underlying mechanisms of the magnetic anisotropy of this material system remain elusive. This work sheds light on these aspects. Detailed element-specific X-ray magnetic dichroism analysis suggests that Ru single ion anisotropy governs the overall magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the magnetic property of Mn ions changes dramatically due to strong antiferromagnetic coupling between Ru and Mn ions. Our findings clarify the role of Ru single ion anisotropy behind magnetic anisotropy in Ru-LSMO, offering a promising avenue for designing advanced materials with tailored magnetic properties for next generation magnetic and spintronic technologies. As the Curie temperature of these materials is close to room temperature, such tunable magnetic anisotropy holds prospects for functional room-temperature magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Entropy of strongly correlated electrons in a partially filled Landau level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use high-resolution chemical potential measurements to extract the entropy of monolayer and bilayer graphene in the quantum Hall regime via the Maxwell relation $\left.\frac{d\mu}{dT}\right|_N = -\left.\frac{dS}{dN}\right|_T$. Measuring the entropy from $T=300$K down to $T=200$mK, we identify the sequential emergence of quantum Hall ferromagnetism, fractional quantum Hall states (FQH), and various charge orders by comparing the measured entropy in different temperature regimes with theoretical models. At the lowest temperature of $T \approx 200$mK we perform a detailed study of the entropy near even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states in bilayer graphene, and comment on the possible topological origin of the observed excess entropy.</description>

      <title>Designing Non-Relativistic Spin Splitting in Oxide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of atomic distortions in non-relativistic spin splitting in perovskite oxides with Pbnm symmetry. Using LaMnO3 as a representative material, we analyze its non-relativistic spin splitting through a combined phonon and multipolar analysis. Our study provides key insights into how structural distortions and magnetic ordering drive ferroically ordered magnetic multipoles, which, in turn, give rise to non-relativistic spin splitting. Based on these findings, we propose three strategies for engineering non-relativistic spin splitting: modifying the A-site cation size, strain engineering, and electric field control in superlattice structures. Our work establishes a framework for designing non-relativistic spin splitting in the Brillouin zone of oxide perovskites.</description>

      <title>Gate and Carriers tunable Valley Imbalance in Topological Proximitized Rhombohedral Trilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the electronic structure, Fermi surface topology and the emergence of valley imbalance in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) induced by the topological proximity and the electric fields. We show that, a strong proximity strength isolates the unperturbed low energy bands at the charge neutrality and the isolated topological bands show metallic nature under the influence of applied electric fields. Our calculations indicate that valley-resolved metallic states with a finite Chern number $|C| =$3 can appear near charge neutrality for appropriate electric fields and second-nearest-neighbor strengths. The Fermi surface topology of these metallic bands greatly influenced by the applied electric fields and carrier doping. The valley imbalance lead to the dominant carriers of either $e^-$ or $h^+$ Fermi surface pockets and the choice of carriers is subjected to the direction of electric fields. The gate-tunable and carrier-induced valley imbalance in topologically proximated rhombohedral trilayer graphene may have potential applications toward the realization of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of Error Mitigation for Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (EM) is a family of hybrid quantum-classical methods for eliminating or reducing the effect of noise and decoherence on quantum algorithms run on quantum hardware, without applying quantum error correction (EC). While EM has many benefits compared to EC, specifically that it requires no (or little) qubit overhead, this benefit comes with a painful price: EM seems to necessitate an overhead in quantum run time which grows as a (mild) exponent. Accordingly, recent results show that EM alone cannot enable exponential quantum advantages (QAs), for an average variant of the expectation value estimation problem. These works raised concerns regarding the role of EM in the road map towards QAs.
  We aim to demystify the discussion and provide a clear picture of the role of EM in achieving QAs, both in the near and long term. We first propose a clear distinction between finite QA and asymptotic QA, which is crucial to the understanding of the question, and present the notion of circuit volume boost, which we claim is an adequate way to quantify the benefits of EM. Using these notions, we can argue straightforwardly that EM is expected to have a significant role in achieving QAs. Specifically, that EM is likely to be the first error reduction method for useful finite QAs, before EC; that the first such QAs are expected to be achieved using EM in the very near future; and that EM is expected to maintain its important role in quantum computation even when EC will be routinely used - for as long as high-quality qubits remain a scarce resource.</description>

Abstract: Free electrons hopping on hyperbolic lattices embedded on a negatively curved space can foster (a) Dirac liquids, (b) Fermi liquids, and (c) flat bands, respectively characterized by a vanishing, constant, and divergent density of states near the half filling. From numerical self-consistent mean-field Hartree analyses, we show that nearest-neighbor Coulomb and on-site Hubbard repulsions respectively give rise to charge-density-wave and antiferromagnetic orders featuring staggered patterns of average electronic density and magnetization in all these systems, when the hyperbolic tessellation is accomplished by periodic arrangements of even $p$-gons. Both quantum orders dynamically open mass gaps near the charge neutrality point via spontaneous symmetry breaking. Only on hyperbolic Dirac materials these orderings take place via quantum phase transitions (QPTs) beyond critical interactions, which however decrease with increasing curvature, showcasing curvature-induced weak-coupling QPTs. We present scaling of these masses with the corresponding interaction strengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin Coulomb drag effect, arising from the exchange of momentum between electrons of opposite spins, plays a crucial role in the spin transport of interacting electron systems and can be characterized by the exchange-correlation (XC) kernel in the spin channel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,\omega)$. Using the state-of-the-art Variational Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach, we compute the Matsubara-frequency-resolved spin XC kernel $K_{\rm XC}^-(q,i\omega_n)$ for the three-dimensional uniform electron gas at sufficiently low temperatures with high precision. In the long-wavelength limit, we identified a singular behavior of the form $A(i\omega_n)/q^2$, confirming the theoretically predicted ultranonlocal behavior associated with spin Coulomb drag. Analysis of this structure in the low frequency region enables precise determination of two crucial parameters characterizing the spin Coulomb drag effect: the spin mass enhancement factor and spin diffusion relaxation time. We observe a significant trend of increasing enhancement of the spin mass factor with decreasing electron density, and provide clear evidence for the suppression of spin diffusion at low temperatures. These quantitative findings advance our understanding of Coulomb interaction effects on spin transport and provide essential parameters for time-dependent density functional theory and spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent planar thermal Hall effect by quasi-ballistic phonons in black phosphorus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the phonon thermal Hall effect in insulators is a matter of ongoing debate. The large amplitude of the signal in an elemental non-magnetic solid, such as black phosphorus (BP), calls for a minimal mechanism not invoking the spin degree of freedom. Here, we show that a longitudinal heat flow generates a transverse temperature gradient in BP even when the magnetic field, the heat current and the thermal gradient lie in the same plane. The phonon mean-free-path is close to the sample thickness. Therefore, it is unlikely that scattering by point-like symmetry-breaking defects play a major role. We show that the angular dependence of the signal can be mapped to the sum of two sinusoidal components each peaking when the magnetic field is parallel to a high symmetry. We propose that anharmonicity may play a major role and argue that the magnetic field can exert a torque on electric dipolar waves traveling with phonons.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Entanglement Cloud after a Boundary Quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement has been extensively used to characterize the structure of strongly correlated many-body systems. Most of these analyses focus on either spatial properties of entanglement or its temporal behavior. Negativity, as an entanglement measure, quantifies entanglement between different non-complementary blocks of a many-body system. Here, we consider a combined spatial-temporal analysis of entanglement negativity in a strongly correlated many-body system to characterize complex formation of correlations through non-equilibrium dynamics of such systems. A bond defect is introduced through a local quench at one of the boundaries of a uniform Heisenberg spin chain. Using negativity and entanglement entropy, computed by the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group, we analyze the extension of entanglement in the model as a function of time. We find that an entanglement cloud is formed, detached from the boundary spin and composed of spins with which it is highly entangled. The cloud travels ballistically in the chain until it reaches the other end where it reflects back and the cycle repeats. The revival dynamics exhibits an intriguing contraction (expansion) of the cloud as it moves away from (towards) the boundary spin.</description>

      <title>Precursor to Quantum Criticality in Ce-Au-Al Quasicrystal Approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare-earth element containing aperiodic quasicrystals and their related periodic approximant crystals can exhibit non-trivial physical properties at low temperatures. Here, we investigate the 1/1 and 2/1 approximant crystal phases of the Ce-Au-Al system by studying the ac-susceptibility and specific heat at low temperatures and in magnetic fields up to 12 T. We find that these systems display signs of quantum criticality similar to the observations in other claimed quantum critical systems, including the related Yb-Au-Al quasicrystal. In particular, the ac-susceptibility at low temperatures shows a diverging behavior $\chi \propto 1/T$ as the temperature decreases as well as cutoff-behavior in magnetic field. Notably, the field dependence of $\chi$ closely resembles that of quantum critical systems. However, the ac-susceptibility both in zero and nonzero magnetic fields can be understood from the splitting of a ground state Kramers doublet of Ce$^{3+}$. The high-temperature Curie-Weiss fit yields an effective magnetic moment of approximately 2.54$\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ per Ce for both approximant systems, which is reduced to $\sim$2.0$\mu_{\mathrm{B}}$ at temperatures below 10 K. The low-temperature specific heat is dominated by the Schottky anomaly originating from the splitting of the Ce$^{3+}$ Kramers doublet, resulting in an entropy of $R\ln 2$ at around 10 K.</description>

      <title>High temperature surface state in Kondo insulator U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resurgence of interest in Kondo insulators has been driven by two major mysteries: the presence of metallic surface states and the observation of quantum oscillations. To further explore these mysteries, it is crucial to investigate another similar system beyond the two existing ones, SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$. Here, we address this by reporting on a Kondo insulator, U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$. Our transport measurements reveal that a surface state emerges below 250 K and dominates transport properties below 150 K, which is well above the temperature scale of SmB$_6$ and YbB$_{12}$. At low temperatures, the surface conductivity is about one order of magnitude higher than the bulk. The robustness of the surface state indicates that it is inherently protected. The similarities and differences between U$_3$Bi$_4$Ni$_3$ and the other two Kondo insulators will provide valuable insights into the nature of metallic surface states in Kondo insulators and their interplay with strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Solving the SU($N$) Orbital Hatsugai-Komoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the physics of the SU($N$) Hubbard model can be realistically simulated with the recent advance of the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. In this approach, the momentum mixing absent from the band Hatsugai-Kohmoto model is included by grouping $n-$Hubbard atoms into a cluster. We take advantage of the rapid convergence of this scheme ($1/n^2$) and show that for $n\approx O(10)$, quantitative agreement with determinantal quantum Monte Carlo arises for the double occupancy and the compressibility across the Mott transition, as well as the spin structure factor in the Mott insulating state. Additional features of this work are that we can obtain low-temperature physics, which could be qualitatively different from its high-temperature counterpart, and dynamical quantities without resorting to analytical continuation, thereby establishing a clear advantage of the orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model over quantum Monte Carlo methodology in the study of strong correlations.</description>

      <title>Absence of barren plateaus and scaling of gradients in the energy optimization of isometric tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00161v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vanishing gradients can pose substantial obstacles for high-dimensional optimization problems. Here we consider energy minimization problems for quantum many-body systems with extensive Hamiltonians and finite-range interactions, which can be studied on classical computers or in the form of variational quantum eigensolvers on quantum computers. Barren plateaus correspond to scenarios where the average amplitude of the energy gradient decreases exponentially with increasing system size. This occurs, for example, for quantum neural networks and for brickwall quantum circuits when the depth increases polynomially in the system size. Here we prove that the variational optimization problems for matrix product states, tree tensor networks, and the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz are free of barren plateaus. The derived scaling properties for the gradient variance provide an analytical guarantee for the trainability of randomly initialized tensor network states (TNS) and motivate certain initialization schemes. In a suitable representation, unitary tensors that parametrize the TNS are sampled according to the uniform Haar measure. We employ a Riemannian formulation of the gradient based optimizations which simplifies the analytical evaluation.</description>

      <title>The classical limit of Quantum Max-Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known in physics that the limit of large quantum spin $S$ should be understood as a semiclassical limit. This raises the question of whether such emergent classicality facilitates the approximation of computationally hard quantum optimization problems, such as the local Hamiltonian problem. We demonstrate this explicitly for spin-$S$ generalizations of Quantum Max-Cut ($\mathrm{QMaxCut}_S$), equivalent to the problem of finding the ground state energy of an arbitrary spin-$S$ quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet ($\mathrm{QHA}_S$). We prove that approximating the value of $\mathrm{QHA}_S$ to inverse polynomial accuracy is QMA-complete for all $S$, extending previous results for $S=1/2$. We also present two distinct families of classical approximation algorithms for $\mathrm{QMaxCut}_S$ based on rounding the output of a semidefinite program to a product of Bloch coherent states. The approximation ratios for both our proposed algorithms strictly increase with $S$ and converge to the Bri\"et-Oliveira-Vallentin approximation ratio $\alpha_{\mathrm{BOV}} \approx 0.956$ from below as $S \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>An analog of topological entanglement entropy for mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the convex-roof extension of quantum conditional mutual information ("co(QCMI)") as a diagnostic of topological order in a mixed state. We focus primarily on topological states subjected to local decoherence, and employ the Levin-Wen scheme to define co(QCMI), so that for a pure state, co(QCMI) equals topological entanglement entropy (TEE). By construction, co(QCMI) is zero if and only if a mixed state can be decomposed as a convex sum of pure states with zero TEE. We show that co(QCMI) is non-increasing with increasing decoherence when Kraus operators are proportional to the product of onsite unitaries. This implies that unlike a pure state transition between a topologically trivial and a non-trivial phase, the long-range entanglement at a decoherence-induced topological phase transition as quantified by co(QCMI) is less than or equal to that in the proximate topological phase. For the 2d toric code decohered by onsite bit/phase-flip noise, we show that co(QCMI) is non-zero below the error-recovery threshold and zero above it. Relatedly, the decohered state cannot be written as a convex sum of short-range entangled pure states below the threshold. We conjecture and provide evidence that in this example, co(QCMI) equals TEE of a recently introduced pure state. In particular, we develop a tensor-assisted Monte Carlo (TMC) computation method to efficiently evaluate the R\'enyi TEE for the aforementioned pure state and provide non-trivial consistency checks for our conjecture. We use TMC to also calculate the universal scaling dimension of the anyon-condensation order parameter at this transition.</description>

      <title>Slow approach to adiabaticity in many-body non-Hermitian systems: the Hatano-Nelson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the near adiabatic dynamics in a non-Hermitian quantum many-body system by investigating a finite-time ramp of the imaginary vector potential in the interacting Hatano-Nelson model. The excess energy, the Loschmidt echo, and the density imbalance are analyzed using bosonization and exact diagonalization. The energy becomes complex valued, despite the instantaneous Hamiltonian having the same real spectrum throughout. The adiabatic limit is approached very slowly through damped oscillations. The decay scales with $\tau^{-1}$ with $\tau$ the ramp duration, while the oscillation period is $2L/v$ with $v$ the Fermi velocity and $L$ the system length. Yet, without the need for auxiliary controls, a shortcut to adiabaticity is found for ramp times commensurate with the period. Our work highlights the intricate interplay of adiabaticity and non-Hermitian many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Intertwined charge and spin instability of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15649v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on nickel-based superconductors has progressed from infinite-layer LaNiO$_2$ to finite-layer La$_{6}$Ni$_{5}$O$_{12}$, and most recently to the Ruddlesden-Popper phase La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, which was found to exhibits onset of superconductivity at $\sim$80\,K under a pressure of $\sim$16\,GPa. Unlike the superconductivity mainly driven by the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in infinite-layer nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and Coulomb interactions, here we analyze the pressure dependent low-energy electronic states of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster, relevant for the bilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals and the atomic Hund's rule exchange, the apical bridging O-$2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We find that the leading configurations contributiong to the cluster ground-states both for nominal valence and also with local charge fluctuations, do not involve occupation of the apical oxygen, instead they favor formation of in-plane Zhang-Rice singlet like states between an O ligand hole and the Ni $3d_{z^2-y^2}$ orbital. We also highlight two possible charge and spin ordered states suggested by our cluster results, that are nearly degenerate at all relevant pressures within our modelling.</description>
