      <title>FD-Bench: A Modular and Fair Benchmark for Data-driven Fluid Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven modeling of fluid dynamics has advanced rapidly with neural PDE solvers, yet a fair and strong benchmark remains fragmented due to the absence of unified PDE datasets and standardized evaluation protocols. Although architectural innovations are abundant, fair assessment is further impeded by the lack of clear disentanglement between spatial, temporal and loss modules. In this paper, we introduce FD-Bench, the first fair, modular, comprehensive and reproducible benchmark for data-driven fluid simulation. FD-Bench systematically evaluates 85 baseline models across 10 representative flow scenarios under a unified experimental setup. It provides four key contributions: (1) a modular design enabling fair comparisons across spatial, temporal, and loss function modules; (2) the first systematic framework for direct comparison with traditional numerical solvers; (3) fine-grained generalization analysis across resolutions, initial conditions, and temporal windows; and (4) a user-friendly, extensible codebase to support future research. Through rigorous empirical studies, FD-Bench establishes the most comprehensive leaderboard to date, resolving long-standing issues in reproducibility and comparability, and laying a foundation for robust evaluation of future data-driven fluid models. The code is open-sourced at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FD-Bench-15BC.</description>

      <title>Solving Euler equations with Multiple Discontinuities via Separation-Transfer Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in scientific computing, they continue to face challenges when solving hydrodynamic problems with multiple discontinuities. In this work, we propose Separation-Transfer Physics Informed Neural Networks (ST-PINNs) to address such problems. By sequentially resolving discontinuities from strong to weak and leveraging transfer learning during training, ST-PINNs significantly reduce the problem complexity and enhance solution accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply a PINNs-based approach to the two-dimensional unsteady planar shock refraction problem, offering new insights into the application of PINNs to complex shock-interface interactions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that ST-PINNs more accurately capture sharp discontinuities and substantially reduce solution errors in hydrodynamic problems involving multiple discontinuities.</description>

      <title>UniFoil: A Universal Dataset of Airfoils in Transitional and Turbulent Regimes for Subsonic and Transonic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present UniFoil, a large publicly available universal airfoil dataset based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations. It contains over 500,000 samples spanning a wide range of Reynolds and Mach numbers, capturing both transitional and fully turbulent flows across incompressible to compressible regimes. UniFoil is designed to support machine learning research in fluid dynamics, particularly for modeling complex aerodynamic phenomena. Most existing datasets are limited to incompressible, fully turbulent flows with smooth field characteristics, overlooking the critical physics of laminar\-turbulent transition and shock\-wave interactions\-features that exhibit strong nonlinearity and sharp gradients. UniFoil addresses this limitation by offering a broad spectrum of realistic flow conditions. Turbulent simulations utilize the Spalart\-Allmaras (SA) model, while transitional flows are modeled using an e^N\-based transition prediction method coupled with the SA model. The dataset includes a comprehensive geometry set comprising over 4,800 natural laminar flow (NLF) airfoils and 30,000 fully turbulent (FT) airfoils, covering a diverse range of airfoil designs relevant to aerospace, wind energy, and marine applications. This dataset is also valuable for scientific machine learning, enabling the development of data-driven models that more accurately capture the transport processes associated with laminar-turbulent transition. UniFoil is freely available under a permissive CC\-BY\-SA license.</description>

      <title>Ill posedness in shallow multi-phase debris flow models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth-averaged systems of equations describing the motion of fluid-sediment mixtures have been widely adopted by scientists in pursuit of models that can predict the paths of dangerous overland flows of debris. As models have become increasingly sophisticated, many have been developed from a multi-phase perspective in which separate, but mutually coupled sets of equations govern the evolution of different components of the mixture. However, this creates the opportunity for the existence of pathological instabilities stemming from resonant interactions between the phases. With reference to the most popular approaches, analyses of two- and three-phase models are performed, which demonstrate that they are more often than not ill posed as initial value problems over physically relevant parameter regimes - an issue which renders them unsuitable for scientific applications. Additionally, a general framework for detecting ill posedness in models with any number of phases is developed. This is used to show that small diffusive terms in the equations for momentum transport, which are sometimes neglected, can reliably eliminate this issue. Conditions are derived for the regularisation of models in this way, but they are typically not met by multi-phase models that feature diffusive terms.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Reynolds number dependence of the chaotic attractor dimension in two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep autoencoder neural networks can generate highly accurate, low-order representations of turbulence. We design a new family of autoencoders which are a combination of a 'dense-block' encoder-decoder structure (Page et al, J. Fluid Mech. 991, 2024), an 'implicit rank minimization' series of linear layers acting on the embeddings (Zeng et al, Mach. Learn. Sci. Tech. 5, 2024) and a full discrete+continuous symmetry reduction. These models are applied to two-dimensional turbulence in Kolmogorov flow for a range of Reynolds numbers $25 \leq Re \leq 400$, and used to estimate the dimension of the chaotic attractor, $d_{\mathcal A}(Re)$. We find that the dimension scales like $\sim Re^{1/3}$ -- much weaker than known bounds on the global attractor which grow like $Re^{4/3}$. In addition, two-dimensional maps of the latent space in our models reveal a rich structure not seen in previous studies, including multiple classes of high-dissipation events at lower $Re$ which guide bursting trajectories. We visualize the embeddings of large numbers of "turbulent" unstable periodic orbits, which the model indicates are distinct (in terms of features) from any flow snapshot in a large turbulent dataset, suggesting their dynamical irrelevance. This is in sharp contrast to their appearance in more traditional low-dimensional projections, in which they appear to lie within the turbulent attractor.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Augmented GraphGPS Framework for the Reconstruction of 3D Riemann Problems from Sparse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In compressible fluid flow, reconstructing shocks, discontinuities, rarefactions, and their interactions from sparse measurements is an important inverse problem with practical applications. Moreover, physics-informed machine learning has recently become an increasingly popular approach for performing reconstructions tasks. In this work we explore a machine learning recipe, known as GraphGPS, for reconstructing canonical compressible flows known as 3D Riemann problems from sparse observations, in a physics-informed manner. The GraphGPS framework combines the benefits of positional encodings, local message-passing of graphs, and global contextual awareness, and we explore the latter two components through an ablation study. Furthermore, we modify the aggregation step of message-passing such that it is aware of shocks and discontinuities, resulting in sharper reconstructions of these features. Additionally, we modify message-passing such that information flows strictly from known nodes only, which results in computational savings, better training convergence, and no degradation of reconstruction accuracy. We also show that the GraphGPS framework outperforms numerous machine learning benchmarks.</description>

      <title>FMEnets: Flow, Material, and Energy networks for non-ideal plug flow reactor design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose FMEnets, a physics-informed machine learning framework for the design and analysis of non-ideal plug flow reactors. FMEnets integrates the fundamental governing equations (Navier-Stokes for fluid flow, material balance for reactive species transport, and energy balance for temperature distribution) into a unified multi-scale network model. The framework is composed of three interconnected sub-networks with independent optimizers that enable both forward and inverse problem-solving. In the forward mode, FMEnets predicts velocity, pressure, species concentrations, and temperature profiles using only inlet and outlet information. In the inverse mode, FMEnets utilizes sparse multi-residence-time measurements to simultaneously infer unknown kinetic parameters and states. FMEnets can be implemented either as FME-PINNs, which employ conventional multilayer perceptrons, or as FME-KANs, based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. Comprehensive ablation studies highlight the critical role of the FMEnets architecture in achieving accurate predictions. Specifically, FME-KANs are more robust to noise than FME-PINNs, although both representations are comparable in accuracy and speed in noise-free conditions. The proposed framework is applied to three different sets of reaction scenarios and is compared with finite element simulations. FMEnets effectively captures the complex interactions, achieving relative errors less than 2.5% for the unknown kinetic parameters. The new network framework not only provides a computationally efficient alternative for reactor design and optimization, but also opens new avenues for integrating empirical correlations, limited and noisy experimental data, and fundamental physical equations to guide reactor design.</description>

      <title>Superstability of micrometer jets surrounded by a polymeric shell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have produced superstable compound liquid microjets with a three-dimensional printed coaxial flow-focusing injector. The aqueous jet core is surrounded by a shell, a few hundred nanometers in thickness, of a low-concentration aqueous solution of a low-molecular-weight polymer. Due to the stabilizing effect of the polymeric shell, the minimum liquid flow rate leading to stable flow-focusing is decreased by one order of magnitude, resulting in much thinner and longer jets. Possible applications of this technique for Serial Femtosecond X-ray Crystallography are discussed.</description>

      <title>Two regimes of dilute turbulent settling suspensions under shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When turbulent flow is laden with negatively buoyant particles, their mean distribution over the direction of gravity can induce stable density gradients that penalize turbulent fluctuations. This effect is studied numerically for shear-driven flow with dilute non-inertial sediment. The turbulent dynamics and sediment transport depend critically on particle settling velocity $v_s$, splitting into two regimes: homogeneous weakly stratified turbulence and flow with developed turbulence atop an intermittent boundary layer. At intermediate $v_s$, neither state can be sustained and the flow laminarizes.</description>

      <title>Enhancing generalizability of machine learning general effective-viscosity turbulence model via tensor basis normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12255v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, the development and study of machine learning turbulence models have become increasingly prevalent. As a critical component of turbulence modeling, the constitutive relationship between the Reynolds stress tensor and the mean flow quantities, modeled using machine learning methods, faces a pressing challenge: the lack of generalizability. To address this issue, we propose a novel tensor basis normalization technique to improve machine learning turbulence models, grounded in the general effective-viscosity hypothesis. In this study, we utilize direct numerical simulation (DNS) results of periodic hill flows as training data to develop a symbolic regression-based turbulence model based on the general effective-viscosity hypothesis. Furthermore, we construct a systematic validation dataset to evaluate the generalizability of our symbolic regression-based turbulence model. This validation set includes periodic hills with different aspect ratios from the training dataset, zero pressure gradient flat plate flows, three-dimensional incompressible flows over a NACA0012 airfoil, and transonic axial compressor rotor flows. These validation cases exhibit significant flow characteristics and geometrical variations, progressively increasing their differences from the training dataset. Such a diverse validation set is a robust benchmark to assess the generalizability of the proposed turbulence model. Finally, we demonstrate that our symbolic regression-based turbulence model performs effectively across validation cases, encompassing various separation features, geometries, and Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>An Implicit Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator for Long-term Predictions of Three-dimensional Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-term prediction of three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flows is one of the most challenging problems for machine learning approaches. Although some existing machine learning approaches such as implicit U-net enhanced Fourier neural operator (IUFNO) have been proven to be capable of achieving stable long-term predictions for turbulent flows, their computational costs are usually high. In this paper, we use the adaptive Fourier neural operator (AFNO) as the backbone to construct a model that can predict 3D turbulence. Furthermore, we employ the implicit iteration to our constructed AFNO and propose the implicit adaptive Fourier neural operator (IAFNO). IAFNO is systematically tested in three types of 3D turbulence, including forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), temporally evolving turbulent mixing layer and turbulent channel flow. The numerical results demonstrate that IAFNO is more accurate and stable than IUFNO and the traditional large-eddy simulation using dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM). Meanwhile, the AFNO model exhibits instability in numerical simulations. Moreover, the training efficiency of IAFNO is 4 times higher than that of IUFNO, and the number of parameters and GPU memory occupation of IAFNO are only 1/80 and 1/3 of IUFNO, respectively in HIT. In other tests, the improvements are slightly lower but still considerable. These improvements mainly come from patching and self-attention in 3D space. Besides, the well-trained IAFNO is significantly faster than the DSM.</description>

      <title>Residual U-Net for accurate and efficient prediction of hemodynamics in two-dimensional asymmetric stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents residual U-Net (U-ResNet), a deep learning surrogate model for predicting steady hemodynamic fields in two-dimensional asymmetric stenotic channels at Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 800. By integrating residual connections with multi-scale feature extraction, U-ResNet achieves exceptional accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Comprehensive evaluation against U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) demonstrates U-ResNet superior performance in capturing sharp hemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. For pressure prediction, U-ResNet achieves a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 1.10%. Similarly, the performance of U-ResNet for wall shear stress (NMAE: 0.56%), velocity (NMAE: 1.06%), and vorticity (NMAE: 0.69%) consistently surpasses alternative architectures. Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates robust generalization to interpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a capability rarely achieved in existing models. From a computational perspective, U-ResNet delivers a 180-fold acceleration over CFD, reducing simulation time from approximately 30 minutes to 10 seconds per case. The model with non-dimensional formulation ensures scalability across vessel sizes and anatomical locations, enhancing its applicability to diverse clinical scenarios. These advances position U-ResNet as a promising auxiliary tool to complement CFD simulations for real-time clinical decision support, treatment planning, and medical device optimization. Future work will focus on extending the framework to three-dimensional geometries and integrating it with patient-specific data.</description>

      <title>The role of interior dynamics and differentiation on the surface and atmosphere of lava planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lava planets are rocky exoplanets that orbit so close to their host star that their day-side is hot enough to melt silicate rock. Their short orbital periods ensure that lava planets are tidally locked into synchronous rotation, with permanent day and night hemispheres. Such asymmetric magma oceans have no analogs in the Solar System and will exhibit novel fluid dynamics.
  Here we report numerical simulations of lava planet interiors showing that solid-liquid fractionation in the planetary interior has a major impact on the compositional structure and evolution of the planet. We explored two styles of dynamics that depend primarily on the interior thermal state : 1) a hot fully molten interior, and 2) a mostly solid interior with a shallow day-side magma ocean.
  In the hot interior scenario, the atmosphere reflects the planet's bulk silicate composition and the night-side crust is gravitationally unstable and constantly replenished. In the cool interior scenario, the distilled atmosphere will lack Na, K and FeO, and the night-side mantle is entirely solid, with a cold surface. These two end-member cases can be distinguished with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, offering an avenue to probe the diversity of terrestrial exoplanet evolutions.</description>

      <title>Formation and evolution of turbulence in convectively unstable internal solitary waves of depression shoaling over gentle slopes in the South China Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shoaling of high-amplitude Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) of depression in the South China Sea (SCS) is examined through large-scale parallel turbulence-resolving high-accuracy/resolution simulations. A select, near-isobath-normal, bathymetric transect of the gentle SCS continental slope is employed together with stratification and current profiles obtained by in-situ measurements. Three simulations of separate ISWs with initial deep-water amplitudes in the range [136m, 150m] leverage a novel wave-tracking capability for a propagation distance of 80km and accurately reproduce key features of in-situ-observed phenomena with significantly higher spatiotemporal resolution. The interplay between convective and shear instability and the associated turbulence formation and evolution, as a function of deep-water ISW amplitude are further studied in-part revealing processes previously not observed in the field. Across all three waves, the convective instability develops in a similar fashion. Heavier water entrained from the wave rear plunges into its interior, giving rise to transient, yet distinct, subsurface vortical structures. Ultimately, a gravity current is triggered which horizontally advances through the wave interior and mixes it down to pycnocline's base. Although the waveform remains distinctly symmetric, Kelvin-Helmholtz billows emerge near the well-mixed ISW trough, disturb the wave's trailing edge and give rise to an active wake. The evolution of the kinetic energy associated with finer-scale perturbations to the ISW-induced velocity field shows two different growth regimes, each dominated by either convective or shear instability. The wake's perturbation kinetic energy is nonlinearly dependent on deep-water wave amplitude and can become a sizable fraction of the kinetic energy of the deep-water ISW.</description>

      <title>Effective description of Taylor dispersion in strongly corrugated channels</title>

Abstract: Taylor dispersion in periodic but highly corrugated channels is studied. Exact analytical expressions for the long-time diffusion constant and drift along the channel are derived to next-to-leading order in the limit of small channel period. Using these results we show how an effective model for Taylor dispersion in tortuous porous media can be framed in terms of dispersion in a uniform channel with absorption/desorption at its surface, an effective slip length for the flow at the surface and an effective, universal, diffusion constant on the surface. This work thus extends the concept of an effective slip-length for hydrodynamics flows to Taylor dispersion by those flows. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical calculations, and present a robust method to understand and upscale the transport properties of flows in porous media.</description>

      <title>Preliminary experimental investigation on the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow experimentally using optical diagnostics in the Shields and Froude parameter space ($0.05{\leq}{\theta}{\leq}0.32$, $0.1{\leq}Fr{\leq}0.4$). Interactions between the turbulent flow and the granular structure give rise to transient erosion-deposition dynamics leading to various types of particle transport. The subaqueous structures in the channel bed evolves due to shear-stress-induced erosion, gravity-driven deposition, and subsequent particle transport. We study the centroid motion and the granular structure shape evolution. At lower end of our ${\theta}-Fr$ parameter space, we observe no erosion and the structure remains at rest. We show that the critical Shields number (${\theta}_{cr}$) is of the order of $0.1$ beyond which erosion starts to occur. At intermediate values of ${\theta}$ and $Fr$ we observe slow erosion, resulting in a rigid body motion of the granular structure without significant shape deformation. Higher values of ${\theta}$ and $Fr$ causes vortex formation at the upstream of the dune resulting in stronger erosion, rapid shape deformation and relatively higher translation velocity of the centroid.</description>
