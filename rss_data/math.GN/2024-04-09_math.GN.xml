      <title>On three-point generalizations of Banach and Edelstein fixed point theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a metric space. Recently in~[1] it was considered a new type of mappings $T\colon X\to X$ which can be characterized as mappings contracting perimeters of triangles. These mappings are defined by the condition based on the mapping of three points of the space instead of two, as it is adopted in many fixed-point theorems. In the present paper we consider so-called $(F,G)$-contracting mappings, which form a more general class of mappings than mappings contracting perimeters of triangles. The fixed-point theorem for these mappings is proved. We prove also a fixed-point theorem for mappings contracting perimeters of triangles in the sense of Edelstein.</description>

      <title>Subfitness in distributive (semi)lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether the set of subfit elements of a distributive semilattice is an ideal. This question was raised by the second author at the BLAST conference in 2022. We show that in general it has a negative solution, however if the semilattice is a lattice, then the solution is positive. This is somewhat unexpected since, as we show, a semilattice is subfit if and only if so is its distributive lattice envelope.</description>
