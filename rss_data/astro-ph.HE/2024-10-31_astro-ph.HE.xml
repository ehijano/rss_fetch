      <title>Fast Transients from Magnetic Disks Around Non-Spinning Collapsar Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most black holes (BHs) formed in collapsing stars have low spin, though some are expected to acquire a magnetic accretion disk during the collapse. While such BH disks can launch magnetically driven winds, their physics and observational signatures have remained unexplored. We present global 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of collapsing stars that form slowly spinning BHs with accretion disks. As the disk transitions to a magnetically arrested state, it drives mildly relativistic, wobbling, collimated magnetic outflows through two mechanisms: steady outflows along vertical magnetic field lines (''Blandford-Payne jets'') and magnetic flux eruptions. With an isotropic-equivalent energy of $E_{\rm iso}\approx10^{52}\,{\rm erg}$, exceeding that of relativistic jets from BHs with spin $a\lesssim 0.25$, the disk outflows unbind the star, ultimately capping the final BH mass at $ M_{\rm BH} \approx 4\,M_\odot$. Once the outflows emerge from the star, they produce mildly relativistic shock breakout, cooling, and $^{56}{\rm Ni}$-decay emission. Our cooling emission estimates suggest a bright near-ultraviolet and optical signal at absolute magnitude $M_{\rm AB}\approx-16$ lasting for several days. This indicates that disk winds could be responsible for the first peak in the double-peaked light curves observed in Type Ib/c supernovae (SNe) or power another class of transients. The detection rate in the upcoming Rubin Observatory and ULTRASAT/UVEX will enable us to differentiate between competing models for the origin of the first SN peak and provide constraints on the physics and formation rate of accretion disks in core-collapse SNe.</description>

      <title>The Influence of a Shock on the Nucleosynthesis Developing during the Explosion of a Low-Mass Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pattern of nucleosynthesis during the explosion of a low-mass neutron star formed in a close binary system in the stripping scenario is considered. In the scenario considered the shock arising during the explosion is shown to strongly heat the expanding neutron star matter. The heavy nuclei produced at the preceding stage of nucleosynthesis are partially destroyed as a result of a sharp increase in the role of photonuclear reactions. It is shown that even short-term heating of the matter by the shock can exert a noticeable influence on the results of the synthesis of elements in the r-process in the inner crust matter, while explosive nucleosynthesis gives rise to new elements in the outer crust matter with mass numbers A from 50 to 130.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength study of OT 081: broadband modelling of a transitional blazar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OT 081 is a well-known, luminous blazar that is remarkably variable in many energy bands. We present the first broadband study of the source which includes very-high-energy (VHE, $E&gt;$100\,GeV) $\gamma$-ray data taken by the MAGIC and H.E.S.S. imaging Cherenkov telescopes. The discovery of VHE $\gamma$-ray emission happened during a high state of $\gamma$-ray activity in July 2016, observed by many instruments from radio to VHE $\gamma$-rays. We identify four states of activity of the source, one of which includes VHE $\gamma$-ray emission. Variability in the VHE domain is found on daily timescales. The intrinsic VHE spectrum can be described by a power-law with index $3.27\pm0.44_{\rm stat}\pm0.15_{\rm sys}$ (MAGIC) and $3.39\pm0.58_{\rm stat}\pm0.64_{\rm sys}$ (H.E.S.S.) in the energy range of 55--300\,GeV and 120--500\,GeV, respectively. The broadband emission cannot be sucessfully reproduced by a simple one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. Instead, an additional external Compton component is required. We test a lepto-hadronic model that reproduces the dataset well and a proton-synchrotron dominated model that requires an extreme proton luminosity. Emission models that are able to successfully represent the data place the emitting region well outside of the Broad Line Region (BLR) to a location at which the radiative environment is dominated by the infrared thermal radiation field of the dusty torus. In the scenario described by this flaring activity, the source appears to be an FSRQ, in contrast with past categorizations. This suggests that the source can be considered to be a transitional blazar, intermediate between BL~Lac and FSRQ objects.</description>

      <title>Magnetic accretion flow explains the hysteresis q-diagram seen in outbursts of black hole low-mass X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole low-mass X-ray binaries undergo quiescence-outburst cycles. During the outbursts, they typically go through a q-shaped pattern in the hardness-intensity diagram (HID), known as the hysteresis q-diagram, while the physical nature is still unknown. We argue that the hysteresis q-diagram can be well explained with a recently proposed magnetized accretion disk model. The model takes into account the saturated magnetic pressure and predicts that the standard Shakura-Sunyaev disk (SSD) has an inner truncation at relatively low accretion rates, filled with an advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) inside. Given a perturbation of accretion rate, the variation of the truncation radius can be derived as a result of thermal equilibrium by comparing the heating and cooling rates. We show that the truncation radius displays a hysteresis effect in response to the variation of mass accretion rate. As a result, the spectral hardness due to competition of the soft SSD and hard ADAF components is also hysteresis along with the rise and decay of the mass accretion rate or source intensity, leading to a q-shaped diagram in the HID.</description>

      <title>A New Particle Pusher with Hadronic Interactions for Modeling Multimessenger Emission from Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose novel numerical schemes based on the Boris method in curved spacetime, incorporating both hadronic and radiative interactions for the first time. Once the proton has lost significant energy due to radiative and hadronic losses, and its gyroradius has decreased below typical scales on which the electromagnetic field varies, we apply a guiding center approximation (GCA). We fundamentally simulate collision processes either with a Monte-Carlo method or, where applicable, as a continuous energy loss, contingent on the local optical depth. To test our algorithm for the first time combining the effects of electromagnetic, gravitational, and radiation fields including hadronic interactions, we simulate highly relativistic protons traveling through various electromagnetic fields and proton backgrounds. We provide unit tests in various spatially dependent electromagnetic and gravitational fields and background photon and proton distributions, comparing the trajectory against analytic results. We propose that our method can be used to analyze hadronic interactions in black hole accretion disks, jets, and coronae to study the neutrino abundance from active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>The high-energy cyclotron line in 2S 1417-624 discovered with Insight-HXMT during the 2018 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a detailed timing and spectral analysis of the X-ray pulsar 2S~1417-624 using the data from Insight-HXMT during the 2018 outburst. The pulse profiles are highly variable with respect to both unabsorbed flux and energy. A double-peaked pulse profile from the low flux evolved to a multi-peaked shape in the high-flux state. The pulse fraction is negatively correlated to the source flux in the range of $\sim$(1--6)$\ \times \ 10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, consistent with \textit{Rossi} X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) studies during the 2009 giant outburst. The energy-resolved pulse profiles around the peak outburst showed a four-peak shape in the low-energy bands and gradually evolved to triple peaks at higher energies. The continuum spectrum is well described by typical phenomenological models, such as the cut-off power law and the power law with high-energy cut-off models. Notably, we discovered high-energy cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) for the first time, which are around 100 keV with a statistical significance of $\sim$7$\sigma$ near the peak luminosity of the outburst. This CRSF line is significantly detected with different continuum models and provides very robust evidence for its presence. Furthermore, pulse-phase-resolved spectroscopy confirmed the presence of the line, whose energy varied from 97 to 107 keV over the pulse phase and appeared to have a maximum value at the narrow peak phase of the profiles.</description>

      <title>Investigating the hadron nature of high-energy photons with PeVatrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy with shower arrays the most discriminating signature of the photon-induced showers against the background of hadron-induced cosmic-ray is the content of muons in the observed events. In the electromagnetic $\gamma$-showers the muon production is mainly due to the photo-production of pions followed by the decay $\pi\to\mu\nu$. In high energy photo-production process the photon exhibits an internal structure which is very similar to that of hadrons. Indeed, photon-hadron interactions can be understood if the physical photon is viewed as a superposition of a bare photon and an accompanying small hadronic component which feels conventional hadronic interactions. Information on photo-production $\gamma$p and $\gamma\gamma$ cross-sections are limited to $\sqrt{s}\leq$ 200 GeV from data collected at HERA. Starting from $E_{lab}\approx$100 TeV the difference between different extrapolations of the cross sections increases to more than 50\% at $E_{lab}\approx$10$^{19}$ eV, with important impact on a number of shower observables and on the selection of the photon-initiated air showers. Recently, the LHAASO experiment opened the PeV-sky to observations detecting 40 PeVatrons in a background-free regime starting from about $E_{lab}\approx$ 100 TeV. This result provides a beam of pure high energy primary photons allowing to measure for the first time the photo-production cross section even at energies not explored yet. The future air shower array SWGO in the Southern Hemisphere, where the existence of Super-Pevatrons emitting photons well above the PeV is expected, could extend the study of the hadron nature of the photons in the PeV region. In this contribution the opportunity for a measurement of the photo-production cross section with air shower arrays is presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Very-high-energy gamma rays from cosmic rays escaping from Galactic black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the cosmic-ray diffusion around a Galactic black hole binary (microquasars) by considering the finite size of the escape region and the continuous cosmic-ray injection. We find that the energy spectrum of escaping cosmic rays in the gamma-ray emission region is described by a broken power law spectrum with one or two spectral breaks even though the total spectrum of escaping cosmic rays is a single power law spectrum. Using the solution for the diffusion equation, we construct a unified picture that explains spatially extended very-high-energy gamma rays from five microquasars observed by HAWC and LHAASO. In the unified picture, all five microquasars have the same energy spectrum of the escaping CRs, $dN/dE \propto E^{-2}$, the same diffusion coefficient, and the same emission region. The hard energy spectrum without the high-energy cutoff supports the idea that the origin of Galactic CRs beyond PeV energies is Galactic black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>A multi-faceted view of the X-ray spectral variability in Seyfert galaxy Ark 120</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing a range of techniques including multi-band light curves, softness ratio analysis, structure functions, rms spectra, cross-correlation functions, and ratios of spectra from different intervals, we present a comprehensive study of the complex X-ray spectral variability in Seyfert 1 galaxy Ark 120, through re-analyzing its six XMM-Newton observations taken between 2003 and 2014. We find a clear ''softer-when-brighter" trend in the 2--10 keV power-law component over long timescales, with this trend being timescale dependent, as it is much weaker on shorter timescales, similar to that previously detected in NGC 4051. Notably, a rare ''harder-when-brighter" trend is observed during one exposure, indicating dynamic changes in the spectral variability behavior of the power-law component. This exceptional exposure, with the spectral variability indeed marked by a power-law pivoting at an unusually low energy of ~ 2 keV, suggests intricate variations in the thermal Comptonization processes within the corona. Furthermore, when the data below 2 keV are included, we identify that the soft excess component adds significant complexity to the spectral variability, such as evidenced by a transition from ''harder-when-brighter'' to ''softer-when-brighter'' during another single exposure. Such extra complexity arises because the variability of the soft excess sometimes follows and sometimes does not follow the changes in the power-law component. Our findings underscore the necessity of applying multiple analytic techniques to fully capture the multifaceted spectral variability of AGNs.</description>

      <title>Insights from the first flaring activity of a high-synchrotron-peaked blazar with X-ray polarization and VHE gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a flaring activity of the HSP Mrk421 that was characterized from radio to very-high-energy (VHE; E $&gt;0.1$TeV) gamma rays with MAGIC, Fermi-LAT, Swift, XMM-Newton and several optical and radio telescopes. These observations included, for the first time for a gamma-ray flare of a blazar, simultaneous X-ray polarization measurements with IXPE. We find substantial variability in both X-rays and VHE gamma rays throughout the campaign, with the highest VHE flux above 0.2 TeV occurring during the IXPE observing window, and exceeding twice the flux of the Crab Nebula. However, the VHE and X-ray spectra are on average softer, and the correlation between these two bands weaker that those reported in previous flares of Mrk421. IXPE reveals an X-ray polarization degree significantly higher than that at radio and optical frequencies. The X-ray polarization angle varies by $\sim$100$^\circ$ on timescales of days, and the polarization degree changes by more than a factor 4. The highest X-ray polarization degree reaches 26%, around which a X-ray counter-clockwise hysteresis loop is measured with XMM-Newton. It suggests that the X-ray emission comes from particles close to the high-energy cutoff, hence possibly probing an extreme case of the Turbulent Extreme Multi-Zone model. We model the broadband emission with a simplified stratified jet model throughout the flare. The polarization measurements imply an electron distribution in the X-ray emitting region with a very high minimum Lorentz factor, which is expected in electron-ion plasma, as well as a variation of the emitting region size up to a factor of three during the flaring activity. We find no correlation between the fluxes and the evolution of the model parameters, which indicates a stochastic nature of the underlying physical mechanism. Such behaviour would be expected in a highly turbulent electron-ion plasma crossing a shock front.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Long-Term Flaring Events of Blazar PKS 0805-07: A Multi-Wavelength Analysis over the 2009-2023 Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive temporal and spectral study of the FSRQ PKS 0805-07 by using the broadband observations from the Fermi-LAT and Swift-XRT/UVOT instruments over the period MJD 54684-60264. The 3-day binned $\gamma$-ray light curve during the active state, revealed eleven distinct peak structures with the maximum integral flux (E $&gt;$ 100 MeV) reached $(1.56\pm 0.16)\times10^{-6}\, \text{photons cm}^{-2}\, \text{s}^{-1}$ on MJD 59904.5. The shortest observed $\gamma$-ray variability was $2.80\pm 0.77$ days. A correlation analysis between the $\gamma$-ray spectral index and flux indicated the typical trend of hardening when the source is brighter, commonly observed in blazars. We identified a lag of 121 (+27.21, -3.51) days in the spectral index relative to the flux, within the time interval MJD 59582 to 60112. The Anderson-Darling test and histogram-fit rejected the normality of the $\gamma$-ray flux distribution, and instead suggest a log-normal distribution. To gain insight into the underlying physical processes, we extracted broadband spectra from different time periods in the light curve. The spectral energy distribution during various flux states were well-reproduced using synchrotron, synchrotron-self-Compton, and external-Compton emissions from a broken power-law electron distribution. The seed photons required for the external Compton process are from IR region. A comparison of the best-fit physical parameters indicated that the variations in different flux states were primarily associated with an increase in the bulk Lorentz factor and magnetic field from low to high flux states.</description>

      <title>Diffusive shock acceleration of dust grains at supernova remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is a prominent mechanism for energizing charged particles up to very large rigidities at astrophysical collisionless shocks. In addition to ions and electrons, it has been proposed that interstellar dust grains could also be accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration, for instance, at supernova remnants (SNRs). Considering interstellar dust grains of various size and composition, we investigate the possibility of grain acceleration at young SNR shocks (throughout the free expansion and Sedov-Taylor phases) and the maximum energies reached by the accelerated grains. We investigate the potential implications on the abundance of refractory species relative to volatile elements in the cosmic-ray composition. We rely on semi-analytical descriptions of particle acceleration at strong shocks, and on self-similar solutions for the dynamics of SNR shock waves. For simplicity, type Ia thermonuclear SNRs expanding in uniform interstellar medium are considered. We find that the acceleration of dust grains at relativistic speed is possible, up to Lorentz factor of $\sim 10^{2}$, kinetic energy $E_{\rm k}/\text{nuc}\sim 10^2$ GeV/nuc for the smaller grains of size $a\sim 5 \times 10^{-7}$ cm. We find that the subsequent sputtering of grains can produce nuclei with a rigidity sufficient to be injected in the process of diffusive shock acceleration. Such scenario can help naturally account for the overabundance of refractory elements in the Galactic cosmic-ray composition, provided that a fraction $\eta \sim 10^{-3}-10^{-2}$ of dust grains swept up by a SNR are energized through DSA.</description>

      <title>On the origin of multifrequency temporal and spectral variability in Ton 599</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we studied the broadband temporal and spectral properties of the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) Ton 599 and explored the one-zone leptonic model to fit the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED). We collected the long-term data from June 2020 to August 2024 when the source was in a long flaring episode. We used the Bayesian block methodology to identify the various flux states which included three flares. The broadband fractional variability is estimated during two flaring states and in the total light curve. The Fvar distribution with respect to frequency shows a double hump structure similar to broadband SED. The Power spectral density (PSD) shows a pink-noise kind of stochastic variability in the light curve and we do not see any break in the power spectrum suggesting a much longer characteristic time scale is involved in gamma-ray variability. The flux distribution is well-fitted with a double log-normal flux distribution suggesting the variability of non-linear in nature. The gamma-ray, optical, and X-ray emissions were found to be highly correlated with a zero time lag suggesting a co-spatial origin. We used the one-zone leptonic model to reproduce the broad-band spectrum in the energy range from IR to very high-energy gamma-ray. The increase in the magnetic field and the Doppler factor were found to be the main cause for high flux states. The XMM-Newton spectra taken during one of the flaring durations exhibit a signature of black body emission from the accretion disk suggesting a possible disk-jet coupling. This has also been indicated by the gamma-ray flux distribution which shows the distribution as non-linear in nature mostly seen in galactic X-ray binaries or AGN where emission is dominated by the accretion disk. This possibility of disk-jet coupling will be explored in the coming works.</description>

      <title>Subphotospheric Emission from Short Gamma-Ray Bursts. II.~Signatures of Non-Thermal Dissipation in the Multi-Messenger Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) jet with initial magnetization $\sigma_0=150$, propagating through the dynamical ejecta from a binary neutron star merger, we identify regions of energy dissipation driven by magnetic reconnection and collisionless sub-shocks within different scenarios. We solve the transport equations for photons, electrons, protons, neutrinos, and intermediate particles up to the photosphere, accounting for all relevant radiative processes, including electron and proton acceleration, and investigate the potential impact of magnetic reconnection occurring in different regions along the jet. We find the photon spectra undergo non-thermal modifications below the photosphere, observable in both on-axis and off-axis emission directions, as well as across different scenarios of energy dissipation and subsequent particle acceleration. Interestingly, the spectral index of the photon energy distribution can at most vary by $\sim20\%$ across all different dissipation scenarios. Depending on the dissipation mechanism at play, neutrino signatures may accompany the photon signal, pointing to efficient proton acceleration and shedding light on jet physics. Although our findings are based on one jet simulation, they point to a potential universal origin of the non-thermal features of the Band spectrum observed in sGRBs.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of a supermassive black hole binary from its magnetically arrested circumbinary accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merging supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries will likely be surrounded by a circumbinary accretion disk. Close to merger, gravitational radiation-driven inspiral will happen on timescales faster than the effective viscous time at the disk cavity wall, leading to a decoupling of the inner binary dynamics from the surrounding gaseous environment. Here we perform the first simulation of this decoupling process from a magnetically arrested circumbinary accretion disk. In this regime, the central cavity is filled with very strong vertical magnetic flux, regulating accretion onto the binary. Our simulations identify three main stages of this process: (1) Large-scale magnetic flux loss prior to decoupling. (2) Rayleigh-Taylor-driven accretion streams onto the binary during and after decoupling, which can power magnetic tower-like outflows, resembling dual jets. (3) Post merger, the cavity wall becomes unstable and the magnetic flux trapped inside the cavity will get ejected in large coherent outbreak episodes with implications for potential multi-messenger transients to merging SMBH binaries.</description>

      <title>The 10 pc Neighborhood of Habitable Zone Exoplanetary Systems: Threat Assessment from Stellar Encounters &amp; Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The habitability of a planet is influenced by both its parent star and the properties of its local stellar neighborhood. Potential threats to habitability from the local stellar environment mainly arise from two factors: cataclysmic events such as powerful stellar explosions and orbital perturbations induced by close stellar encounters. Among the 4,500+ exoplanet-hosting stars, about 140+ are known to host planets in their habitable zones. In this study, we use \textit{Gaia DR3} data to investigate the 10~pc stellar neighborhood of the 84 habitable zone systems (HZS) closest to the Sun. We assess the possible risks that local stellar environment of these HZS pose to their habitability. In particular, we find that HD~165155 has a high stellar density around it, making it likely to experience at least one flyby encounter within a span of 5~Gyr. We also identified two high-mass stars ($M \geq 8 M_\odot$) as potential progenitors of supernovae, which could threaten the long-term survivability of habitable zone systems HD~48265 and TOI-1227. Further, to quantify the similarity between habitable zone stars and the Sun, as well as their respective 10~pc stellar environments, we employ various astrophysical parameters to define a Solar Similarity Index (SSI) and a Neighborhood Similarity Index (NSI). Our analysis suggests that HD~40307 exhibits the closest resemblance to the solar system, while HD~165155 shows the least resemblance.</description>

      <title>Stellar Expansion or Inflation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While stellar expansion after core-hydrogen exhaustion related to thermal imbalance has been documented for decades, the physical phenomenon of stellar inflation that occurs close to the Eddington limit has only come to the fore in recent years. We aim to elucidate the differences between these physical mechanisms for stellar radius enlargement, especially as additional terms such as `bloated' and `puffed-up' stars have been introduced in the recent massive star literature. We employ single and binary star MESA structure and evolution models for both constant mass, as well as models allowing for the mass to change, due to winds or binary interaction. We find cases that were previously attributed to stellar inflation in fact to be due to stellar expansion. We also highlight that while the opposite effect of expansion is contraction, the removal of an inflated zone should not be referred to as contraction but {\it deflation} as the star is still in thermal balance.</description>

      <title>How black hole activity may influence exoplanetary evolution in our Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An increasing number of exoplanets have been discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, which is also known to harbour a super-massive black hole (Sagittarius A*) at its centre. Here, we investigate how the central black hole (BH) activity may affect the evolution of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Accreting BHs emit high-energy radiation -- extreme ultraviolet and X-rays -- which can lead to XUV photoevaporation of the planetary atmospheres. We evaluate the atmospheric mass-loss using both theoretical estimates of the BH radiative output and observational constraints on the past activity history of Sgr A*. The resulting mass-loss is analysed as a function of the galactocentric distance. For the first time, we compute the exoplanet atmospheric evolution under BH irradiation by explicitly including the temporal evolution of the central luminosity output (i.e. the BH activity history). We obtain that Sgr A* could have a major impact on exoplanets located in the inner region of the Galaxy (e.g. Galactic bulge): a significant fraction of the atmospheric mass can be removed by BH irradiation; and in extreme cases, the initial atmosphere may be completely stripped away. Such mass-loss can have important consequences on the atmospheric chemistry and potential biological evolution. We discuss the physical implications for planetary habitability, and we also briefly consider the case of stellar-mass BHs. Overall, accreting black holes may play a significant role in the evolution of exoplanets in our Galaxy across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Hints of auroral and magnetospheric polarized radio emission from the scallop-shell star 2MASS J05082729$-$2101444</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scallop-shell stars, a recently discovered class of young M dwarfs, show complex optical light curves that are characterized by periodic dips as well as other features that are stable over tens to hundreds of rotation cycles. The origin of these features is not well-understood. 2MASS J05082729$-$2101444 is a $\sim$25 Myr old scallop-shell star that was identified using TESS data; it has a photometric period of 6.73h that has been attributed to rotation. Of the $\sim$50 recently confirmed scallop-shell stars, it is one of the few detected at radio frequencies between 1 and 8 GHz. We observed this rare system with the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope at 575--720 MHz, covering 88% of the photometric period in each of the two observations scheduled almost a month apart in 2023. We detected $\sim$millijansky emission from the target in both epochs, with a significant circular polarization fraction: $|V/I|\sim$20--50%. The 3.5-min phase-folded light curves reveal unique variability in circular polarization, showing an $\sim$hour-long helicity reversal in both epochs, similar in amplitude, length, and (possibly) phase. These results suggest two emission components: The first is a persistent, moderately polarized component possibly ascribable to gyro-synchrotron emission driven by centrifugal breakout events. The second is a highly polarized, short burst-like component, likely due to an electron cyclotron maser (ECM), indicative of auroral emission and potentially responsible for the helicity reversal. To explain this, we discuss the different origins of the plasma responsible for the radio emission, including the possibility that the occulting material is acting as a plasma source. Future coordinated multifrequency radio and optical observations can further constrain the underlying scenario, as well as the magnetic geometry of the system, if we assume an ECM-like auroral emission.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hawking evaporation of black holes formed by dark matter in compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The memory burden effect is an explicit resolution to the information paradox by which an evaporating black hole acquires quantum hair, which then suppresses its rate of mass loss with respect to the semi-classical Hawking rate. We show that this has significant implications for particle dark matter that captures in neutron stars and forms black holes that go on to consume the host star. In particular, we show that constraints on the nucleon scattering cross section and mass of spin-0 and spin-1/2 dark matter would be extended by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic matter pieces together the hyperon puzzle</title>

Abstract: Matter composed of hyperons has been hypothesized to occur in neutron stars at densities slightly above the nuclear saturation density and in many descriptions gives rise to a significant softening in the equation of state (EoS). This softening would be at odds with the constraints from neutron star observations and ab initio nuclear matter computations at low density. This inconsistency is known as the hyperon puzzle. We show that Quarkyonic Matter models, which take into account the quark substructure of baryons, can mitigate the hyperon puzzle. We demonstrate two important consequences of the quark substructure effects. First, the hyperon threshold is shifted to a higher density as neutrons preoccupy the phase space for down quarks, preventing the emergence of hyperons at low energy. Secondly, the softening in the EoS becomes mild even above the hyperon threshold density because only little phase space is available for low-energy hyperons; increasing hyperon density quickly drives hyperons into the relativistic regime. In this work, we illustrate these two effects for a matter composed of charge-neutral baryons, using the ideal dual Quarkyonic (IdylliQ) model for three flavors. This model incorporates the Quarkyonic duality and allows us to manifestly express the quark Pauli blocking constraints in terms of the baryon occupation probability. The extension to neutron star matter is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Possibility of quantum Hall effect in neutron star environment: A chiral model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high baryon density and strong magnetic fields are expected in peripheral collisions in heavy-ion collision experiments, such as the upcoming CBM experiment at FAIR in Germany and NICA in Russia. Such densities are also likely in the core of massive neutron stars, possibly with mixed quark-hadron phases. We employed the chiral effective model to obtain the constituent quark mass in this non-perturbative QCD regime. A quantized version of conductivity and resistivity is found reliable in the quantum domain of low density and high magnetic fields. Landau quantization gives rise to phenomena similar to SdH oscillations and quantum Hall effect in this regime. We have used a density-dependent magnetic field to observe SdH-type oscillations and the possibility of the quantum Hall effect in the interior of neutron stars where the magnetic field varies as a function of the baryon density. Our results indicate the possibility of observing the quantum Hall effect in a neutron star environment as well as in heavy-ion collision of CBM and NICA experiments.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Rapid Hydrogen Disappearance in SN2022crv: Evidence of a Continuum between Type Ib and IIb Supernova Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared observations of SN~2022crv, a stripped envelope supernova in NGC~3054, discovered within 12 hrs of explosion by the Distance Less Than 40 Mpc Survey. We suggest SN~2022crv is a transitional object on the continuum between SNe Ib and SNe IIb. A high-velocity hydrogen feature ($\sim$$-$20,000 -- $-$16,000 $\rm km\,s^{-1}$) was conspicuous in SN~2022crv at early phases, and then quickly disappeared around maximum light. By comparing with hydrodynamic modeling, we find that a hydrogen envelope of $\sim 10^{-3}$ \msun{} can reproduce the behaviour of the hydrogen feature observed in SN~2022crv. The early light curve of SN~2022crv did not show envelope cooling emission, implying that SN~2022crv had a compact progenitor with extremely low amount of hydrogen. The analysis of the nebular spectra shows that SN~2022crv is consistent with the explosion of a He star with a final mass of $\sim$4.5 -- 5.6 \msun{} that has evolved from a $\sim$16 -- 22 \msun{} zero-age main sequence star in a binary system with about 1.0 -- 1.7 \msun{} of oxygen finally synthesized in the core. The high metallicity at the supernova site indicates that the progenitor experienced a strong stellar wind mass loss. In order to retain a small amount of residual hydrogen at such a high metallicity, the initial orbital separation of the binary system is likely larger than $\sim$1000~$\rm R_{\odot}$. The near-infrared spectra of SN~2022crv show a unique absorption feature on the blue side of He I line at $\sim$1.005~$\mu$m. This is the first time that such a feature has been observed in a Type Ib/IIb, and could be due to \ion{Sr}{2}. Further detailed modelling on SN~2022crv can shed light on the progenitor and the origin of the mysterious absorption feature in the near infrared.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Orbital Alignments of Galactic Close White Dwarf Binaries with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the proposed space gravitational wave detector LISA, we will be able to measure the geometrical configurations of $\sim 10^4$ close white dwarf binaries in our Galaxy. The obtained data will be an entirely new resource to examine the randomness of their orbital orientations. Partly motivated by a recent reported on the systematic alignments of bulge planetary nebulae, we discuss the outlook of the orientational analysis with LISA. We find that a quadrupole pattern as small as $\sim 0.05$ can be detected for bulge white dwarf binaries, owing to their large available number. From such a pattern analysis, we might geometrically explore fossil records in our Galaxy billions of years ago.</description>

      <title>A Star Cluster Population of High Mass Black Hole Mergers in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar evolution theories predict a gap in the black hole birth mass spectrum as the result of pair instability processes in the cores of massive stars.This gap, however, is not seen in the binary black hole masses inferred from gravitational wave data. One explanation is that black holes form dynamically in dense star clusters where smaller black holes merge to form more massive black holes, populating the mass gap. We show that this model predicts a distribution of the effective and precessing spin parameters, $\chi_{\rm eff}$ and $\chi_{\rm p}$, within the mass gap that is insensitive to assumptions about black hole natal spins and other astrophysical parameters. We analyze the distribution of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ as a function of primary mass for the black hole binaries in the third gravitational wave transient catalog. We infer the presence of a high-mass and isotropically spinning population of black holes that is consistent with hierarchical formation in dense star clusters and a pair-instability mass gap with a lower edge at $44^{+6}_{-4} M_\odot$. We compute a Bayes factor $\mathcal{B}&gt;10^4$ relative to models that do not allow for a high-mass population with a distinct $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution.</description>

      <title>General relativistic viscous accretion flow around Konoplya-Zhidenko black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of accretion flows around the Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) black hole, which is proposed by deforming the Kerr metric with a single deformation parameter to test the no-hair theorem using gravitational wave observations. The dynamical equations describing the general relativistic viscous accreting flow are solved self-consistently to find the transonic accretion solutions in terms of global constants, such as energy ($E$), angular momentum ($\mathcal{L}$), viscosity parameter ($\alpha$), spin ($a_{k}$), and deformation parameter ($\eta_0$). We obtain five distinct types of accretion solutions (O, A, $\text{A}^{\prime}$, W, and I-types), and observe that those solutions are not unique but rather continue to exist for wide range of parameter spaces in the $\mathcal{L}-E$ plane. Furthermore, we find that the viscous accretion flows can harbor shock waves when the relativistic shock conditions are satisfied. Consequently, the shock-induced global accretion solutions are obtained, and the effect of $\eta_0$ on shock properties, such as shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$) and change in electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) across the shock front are investigated. Moreover, we calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of accretion flow using the relativistic thermal bremsstrahlung emission coefficient and study the modification of SEDs due to the increase of $\eta_0$ for both shock-induced and shock-free solutions. In addition, it has been noticed that the observable quantities, like quasi-periodic oscillation frequency ($\nu_{\rm QPO}$) and bolometric disc luminosity ($L$), are strongly dependent on $\eta_0$. Finally, we phenomenologically show that the KZ black hole is consistent with the high-frequency QPOs, commonly observed in black hole binaries and black hole candidates.</description>

      <title>A splitting method for numerical relativistic magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a novel splitting approach to numerical relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) designed to expand its applicability to the domain of ultra-high magnetisation (high-$\sigma$). In this approach, the electromagnetic field is split into the force-free component and its perturbation due to the plasma inertia. Accordingly, the system of RMHD equations is extended to include the subsystem of force-free degenerate electrodynamics and the subsystem governing the plasma dynamics and the perturbation of the force-free field. The combined system of conservation laws is integrated simultaneously, to which aim various numerical techniques can be used, and the force-free field is recombined with its perturbation at the end of every timestep. To explore the potential of this splitting approach, we combined it with a 3rd-order WENO method, and carried out a variety of 1D and 2D test simulations. The simulations confirm the robustness of the splitting method in the high-$\sigma$ regime, and also show that it remains accurate in the low-$\sigma$ regime, all the way down to $\sigma$ = 0. Thus, the method can be used for simulating complex astrophysical flows involving a wide range of physical parameters. The numerical resistivity of the code obeys a simple ansatz and allows fast magnetic reconnection in the plasmoid-dominated regime. The results of simulations involving thin and long current sheets agree very well with the theory of resistive magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Investigating the consistency of the shape and flux of X-ray reflection spectra in the hard state with an accretion disk reaching close to the black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed spectra from black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs) typically consist of two primary components: multitemperature blackbody (BB) originating from the accretion disk in soft X-ray, and a power-law like component in hard X-ray due to Comptonization of soft photons by the hot corona. Illumination of the disk by the corona gives rise to another key component known as reflection. A fraction of the incident hard X-ray radiation is naturally absorbed and re-emitted as a BB at lower energies, referred to as reprocessed BB. For densities relevant to XRBs and typical ionization values, the reprocessed BB may become significant in the soft X-ray region and should be noticeable in the observed spectra as a consequence of reflection. The absence of any BB component in the low/hard state of BH XRB may not be consistent with reflection of high irradiating flux observed as power-law from appropriately dense disk of XRB. We focus on the low/hard state of the BH XRB MAXI J1820+070. We simultaneously fit the shape and flux of the reflection spectra, allowing us to estimate the correct density and ionization of the slab and, correspondingly, the reprocessed BB. Our fitting suggests that the disk in principle may extend close to the BH and still the reprocessed BB due to disk illumination remains small enough to be consistent with the data as opposed to earlier study. The inner reflection component is highly ionized and its fit is primarily driven by its contribution to the continuum. The reprocessed BB cannot resolve whether the disk is extended close to the BH or not in the hard state. For this specific observation, the flux in inner reflection component turns out to be quite low with respect to outer reflection or power-law. Outflowing slab corona covering the inner region of the disk could be the possible geometry of the source with the underlying disk reaching close to the BH. (shortened)</description>

      <title>Probing the Origin of the Star Formation Excess Discovered by JWST through Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed a larger number of bright galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ than was expected. The origin of this excess is still under debate, although several possibilities have been presented. We propose that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are a powerful probe to explore the origin of the excess and, hence, the star and galaxy formation histories in the early universe. Focusing on the recently launched mission, Einstein Probe (EP), we find that EP can detect several GRBs annually at $z\gtrsim10$, assuming the GRB formation rate calibrated by events at $z\lesssim6$ can be extrapolated. Interestingly, depending on the excess scenarios, the GRB event rate may also show an excess at $z\simeq10$, and its detection will help to discriminate between the scenarios that are otherwise difficult to distinguish. Additionally, we discuss that the puzzling, red-color, compact galaxies discovered by JWST, the so-called ``little red dots'', could host dark GRBs if they are dust-obscured star forming galaxies. We are eager for unbiased follow-up of GRBs and encourage future missions such as HiZ-GUNDAM to explore the early universe.</description>

      <title>Kerr-fully Diving into the Abyss: Analytic Solutions to Plunging Geodesics in Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present closed-form solutions for plunging geodesics in the extended Kerr spacetime using Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. Our solutions directly solve for the dynamics of generic timelike plunges, we also specialise to the case of test particles plunging from a precessing innermost stable circular orbit (ISSO). We find these solutions in the form of elementary and Jacobi elliptic functions parameterized by Mino time. In particular, we demonstrate that solutions for the ISSO case can be determined almost entirely in terms of elementary functions, depending only on the spin parameter of the black hole and the radius of the ISSO. This extends recent work on the case of equatorial plunges from the innermost stable circular orbit. Furthermore, we introduce a new equation that characterizes the radial inflow from the ISSO to the horizon, taking into account the inclination. For ease of application, our results have been implemented in the KerrGeodesics package in the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit.</description>
