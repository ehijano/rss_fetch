      <title>Recursive-ARX for Grid-Edge Fault Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future electrical grids will require new ways to identify faults as inverters are not capable of supplying large fault currents to support existing fault detection methods and because distributed resources may feed faults from the edge of the grid. This paper proposes the use of real-time system identification for online power-system fault detection. Specifically, we implement Recursive ARX (rARX) system identification on a grid-connected inverter. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed rARX method is able to both detect large faults quickly, and distinguish between high-impedance faults and large load increases. These results indicate that rARX grid-edge fault detection is a promising research direction for improving the reliability and safety of modern electric grids.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Approach for Topology Correction in Low Voltage Networks with DERs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a data-driven topology identification and correction approach for low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) combined with a time-based smart meter data selection strategy, aiming to correct outdated recordings and identify the missed recordings. The proposed approach solely relies on voltage magnitude measurements, releasing privacy concerns and measurement burdens. It enables the distribution system operators to identify switch states through supervised learning algorithms, as well as determine user-feeder connections and phase labels of customers by a modified Hierarchical Clustering algorithm. To address the similarity among smart meter (SM) data caused by distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems, a time-based SM data selection strategy is combined with the proposed correlation analysis. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach are validated using modified real-world LVDNs and multiple incomplete SM datasets collected from customers in the Netherlands. The results demonstrate that the time-based SM data selection strategy effectively mitigates their impact on phase identification, and the corrected topology not only improves network observability but also supports network operators in load balancing and PV consumption.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Sensing and Communication Beamforming Design for Low-Altitude Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To empower the low-altitude economy with high-accuracy sensing and high-rate communication, this paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework for aerial-ground networks. In the proposed system, the ground base stations (BSs) cooperatively serve the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are equipped for either joint communication and sensing or sensing-only operations. The BSs employ coordinated beamforming to simultaneously transmit communication and sensing signals, while the UAVs execute their missions. To maximize the weighted sum rate under the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming, receive filtering, and UAV trajectory. The resulting non-convex problem is solved using an alternating optimization framework incorporating semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint design achieves higher communication throughput while ensuring required sensing robustness. Additionally, the sensing SINR threshold and the UAV altitude have a significant impact on the trajectory design, highlighting the necessity of adaptive deployment strategies in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural network-based robust control systems with closed-loop regional incremental ISS and application to MPC design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of output-feedback schemes for systems described by a class of recurrent neural networks. We propose a procedure based on linear matrix inequalities for designing an observer and a static state-feedback controller. The algorithm leverages global and regional incremental input-to-state stability (incremental ISS) and enables the tracking of constant setpoints, ensuring robustness to disturbances and state estimation uncertainty. To address the potential limitations of regional incremental ISS, we introduce an alternative scheme in which the static law is replaced with a tube-based nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) that exploits regional incremental ISS properties. We show that these conditions enable the formulation of a robust NMPC law with guarantees of convergence and recursive feasibility, leading to an enlarged region of attraction. Theoretical results are validated through numerical simulations on the pH-neutralisation process benchmark, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Learning-based safety lifting monitoring system for cranes on construction sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifting on construction sites, as a frequent operation, works still with safety risks, especially for modular integrated construction (MiC) lifting due to its large weight and size, probably leading to accidents, causing damage to the modules, or more critically, posing safety hazards to on-site workers. Aiming to reduce the safety risks in lifting scenarios, we design an automated safe lifting monitoring algorithm pipeline based on learning-based methods, and deploy it on construction sites. This work is potentially to increase the safety and efficiency of MiC lifting process via automation technologies. A dataset is created consisting of 1007 image-point cloud pairs (37 MiC liftings). Advanced object detection models are trained for automated two-dimensional (2D) detection of MiCs and humans. Fusing the 2D detection results with the point cloud information allows accurate determination of the three-dimensional (3D) positions of MiCs and humans. The system is designed to automatically trigger alarms that notify individuals in the MiC lifting danger zone, while providing the crane operator with real-time lifting information and early warnings. The monitoring process minimizes the human intervention and no or less signal men are required on real sites assisted by our system. A quantitative analysis is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithmic pipeline. The pipeline shows promising results in MiC and human perception with the mean distance error of 1.5640 m and 0.7824 m respectively. Furthermore, the developed system successfully executes safety risk monitoring and alarm functionalities during the MiC lifting process with limited manual work on real construction sites.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Strategic Bidding on the Reserve Capacity via a Bi-Level Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources necessitates adequate reserve capacity to maintain power balance. However, in market clearing, power companies with flexible resources may submit strategic bids to maximize profits, potentially compromising system reserves. This paper examines the effects of such strategic behavior by modeling the market as a bi-level problem. The upper level represents a strategic company aiming to maximize profit, while the lower level simulates the system operator clearing the market based on submitted offers. To enable duality-based solution methods, we approximate unit commitments with a continuous reserve capacity calculation. Case studies indicate that, in an imperfectly competitive market, more units are incentivized to operate,enhancing system reserves. However, some units go online mainly for profit, ultimately raising electricity costs for consumers. These findings highlight the importance of market design in managing the trade-off between reserve adequacy and economic efficiency in the presence of strategic bidding behavior.</description>

      <title>Task Allocation of UAVs for Monitoring Missions via Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the optimisation of task allocation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within industrial monitoring missions. The proposed methodology integrates a Genetic Algorithms (GA) with a 2-Opt local search technique to obtain a high-quality solution. Our approach was experimentally validated in an industrial zone to demonstrate its efficacy in real-world scenarios. Also, a Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator for the UAVs team is introduced. Moreover, insights about the correlation between the theoretical cost function and the actual battery consumption and time of flight are deeply analysed. Results show that the considered costs for the optimisation part of the problem closely correlate with real-world data, confirming the practicality of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Identifiability and Maximum Likelihood Estimation for System Identification of Networks of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate identifiability and maximum likelihood estimation for direct system identification of networks of dynamical systems. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for network identifiability in terms of Gr\"obner bases. We show that the maximum likelihood approach is both consistent and efficient, which is in contrast to existing prediction error approaches. Moreover, our approach has wider applicability, i.e., it is applicable whenever network identifiability holds. Finally, we show that we can formulate the maximum likelihood problem without the use of a predictor, which is the key to numerically being able to solve it efficiently.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Intrusion Detection System with a New Approach to Protect the Cybersecurity of Cloud Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cybersecurity is one of the foremost challenges facing the world of cloud computing. Recently, the widespread adoption of smart devices in cloud computing environments that provide Internet-based services has become prevalent. Therefore, it is essential to consider the security threats in these environments. The use of intrusion detection systems can mitigate the vulnerabilities of these systems. Furthermore, hybrid intrusion detection systems can provide better protection compared to conventional intrusion detection systems. These systems manage issues related to complexity, dimensionality, and performance. This research aims to propose a Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (HyIDS) that identifies and mitigates initial threats. The main innovation of this research is the introduction of a new method for hybrid intrusion detection systems (HyIDS). For this purpose, an Energy-Valley Optimizer (EVO) is used to select an optimal feature set, which is then classified using supervised machine learning models. The proposed approach is evaluated using the CIC_DDoS2019, CSE_CIC_DDoS2018, and NSL-KDD datasets. For evaluation and testing, the proposed system has been run for a total of 32 times. The results of the proposed approach are compared with the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO). With the CIC_DDoS2019 dataset, the D_TreeEVO model achieves an accuracy of 99.13% and a detection rate of 98.941%. Furthermore, this result reaches 99.78% for the CSE_CIC_DDoS2018 dataset. In comparison to NSL-KDD, it has an accuracy of 99.50% and a detection rate (DT) of 99.48%. For feature selection, EVO outperforms GWO. The results of this research indicate that EVO yields better results as an optimizer for HyIDS performance.</description>

      <title>Development of an Open-Source Spacecraft Bus for the PULSE-A CubeSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The undergraduate-led Polarization-modUlated Laser Satellite Experiment (PULSE-A) at the University of Chicago seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of circular polarization shift keyed satellite-to-ground laser communication. PULSE-A's low-cost open-source bus serves as the backbone of the mission and has been designed in tandem with the Payload, with design driven by strict requirements for pointing accuracy, component alignment, power demand, and thermal stability. This work presents the design and testing of the PULSE-A bus.
  The spacecraft bus was designed to fill two major needs: (1) to meet the requirements of the PULSE-A mission, and (2) to be easily configurable for future missions that desire enhanced capabilities over other low-cost open-source designs. At its core, the bus features dual BeagleBone Black Industrial compute units, selected for their flight heritage, integrated via a PC/104 header standard. PULSE-A implements Goddard Space Flight Center's core Flight System (cFS), which takes a modular software architecture approach and is built in C. The use of C as the primary language aligns with the expertise of the University of Chicago's Computer Science department, allowing for ease of development by PULSE-A's undergraduate flight software team.
  The CubeSat structure utilizes Gran Systems' 3U frame, modified to accommodate openings for various ports and deployable components. Inside, the avionics stack uses the PC/104 standard quad rails, which terminate in PULSE-A's custom-designed Payload Box that houses all of the Payload components and optical fiber runs. This work also covers the techniques and iterative engineering processes used to develop the thermal control and dissipation mechanisms for the specific requirements, under volume, mass, and temperature-range constraints.</description>

      <title>First experimental demonstration of plasma shape control in a tokamak through Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is proposed to control the plasma shape in the Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV). The proposed controller relies on models obtained by coupling linearized plasma response models, derived from the \texttt{fge} code of the Matlab EQuilibrium toolbox (MEQ) suite, with a state-space description of the core TCV magnetic control system. It optimizes the reference signals fed to this inner control loop in order to achieve the desired plasma shape while also enforcing constraints on the plant outputs. To this end, a suitable Quadratic Programming (QP) problem is formulated and solved in real-time. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is illustrated through a combination of simulations and experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a plasma shape control solution based on MPC has been experimentally tested on a real tokamak.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Cyber Resilience via a Co-Evolutionary Arms Race within a Fortified Digital Twin Sandbox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The convergence of IT and OT has created hyper-connected ICS, exposing critical infrastructure to a new class of adaptive, intelligent adversaries that render static defenses obsolete. Existing security paradigms often fail to address a foundational "Trinity of Trust," comprising the fidelity of the system model, the integrity of synchronizing data, and the resilience of the analytical engine against sophisticated evasion. This paper introduces the ARC framework, a method for achieving analytical resilience through an autonomous, closed-loop hardening process. ARC establishes a perpetual co-evolutionary arms race within the high-fidelity sandbox of a F-SCDT. A DRL agent, the "Red Agent," is formalized and incentivized to autonomously discover stealthy, physically-plausible attack paths that maximize process disruption while evading detection. Concurrently, an ensemble-based "Blue Agent" defender is continuously hardened via adversarial training against the evolving threats discovered by its adversary. This co-evolutionary dynamic forces both agents to become progressively more sophisticated, enabling the system to autonomously probe and patch its own vulnerabilities. Experimental validation on both the TEP and the SWaT testbeds demonstrates the framework's superior performance. A comprehensive ablation study, supported by extensive visualizations including ROC curves and SHAP plots, reveals that the co-evolutionary process itself is responsible for a significant performance increase in detecting novel attacks. By integrating XAI to ensure operator trust and proposing a scalable F-ARC architecture, this work presents ARC not merely as an improvement, but as a necessary paradigm shift toward dynamic, self-improving security for the future of critical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Causal discovery in deterministic discrete LTI-DAE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering pure causes or driver variables in deterministic LTI systems is of vital importance in the data-driven reconstruction of causal networks. A recent work by Kathari and Tangirala, proposed in 2022, formulated the causal discovery method as a constraint identification problem. The constraints are identified using a dynamic iterative PCA (DIPCA)-based approach for dynamical systems corrupted with Gaussian measurement errors. The DIPCA-based method works efficiently for dynamical systems devoid of any algebraic relations. However, several dynamical systems operate under feedback control and/or are coupled with conservation laws, leading to differential-algebraic (DAE) or mixed causal systems. In this work, a method, namely the partition of variables (PoV), for causal discovery in LTI-DAE systems is proposed. This method is superior to the method that was presented by Kathari and Tangirala (2022), as PoV also works for pure dynamical systems, which are devoid of algebraic equations. The proposed method identifies the causal drivers up to a minimal subset. PoV deploys DIPCA to first determine the number of algebraic relations ($n_a$), the number of dynamical relations ($n_d$) and the constraint matrix. Subsequently, the subsets are identified through an admissible partitioning of the constraint matrix by finding the condition number of it. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: The growing use of mobile robots in sectors such as automotive, agriculture, and rescue operations reflects progress in robotics and autonomy. In unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), most research emphasizes visual SLAM, sensor fusion, and path planning. However, applying UAVs to search and rescue missions in disaster zones remains underexplored, especially for autonomous navigation.
  This report develops methods for real-time and secure UAV maneuvering in complex 3D environments, crucial during forest fires. Building upon past research, it focuses on designing navigation algorithms for unfamiliar and hazardous environments, aiming to improve rescue efficiency and safety through UAV-based early warning and rapid response.
  The work unfolds in phases. First, a 2D fusion navigation strategy is explored, initially for mobile robots, enabling safe movement in dynamic settings. This sets the stage for advanced features such as adaptive obstacle handling and decision-making enhancements. Next, a novel 3D reactive navigation strategy is introduced for collision-free movement in forest fire simulations, addressing the unique challenges of UAV operations in such scenarios.
  Finally, the report proposes a unified control approach that integrates UAVs and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) for coordinated rescue missions in forest environments. Each phase presents challenges, proposes control models, and validates them with mathematical and simulation-based evidence. The study offers practical value and academic insights for improving the role of UAVs in natural disaster rescue operations.</description>

      <title>A Visualization Framework for Exploring Multi-Agent-Based Simulations Case Study of an Electric Vehicle Home Charging Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent-based simulations (MABS) of electric vehicle (EV) home charging ecosystems generate large, complex, and stochastic time-series datasets that capture interactions between households, grid infrastructure, and energy markets. These interactions can lead to unexpected system-level events, such as transformer overloads or consumer dissatisfaction, that are difficult to detect and explain through static post-processing. This paper presents a modular, Python-based dashboard framework, built using Dash by Plotly, that enables efficient, multi-level exploration and root-cause analysis of emergent behavior in MABS outputs. The system features three coordinated views (System Overview, System Analysis, and Consumer Analysis), each offering high-resolution visualizations such as time-series plots, spatial heatmaps, and agent-specific drill-down tools. A case study simulating full EV adoption with smart charging in a Danish residential network demonstrates how the dashboard supports rapid identification and contextual explanation of anomalies, including clustered transformer overloads and time-dependent charging failures. The framework facilitates actionable insight generation for researchers and distribution system operators, and its architecture is adaptable to other distributed energy resources and complex energy systems.</description>

      <title>A Decomposition Method for Finite-Time Stabilization of Bilinear Systems with Applications to Parabolic and Hyperbolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of finite-time stabilization for a class of bilinear system. We propose a decomposition-based approach in which the nominal system is split into two subsystems, one of which is inherently finite-time stable without control. This allows the stabilization analysis to focus solely on the remaining subsystem. To ensure the well-posedness of the closed-loop system, we establish sufficient conditions on the system and control operators. The stabilization results are then derived using a suitable Lyapunov function and an observation condition. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through examples involving both parabolic and hyperbolic infinite-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Industrial Energy Disaggregation with Digital Twin-generated Dataset and Efficient Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA) method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Increases Wind Farm Power Production by Enabling Closed-Loop Collaborative Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional wind farm control operates each turbine independently to maximize individual power output. However, coordinated wake steering across the entire farm can substantially increase the combined wind farm energy production. Although dynamic closed-loop control has proven effective in flow control applications, wind farm optimization has relied primarily on static, low-fidelity simulators that ignore critical turbulent flow dynamics. In this work, we present the first reinforcement learning (RL) controller integrated directly with high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES), enabling real-time response to atmospheric turbulence through collaborative, dynamic control strategies. Our RL controller achieves a 4.30% increase in wind farm power output compared to baseline operation, nearly doubling the 2.19% gain from static optimal yaw control obtained through Bayesian optimization. These results establish dynamic flow-responsive control as a transformative approach to wind farm optimization, with direct implications for accelerating renewable energy deployment to net-zero targets.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning and Prompt Engineering of LLMs, for the Creation of Multi-Agent AI for Addressing Sustainable Protein Production Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global demand for sustainable protein sources has accelerated the need for intelligent tools that can rapidly process and synthesise domain-specific scientific knowledge. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework designed to support sustainable protein production research, with an initial focus on microbial protein sources. Our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-oriented system consists of two GPT-based LLM agents: (1) a literature search agent that retrieves relevant scientific literature on microbial protein production for a specified microbial strain, and (2) an information extraction agent that processes the retrieved content to extract relevant biological and chemical information. Two parallel methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean scores of $\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\geq 0.94$) compared to prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with the latter approach. A user interface was developed and published for enabling the use of the multi-agent AI system, alongside preliminary exploration of additional chemical safety-based search capabilities</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Steady-State Learning for Nonlinear Output Feedback Regulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16170v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article addresses the nonadaptive and robust output regulation problem of the general nonlinear output feedback system with error output. The global robust output regulation problem for a class of general output feedback nonlinear systems with an uncertain exosystem and high relative degree can be tackled by constructing a linear generic internal model, provided that a continuous nonlinear mapping exists. Leveraging the proposed nonadaptive framework facilitates the conversion of the nonlinear robust output regulation problem into a robust nonadaptive stabilization formulation for the augmented system endowed with Input-to-State Stable dynamics. This approach removes the need for constructing a specific Lyapunov function with positive semi-definite derivatives and avoids the common assumption of linear parameterization of the nonlinear system. The nonadaptive approach is extended by incorporating the nonparametric learning framework to ensure the feasibility of the nonlinear mapping, which can be tackled using a data-driven method. Moreover, the introduced nonparametric learning framework allows the controlled system to learn the dynamics of the steady-state input behaviour from the signal generated from the internal model with the output error as the feedback. As a result, the nonadaptive/nonparametric approach can be advantageous to guarantee the convergence of the estimation and tracking error even when the underlying controlled system dynamics are complex or poorly understood. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated for a benchmark example: a controlled duffing system and two practical examples: a continuously stirred tank reactor and a continuous bioreactor.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks: a Plug and Play Integration into Power System Dynamic Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-domain simulations are crucial for ensuring power system stability and avoiding critical scenarios that could lead to blackouts. The next-generation power systems require a significant increase in the computational cost and complexity of these simulations due to additional degrees of uncertainty, non-linearity and states. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) have been shown to accelerate single-component simulations by several orders of magnitude. However, their application to current time-domain simulation solvers has been particularly challenging since the system's dynamics depend on multiple components. Using a new training formulation, this paper introduces the first natural step to integrate PINNs into multi-component time-domain simulations. We propose PINNs as an alternative to other classical numerical methods for individual components. Once trained, these neural networks approximate component dynamics more accurately for longer time steps. Formulated as an implicit and consistent method with the transient simulation workflow, PINNs speed up simulation time by significantly increasing the time steps used. For explanation clarity, we demonstrate the training, integration, and simulation framework for several combinations of PINNs and numerical solution methods using the IEEE 9-bus system, although the method applies equally well to any power system size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal cooling that minimises thermal gradients and the average temperature is essential for enhanced battery safety and health. This work presents a new modelling approach for battery cells of different shapes by integrating Chebyshev spectral-Galerkin method and model component decomposition. As a result, a library of reduced-order computationally efficient battery thermal models is obtained, characterised by different numbers of states. These models are validated against a high-fidelity finite element model and are compared with a thermal equivalent circuit (TEC) model under real-world vehicle driving and battery cooling scenarios. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed model with four states can faithfully capture the two-dimensional thermal dynamics, while the model with only one state significantly outperforms the widely-used two-state TEC model in both accuracy and computational efficiency, reducing computation time by 28.7%. Furthermore, our developed models allow for independent control of tab and surface cooling channels, enabling effective thermal performance optimisation. Additionally, the proposed model's versatility and effectiveness are demonstrated through various applications, including the evaluation of different cooling scenarios, closed-loop temperature control, and cell design optimisation.</description>

      <title>Operator Learning for Robust Stabilization of Linear Markov-Jumping Hyperbolic PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of robust stabilization for linear hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with Markov-jumping parameter uncertainty. We consider a 2 x 2 heterogeneous hyperbolic PDE and propose a control law using operator learning and the backstepping method. Specifically, the backstepping kernels used to construct the control law are approximated with neural operators (NO) in order to improve computational efficiency. The key challenge lies in deriving the stability conditions with respect to the Markov-jumping parameter uncertainty and NO approximation errors. The mean-square exponential stability of the stochastic system is achieved through Lyapunov analysis, indicating that the system can be stabilized if the random parameters are sufficiently close to the nominal parameters on average, and NO approximation errors are small enough. The theoretical results are applied to freeway traffic control under stochastic upstream demands and then validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Aggregative games with bilevel structures: Distributed algorithms and convergence analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of distributively seeking the equilibria of aggregative games with bilevel structures is studied. Different from the traditional aggregative games, here the aggregation is determined by the minimizer of a virtual leader's objective function in the inner level, which depends on the actions of the players in the outer level. Moreover, the global objective function of the virtual leader is formed by the sum of some local functions with two arguments, each of which is strongly convex with respect to the second argument. When making decisions, each player in the outer level only has access to a local part of the virtual leader's objective function. To handle this problem, first, we propose a second order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where the Hessian matrices associated with the objective functions of the leader are involved. By the algorithm, players update their actions while cooperatively minimizing the objective function of the virtual leader to estimate the aggregation by communicating with their neighbors via a connected graph. Under mild assumptions on the graph and cost functions, we prove that the actions of players asymptotically converge to the Nash equilibrium point. Then, for the case where the Hessian matrices associated with the objective functions of the virtual leader are not available, we propose a first order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where a distributed two-point estimate strategy is developed to estimate the gradients of players' cost functions in the outer level. Under the same conditions, we prove that the convergence errors of players' actions to the Nash equilibrium point are linear with respect to the estimate parameters. Finally, simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parameter convergence relies on a stringent persistent excitation (PE) condition in adaptive control. Several works have proposed a memory term in the last decade to translate the PE condition to a feasible finite excitation (FE) condition. This work proposes a combined model reference adaptive control for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with an unknown control effectiveness vector. The closed-loop system is exponentially stable under the FE condition. The exponential rate of convergence is independent of the excitation level of the regressor vector and is lower-bounded in terms of the system parameters and user-designed gains. Numerical simulation is illustrated, validating the results obtained with the proposed adaptive control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05403v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a decentralized framework for guaranteeing the small-signal stability of future power systems with grid-forming converters. Our approach leverages dynamic loop-shifting techniques to compensate for the lack of passivity in the network dynamics and establishes decentralized parametric stability certificates, depending on the local device-level controls and incorporating the effects of the network dynamics. By following practical tuning rules, we are able to ensure plug-and-play operation without centralized coordination. Unlike prior works, our approach accommodates coupled frequency and voltage dynamics, incorporates network dynamics, and does not rely on specific network configurations or operating points, offering a general and scalable solution for the integration of power-electronics-based devices into future power systems. We validate our theoretical stability results through numerical case studies in a high-fidelity simulation model.</description>

Abstract: Estimating the parameters of nonlinear block-oriented state-space models from input-output data typically involves solving a highly non-convex optimization problem, which is prone to poor local minima and slow convergence. This paper presents a computationally efficient initialization method for nonlinear linear fractional representation (NL-LFR) models using periodic data. By first inferring the latent signals and subsequently estimating the model parameters, the approach generates initial estimates for use in a later nonlinear optimization step. The proposed method shows robustness against poor local minima, and achieves a twofold error reduction compared to the state-of-the-art on a challenging benchmark dataset.</description>

      <title>Age-of-information minimization under energy harvesting and non-stationary environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on minimizing the age of information for multiple energy harvesting sources that sample data and transmit it to a sink node. At each time, the central scheduler selects one of the sources to probe the quality of its channel to the sink node, and then the assessed channel quality is utilized to determine whether a source will sample and send the packet. For a single source case, we assume that the probed channel quality is known at each time instant, model the problem of AoI minimization as a Markov decision process, and prove the optimal sampling policy threshold structure. We then use this threshold structure and propose an AEC-SW-UCRL2 algorithm to handle unknown and time varying energy harvesting rate and channel statistics, motivated by the popular SWUCRL2 algorithm for non stationary reinforcement learning. This algorithm is applicable when an upper bound is available for the total variation of each of these quantities over a time horizon. Furthermore, in situations where these variation budgets are not accessible, we introduce the AEC-BORL algorithm, motivated by the well known BORL algorithm. For the multiple source case, we demonstrate that the AoI minimization problem can be formulated as a constrained MDP, which can be relaxed using a Lagrange multiplier and decoupled into sub problems across source nodes. We also derive Whittle index based source scheduling policy for probing and an optimal threshold policy for source sampling. We next leverage this Whittle index and threshold structure to develop the WIT-SW-UCRL2 algorithm for unknown time varying energy harvesting rates and channel statistics under their respective variation budgets. Moreover, we also proposed a Whittle index and threshold based bandit over reinforcement learning (WIT-BORL) algorithm for unknown variation budgets.

      <title>Nonlinear Online Optimization for Vehicle-Home-Grid Integration including Household Load Prediction and Battery Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the economic impact of vehicle-home-grid integration, by proposing an online energy management algorithm that optimizes energy flows between an electric vehicle (EV), a household, and the electrical grid. The algorithm leverages vehicle-to-home (V2H) for self-consumption and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) for energy trading, adapting to real-time conditions through a hybrid long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for accurate household load prediction, alongside a comprehensive nonlinear battery degradation model accounting for both cycle and calendar aging. Simulation results reveal significant economic advantages: compared to smart unidirectional charging, the proposed method yields an annual economic benefit of up to EUR 3046.81, despite a modest 1.96% increase in battery degradation. Even under unfavorable market conditions, where V2G energy selling generates no revenue, V2H alone ensures yearly savings of EUR 425.48. A systematic sensitivity analysis investigates how variations in battery capacity, household load, and price ratios affect economic outcomes, confirming the consistent benefits of bidirectional energy exchange. These findings highlight the potential of EVs as active energy nodes, enabling sustainable energy management and cost-effective battery usage in real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Class Stackelberg Games for the Co-Design of Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a co-design problem, encompassing simultaneous design of system infrastructure and control, through a game-theoretical framework. To this end, we propose the co-design problem as a two-layer hierarchical strategic interaction. At the upper layer, a leader (or multiple leaders) determines system design parameters, while at the lower layer, a follower (or multiple followers) optimizes the control strategy. To capture this hierarchy, we propose four novel classes of Stackelberg games that integrate diverse strategic behaviors, including combinations of cooperative and non-cooperative interactions across two different layers. Notably, the leaders' interactions are represented using a normal-form game, whereas the followers' interactions are modeled by different games (dynamic games in discrete time). These distinct game structures result in a Stackelberg game that accommodates different game types per layer, and/or supports heterogeneous strategic behaviors involving cooperation and non-cooperation simultaneously. Learning algorithms using the best-response dynamics are used to solve the game problems when considering a discrete strategic space for the leaders. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through an application to the co-design of the Barcelona drinking water network.</description>

      <title>Followerstopper Revisited: Phase-space Lagrangian Controller for Traffic Decongestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper revisits Followerstopper, a phase-space-based control system that had demonstrated its ability to mitigate emergent traffic jams due to stop-and-go traffic during rush hour in the mixed-autonomy setting. Followerstopper was deployed on an autonomous vehicle. The controller attenuates the emanant traffic waves by regulating its velocity according to the relative distance and velocity of the leader car. While regulating the velocity, the controller also prevents the collision of the ego vehicle with the lead vehicle within the range specified by the controller's design parameter. The controller design is based on a configurable quadratic curve on relative distance-relative velocity phase-space that allows the transition of the regulated velocity from (i) no modification of input, (ii) decelerating to match the leader's velocity (iii) braking to avoid any imminent collision. In this paper, we explore the phase-space properties of Followerstopper and provide a detailed description of a nonlinear control law that regulates the reference input to Followerstopper within the physics-informed boundaries. We also provide a new discussion on the nominal control law that regulates the reference speed to Followerstopper to avoid unrealistic and unsafe acceleration.</description>

      <title>Duality between controllability and observability for target control and estimation in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Output controllability and functional observability are properties that enable, respectively, the control and estimation of part of the state vector. These notions are of utmost importance in applications to high-dimensional systems, such as large-scale networks, in which only a target subset of variables (nodes) is sought to be controlled or estimated. Although the duality between full-state controllability and observability is well established, the characterization of the duality between their generalized counterparts remains an outstanding problem. Here, we establish both the weak and the strong duality between output controllability and functional observability. Specifically, we show that functional observability of a system implies output controllability of a dual system (weak duality), and that under a certain geometric condition the converse holds (strong duality). As an application of the strong duality, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for target control via static feedback. This allow us to establish a separation principle between the design of target controllers and the design of functional observers in closed-loop systems. These results generalize the classical duality and separation principles in modern control theory.</description>

      <title>On the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus tests for functional observability and output controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional observability and output controllability are properties that establish the conditions for the partial estimation and partial control of the system state, respectively. In the special case of full-state observability and controllability, the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) tests provide conditions for the properties to hold based on the system eigenspace. Generalizations of the PBH test have been recently proposed for functional observability and output controllability, but thus far have only been proven valid for diagonalizable systems. Here, we rigorously establish the generalized PBH test for functional observability, extending its validity to a broader class of systems using Jordan decomposition. Likewise, we determine the class of systems under which the generalized PBH test is sufficient and necessary for output controllability. These results have immediate implications for observer and controller design, pole assignment, and optimal placement of sensors and drivers.</description>

      <title>Power-Capping Metric Evaluation for Improving Energy Efficiency in HPC Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With high-performance computing systems now running at exascale, optimizing power-scaling management and resource utilization has become more critical than ever. This paper explores runtime power-capping optimizations that leverage integrated CPU-GPU power management on architectures like the NVIDIA GH200 superchip. We evaluate energy-performance metrics that account for simultaneous CPU and GPU power-capping effects by using two complementary approaches: speedup-energy-delay and a Euclidean distance-based multi-objective optimization method. By targeting a mostly compute-bound exascale science application, the Locally Self-Consistent Multiple Scattering (LSMS), we explore challenging scenarios to identify potential opportunities for energy savings in exascale applications, and we recognize that even modest reductions in energy consumption can have significant overall impacts. Our results highlight how GPU task-specific dynamic power-cap adjustments combined with integrated CPU-GPU power steering can improve the energy utilization of certain GPU tasks, thereby laying the groundwork for future adaptive optimization strategies.</description>
