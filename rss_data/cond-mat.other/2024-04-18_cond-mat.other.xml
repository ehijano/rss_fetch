      <title>Observation of Young's double-slit phenomenon in anti-PT-symmetric electrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few decades, interference has been extensively studied in both the quantum and classical fields, which reveals light volatility and is widely used for high-precision measurements. We have put forward the phenomenon in which the discrete diffraction and interference phenomena, presented by the time-varying voltage of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit model with an anti-PT symmetry (APT) symmetry. To demonstrate Young's double-slit phenomenon in an APT circuit, we initially explore the coupled mode theory (CMT) of voltage in the broken phase, observe discrete diffraction under single excitation and interference under double excitations. Furthermore, we design a phase-shifting circuit to observe the effects of phase difference and distance on discrete interference. Our work combines the effects in optics with condensed matter physics, show the Young's double-slit phenomenon in electrical circuits theoretically and experimentally.</description>

      <title>Hexagonal quasiperiodic tilings as decorations of periodic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry sharing facilitates coherent interfaces which can transition from periodic to quasiperiodic structures. Motivated by the design and construction of such systems, we present hexagonal quasiperiodic tilings with a single edge-length which can be considered as decorations of a periodic lattice. We introduce these tilings by modifying an existing family of golden-mean trigonal and hexagonal tilings, and discuss their properties in terms of this wider family. Then, we show how the vertices of these new systems can be considered as decorations or sublattice sets of a periodic triangular lattice. We conclude by simulating a simple Ising model on one of these decorations, and compare this system to a triangular lattice with random defects.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for the detection of exotic phases in skyrmion phase diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Undoubtedly, machine learning techniques are being increasingly applied to a wide range of situations in the field of condensed matter. Amongst these techniques, unsupervised techniques are especially attractive, since they imply the possibility of extracting information from the data without previous labeling. In this work, we resort to the technique known as anomaly detection to explore potential exotic phases in skyrmion phase diagrams, using two different algorithms: Principal Component Analysis and Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). First, we train these algorithms with an artificial dataset of skyrmion lattices constructed from an analytical parametrization, for different magnetizations, skyrmion lattice orientations, and skyrmion radii. We apply the trained algorithms to a set of snapshots obtained from Monte Carlo simulations for three ferromagnetic skyrmion models: two with in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) in the triangular and kagome lattices, and one with an additional out of plane DMI in the kagome lattice. Then, we compare the root mean square error (RMSE) and the binary cross entropy between the input and output snapshots as a function of the external magnetic field and temperature. We find that the RMSE and its variance in the CAE case may be useful to not only detect exotic low temperature phases, but also to differentiate between the characteristic low temperature orderings of a skyrmion phase diagram (helical, skyrmions and ferromagnetic). Moreover, we apply the skyrmion trained CAE to two antiferromagnetic models in the triangular lattice, one that gives rise to antiferromagnetic skyrmions, and the pure exchange antiferromagnetic case. Despite the predictably larger RMSE, we find that, even in these cases, RMSE is also an indicator of different orderings and the emergence of particular features, such as the well-known pseudo-plateau in the pure exchange case.</description>

      <title>Revealing the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sublattice symmetry on a bipartite lattice is commonly regarded as the chiral symmetry in the AIII class of the tenfold Altland--Zirnbauer classification. Here, we reveal the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry, and show that this assertion holds only if the periodicity of primitive unit cells agrees with that of the sublattice labeling. In cases where the periodicity does not agree, sublattice symmetry is represented as a glide reflection in energy--momentum space, which inverts energy and simultaneously translates some $k$ by $\pi$, leading to substantially different physics. Particularly, it introduces novel constraints on zero modes in semimetals and completely alters the classification table of topological insulators compared to class AIII. Notably, the dimensions corresponding to trivial and nontrivial classifications are switched, and the nontrivial classification becomes $\mathbb{Z}_2$ instead of $\mathbb{Z}$. We have applied these results to several models, including the Hofstadter model both with and without dimerization.</description>
