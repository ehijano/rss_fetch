      <title>Epidemic-induced local awareness behavior inferred from surveys and genetic sequence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavior-disease models suggest that if individuals are aware and take preventive actions when the prevalence of the disease increases among their close contacts, then the pandemic can be contained in a cost-effective way. To measure the true impact of local awareness behavior on epidemic spreading, we propose an efficient approach to identify superspreading events and assign corresponding Event Containment Scores (ECSs) in clinical genetic sequence data. We validate ECS as a measure of local awareness in simulation experiments, and we find that ECS was correlated positively with policy stringency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we observe a temporary drop in ECS during the Omicron wave in most European countries, matching a survey experiment we carried out at the same time. Our findings bring important insight into the field of awareness modeling through the analysis of large-scale genetic sequence data, one of the most promising data sources in epidemics research.</description>

      <title>Balance with Memory in Signed Networks via Mittag-Leffler Matrix Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural balance is an important characteristic of graphs/networks where edges can be positive or negative, with direct impact on the study of real-world complex systems. When a network is not structurally balanced, it is important to know how much balance still exists in it. Although several measures have been proposed to characterize the degree of balance, the use of matrix functions of the signed adjacency matrix emerges as a very promising area of research. Here, we take a step forward to using Mittag-Leffler (ML) matrix functions to quantify the notion of balance of signed networks. We show that the ML balance index can be obtained from first principles on the basis of a nonconservative diffusion dynamic, and that it accounts for the memory of the system about the past, by diminishing the penalization that long cycles typically receive in other matrix functions. Finally, we demonstrate the important information in the ML balance index with both artificial signed networks and real-world networks in various contexts, ranging from biological and ecological to social ones.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Vulnerabilities of the Online Public Square to Adversarial Manipulation Tactics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.06130v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media, seen by some as the modern public square, is vulnerable to manipulation. By controlling inauthentic accounts impersonating humans, malicious actors can amplify disinformation within target communities. The consequences of such operations are difficult to evaluate due to the challenges posed by collecting data and carrying out ethical experiments that would influence online communities. Here we use a social media model that simulates information diffusion in an empirical network to quantify the impacts of several adversarial manipulation tactics on the quality of content. We find that the presence of influential accounts, a hallmark of social media, exacerbates the vulnerabilities of online communities to manipulation. Among the explored tactics that bad actors can employ, infiltrating a community is the most likely to make low-quality content go viral. Such harm can be further compounded by inauthentic agents flooding the network with low-quality, yet appealing content, but is mitigated when bad actors focus on specific targets, such as influential or vulnerable individuals. These insights suggest countermeasures that platforms could employ to increase the resilience of social media users to manipulation.</description>

      <title>Browsing behavior exposes identities on the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How easy is it to uniquely identify a person based solely on their web browsing behavior? Here we show that when people navigate the Web, their online traces produce fingerprints that identify them. Merely the four most visited web domains are enough to identify 95% of the individuals. These digital fingerprints are stable and render high re-identifiability. We demonstrate that we can re-identify 80% of the individuals in separate time slices of data. Such a privacy threat persists even with limited information about individuals' browsing behavior, reinforcing existing concerns around online privacy.</description>
