      <title>Machine learning classification of local environments in molecular crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying local structural motifs and packing patterns of molecular solids is a challenging task for both simulation and experiment. We demonstrate two novel approaches to characterize local environments in different polymorphs of molecular crystals using learning models that employ either flexibly learned or handcrafted molecular representations. In the first case, we follow our earlier work on graph learning in molecular crystals, deploying an atomistic graph convolutional network, combined with molecule-wise aggregation, to enable per-molecule environmental classification. For the second model, we develop a new set of descriptors based on symmetry functions combined with a point-vector representation of the molecules, encoding information about the positions as well as relative orientations of the molecule. We demonstrate very high classification accuracy for both approaches on urea and nicotinamide crystal polymorphs, and practical applications to the analysis of dynamical trajectory data for nanocrystals and solid-solid interfaces. Both architectures are applicable to a wide range of molecules and diverse topologies, providing an essential step in the exploration of complex condensed matter phenomena.</description>

      <title>Gradient bandgap enables &gt;13% efficiency sulfide Kesterite solar cells with open-circuit voltage over 800 mV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfide Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), a nontoxic and low-cost photovoltaic material, has always being facing severe charge recombination and poor carrier transport, resulting in the cell efficiency record stagnating around 11% for years. Gradient bandgap is a promising approach to relieve these issues, however, has not been effectively realized in Kesterite solar cells due to the challenges in controlling the gradient distribution of alloying elements at high temperatures. Herein, targeting at the Cd alloyed CZTS, we propose a pre-crystallization strategy to reduce the intense vertical mass transport and Cd rapid diffusion in the film growth process, thereby realizing front Cd-gradient CZTS absorber. The Cd-gradient CZTS absorber, exhibiting downward bending conduction band structure, has significantly enhanced the minority carrier transport and additionally improved band alignment and interface property of CZTS/CdS heterojunction. Ultimately, we have achieved a champion total-area efficiency of 13.5% (active-area efficiency: 14.1%) in the cell and in particular a high open-circuit voltage of &gt;800 mV. We have also achieved a certified total-area cell efficiency of 13.16%, realizing a substantial step forward for the pure sulfide Kesterite solar cell.</description>

      <title>Optimum surface-passivation schemes for near-surface spin defects in silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-active defects in silicon carbide (SiC) are promising quantum light sources for realizing scalable quantum technologies. In different applications, these photoluminescent defects are often placed in a nanostructured host or close to surfaces in order to enhance the signal from the defects. However, proximity to the surface not only modifies frequencies of the quantum emission from the defect, but also adversely affects their photo-stability, resulting in blinking and/or photobleaching of the defect. These effects can be ameliorated by passivating surfaces with optimal adsorbates. In this work, we explore different passivation schemes using density functional theory-based calculations. We show that a uniform surface passivation with either hydrogen or with mixed hydrogen/hydroxyl groups completely removes surface states from the SiC band gap, restoring the optical properties of the defects.</description>

      <title>First Principles Studies of Stacking Fault Energies in Ternary Magnesium Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnesium (Mg) alloys have emerged as promising materials due to their low density and high strength-to-weight ratio, offering a wide range of applications across multiple industries. Nevertheless, the inherent brittleness of Mg alloys poses a significant hurdle, necessitating innovative approaches to enhance their mechanical performance. Among the various strategies, manipulating stacking fault energy (SFE) has been a key focus, although primarily within the realm of binary alloys. This study investigates SFE in Mg alloys, focusing on ternary compositions. Utilizing first-principles DFT calculations, we analyze solute interactions and their influence on SFE, particularly in Mg-Al-X and Mg-Zn-X configurations. Predictive models are developed for estimating SFE effects, revealing solute pairs that mimic rare earth elements and show potential for improved ductility. The findings contribute to fundamental insights into Mg alloy behavior, offering practical directions for designing advanced materials with superior mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Sign-reversal Anomalous Hall effect driven by a magnetic transition in Cr$_{7-\delta}$Te$_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for exotic spin configurations and related novel transport properties continues to be fueled by the promise of new electronic states and outstanding candidate components for spintronic applications. In layered Cr$_{7-\delta}$Te$_8$, the applied field drives a before unreported magnetic transition revealed by the alternating current magnetic susceptibility measurements around room temperature. This observed magnetic transition results in a sign change for the anomalous Hall effect which exhibits non-monotonous temperature dependence. The prominent topological Hall effect (THE) with a large value of 1$\mu \Omega \cdot cm$ has been observed without breaking the inversion symmetry for Cr$_{7-\delta}$Te$_8$. This robust THE can persist up to room temperature attributed to the nonzero fluctuation-driven scalar spin chirality. The complicated interactions of long-range and short-range magnetic orders lead to rich exotic magnetic states with related novel transport properties in Cr$_{7-\delta}$Te$_8$.</description>

      <title>Charge and spin current pumping by ultrafast demagnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surprising discovery of ultrafast demagnetization -- where electric field of femtosecond laser pulse couples to electrons of a ferromagnetic (FM) layer causing its magnetization vector {\em to shrink while not rotating}, is also assumed to be accompanied by generation of spin current in the direction orthogonal to electric field. However, understanding of the microscopic origin of such spin current and how efficiently it can be converted into charge current, as the putative source of THz radiation, is lacking despite nearly three decades of intense studies. Here we connect the standard pumping phenomena driven by microwave precession of magnetization vector replacing periodic time-dependence of magnetization precession with nonperiodic time-dependence of demagnetization, as obtained from experiments on ultrafast-light-driven Ni layer. Applying time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions, able to evolve such setup with arbitrary time dependence, reveals how demagnetization dynamics pumps both charge and spin currents in directions both parallel and orthogonal to electric field of laser pulse, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and thereby induced spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms. Although pumped currents follow $dM_z/dt$ in some setups, this becomes obscured when NM layers are disconnected and pumped currents start to reflect from FM boundaries (as is the case of experimental setups). Finally, we use the Jefimenko equations to compute electromagnetic radiation by charge current pumped in disconnected setup during demagnetization, or later during its slow recovery, unraveling that radiated electric field only in the former time interval exhibits features in 0.1--30 THz frequency range probed experimentally or explored for applications of spintronic THz emitters.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic conductance of ferroelectric domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain walls hold great promise for innovative applications in ferroelectric devices. However, the underlying mechanisms behind the observed giant conductance of charged domain walls remain poorly understood. Using a first-principles approach that incorporates Boltzmann transport theory and the relaxation time approximation, we determine the carrier concentration, mobility, and conductivity of domain walls with head-to-head and tail-to-tail polarization orientations. Our systematic exploration reveals that the accumulation of carriers, particularly their concentration, plays a dominant role in the domain wall conductance mechanism. However, the observed conductance differences between head-to-head and tail-to-tail domain walls are primarily due to differences in carrier mobility. The width of the domain wall is a key factor determining the device scale. Our calculated domain wall width is significantly smaller than previously reported values. This method, not limited to a certain ferroelectric material, can be used for the optimization and application development of various domain wall materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure of Molybdenene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale CAMS (computer-aided materials simulation) within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) has been applied to investigate electronic structure of molybdenene monolayer in both its hexagonal and triclinic eigen-structures as observed formerly in the lab. In agreement with experimental findings, and based on electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) calculations, it has been found that both monolayers are metallic Dirac materials, known as metallic relative of graphene in the literature. Partial DOS analyses have also revealed that both Mo atoms of the unit cells have exactly the same contributions to the metallic property observed, the largest of which, compared to the rest, emerge from the $d$ valence orbitals due to being both half-empty as well as the outermost (then containing weakest-bound electrons), giving charge carriers a higher kinetic/movement degree of freedom to conduct electricity, governed by Pauli's exclusion principle.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Interlayer Magnetic Coupling for Efficient, Field-Free Current-Induced Magnetization Switching in a Magnetic Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the unique features of low Gilbert damping, long spin-diffusion lengths and zero Ohmic losses, magnetic insulators are promising candidate materials for next-generation spintronic applications. However, due to the localized magnetic moments and the complex metal-oxide interface between magnetic insulators and heavy metals, spin-functional Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions or spin Hall and Edelstein effects are weak, which diminishes the performance of these typical building blocks for spintronic devices. Here, we exploit the exchange coupling between metallic and insulating magnets for efficient electrical manipulation of heavy metal/magnetic insulator heterostructures. By inserting a thin Co layer, we enhance the spin-orbit torque efficiency by more than 20 times, which significantly reduces the switching current density. Moreover, we demonstrate field-free current-induced magnetization switching caused by a symmetry-breaking non-collinear magnetic texture. Our work launches magnetic insulators as an alternative platform for low-power spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Scaling Crystal Structure Relaxation with a Universal Trustworthy Deep Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of AI and high-throughput technologies has boosted a rapid increase in the number of new materials, challenging our computational ability to comprehensively analyze their properties. Relaxed crystal structures often serve as the foundational basis for further property calculations. However, determining equilibrium structures traditionally involves computationally expensive iterative calculations. Here, we develop DeepRelax, an efficient deep generative model designed for rapid structural relaxation without any iterative process. DeepRelax learns the equilibrium structural distribution, enabling it to predict relaxed structures directly from their unrelaxed counterparts. The ability to perform structural relaxation in just a few hundred milliseconds per structure, combined with the scalability of parallel processing, makes DeepRelax particularly useful for large-scale virtual screening. To demonstrate the universality of DeepRelax, we benchmark it against three different databases of X-Mn-O oxides, Materials Project, and Computational 2D Materials Database with various types of materials. In these tests, DeepRelax exhibits both high accuracy and efficiency in structural relaxation, as further validated by DFT calculations. Finally, we integrate DeepRelax with an implementation of uncertainty quantification, enhancing its reliability and trustworthiness in material discovery. This work provides an efficient and trustworthy method to significantly accelerate large-scale computations, offering substantial advancements in the field of computational materials science.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of defects and doping limits in CaO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calcium oxide (CaO) is a promising host for quantum defects because of its ultrawide band gap and potential for long spin coherence times. Using hybrid functional calculations, we investigate the intrinsic point defects and how they limit Fermi-level positions and doping in CaO. Our results reveal calcium and oxygen vacancies to be the most common intrinsic defects, acting as compensating acceptors and donors, respectively. Oxygen interstitials are also prevailing under O-rich conditions and act as compensating donors. Due to compensation by these defects, O-poor conditions are required to dope CaO n-type, while O-rich conditions are required for p-type doping. We find that, at room temperature, intrinsic CaO can only achieve Fermi-level positions between 1.76 eV above the valence-band maximum (VBM) and 1.73 eV below the conduction-band minimum (CBM). If suitable shallow dopants can be found, the allowed range of Fermi levels would increase to between VBM+0.53 eV and CBM-0.27 eV and is set by the compensating intrinsic defects. Additionally, we study hydrogen impurities, and show that hydrogen will limit p-type doping but can also act as shallow donor when substituting oxygen ($\mathrm{H}_\mathrm{O}$ defects).</description>

      <title>Continuous crossover between insulating ferroelectrics and the polar metals: \textit{Ab initio} calculation of structural phase transitions of Li$B$O$_3$ ($B$ = Ta, W, Re, Os)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent discovery of a new polar metal LiReO$_3$ by K. Murayama, \textit{et al}, we calculate the temperature($T$)-dependent crystal structures of Li$B$O3 with $B$ = Ta, W, Re, Os, using the self-consistent phonon (SCPH) theory. We have reproduced the experimentally observed polar-nonpolar structural phase transitions and the transition temperatures ($T_c$) of LiTaO$_3$, LiReO$_3$, and LiOsO$_3$. From the calculation, we predict that LiWO$_3$ is a polar metal, which is yet to be tested experimentally. Upon doping electrons to the insulating LiTaO$_3$, the predicted $T_c$ is quickly suppressed and approaches those of the polar metals. Thus, there is a continuous crossover between ferroelectric insulators and polar metals if we dope electrons to the polar metals. Investigating the detailed material dependence of the interatomic force constants (IFCs), we explicitly show that the suppression of $T_c$ in polar metals can be ascribed to the screening of the long-range Li-O interaction, which is caused by the presence of the itinerant electrons.</description>

      <title>Stabilization and high thermoelectric performance of high-entropy-type cubic AgBi(S, Se, Te)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As thermoelectric generators can convert waste heat into electricity, they play an important role in energy harvesting. The metal chalcogenide AgBiSe2 is one of the high-performance thermoelectric materials with low lattice thermal conductivity (klat), but it exhibits temperature-dependent crystal structural transitions from hexagonal to rhombohedral, and finally a cubic phase as the temperature rises. The high figure-of-merit ZT is obtained only for the high-temperature cubic phase. In this study, we utilized the high-entropy-alloy (HEA) concept for AgBiSe2 to stabilize the cubic phase throughout the entire temperature range with enhanced thermoelectric performance. We synthesized high-entropy-type AgBiSe2-2xSxTex bulk polycrystals and realized the stabilization of the cubic phase from room temperature to 800 K for x &gt; 0.6. The ultra-low klat at of 0.30 Wm^-1K^-1 and the high peak ZT 0.9 at around 750 K were realized for cubic AgBiSe2-2xSxTex without carrier tuning. In addition, the average ZT value of x = 0.6 and 0.7 for the temperature range of 360-750 K increased to 0.38 and 0.40, respectively, which are comparable to the highest previously reported values.</description>

      <title>MICROSIM: A high performance phase-field solver based on CPU and GPU implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase-field method has become a useful tool for the simulation of classical metallurgical phase transformations as well as other phenomena related to materials science. The thermodynamic consistency that forms the basis of these formulations lends to its strong predictive capabilities and utility. However, a strong impediment to the usage of the method for typical applied problems of industrial and academic relevance is the significant overhead with regard to the code development and know-how required for quantitative model formulations. In this paper, we report the development of an open-source phase-field software stack that contains generic formulations for the simulation of multi-phase and multi-component phase transformations. The solvers incorporate thermodynamic coupling that allows the realization of simulations with real alloys in scenarios directly relevant to the materials industry. Further, the solvers utilize parallelization strategies using either multiple CPUs or GPUs to provide cross-platform portability and usability on available supercomputing machines. Finally, the solver stack also contains a graphical user interface to gradually introduce the usage of the software. The user interface also provides a collection of post-processing tools that allow the estimation of useful metrics related to microstructural evolution.</description>

      <title>An atomic-scale perspective on individual thiol-terminated molecules anchored to single S vacancies in MoS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulphur vacancies in MoS$_2$ on Au(111) have been shown to be negatively charged as reflected by a Kondo resonance. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy to show that these vacancies serve as anchoring sites for thiol-based molecules (CF$_3$-3P-SH) with two distinct reaction products, one of them showing a Kondo resonance. Based on comparisons with density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, including a random structure search and computation of energies and electronic properties at a hybrid exchange-correlation functional level, we conclude that both anchored molecules are charge neutral. One of them is an anchored intact CF$_3$-3P-SH molecule while the other one is the result of catalytically activated dehydrogenation to CF$_3$-3P-S with subsequent anchoring. Our investigations highlight a perspective of functionalizing defects with thiol-terminated molecules that can be equipped with additional functional groups, such as charge donor- or acceptor-moieties, switching units or magnetic centers.</description>

      <title>High-temperature domain wall current in Mg-doped lithium niobate single crystals up to 400{\deg}C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01214</link>

Abstract: Conductive ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) represent a promising topical system for the development of nanoelectronic components and devices. DWs may show very different properties as compared to their bulk counterparts. Of central interest here is the domain wall current (DWC) of charged DWs in 5mol% Mg-doped lithium niobate single crystals; in contrast to former works, we extend the DWC study here to temperatures as high as 400{\deg}C. Both the temporal stability and the thermal activation energies of 100 - 160 meV are readily deduced from current-voltage sweeps as recorded over multiple heating cycles. Our experimental work is backed up by atomistic modelling of the DWC. The latter suggests that a large band bending renders head-to-head (H2H) and tail-to-tail (T2T) DWs semimetallic. These detailed investigations underline the potential to extending DWC-based nanoelectronic applications even into the so-far unexplored high-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>Precise Control of Process Parameters for &gt;23% Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells in Ambient Air Using an Automated Device Acceleration Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00106</link>

Abstract: Achieving high-performance perovskite photovoltaics, especially in ambient air relies heavily on optimizing process parameters. However, traditional manual methods often struggle to effectively control the key variables. This inherent challenge requires a paradigm shift toward automated platforms capable of precise and reproducible experiments. Herein, we use a fully automated device acceleration platform (DAP) to optimize the process parameters for preparing full perovskite devices using a two-step method in ambient air. Eight process parameters that have the potential to significantly influence device performance are systematically optimized. Specifically, we delve into the impact of the dispense speed of organic ammonium halide, a parameter that is difficult to control manually, on both perovskite film and device performance. Through the targeted design of experiments, we reveal that the dispense speed significantly affects device performance primarily by adjusting the residual PbI2 content in the films. We find that moderate dispense speeds, e.g., 50 {\mu}l/s, contribute to top-performance devices. Conversely, too fast or too slow speeds result in devices with relatively poorer performance and lower reproducibility. The optimized parameter set enables us to establish a Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) for additive-free perovskite processing under ambient conditions, which yield devices with efficiencies surpassing 23%, satisfactory reproducibility, and state-of-the-art photo-thermal stability. This research underscores the importance of understanding the causality of process parameters in enhancing perovskite photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, our study highlights the pivotal role of automated platforms in discovering innovative workflows and accelerating the development of high-performing perovskite photovoltaic technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic Structure Theory (EST) describes the behavior of electrons in matter and is used to predict material properties. Conventionally, this involves forming a Hamiltonian and solving the Schr\"odinger equation through discrete computation. Here, a new perspective to EST is provided by treating a perfectly crystalline material as a Linear Translation Invariant (LTI) system. The validity of this LTI-EST formalism is demonstrated by determining band structures for a one-dimensional chain of atoms, including the phenomenon of band structure folding in super cells. The proposed formalism allows for analytical traceability of band structure folding and offers computational advantage by bypassing the O(N) eigenvalue calculations. The spike-based computing nature of the proposed LTI-EST formalism is highlighted; thereby implying potential for material simulations solely in the spiking domain.</description>

Abstract: Technical advancement of oxide molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has opened new avenues for studying various quantum transport phenomena in correlated transition-metal oxides, as exemplified by the exotic superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and quantum oscillations of SrRuO$_3$. On the other hand, film research of another Ruddlesden-Popper strontium ruthenate Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ which exhibits a unique quantum phase related to metamagnetism in bulk systems did not progress well. Here we report the fabrication of high-quality Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ thin films by oxide MBE and the observation of a strain-induced ferromagnetic ground state. The change in magnetic exchange coupling evaluated by first-principles calculations indicates a systematic relation between the compression of the $c$-axis length and induced ferromagnetism. Giant epitaxial strain in high-quality films will be a key to a comprehensive understanding of the magnetism in Ruddlesden-Popper strontium ruthenates Sr$_{n+1}$Ru$_n$O$_{3n+1}$, which sensitively depends on the ratio of in-plane to out-of-plane Ru-Ru distances.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Viscosity of the ABC-stacked Multilayer Graphene in the Collisionless Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamic shear viscosity of the undoped ABC-stacked multilayer graphene based on the chiral-$N$ effective Hamiltonian, where the chirality $N$ is equivalent to the layer number. We investigate the dependence of the dynamic shear viscosity on the frequency in the collisionless regime and calculate Coulomb interaction corrections by three leading order Feynman diagrams: self-energy diagram, vertex diagram, and honey diagram. We propose that the dynamic shear viscosity is generated by the relaxation of momentum flux polarization through electron-hole excitations, and that the interaction can amplify this effect. Furthermore, our research indicates that the dynamic shear viscosity exhibits a robust linear positive dependence on $N$. This finding suggests that by making modifications to the number of layers in graphene, it is possible to finely tune the electron viscous effects.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Nanoelectromechanical Coupling at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface hosts a plethora of gate-tunable electronic phases. Gating of LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces are usually assumed to occur electrostatically. However, increasing evidence suggests that non-local interactions can influence and, in some cases, dominate the coupling between applied gate voltages and electronic properties. Here, we sketch quasi-1D ballistic electron waveguides at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface as a probe to understand how gate tunability varies as a function of spatial separation. Gate tunability measurements reveal the scaling law to be at odds with the pure electrostatic coupling observed in traditional semiconductor systems. The non-Coulombic gating at the interface is attributed to the existence of a long-range nanoelectromechanical coupling between the gate and electron waveguide, mediated by the ferroelastic domains in SrTiO$_3$. The long-range interactions at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface add unexpected richness and complexity to this correlated electron system.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous charge-ordered state in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that a weakly spontaneous charge-ordered insulating state probably exists in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene which can account for experimentally observed non-monotonic behavior of resistance as a function of the gated field, namely, the gap closes and reopens at a critical gated field. The underlying physics is demonstrated by a simple model on a corresponding lattice that contains the nearest intralayer and interlayer hoppings, electric field, and staggered potential between different sublattices. Combining density functional theory calculations with model analyses, we argue that the interlayer van der Waals interactions cooperating with ripples may be responsible for the staggered potential which induces a charge-ordered insulating state in the absence of the electric field.</description>

      <title>Hidden-Rashba-driven Absence of Odd-integer Quantized States in an Oxide Quantum Hall System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the quantum Hall effect in 1980, a turning point in condensed matter physics, has inspired exploring emergent quantized states regarding novel electron states, band topologies and spin textures. Owing to the lifted degeneracies universally-existing, most quantum Hall systems host both even- and odd-integer quantum Hall plateaus simultaneously. Selective control of these quantized states is of great significance to understand the exotic ground states and manipulate the spin textures in quantum Hall systems; however, it remains challenging. Here we demonstrate the absence of odd-integer state in inversion-symmetric Bi2O2Se quantum Hall system driven by the unique hidden Rashba effect. Pronounced quantum oscillations and only even-integer quantized plateaus were observed in the few-layer Bi2O2Se films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3. However, after reducing the thickness of epitaxial Bi2O2Se film to one unit cell limit with giant Rashba parameter of 440 meV.A, both odd- and even-integer states can show up simultaneously in this 2D Janus film. Theoretical calculations revealed that such absence of odd-integer states, i.e., a suppressed Zeeman splitting, stems from a unique hidden Rashba effect in the inversion-symmetric Bi2O2Se. However, this hidden Rashba effect can be further broken down due to tunable inversion-symmetry breaking. Our work highlights the extraordinary controllability of quantized states at the atomic level and further provides an unprecedented path to explore and handle novel spin textures and ground states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore numerically the intricate interplay between Berry phases in both real and momentum spaces within itinerant magnets. This interplay manifests as an emergent spin-orbit coupling, where charge carriers occupying a Berry-curved band generate an orbital magnetization, inducing a pseudo-magnetic field originating in chiral spin textures. Using density-matrix-renormalization-group techniques, we demonstrate that switching on a band Berry curvature in a metallic ferromagnetic phase results in chiral magnetic textures. Furthermore, employing a two-leg strip geometry, we establish a connection between charge and spin chirality, further supporting this emergent spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Effect of cathode porosity on the Lithium air cell oxygen reduction reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the practical air cathode in a Lithium air cell, which is conventionally composed of porous carbon with or without catalysts supported on it, was investigated. The mechanism and kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied on a porous carbon electrode in an oxygen saturated solution of 0.1M Lithium bis-trifluoromethanesulfonimidate (LiTFSI) in Dimethoxyethane (DME) using cyclic voltammetery (CV) and the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. The oxygen reduction and evolution reactions were found to occur at similar potentials to those observed on a smooth, planar glassy carbon (GC) electrode. The effect of the porosity and the resultant increase in surface area were readily observed in the increase in the transient time required for the intermediates to reach the ring and the much larger disk currents (compared to smooth, planar GC) recorded respectively. The RRDE data was analyzed using a kinetic model previously developed by us and the rate constant of the elementary reactions calculated. The rates constant for the electrochemical reactions were found to be similar in magnitude to the rate constants calculated for smooth GC disks. The porosity of the electrode was found to decrease the rate of desorption of the intermediate and the product and delay their diffusion by shifting it from a Fickian regime in the electrolyte bulk to the Knudsen regime in the film pores. Thus, it is shown that the effect of the electrode porosity on the kinetics of the ORR is physical rather than electrochemical.</description>

Abstract: NASA mandate is a human mission to Mars in the 2030s and sustained exploration of Mars requires in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). Exploiting the Martian water cycle (alongside perchlorate salts that depress the freezing point of water to less than 213K) and the available 95 volume percent atmospheric CO2, we detail an ultra-low temperature (255K) CO2-H2O electrolyzer to produce methane fuel and life-supporting oxygen on Mars. Methane production is thermodynamically favored across a range of operational pressures and temperatures and our electrolyzer polarization model concurred with reported experimental performance. A hypothetical 10-cell, 100 square cm electrode-area-per-cell electrolyzer produced 0.31g per W per day of CH4 and 3.54g per W per day of O2 at 2V per cell (operating voltage) versus 0.8g per W per day of O2 produced by the Mars Oxygen in-situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) from the Mars 2020 mission (MOXIE produces no fuel). Material performance requirements are presented to show that this technology is an energy-efficient complement to the MOXIE high temperature approach.</description>

      <title>Charge density wave without long-range structural modulation in canted antiferromagnetic kagome FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated electron systems with a kagome lattice can host abundant exotic quantum states such as superconductivity and spin/charge density waves (CDW) due to the complicated interactions between different degrees of freedoms in the framework of a unique two-dimensional geometrically frustrated lattice structure. Recently, successive orders of A-type antiferromagnetism (AFM), $2\times2\times2$ CDW and canted double-cone AFM have been manifested upon cooling in magnetic kagome FeGe. However, the mechanism of the CDW order and its interaction with magnetism are presently enigmatic at best. Here we investigate the evolution of CDW order with temperature across the spin canting transition in FeGe by single-crystal x-ray diffraction. Refinements of its modulated structure are presented using the superspace approach. Interestingly, the superlattice reflections originating from CDW-induced long-range structural modulation become extremely weak after the system enters the canted AFM while a $2\times2$ CDW in the $ab$ plane persists as a long-range order demonstrated by strong electronic modulation in the d$I$/d$V$ map of scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We discovered a novel CDW order without long-range structural modulation in FeGe probably because of the competition between CDW and canted AFM in determining the underlying crystal structure. In addition, occupational modulations of Ge1 atoms located in the kagome plane and displacive modulations of all the atoms were extracted from the refinements, confirming the existence of Ge atom dimerization along the $c$ axis as the major distortion and indicating a dynamic transformation between different CDW domains.</description>

      <title>Reversible-to-irreversible transition of colloidal polycrystals under cyclic athermal quasistatic deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclic loading on granular packings and amorphous media exhibits a transition from reversible elastic behavior to irreversible plasticity. The present study compares the irreversibility transition and microscopic details of colloidal polycrystals under oscillatory tensile-compressive and shear strain. Under both modes, the systems exhibit a reversible to irreversible transition. However, the strain amplitude at which the transition is observed is larger in the shear strain than in the tensile-compressive mode. The threshold strain amplitude is confirmed by analyzing the dynamical properties, such as mobility and atomic strain (von-Mises shear strain and the volumetric strain). The structural changes are quantified using a hexatic order parameter. Under both modes of deformation, dislocations and grain boundaries in polycrystals disappear, and monocrystals are formed. We also recognize the dislocation motion through grains. The key difference is that strain accumulates diagonally in oscillatory tensile-compressive deformation, whereas, in shear deformation, strain accumulation is along the $x$ or $y$ axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical-controllable antiferromagnet tunnel junction is a key goal in spintronics, holding immense promise for ultra-dense and ultra-stable antiferromagnetic memory with high processing speed for modern information technology. Here, we have advanced towards this goal by achieving an electrical-controllable antiferromagnet-based tunnel junction of Pt/Co/Pt/Co/IrMn/MgO/Pt. The exchange coupling between antiferromagnetic IrMn and Co/Pt perpendicular magnetic multilayers results in the formation of interfacial exchange bias and exchange spring in IrMn. Encoding information states 0 and 1 is realized through the exchange spring in IrMn, which can be electrically written by spin-orbit torque switching with high cyclability and electrically read by antiferromagnetic tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance. Combining spin-orbit torque switching of both exchange spring andexchange bias, 16 Boolean logic operation is successfully demonstrated. With both memory and logic functionalities integrated into our electrical-controllable antiferromagnetic-based tunnel junction, we chart the course toward high-performance antiferromagnetic logic-in-memory.</description>

      <title>Phonon and electronic properties of semiconducting silicon nitride bilayers</title>

Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) IV-V semiconductors have attracted much attention due to their fascinating electronic and optical properties. In this work, we predicted three phases of silicon nitrides, denoted $\alpha$-Si$_{2}$N$_{2}$, $\beta$-Si$_{2}$N$_{2}$, and $\gamma$-Si$_{4}$N$_{4}$, respectively. Both $\alpha$-Si$_{2}$N$_{2}$ and $\beta$-Si$_{2}$N$_{2}$ consist of two buckled SiN sheets, and $\gamma$-Si$_{4}$N$_{4}$ consists of two puckered SiN sheets. It is challenging to transform between $\alpha$-Si$_{2}$N$_{2}$ and $\beta$-Si$_{2}$N$_{2}$ because of the high energy barrier. The three dynamically stable bilayers are semiconductors with fundamental indirect band gaps from 0.25 eV to 2.92 eV. As expected, only the s and p orbitals contribute to the electronic states, and the pz orbitals dominate near the Fermi level. Furthermore, insulator-metal transitions occur in $\alpha$-Si$_{2}$N$_{2}$ and $\beta$-Si$_{2}$N$_{2}$ under the biaxial strain of 16%. These materials perhaps have potential applications in microelectronics and spintronics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Thickness of the Air-Water Interface from Two Extremes of Interface Hydrogen Bond Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The air-water interface plays a crucial role in many aspects of science, because of its unique properties, such as a two-dimensional hydrogen bond (HB) network and completely different HB dynamics compared to bulk water. However, accurately determining the boundary of interfacial and bulk water, that is, the thickness of the air-water interface, still challenges experimentalists. Various simulation-based methods have been developed to estimate the thickness, converging on a range of approximately 3 to 10 Angstroms. In this study, we introduce a novel approach, grounded in density functional theory-based molecular dynamics (DFTMD) simulations, to measure the air-water interface thickness, offering a different perspective based on prior research. To capture realistic HB dynamics in the air-water interface, two extreme scenarios of the interface HB dynamics are obtained: one {underestimates} the interface HB dynamics, while the other overestimates it. Surprisingly, our results suggest that the interface HB dynamics in both scenarios converge as the thickness of the air-water interface increases to 4.0 Angstroms. This convergence point, indicative of the realistic interface thickness, is confirmed by our calculation of anisotropic decay of OH stretch at the air-water interface and supported by the results from recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>An electronic structure investigation of PEDOT with AlCl4- anions, a promising redox combination for energy storage applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is one of the most researched materials. The 1980s bipolaron model remains the dominant interpretation of the electronic structure of PEDOT. Recent theoretical studies have provided updated definitions of key concepts such as bipolarons or polaron pairs, but these have not yet become widely known. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the electronic structure of PEDOT oligomers with co-located AlCl4- anions, a promising combination for energy storage. By considering the influence of oligomer length, oxidation or anion concentration and spin state, we find no evidence for self-localisation of positive charges in PEDOT as predicted by the bipolaron model at the hybrid functional level. Our results show distortions that exhibit either a single or a double peak in bond length alternations and charge density. Either can occur at different oxidation or anion concentrations. We note that other distortion shapes are also possible. Rather than representing bipolarons or polaron pairs in the original model, these are electron distributions driven by a range of factors. Localisation of distortions occurs with anions, and distortions can span an arbitrary number of nearby anions. Conductivity in conducting polymers has been observed to reduce at anion concentrations above 0.5. We show at high anion concentrations, the energy of the localised, non-bonding anionic orbitals approaches that of the system HOMO due to Coulombic repulsion between anions. We hypothesize that with nucleic motion in the macropolymer, these orbitals will interfere with the hopping of charge carriers between sites of similar energy, lowering conductivity.</description>

      <title>Origin of Charge Density Wave in Topological Semimetals SrAl4 and EuAl4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological semimetals in BaAl4-type structure show many interesting behaviors, such as charge density wave (CDW) in SrAl4 and EuAl4, but not the isostructural and isovalent BaAl4, SrGa4 and BaGa4. Here using Wannier functions based on density functional theory, we calculate the susceptibility functions with millions of k-points to reach the small q-vector and study the origin and driving force behind the CDW. Our comparative study reveals that the origin of the CDW in SrAl4 and EuAl4 is the strong electron-phonon coupling interaction for the transverse acoustic mode at small q-vector along the \{Gamma}-Z direction besides the maximum of the real part of the susceptibility function from the nested Fermi surfaces of the Dirac-like bands, which explains well the absence of CDW in the other closely related compounds in a good agreement with experiment. We also connect the different CDW behaviors in the Al compounds to the macroscopic elastic properties.</description>

      <title>Broken Screw Rotational Symmetry in the Near-Surface Electronic Structure of $AB$-Stacked Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of $2H$-$\mathrm{Nb}\mathrm{S}_2$ and $h$-$\mathrm{BN}$ by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and photoemission intensity calculations. Although in bulk form, these materials are expected to exhibit band degeneracy in the $k_z=\pi/c$ plane due to screw rotation and time-reversal symmetries, we observe gapped band dispersion near the surface. We extract from first-principles calculations the near-surface electronic structure probed by ARPES and find that the calculated photoemission spectra from the near-surface region reproduce the gapped ARPES spectra. Our results show that the near-surface electronic structure can be qualitatively different from the bulk one due to partially broken nonsymmorphic symmetries.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic spin splittings and altermagnetism in twisted bilayers of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetism-driven nonrelativistic spin splittings (NRSS) are promising for highly efficient spintronics applications. Although 2D centrosymmetric (in four-dimensional spacetime) antiferromagnets are abundant, they have not received extensive research attention owing to symmetry-forbidden spin polarization and magnetization. Here, we demonstrate a paradigm to harness NRSS by twisting the bilayer of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets with commensurate twist angles. We observe $i$-wave altermagnetism and spin-momentum locking by first-principles simulations and symmetry analysis on prototypical MnPSe$_3$ and MnSe antiferromagnets. The strength of NRSS (up to 80 meV\AA) induced by twisting is comparable to SOC-induced linear Rashba-Dresselhaus effects. The results also demonstrate how applying biaxial strain and a vertical electric field tune the NRSS. The findings reveal the untapped potential of centrosymmetric antiferromagnets and thus expand the material's horizons in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven compression of electron-phonon interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First-principles calculations of electron interactions in materials have seen rapid progress in recent years, with electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions being a prime example. However, these techniques use large matrices encoding the interactions on dense momentum grids, which reduces computational efficiency and obscures interpretability. For e-ph interactions, existing interpolation techniques leverage locality in real space, but the high dimensionality of the data remains a bottleneck to balance cost and accuracy. Here we show an efficient way to compress e-ph interactions based on singular value decomposition (SVD), a widely used matrix / image compression technique. Leveraging (un)constrained SVD methods, we accurately predict material properties related to e-ph interactions - including charge mobility, spin relaxation times, band renormalization, and superconducting critical temperature - while using only a small fraction (1-2%) of the interaction data. These findings unveil the hidden low-dimensional nature of e-ph interactions. Furthermore, they accelerate state-of-the-art first-principles e-ph calculations by about two orders of magnitudes without sacrificing accuracy. Our Pareto-optimal parametrization of e-ph interactions can be readily generalized to electron-electron and electron-defect interactions, as well as to other couplings, advancing quantitative studies of condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Explaining the thickness-dependent dielectric permittivity of thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dielectric properties of thin films are of paramount important in a variety of technological applications, and of fundamental importance for solid state research. In spite of this, there is currently no theoretical understanding of the dependence of the dielectric permittivity on the thickness of thin films. We develop a confinement model within the Lorentz-field framework for the microscopic Langevin-equation description of dielectric response in terms of the atomic-scale vibrational modes of the solid. Based on this, we derive analytical expressions for the dielectric permittivity as a function of thin film thickness, in excellent agreement with experimental data of Barium-Strontium-Titanate (BST) thin films of different stoichiometry. The theory shows that the decrease of dielectric permittivity with decreasing thickness is directly caused by the restriction in $k$-space of the available eigenmodes for field-induced alignment of ions and charged groups.</description>

      <title>Does mixed grain boundary follow the principles of superposition?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the major challenges towards understanding and further utilizing the properties and functional behaviors of grain boundaries (GB) is the complexity of general GBs with mixed tilt and twist character. Here, we demonstrated that the structures and stress fields of mostly mixed GBs could be considered as the superposition of their tilt and twist GB components by computationally examining 26.8 million large-scale structures of 4964 unique silicon mixed GB characters. The results indicate that low angle mixed GB is formed by the dislocation interactions between its decomposed tilt and twist components, while various complex sub-structures with dislocation stress but without conventional dislocation core structures are discovered on twin and structural unit GBs. A universal Read-Shockley model that physically captures the energy trends of the mixed GB is proposed, and its superiority, universality and transferability are proven in a variety of GB structures across different lattices. We confirm the validity of this work by comparing the results with experimental observations and first-principles calculations. Earlier works should now be reassessed in the light of these findings.</description>

      <title>Bridging deep learning force fields and electronic structures with a physics-informed approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a physics-informed neural network approach bridging deep-learning force field and electronic structure simulations, illustrated through twisted two-dimensional large-scale material systems. The deep potential molecular dynamics model is adopted as the backbone, and electronic structure simulation is integrated. Using Wannier functions as the basis, we categorize Wannier Hamiltonian elements based on physical principles to incorporate diverse information from a deep-learning force field model. This information-sharing mechanism streamlines the architecture of our multifunctional model, enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness. Utilizing Wannier functions as the basis lays the groundwork for predicting more physical quantities. This approach serves as a powerful tool to explore both the structural and electronic properties of large-scale systems characterized by low periodicities. By endowing an existing well-developed machine-learning force field with electronic structure simulation capabilities, the study marks a significant advancement in developing multimodal machine-learning-based computational methods that can achieve multiple functionalities traditionally exclusive to first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Energy balance and damage for dynamic brittle fracture from a nonlocal formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01861v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nonlocal model of peridynamic type for dynamic brittle damage is introduced consisting of two phases, one elastic and the other inelastic. Evolution from the elastic to the inelastic phase depends on material strength. Existence and uniqueness of the displacement-failure set pair follow from the initial value problem. The displacement-failure pair satisfies energy balance. The length of nonlocality $\epsilon$ is taken to be small relative to the domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$. The new nonlocal model delivers a two point strain evolution on a subset of $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{R}^d$. This evolution provides an energy that interpolates between volume energy corresponding to elastic behavior and surface energy corresponding to failure. In general the deformation energy resulting in material failure over a region $R$ is given by a $d-1$ dimensional integral that is uniformly bounded as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. For fixed $\epsilon$, the failure energy is nonzero for $d-1$ dimensional regions $R$ associated with flat crack surfaces. This failure energy is the Griffith fracture energy given by the energy release rate multiplied by area for $d=3$ (or length for $d=2$). The nonlocal field theory is shown to recover a solution of Naiver's equation outside a propagating flat traction free crack in the limit of vanishing spatial nonlocality. Simulations illustrate fracture evolution through generation of an internal traction free boundary as a wake left behind a moving strain concentration. Crack paths are seen to follow a maximal strain energy density criterion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High In content InGaAs quantum wells (In $\geq$ 75%) are potentially useful for topological quantum computing and spintronics applications. In high mobility InGaAs quantum wells, alloy disorder scattering is a limiting factor. In this report, we demonstrate that by growing the InGaAs quantum wells as a digital alloy, or a short period superlattice, we can reduce the alloy disorder scattering within the quantum well and increase the peak 2 K electron mobility to 545,000 cm^2/V s, which is the highest reported mobility for high In content InGaAs quantum wells to the best of the authors' knowledge. Our results demonstrate that the digital alloy approach can be used to increase the mobility of quantum wells in random alloy ternary materials.</description>
