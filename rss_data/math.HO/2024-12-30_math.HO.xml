      <title>Stamps and Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the potential of using math-themed postage stamps in mathematics lessons as a tool to engage students and integrate the subject with history, art, and culture. Since the first mathematical stamps appeared in the early 20th century, featuring prominent scholars like Carl Friedrich Gauss and Isaac Newton, they serve not only as philatelic artifacts but also as historical carriers of knowledge. The paper presents several practical projects to interest students, such as creating their own math stamps, investigating the price trends of math-themed stamps, and developing a timeline of mathematical discoveries depicted in philatelic issues. The proposed projects develop students' mathematical skills in areas such as percentage calculations, general arithmetic, working with time intervals, and statistical analysis. Students can analyze shapes, symmetry, and patterns on stamps, study principles of proportion, and explore geometric figures. Using stamps broadens students' horizons, providing an opportunity to become familiar with renowned mathematicians from different eras, countries, and cultures. This also offers students a new perspective on the subject, presenting mathematical discoveries as part of the world's cultural heritage. Postage stamps dedicated to mathematics can become a powerful tool for visualizing theoretical knowledge, stimulating interest in mathematics, and encouraging independent research among students.</description>

      <title>Positivity of Schubert Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schubert coefficients $c_{u,v}^w$ are structure constants describing multiplication of Schubert polynomials. Deciding positivity of Schubert coefficients is a major open problem in Algebraic Combinatorics. We prove a positive rule for this problem based on two standard assumptions.</description>

      <title>Analytical Methods for Squaring the Disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:1509.06344v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and discuss several old and new methods for mapping a circular disc to a square. In particular, we present analytical expressions for mapping each point (u,v) inside the circular disc to a point (x,y) inside a square region. Ideally, we want the mapping to be smooth and invertible. In addition, we put emphasis on mappings with desirable properties. These include conformal, equiareal, and radially-constrained mappings. Finally, we present applications to logo design, panoramic photography, and hyperbolic art.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Topology for Data Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book gives a thorough introduction to topological data analysis (TDA), the application of algebraic topology to data science. Algebraic topology is traditionally a very specialized field of math, and most mathematicians have never been exposed to it, let alone data scientists, computer scientists, and analysts. I have three goals in writing this book. The first is to bring people up to speed who are missing a lot of the necessary background. I will describe the topics in point-set topology, abstract algebra, and homology theory needed for a good understanding of TDA. The second is to explain TDA and some current applications and techniques. Finally, I would like to answer some questions about more advanced topics such as cohomology, homotopy, obstruction theory, and Steenrod squares, and what they can tell us about data. It is hoped that readers will acquire the tools to start to think about these topics and where they might fit in.</description>
