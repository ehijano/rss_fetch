      <title>Chromatic Effects on the PSF and Shear Measurement for the Roman Space Telescope High-Latitude Wide Area Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing (WL) is a key cosmological probe that requires precise measurement of galaxy images to infer shape distortions, or shear, and constrain cosmology. Accurate estimation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) is crucial for shear measurement, but the wavelength dependence of the PSF introduces chromatic biases that can systematically impact shear inference. We focus on biases arising from spectral energy distribution (SED) differences between stars, used for PSF modeling, and galaxies, used for shear measurement. We investigate these effects in $\textit{Roman's}$ four design reference mission WL bands (Y106, J129, H158, F184) and wide filter (W146). Using $\textit{Roman}$-like image simulations, we quantify the induced shear biases and compare them to requirements on those biases. Multiplicative biases over all galaxies hover around $\sim$0.2% in the WL bands and 2% in the wide filter, exceeding the mission requirement of $|m| &lt; 0.032\%$ and relaxed requirement of $|m| &lt; 0.1\%$. In individual redshift bins, biases can reach 0.4$\unicode{x2013}$0.9% for the WL bands and 3$\unicode{x2013}$6% for the wide filter. Additive biases remain acceptable in the WL bands but exceed systematic limits in the wide filter. We develop and test PSF-level corrections, showing that a first-order correction reduces biases within survey requirements for the WL bands; however, higher-order terms are necessary for the wide filter. Our results highlight the necessity of chromatic corrections for precision WL with $\textit{Roman}$ and provide a framework for mitigating these biases. Finally, we compare analytical color-based corrections to self-organizing maps (SOMs) and find that both methods effectively reduce biases.</description>

      <title>Modified cosmology in $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate cosmology within the framework of modified $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity using the non-linear model $f(Q, L_m) = -Q + \alpha L_m^n + \beta$, where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $n$ are free parameters. The modified Friedmann equations are derived for a matter-dominated universe, and an analytical solution is obtained. Using Hubble, Pantheon+, and joint datasets, we constrain the model parameters and examine their implications. The results indicate that the model accommodates varying $H_0$ values, contributing to the Hubble tension, while $n \neq 1$ suggests deviations from general relativity (GR). The deceleration parameter confirms a transition to acceleration at $z_t \approx 0.6 - 0.8$, with present values supporting cosmic acceleration. This model offers a viable alternative to GR-based cosmology.</description>

      <title>Interactions of the scalaron dark matter in $f (R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $f(R)$ gravity, the scalaron$\unicode{x2014}$a scalar degree of freedom arising from modification of General Relativity$\unicode{x2014}$could account for all dark matter if its mass lies in the meV$\unicode{x2013}$MeV range. In this work, we revisit the scalaron's interactions with Standard Model particles, assuming their minimal coupling to gravity. In particular, we refine the scalaron decay rate into photons. Assuming the scalaron constitutes all of dark matter, we calculate the average cosmological background radiation produced by these decays. We also estimate the contribution of primordial thermal scalarons to the present dark matter density and find it to be negligible. This supports the original scenario in which the scalaron dark matter behaves as a coherently oscillating field.</description>

      <title>Denoising weak lensing mass maps with diffusion model: systematic comparison with generative adversarial network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) Weak gravitational lensing (WL) is the unique and powerful probe into the large-scale structures of the Universe. Removing the shape noise from the observed WL field, i.e., denoising, enhances the potential of WL by accessing information at small scales where the shape noise dominates without denoising. We utilise two machine learning (ML) models for denosing: generative adversarial network (GAN) and diffusion model (DM). We evaluate the performance of denosing with GAN and DM utilising the large suite of mock WL observations, which serve as the training and test data sets. We apply denoising to 1,000 maps with GAN and DM models trained with 39,000 mock observations. Both models can fairly well reproduce the true convergence map on large scales. Then, we measure cosmological statistics: power spectrum, bispectrum, one-point probability distribution function, peak and minima counts, and scattering transform coefficients. We find that DM outperforms GAN in almost all statistics and recovers the correct statistics down to small scales within roughly $0.3 \sigma$ level at the scales accessible from current and future WL surveys. We also conduct the stress tests on the trained model; denoising the maps with different characteristics, e.g., different source redshifts, from the data used in training. The performance degrades at small scales, but the statistics can still be recovered at large scales. Though the training of DM is more computationally demanding compared with GAN, there are several advantages: numerically stable training, higher performance in the reconstruction of cosmological statistics, and sampling multiple realisations once the model is trained. It has been known that DM can generate higher-quality images in real-world problems than GAN, the superiority has been confirmed as well in the WL denoising problem.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the state of the IGM at $z\sim 8-10$ using redshifted 21-cm observations with LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power spectra of the redshifted 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) contain information about the ionization and thermal states of the intergalactic medium (IGM), and depend on the properties of the EoR sources. Recently, Mertens et al 2025 has analysed 10 nights of LOFAR high-band data and estimated upper limits on the 21-cm power spectrum at redshifts 8.3, 9.1 and 10.1. Here we use these upper limit results to constrain the properties of the IGM at those redshifts. We focus on the properties of the ionized and heated regions where the temperature is larger than that of the CMB. We model the 21-cm power spectrum with the code GRIZZLY, and use a Bayesian inference framework to explore the source parameters for uniform priors on their ranges. The framework also provides information about the IGM properties in the form of derived parameters. In a model which includes a radio background in excess of the CMB, the 95 (68) per cent credible intervals of disfavoured models at redshift 9.1 for the chosen priors correspond to IGM states with averaged ionization and heated fraction below 0.46 ($\lesssim 0.05$), an average gas temperature below 44 K (4 K), and a characteristic size of the heated region $\lesssim 14 ~h^{-1} ~\mathrm{Mpc}$ ($\lesssim 3 ~h^{-1} ~\mathrm{Mpc}$). The 68 per cent credible interval suggests an excess radio background which is more than 100 per cent of the CMB at 1.42 GHz, while the 95 per cent credible interval of the radio background efficiency parameter spans the entire prior range. The behaviour of the credible intervals is similar at all redshifts. The models disfavoured by the LOFAR upper limits are extreme ones, as they are mainly driven by rare and large ionized or heated regions.</description>

      <title>The Jackknife method as a new approach to validate strong lens mass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of a mass model in the strong lensing analysis is crucial for unbiased predictions of physical quantities such as magnifications and time delays. While the mass model is optimized by changing parameters of the mass model to match predicted positions of multiple images with observations, positional uncertainties of multiple images often need to be boosted to take account of the complex structure of dark matter in lens objects, making the interpretation of the chi-square value difficult. We introduce the Jackknife method as a new method to validate strong lens mass models, specifically focusing on cluster-scale mass modeling. In this approach, we remove multiple images of a source from the fitting and optimize the mass model using multiple images of the remaining sources. We then calculate the multiple images of the removed source and quantitatively evaluate how well they match the observed positions. We find that the Jackknife method performs effectively in simulations using a simple model. We also demonstrate our method with mass modeling of the galaxy cluster MACS J0647.7+7015. We discuss the potential of using the Jackknife method to validate the error estimation of the physical quantities by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Turning dispersion into signal: density-split analyses of pairwise velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pairwise velocities of the large-scale structure encode valuable information about the growth of structure. They can be observed indirectly through redshift-space distortions and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Whether it is Gaussian or non-Gaussian, pairwise velocity has a broad distribution, but the cosmologically useful information lies primarily in the mean - the streaming velocities; the dispersion around the mean is often treated as a nuisance and marginalized over. This conventional approach reduces the constraining power of our observations. Here, we show that this does not have to be the case, provided the physics behind the dispersion is understood. We demonstrate that by splitting the halo/galaxy samples according to their density environments and measuring the streaming velocities separately, the total signal-to-noise is several times greater than in conventional global measurements of the pairwise velocity distribution (PVD). This improvement arises because the global PVD is a composite of a series of near-Gaussian distributions with different means and dispersions, each determined by its local density environment. Around underdense and overdense regions, the mean streaming velocities are positive and negative, respectively. By splitting the data, we avoid cancellation between these opposing velocities, effectively turning what would be considered dispersion in the global PVD into a signal. Our findings indicate substantial potential for improving the analysis of PVD observations using the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and redshift-space distortions.</description>

      <title>Detecting Modeling Bias with Continuous Time Flow Models on Weak Lensing Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for extracting rich information from nonlinear scales in current and upcoming cosmological surveys, and ensuring its robustness requires stringent validation of forward models. In this work, we recast forward model validation as an out-of-distribution (OoD) detection problem within the framework of machine learning (ML)-based simulation-based inference (SBI). We employ probability density as the metric for OoD detection, and compare various density estimation techniques, demonstrating that field-level probability density estimation via continuous time flow models (CTFM) significantly outperforms feature-level approaches that combine scattering transform (ST) or convolutional neural networks (CNN) with normalizing flows (NFs), as well as NF-based field-level estimators, as quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Our analysis shows that CTFM not only excels in detecting OoD samples but also provides a robust metric for model selection. Additionally, we verified CTFM maintains consistent efficacy across different cosmologies while mitigating the inductive biases inherent in NF architectures. Although our proof-of-concept study employs simplified forward modeling and noise settings, our framework establishes a promising pathway for identifying unknown systematics in the cosmology datasets.</description>

      <title>It's All ${\tt Ok}$: Curvature in Light of BAO from DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) show hints of tension with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) when interpreted within the standard model of cosmology. In this short note we discuss the consequences of one solution to this tension, a small but negative spatial curvature with $R_k = 21 H_0^{-1}$, which DESI measures at $2\sigma$. We describe the physical role of curvature in cosmological distance measures tied to recombination, i.e. the CMB and BAO, and the relation to neutrino mass constraints which are relaxed to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.10$ eV when curvature is allowed to deviate from zero. A robust detection of negative curvature would have significant implications for inflationary models: improved BAO measurements, particularly from future high-redshift spectroscopic surveys, will be able to distinguish curvature from other solutions to the DESI-CMB tension like phantom dark energy at high significance.</description>

      <title>Discovering the Dispersion of Gravitational Waves using Multi-Band Observation including Deci-Hertz: A Unique Probe to Cosmic Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion in the speed of gravitational waves is a novel way to test the general theory of relativity and understand whether the origin of cosmic acceleration is due to any alternative theory of gravity. Several alternative theories of gravity predict dispersion in the gravitational wave signal in a frequency-dependent deviation from the speed of light at lower frequencies than accessible from current ground-based detectors. We show how a multi-band observation of gravitational wave signal combining deci-Hertz gravitational wave signal from LGWA (Lunar Gravitational Wave Antenna) with ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope, and also including LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), we can probe the energy scale associated with effective theory of gravity with a precision of approximately $8.6\%$ by combining only $\mathcal{O}(10)$ high SNR multi-band gravitational wave events. This precision will further improve with the inclusion of more events as $\sqrt{N}$. In the future, this measurement will shed light on an unexplored domain of fundamental physics and will bring deeper insights into the phenomenon of cosmic acceleration. The operation of the gravitational wave detector in the deci-Hertz frequency band is key to exploring this frontier of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Multipoles of the galaxy bispectrum on a light cone: wide-separation and relativistic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The galaxy bispectrum provides access to correlations among different scales that cannot be captured by the power spectrum alone, and with the Stage-IV galaxy surveys it enables the possibility of detecting both primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) and general relativistic effects. Accounting for wide-separation corrections, which arise from the loss of symmetry in the correlation of widely separated points on the past light cone, is essential for their accurate modelling and detection. These corrections can be included perturbatively to the standard bispectrum and we compute them analytically for a generalised line of sight. We include the radial contribution to the wide-separations corrections for the first time. We show that the first-order corrections entering the odd multipoles with respect to the line of sight are large, up to $10 \%$ of the bispectrum monopole, and need to be included when considering the leading-order relativistic effects that could be detectable with surveys like DESI and Euclid. The second-order wide-separation and relativistic contributions, including their mixing terms, have implications for analysis of PNG and we show, for the local type, they can mimic $f_{\rm NL}$ of order 10 in the squeezed limit. We present full analytic expressions for all these contributions to the local bispectrum and its multipoles with a publicly available code for their computation.</description>

Abstract: We present and study a new cross-pairwise estimator to extract the kinetic Sunyaev Zeldovich (kSZ) signal from galaxy clusters. The existing pairwise kSZ method involves pairing clusters with other clusters and stacking them. In the cross-pairwise method, we propose to pair clusters with galaxies from a spectroscopic survey and then do the stacking. Cross-pairing decreases the measurement, instrumentation, and statistical noise, thus boosting the signal-to-noise ratio. However, we also need data from a galaxy survey in addition to the CMB temperature maps and a cluster catalog in order to use this method. We do a Fisher matrix analysis for the optimised pairwise and cross-pairwise estimators and forecast the ability of future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments and galaxy surveys to measure cosmological parameters with the kSZ effect when combined with primary CMB and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data. We show that using the cross-pairwise kSZ estimator leads to a factor of 2(3) improvement in the $1\sigma$ error of the dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ and a factor of 4(6) improvement for the growth rate index $\gamma$ compared to the pairwise estimator, when we pair the clusters from the Simons Observatory (CMB-S4) with the galaxies from the DESI survey.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-$C_\ell$s for spin-$s$ fields with component-wise weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalisation of the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach for power spectrum estimation to the case of spin-$s$ fields weighted by a general positive-definite weight matrix that couples the different spin components of the field (e.g. $Q$ and $U$ maps in CMB polarisation analyses, or $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ shear components in weak lensing). Relevant use cases are, for example, data with significantly anisotropic noise properties, or situations in which different masks must be applied to the different field components. The weight matrix map is separated into a spin-0 part, which corresponds to the "mask" in the standard pseudo-$C_\ell$ approach, and a spin-$2s$ part sourced solely by the anisotropic elements of the matrix, leading to additional coupling between angular scales and $E/B$ modes. The general expressions for the mode-coupling coefficients involving the power spectra of these anisotropic weight components are derived and validated. The generalised algorithm is as computationally efficient as the standard approach. We implement the method in the public code NaMaster.</description>

      <title>FLAMINGO: combining kinetic SZ effect and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements to gauge the impact of feedback on large-scale structure</title>

Abstract: Energetic feedback processes associated with accreting supermassive black holes can expel gas from massive haloes and significantly alter various measures of clustering on ~Mpc scales, potentially biasing the values of cosmological parameters inferred from analyses of large-scale structure (LSS) if not modelled accurately. Here we use the state-of-the-art FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to gauge the impact of feedback on large-scale structure by comparing to Planck + ACT stacking measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect of SDSS BOSS galaxies. We make careful like-with-like comparisons to the observations, aided by high precision KiDS and DES galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements of the BOSS galaxies to inform the selection of the simulated galaxies. In qualitative agreement with several recent studies using dark matter only simulations corrected for baryonic effects, we find that the kSZ effect measurements prefer stronger feedback than predicted by simulations which have been calibrated to reproduce the gas fractions of low redshift X-ray-selected groups and clusters. We find that the increased feedback can help to reduce the so-called S8 tension between the observed and CMB-predicted clustering on small scales as probed by cosmic shear (although at the expense of agreement with the X-ray group measurements). However, the increased feedback is only marginally effective at reducing the reported offsets between the predicted and observed clustering as probed by the thermal SZ (tSZ) effect power spectrum and tSZ effect--weak lensing cross-spectrum, both of which are sensitive to higher halo masses than cosmic shear.</description>

      <title>Cosmology From CMB Lensing and Delensed EE Power Spectra Using 2019-2020 SPT-3G Polarization Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From CMB polarization data alone we reconstruct the CMB lensing power spectrum, comparable in overall constraining power to previous temperature-based reconstructions, and an unlensed E-mode power spectrum. The observations, taken in 2019 and 2020 with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and the SPT-3G camera, cover 1500 deg$^2$ at 95, 150, and 220 GHz with arcminute resolution and roughly 4.9$\mu$K-arcmin coadded noise in polarization. The power spectrum estimates, together with systematic parameter estimates and a joint covariance matrix, follow from a Bayesian analysis using the Marginal Unbiased Score Expansion (MUSE) method. The E-mode spectrum at $\ell&gt;2000$ and lensing spectrum at $L&gt;350$ are the most precise to date. Assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, and using only these SPT data and priors on $\tau$ and absolute calibration from Planck, we find $H_0=66.81\pm0.81$ km/s/Mpc, comparable in precision to the Planck determination and in 5.4$\sigma$ tension with the most precise $H_0$ inference derived via the distance ladder. We also find $S_8=0.850\pm0.017$, providing further independent evidence of a slight tension with low-redshift structure probes. The $\Lambda$CDM model provides a good simultaneous fit to the combined Planck, ACT, and SPT data, and thus passes a powerful test. Combining these CMB datasets with BAO observations, we find that the effective number of neutrino species, spatial curvature, and primordial helium fraction are consistent with standard model values, and that the 95% confidence upper limit on the neutrino mass sum is 0.075 eV. The SPT data are consistent with the somewhat weak preference for excess lensing power seen in Planck and ACT data relative to predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also detect at greater than 3$\sigma$ the influence of non-linear evolution in the CMB lensing power spectrum and discuss it in the context of the $S_8$ tension.(abridged)</description>

      <title>Can dark-matter Q-balls grow to the mass gap masses?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of general relativity, it can be shown that gravitational waves are radiated with the merger of massive compact objects. Such gravitational wave signals are observed on Earth on various detectors, in particular, on Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo. During the operation of these detectors, many events have been detected. Those events are associated with the merger of massive compact objects, however, the nature of some merging objects has not yet been reliably established. This work considers nontopological solitons of dark matter -- Q-balls, as candidates for the role of massive compact objects. In this work one of the simplest models of Q-balls, the mechanism of their birth during a phase transition in the early Universe and the mechanism of their mass gaining during the evolution of the Universe, which is based on their mutual merger, are considered. As a result, it is analyzed whether Q-balls of dark matter can grow to the mass gap masses and be candidates for the role of massive compact objects.</description>

      <title>Can the sound horizon-free measurement of $H_0$ constrain early new physics?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sound horizon-independent $H_0$ extracted by using galaxy clustering surveys data through, e.g., EFTofLSS or ShapeFit analyses, is considered to have the potential to constrain the early new physics responsible for solving the Hubble tension. Recent observations, e.g. DESI, have shown that the sound horizon-independent measurement of $H_0$ is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. In this work, we clarify some potential misuses and misinterpretations in these analyses. On the one hand, imposing some prior from other cosmological probes is often used to strengthen the constraints on the results, however, these priors are usually derived using the assumption of $\Lambda$CDM, it is not suitable to apply these so-called $\Lambda$CDM priors (e.g., the $n_s$ prior from CMB), which would bias the results, to early new physics because these early new physics are usually accompanied by shifts of the $\Lambda$CDM parameters. On the other hand, the constraints on $H_0$ in the sound horizon-independent EFTofLSS analysis arise from not only the shape of the power spectrum ($k_\text{eq}$-based $H_0$), but also the overall amplitude (when combined with CMB lensing observations) and the relative amplitudes of the BAO wiggles, thus besides $k_\text{eq}$ other information may also play a role in constraining $H_0$. We also make forecasts for an Euclid-like survey, which suggest that ongoing observations will also have difficulty constraining early new physics.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a universal phenomenon: it affects both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic signals travelling through the gravitational field of a massive object. In this work, we explore the prospects of observing lensed GW signals from the mergers of massive black holes, lensed by dark matter halos composed of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), which form dense cores known as solitons. We focus on wave optics phenomena, where frequency-dependent signatures can be observed in the weak lensing regime (i.e. single-image). Our results show that lensing diffraction signatures differ for low-mass halos in FDM, and can reveal the presence of a solitonic core. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FDM and cold dark matter profiles can be distinguished in GW signals from binary massive black hole mergers, which will be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. However, the dense solitonic core does not substantially enhance the detectability of FDM halos at large source-lens offsets, relative to standard cold dark matter. Our analysis confirms FDM halos as a promising signature of dark matter on GW observations</description>

      <title>Constraints on axion-like ultralight dark matter from observations of the HL Tauri protoplanetary disk</title>

Abstract: Dark matter may consist of axion-like particles (ALPs). When polarized electromagnetic radiation passes through the dark-matter media, interaction with background ALPs affects the polarization of photons. The condensate of axionic dark matter experiences periodic oscillations, and the period of the oscillations is of order of years for ultra-light dark matter. This would result in observable periodic changes in the polarization plane, determined by the phases of the ALP field at the Earth and at the source. In this paper, we use recent polarimetric observations of the HL Tauri protoplanetary disk performed in different years to demonstrate the lack of changes of polarization angles, and hence to constrain masses and photon couplings of the hypothetical axion-like ultralight dark matter.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the formation of type II primordial black holes (PBHs) resulting from extremely large amplitudes of initial fluctuations in a radiation-dominated universe. We find that, for a sufficiently large initial amplitude, the configuration of trapping horizons shows characteristic structure due to the existence of bifurcating trapping horizons. We call this type of configuration of the trapping horizons type II-B PBH, while the structure without a bifurcating trapping horizon type II-A PBH. In Ref. [1], in the dust-dominated universe, the type B PBH can be realized by the type II initial fluctuation, which is characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius as a function of the radial coordinate (throat structure) in contrast with the standard case, type A PBH with a monotonic areal radius (type I fluctuation). Our research reveals that a type II fluctuation does not necessarily result in a type B PBH in the radiation-dominated case. We also find that for an initial amplitude well above the threshold value, the resulting PBH mass may either increase or decrease with the initial amplitude, depending on its specific profile rather than its fluctuation type.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the phenomenology of dark-matter (DM) scenarios within radius-stabilized Randall-Sundrum models. Specifically, we consider models where the dark matter candidates are Standard Model (SM) singlets confined to the TeV brane and interact with the SM via spin-2 and spin-0 gravitational Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. We compute the thermal relic density of DM particles in these models by applying recent work showing that scattering amplitudes of massive spin-2 KK states involve an intricate cancellation between various diagrams. Considering the resulting DM abundance, collider searches, and the absence of a signal in direct DM detection experiments, we show that spin-2 KK portal DM models are highly constrained. We confirm that within the usual thermal freeze-out scenario, scalar dark matter models are essentially ruled out. In contrast, we show that fermion and vector dark matter models are viable in a region of parameter space in which dark matter annihilation through a KK graviton is resonant. Specifically, vector models are viable for dark matter masses ranging from 1.1 TeV to 5.5 TeV for theories in which the scale of couplings of the KK modes is of order 40 TeV or lower. Fermion dark matter models are viable for a similar mass region, but only for KK coupling scales of order 20 TeV. In this work, we provide a complete description of the calculations needed to arrive at these results and, in an appendix, a discussion of new KK-graviton couplings needed for the computations, which have not previously been discussed in the literature. Here, we focus on models in which the radion is light, and the back-reaction of the radion stabilization dynamics on the gravitational background can be neglected. The phenomenology of a model with a heavy radion and the consideration of the effects of the radion stabilization dynamics on the DM abundance are being addressed in forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>Detection of Unresolved Strongly Lensed Supernovae with 7-Dimensional Telescope</title>

Abstract: Gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) are a powerful tool for exploring the realms of astronomy and cosmology. Time-delay measurements and lens modeling of glSNe can provide a robust and independent method for constraining the expansion rate of the universe. The study of unresolved glSNe light curves presents a unique opportunity for utilizing small telescopes to investigate these systems. In this work, we investigate diverse observational strategies for the initial detection of glSNe using the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT), a multitelescope system composed of twenty 50-cm telescopes. We implement different observing strategies on a subset of 5807 strong lensing systems and candidates identified within the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), as reported in various publications. Our simulations under ideal observing conditions indicate the maximum expected annual detection rates for various glSNe types (Type Ia and core-collapse (CC)) using the 7DT target observing mode in the $r$-band at a depth of 22.04 mag, as follows: 7.46 events for type Ia, 2.49 for type Ic, 0.8 for type IIb, 0.52 for type IIL, 0.78 for type IIn, 3.75 for type IIP, and 1.15 for type Ib. Furthermore, in the case of medium-band filter observations (m6000) at a depth of 20.61 in the Wide-field Time-domain Survey (WTS)program, the predicted detection rate for glSNe Ia is 2.53 $yr^{-1}$. Given targeted follow-up observations of these initially detected systems with more powerful telescopes, we can apply a model-independent approach to forecast the ability to measure $H_{0}$ using a Gaussian process from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) data and time-delay distance information derived from glSNe systems, which include both Ia and CC types. We forecast that the expected detection rate of glSNe systems can achieve a $2.7\%$ precision in estimating the $H_{0}$.</description>

      <title>The Merging Galaxy Cluster Environment Affects the Morphology of Radio-AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has previously been found that the galaxy cluster environment can affect the fueling and evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This work examines the effect of the merging cluster environment on the properties of radio-AGN by comparing the radio morphology of cluster members in a sample of four merging and eight relaxed galaxy clusters at low redshift (z&lt;0.2). Using 144-MHz data from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and Zooniverse, we classify the radio morphology of the radio-detected cluster members using the following morphology classes: compact, compact extended, extended, jetted, and disturbed. We find that the merging cluster environment has a statistically significant, higher population proportion of disturbed (bent and head tail) sources, indicating that the merging environment can affect the morphology of cluster radio-AGN. We also investigate the number of AGN that are detected in the radio data only, and the number that are detected in both the radio and optical data in mergers and non-mergers. We find that the merging cluster environment has a higher population proportion of AGN that are identified only as radio-AGN compared to AGN that are identified as both radio and optical AGN. Overall, we find that the merging environment affects certain radio-AGN (disturbed and only radio identified AGN), but not all.</description>

      <title>Modeling Galaxies in the Early Universe with Supernova Dust Attenuation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernova may be the dominant channel by which dust grains accumulate in galaxies during the first Gyr of cosmic time as formation channels important for lower redshift galaxies, e.g., AGB stars and grain growth, may not have had sufficient time to take over. Supernovae (SNe) produce fewer small grains, leading to a flatter attenuation law. In this work, we fit observations of 138 spectroscopically confirmed $z&gt;6$ galaxies adopting standard spectral energy distribution modeling assumptions and compare standard attenuation law prescriptions to a flat attenuation law. Compared to SMC dust, flat attenuation close to what may be expected from dust produced in SNe yields up to $0.5$ mag higher $A_V$, and $0.4$ dex larger stellar masses. It also finds better fits to the rest-frame UV photometry with lower $\chi^2_{\rm UV}$, allowing the observed UV luminosities taken from the models to be fainter by $0.2$ dex on average. The systematically fainter observed UV luminosities for fixed observed photometry could help resolve current tension between the ionizing photon production implied by \textit{JWST} observations and the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction. Given these systematic effects and the physical constraint of cosmic time itself, fairly flat attenuation laws that could represent the properties of dust grain produced by SNe should be a standard consideration in fitting to the spectral energy distributions of $z&gt;6$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>Intracluster light is a biased tracer of the dark matter distribution in clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffuse stellar component of galaxy clusters known as intracluster light (ICL) has been proposed as an observable tracer of the cluster's dark matter (DM) halo. Assessing its reliability as a DM tracer requires understanding how the intracluster stars are energetically linked to the underlying DM distribution, which we investigate at $z\approx0$ in 12 galaxy clusters with $M_{178} = 1.18 - 3.71 \times 10^{14}\,\textrm{M}_\odot$ from the Horizon-AGN simulation. We quantify the orbital energies of these components by their mean specific energies ${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$, and find that this quantity is $\approx$ 25 per cent lower for the intracluster stars than the DM, whilst the energetics of the satellite galaxies (a standard DM tracer) are only marginally ($\approx$ 5 per cent) higher than the DM. Importantly, the lower ${\langle \varepsilon \rangle}$ of the intracluster stars compared to the DM is robust against the precise separation between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the ICL. The specific energy distribution of ICL stars is concentrated towards lower energies and poorly samples the higher energies, where much of the DM resides. Consequently, the intracluster stars have velocity distributions with lower typical speeds and a more centrally-concentrated density profile than the DM. We also find that intracluster stars have more radially-biased orbits than the DM, indicating these components have distinct orbital distributions. This study demonstrates that although the morphology of the ICL may match the DM halo, the ICL is a biased tracer of DM, and these biases must be understood in order to infer properties of the DM from the ICL.</description>

      <title>Relic gravitational waves from primordial gravitational collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A large primordial density perturbation of the Hubble scale will gravitationally collapse, generating an outgoing sound shell whether or not a primordial black hole (PBH) is formed. In this Letter, we report a new source of the stochastic gravitational wave background induced by the collision of sound shells in the early Universe. The peak frequency and amplitude in the GW spectrum depend on the Hubble horizon and the abundance of sound shells. Abundant density perturbations would lead to GW backgrounds potentially detectable for future pulsar timing arrays and ground-based/space-borne detectors. For those perturbations that collapse into PBHs, future null detection of the corresponding high-frequency GW background could put new observational constraints on those PBHs that have already evaporated.</description>
