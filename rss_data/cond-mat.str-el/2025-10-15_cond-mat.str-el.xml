      <title>The Kitaev-AKLT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, we present exact solutions for a spin-1 chain with Kitaev-like couplings. We consider an expanded Kitaev model with bilinear and biquadratic terms. At an exactly solvable point, the Hamiltonian can be reexpressed as a sum of projection operators. Unlike the AKLT model where projectors act on total spin, we project onto components of spin along the bond direction. This leads to exponential ground state degeneracy, expressed in terms of fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ objects. Each ground state can be expressed concisely as a matrix product state. We construct a phase diagram by varying the relative strength of bilinear and biquadratic terms. The fractionalized states provide a qualitative picture for the spin-1 Kitaev model, yielding approximate forms for the ground state and low-lying excitations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Q spin-valley order in twisted WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a study of the interacting phase diagram of $3.65^\circ$-twisted WSe$_2$ at moir\'e hole filling $\nu=1$, in which we find previously-overlooked types of magnetism. Specifically, in part of the phase diagram we obtain a magnetic order parameter which modulates in space with four different non-zero wave vectors, corresponding to the three $M$-points and one $K$-point of the moir\'e Brillouin zone. These multi-Q orders, which can be coplanar or non-coplanar, are continuous deformations of the $120^\circ$ spin-valley anti-ferromagnet (AFM), where the unit cell has expanded by a factor of four. Interestingly, we find that the multi-Q states are stabilized for experimentally relevant values of interaction strength and displacement field, and are accompanied by a softening of the spin fluctuations near the $M$-points of the moir\'e</description>

      <title>Exotic Surface Stripe Orders in Correlated Kagome Metal CsCr3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly discovered kagome superconductor CsCr3Sb5 exhibits distinct features with flat bands and unique magnetism, providing a compelling platform for exploring novel quantum states of correlated electron systems. Emergent charge order in this material is a key for understanding unconventional superconductivity, but it remains unexplored at the atomic scale and the underlying physics is elusive. Here, we identify and unreported stripe orders on the surface which are distinct from the bulk and investigate the underlying bulk electronic properties using a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Specifically, a mixture of 2a0 * a0 and 3a0 * a0 stripe order is found on Cs-terminated surface while 4a0 * root3a0 stripe order is found on the Sb-terminated surface. The electronic spectra exhibit strongly correlated features resembling that of high temperature superconductors, with kagome flat bands lying about 330 meV above EF, suggesting that the electron correlations arise from Coulomb interactions and Hund's coupling. Moreover, a distinct electron-boson coupling mode is observed at approximately 100 meV. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between surface and bulk charge orders in this strongly correlated kagome system.</description>

      <title>Polarization dependency in Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering (RIXS) is a well-established tool for probing excitations in a wide range of materials. The measured spectra strongly depend on the scattering geometry, via its influence on the polarization of the incoming and outgoing light. By employing a tensor representation of the 4-point response function that governs the RIXS intensity, we disentangle the experimental geometry from the intrinsic material properties. In dipole-dipole RIXS processes and low-symmetry crystals, up to 81 linearly independent fundamental spectra can be measured as a function of light polarization. However, for crystals or molecules with symmetry, the number of independent fundamental spectra that define the RIXS tensor is significantly reduced.
  This work presents a systematic framework for determining the number of fundamental spectra and expressing the RIXS tensor in terms of these fundamental components. Given a specific experimental geometry, the measured spectrum can be represented as a linear combination of these fundamental spectra. To validate our approach, we performed calculations for different point group symmetries, both with and without an applied magnetic field. Within the same framework, we derived expressions for powder spectra in momentum-independent processes and spectra obtained using Bragg spectrometers. This formalism provides a valuable toolkit for optimizing experiment planning, data interpretation, and RIXS simulation.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate Twisted Bilayer Graphene: emerging quasi-periodicity and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a lattice model of Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG). The presence of incommensurate angles produces an emerging quasi-periodicity manifesting itself in large momenta Umklapp interactions that almost connect the Dirac points. We rigorously establish the stability of the semimetallic phase via a Renormalization Group analysis combined with number theoretical properties of irrationals, similar to the ones used in Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory for the stability of invariant tori. The interlayer hopping is weak and short ranged and the angles are chosen in a large measure set. The result provides a justification, in the above regime, to the effective continuum description of TBG in which large momenta interlayer interactions are neglected.</description>

      <title>Entanglement spectrum of gapless topological phases: a case study with topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using bulk gapless topological superconductors in both 1d and 2d as free fermion model examples, we demonstrate the power of subsystem correlation spectrum (the spectrum of correlation matrix), or equivalently the entanglement spectrum for the case of free fermions, in characterizing the topology of the non-trivial ground state. For the systems considered, we show that signatures of the lowenergy spectrum, including both the edge modes and the bulk modes, appear in the correlation spectrum, albeit with different behaviors. This work generalizes the 2d Li-Haldane entanglement spectrum characterization of topological edge states to 2d topological systems with gapless bulk.</description>

      <title>Interplay of magnetic and thermodynamic responses in the kagome-triangular system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the recent experimental progress in pyrochlore derivative \ce{RE3Sb3A2O14 (A=Mg, Zn)}, we investigate the Hubbard model on the kagome lattice with an additional hopping $t'/t$, which enables continuous interpolation between the kagome and triangular lattices by using determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We analyze the evolution of magnetic correlations and thermodynamic responses across different values of $t'/t$ and on-site interaction $U$. It is found that increasing $t'/t$ suppresses short-range antiferromagnetic correlations, while the next-nearest-neighbor correlations exhibit a sign change near $t'/t \approx 0.3 \text{--} 0.4$. Within this regime, the specific heat shows a pronounced low-temperature peak, indicating an emergent spin-related energy scale. Increasing $U$ enhances magnetic correlations and shifts the associated $t'/t$ crossover points to larger values. We also discuss the sign problem to clarify which parameter region of our numerical simulations is accessible and reliable. Our results uncover the competition between frustration and correlations and the interplay of magnetic and thermodynamic responses in the kagome lattice, providing insights into correlated states in frustrated materials.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transition driven by competing charge-order fluctuations in 1T'-TaTe$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions, characterized by a discontinuous change in the order parameter, are intriguing phenomena in condensed matter physics. However, the underlying, material-specific, microscopic mechanisms often remain unclear. Here, we unveil a high-temperature incommensurate charge-order precursor with the wave vector $\mathbf{q}^* = (0, \frac{1}{4}+\delta, \frac{1}{2})$ in the 1T' phase of TaTe$_2$, which competes with fluctuating high-temperature Ta trimer bonding states at $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CO} =(0, \frac{1}{3}, 0)$. The precursor state follows the temperature dependence of the hidden incommensurability of the $\textit{quasi}$-1D nested Fermi surface. In contrast, the low-temperature commensurate charge order at $\mathbf{q}_\mathrm{CO}$, characterized by a charge disproportionation of the inequivalent Ta sites, appears to be driven by local chemical bonding. Dynamical lattice calculations identify an imaginary optical mode at $\mathbf{q}^*$, involving an in-plane vibration of the Ta atoms forming a chain-like structure that renormalizes below $T_\mathrm{CO}$. Our experimental and theoretical observations suggest that the controversial first-order phase transition, as captured by phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory, results from the competition between two order parameters: one involving Fermi surface nesting and the other involving local chemical bonding.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a field-induced Lifshitz transition in the Weyl semimetal CeAlSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weyl semimetal CeAlSi crystallises in the noncentrosymmetric tetragonal space group $I4_1md$ and exhibits ferromagnetic order below 8 K, thereby breaking both spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetries. This unique combination of properties establishes CeAlSi as a model system for studying the interplay between non-trivial topological states and strong electron correlations. In this work, we report observations of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the electrical resistivity under magnetic fields up to 68 T applied parallel to the [001] crystallographic axis. Our measurements reveal an abrupt change in the oscillation frequencies near 14 T, which is indicative of a field-induced Lifshitz transition. Additionally, our results are consistent with the ferromagnetic order bringing the Weyl nodes closer to the Fermi level in CeAlSi. Furthermore, they suggest that the RKKY interaction plays an important role.</description>

      <title>Excitonic correlations in the equilibrium and voltage-biased bilayer Hubbard model: multi-orbital two-particle self-consistent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a nonequilibrium multi-orbital extension of the two-particle self-consistent theory and apply it to the bilayer Hubbard model as a minimal platform to investigate correlation effects in the presence of interlayer interactions and tunneling. The method determines vertex corrections in the spin and charge channels self-consistently at the two-particle level, thereby avoiding the spurious finite-temperature phase transitions that limit dynamical mean-field theory in two dimensions. We derive the spectral self-energy and implement the framework directly on the real-frequency axis within the Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's function formalism, enabling the treatment of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states without relying on numerical analytic continuation. As an application, we demonstrate that a pseudogap can emerge in the bilayer Hubbard model when spin, charge, or excitonic fluctuations become sufficiently strong. Instabilities in different channels are also evaluated in an unbiased manner across the parameter space. Remarkably, we find that the excitonic susceptibility grows with increasing interlayer bias, before it gets suppressed at large biases by the charge imbalance between the layers. This work establishes a versatile and computationally efficient framework for investigating correlated multi-orbital systems under nonequilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Structural origin of resonant diffraction in RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report Ru L$_3$-edge resonant X-ray diffraction studies on single crystal and (001) epitaxial films of RuO$_2$. We investigate the distinct $\mathbf{Q} = (100)$ and $(001)$ reflections as a function of incident energy, azimuthal angle, and temperature. The results show that the observed resonant diffraction in RuO$_2$ is fully consistent with a resonant charge anisotropy signal of structural origin permitted by the parent (non-magnetic) rutile $P4_2/mnm$ space group. These results significantly constrain the magnetic contribution to the resonant diffraction signal and indicate the unlikely existence of $\mathbf{k} = 0$ antiferromagnetic order in RuO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum Mpemba effect in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a fundamental role in many-body systems, both in and out of equilibrium. The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) - a phenomenon where systems initially farther from equilibrium can thermalize faster - can be understood in terms of how rapidly a symmetry, broken by initial conditions, is dynamically restored. In this work, we study the QME in a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XYZ model with power-law decaying interactions in the presence of a magnetic field. In the prethermal regime generated by large field strengths, the system develops a continuous U(1) symmetry, enabling the QME to emerge. However, due to the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the QME can only arise when interactions are sufficiently short-ranged. This leads to an interplay between the external field, interaction range, and dynamical symmetry restoration. We systematically explore this interplay and analyze the dependence of the QME on the effective temperature set by the initial state. Our results demonstrate the tunability of the QME via long-range interactions, which can be probed in experimental platforms of trapped ions, polar molecules, and NV centers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how crystalline inversion symmetry can be dynamically broken by optical phonons with generic, hardening Kerr-like non-linearities. The symmetry-broken state is reached through a parametric instability that can be accessed by driving close to half the phonon resonance. After the onset of the instability, the system settles to a steady state with inversion-symmetry breaking phonon trajectories and strong second harmonic generation. The time averaged positions of the atoms are displaced relative to equilibrium in the steady state, resulting in a rectification of the driving signal.</description>

      <title>Flat bands in condensed-matter systems -- perspective for magnetism and superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a recent upsurge of interests in flat bands in condensed-matter systems and the consequences for magnetism and superconductivity. This article highlights the physics, where peculiar quantum-mechanical mechanisms for the physical properties such as flatband ferromagnetism and flatband superconductivity that arise when the band is not trivially flat but has a strange Hilbert space with non-orthogonalisable Wannier states, which goes far beyond just the diverging density of states. Peculiar wavefunctions come from a quantum-mechanical interference and entanglement. Interesting phenomena become even remarkable when many-body interactions are introduced, culminating in flatband superconductivity as well as flatband ferromagnetism. Flatband physics harbours a very wide range physics indeed, extending to non-equilibrium physics in laser illumination, where Floquet states for topologcial superconductivity is promoted in flatbands. While these are theoretically curious, possible candidates for the flatband materials are beginning to emerge, which is also described. These provide a wide and promising outlook.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of superconductivity in bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at 80 K and the increased superconducting transition temperature, $T_\text{c}$, up to 92 K in single crystals of La$_2$SmNi$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we systematically study the effect of Sm doping on the superconductivity and structure of La$_{3-x}$Sm$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (0 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 1.5) under pressure. Experimental investigations in polycrystalline samples reveal that Sm doping monotonically decreases the lattice constants $c$ and $a$, thereby enhancing crystal structure distortion and leading to an evolution of the metallic ground state in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ to an insulating state in La$_{1.5}$Sm$_{1.5}$Ni$_2$O$_7$. The maximum onset $T_\text{c}$ in compounds $x=0.9$ and 1.5 is 89 K, while the pressure that drives the emergence of superconductivity is higher for higher doping levels. The results suggest that the enhancement of $T_\text{c}$ in La$_{3-x}$Sm$_x$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is mainly affected by the compressed $c$ lattice before saturation, and the structure transition is critical for the emergence of superconductivity. Our experimental results provide insight into the influence of elemental substitution on nickelate superconductors, offering a means to increase the transition temperature further.</description>

      <title>Emergent Discrete Time Crystals on Digital Quantum Computers: Boundary-Protected and Ancilla-Induced Disorder Mechanisms of Thermalization Slowdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven (Floquet) systems typically evolve toward an infinite-temperature thermal state due to continuous energy absorption. Before reaching equilibrium, however, they can transiently exhibit long-lived prethermal states that host exotic nonequilibrium phenomena, such as discrete time crystals (DTCs). In this study, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of periodically driven product states in a kicked Ising model implemented on the IBM Quantum Eagle and Heron processors. By using ancilla qubits to mediate interactions, we construct Kagome and Lieb lattices on superconducting qubits with heavy-hex connectivity. We identify two distinct types of noise-induced DTCs on Kagome and Lieb lattices, both arising from quantum noise in ancilla qubits. Type-I DTCs originate from robust boundary-mode period-doubling oscillations, stabilized by symmetry charge pumping, that are redistributed into the bulk due to ancilla noise. Type-II DTCs, in contrast, emerge in systems without charge-pumped qubits, where quantum noise unexpectedly stabilizes period-doubling oscillations that would otherwise rapidly decay. On the noisier Eagle device (ibm_kyiv), we observe both type-I and type-II DTCs on 53-qubit Kagome lattices with and without charge-pumped qubits, respectively. In contrast, on the lower-noise Heron device (ibm_marrakesh), period-doubling oscillations are confined to boundary-localized oscillations on 82-qubit Kagome and 40-qubit Lieb lattices, as redistribution into the bulk is suppressed. These experimental findings are supported by noisy matrix-product-state simulations, in which ancilla noise is modeled as random sign flips in the two-qubit gate rotation angles. Our results demonstrate that quantum noise in ancilla qubits can give rise to novel classes of prethermal dynamical phases, including boundary-protected and noise-induced DTCs.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee edge singularity and quantum criticality in non-Hermitian PXP model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for quantum criticality in the non-Hermitian detuned PXP model, and establish the complete phase diagram, which had remained elusive in previous studies. Starting from a numerically identified phase transition point, we construct an exact second-order phase transition boundary through a similarity transformation in the real-energy regime. By introducing the biorthogonal entanglement entropy and biorthogonal Loschmidt echo, we demonstrate from both equilibrium and nonequilibrium perspectives that this transition belongs to the Ising universality class. Using the correlation function, we further distinguish between confined and deconfined phases within the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric region. In the complex-energy regime, we identify both a full $\mathcal{PT}$ transition and a first-excited-state $\mathcal{PT}$ transition, respectively. Moreover, we identify the location of the Yang-Lee edge singularity (YLES) using both the associated-biorthogonal and self-normal Loschmidt echoes, and extract the corresponding critical exponent, which agrees with the predictions of non-unitary conformal field theory. Finally, we propose an experimental scheme to observe the YLES in Rydberg atomic arrays, which offers a promising route to exploring non-Hermitian critical phenomena and singularities in future experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Structure and magnetism of MnGe thin films grown with a non-magnetic CrSi template</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a novel method to grow B20 MnGe thin films which employs an ultrathin CrSi template layer on Si(111). This layer is expected to be non-magnetic, in contrast to MnSi and FeGe buffer layers that have been used previously, allowing an investigation of the intrinsic properties the MnGe in the ultrathin film limit without the influence of a neighboring magnetic layer. Single-phase MnGe(111) films were grown with thicknesses between 2 and 40 nm, which exhibited low interfacial roughnesses on the order of 0.6 nm. The films crystallized in a B20 structure with a small rhombohedral distortion. Magnetometry measurements in out-of-plane fields are consistent with a conical state. However, an unexpected remanent moment develops below 35 K, concomitant with features in the field dependence of the transport data. This provides indirect evidence for the presence of a low-temperature phase which has been identified by others as either a triple-Q topological spin-hedgehog lattice, or a multi-domain single-Q conical state.</description>

      <title>Phonons in Electron Crystals with Berry Curvature</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D materials featuring nonzero Berry curvature have inspired extensions of the Wigner crystallization paradigm. This paper derives a low-energy effective theory for such quantum crystals, including the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC) with nonzero Chern number. First we show that the low frequency dispersion of phonons in AHC, despite the presence of Berry curvature, resembles that of the zero field (rather than finite magnetic field) Wigner crystal due to the commutation of translation generators. We explain how key parameters of the phonon theory such as elastic constants and effective mass can be extracted from microscopic models, and apply them to two families of models: the recently introduced $\lambda$-jellium model and a model of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In the $\lambda$-jellium model, we explore the energy landscape as crystal geometry shifts, revealing that AHC can become `soft' under certain conditions. This causes transitions in lattice geometry, although the quantized Hall response remains unchanged. Surprisingly, the Berry curvature seems to enhance the effective mass, leading to a reduction in phonon speed. For the AHC in RMG, we obtain estimates of phonon speed and shear stiffness. We also identify a previously overlooked `kineo-elastic' term in the phonon effective action that is present in the symmetry setting of RMG, and leads to dramatic differences in phonon speeds in opposite directions. We numerically confirm these predictions of the effective actions by time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations.</description>

      <title>The beginning of the endpoint bootstrap for conformal line defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A challenge in the study of conformal field theory (CFT) is to characterize the possible defects in specific bulk CFTs. Given the success of numerical bootstrap techniques applied to the characterization of bulk CFTs, it is desirable to develop similar tools to study conformal defects. In this work, we successfully demonstrate this possibility for endable conformal line defects. We achieve this by incorporating the endpoints of a conformal line defect into the numerical four-point bootstrap and exploit novel crossing symmetry relations that mix bulk and defect CFT data in a way that further possesses positivity, so that rigorous numerical bootstrap techniques are applicable. We implement this approach for the pinning field line defect of the $3d$ Ising CFT, obtaining estimates of its defect CFT data that agree well with other recent estimates, particularly those obtained via the fuzzy sphere regularization. An interesting consequence of our bounds is nearly rigorous evidence that the $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric defect exhibiting long range order obtained as a direct sum of two conjugate pinning field defects is unstable to domain wall proliferation.</description>

      <title>Strain-tunable anomalous Hall effect in hexagonal MnTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to control and manipulate time-reversal ($T$) symmetry-breaking phases with near-zero net magnetization is a sought-after goal in spintronic devices. The recently discovered hexagonal altermagnet manganese telluride ($\alpha$-MnTe) is a prime example. It has a compensated altermagnetic ground state where the magnetic moments are aligned in each layer and stacked antiparallel along the $c$ axis, yet it exhibits a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that breaks the $T$-symmetry with a vanishingly small $c$-axis ferromagnetic (FM) moment. However, the presence of three 120$^\circ$ separated in-plane magnetic domains presents a challenge in understanding the origin of the AHE and the effective control of the altermagnetic state. Here we use neutron scattering to show that a compressive uniaxial strain along the next-nearest-neighbor Mn-Mn bond direction detwins $\alpha$-MnTe into a single in-plane magnetic domain, aligning the in-plane moments along the same axis. Furthermore, we find that uniaxial strain (-0.2% to 0.1%) significantly sharpens the magnetic hysteresis loop and switches the sign of the AHE near room temperature. Remarkably, this is achieved without altering the altermagnetic phase-transition temperature or substantially changing the small $c$-axis FM moment. Combined with our phenomenological model, we argue that these effects result from the modification of the electronic Berry curvature by a combination of both spin-orbit coupling and strain. Our work not only unambiguously establishes the relationship between the in-plane moment direction and the AHE in $\alpha$-MnTe but also paves the way for future applications in highly scalable, strain-tunable magnetic sensors and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Consistent gauge theories for the slave particle representation of the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to clarify the confusion and inconsistency in our recent works [1,2], and to address the incompleteness therein. In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints must be BRST-exact. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and the density matrix renormalisation group in the generalised Landau paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fields of entanglement theory and tensor networks have recently emerged as central tools for characterising quantum phases of matter. In this article, we determine the entanglement structure of ground states of gapped symmetric quantum lattice models, and use this to obtain the most efficient tensor network representation of those ground states. We do this by showing that degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum arise through a duality transformation of the original model to the unique dual model where the entire dual (generalised) symmetry is spontaneously broken and subsequently no degeneracies are present. Physically, this duality transformation amounts to a (twisted) gauging of the unbroken symmetry in the original ground state. This result has strong implications for the complexity of simulating many-body systems using variational tensor network methods. For every phase in the phase diagram, the dual representation of the ground state that completely breaks the symmetry minimises both the entanglement entropy and the required number of variational parameters. We demonstrate the applicability of this idea by developing a generalised density matrix renormalisation group algorithm that works on (dual) constrained Hilbert spaces, and quantify the computational gains obtained over traditional tensor network methods in a perturbed Heisenberg model. Our work testifies to the usefulness of generalised non-invertible symmetries and their formal category theoretic description for the practical simulation of strongly correlated systems.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental discovery of superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, we investigate the pairing mechanism arising from the density-density interactions within the random-phase approximation. This approach successfully highlights the dominance of the chiral $p$-wave pairing between electrons with the same spin and valley index at low densities, while also predicting the superconducting range in agreement with experimental findings. Furthermore, we examine the characteristics of distinct superconducting regions: SC1 and SC2 exhibit chiral finite-momentum superconductivity with pronounced phase fluctuations, whereas SC4 displays zero-momentum superconductivity, with its transition temperature constrained by the pairing strength.</description>

Abstract: Dark current in silicon-based blocked impurity band (BIB) infrared detectors has long been a critical limitation on device performance. This work proposes a chiral-phonon-assisted spin current model at interfaces to explain the parabolic-like dark current behavior observed at low bias voltages. Concurrently, the spatially-confined charge transport theory is employed to elucidate the dark current generation mechanism across the entire operational voltage range.</description>
