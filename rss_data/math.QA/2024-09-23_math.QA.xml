      <title>$L_1(\mathfrak{psl}_{n|n})$ from BRST reductions, associated varieties and nilpotent orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We verify a conjecture of Beem and the first author stating that a certain family of physically motivated BRST reductions of beta-gamma systems and free fermions is isomorphic to $L_1(\mathfrak{psl}_{n|n})$, and that its associated variety is isomorphic as a Poisson variety to the minimal nilpotent orbit closure $\overline{\mathbb{O}_{\mathrm{min}}(\mathfrak{sl}_n)}$. This shows in particular that $L_1(\mathfrak{psl}_{n|n})$ is quasi-lisse. Combining this with other results in the literature (in particular work of Ballin et al.), this paper provides a concrete and important example of how one can extract two symplectic dual varieties from a rather well-known vertex operator algebra.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Lie bialgebras via affinization of perm bialgebras and pre-Lie bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the operads of perm algebras and pre-Lie algebras are the Koszul dual each other and hence there is a Lie algebra structure on the tensor product of a perm algebra and a pre-Lie algebra. Conversely, we construct a special perm algebra structure and a special pre-Lie algebra structure on the vector space of Laurent polynomials such that the tensor product with a pre-Lie algebra and a perm algebra being a Lie algebra structure characterizes the pre-Lie algebra and the perm algebra respectively. This is called the affinization of a pre-Lie algebra and a perm algebra respectively. Furthermore we extend such correspondences to the context of bialgebras, that is, there is a bialgebra structure for a perm algebra or a pre-Lie algebra which could be characterized by the fact that its affinization by a quadratic pre-Lie algebra or a quadratic perm algebra respectively gives an infinite-dimensional Lie bialgebra. In the case of perm algebras, the corresponding bialgebra structure is called a perm bialgebra, which can be independently characterized by a Manin triple of perm algebras as well as a matched pair of perm algebras. The notion of the perm Yang-Baxter equation is introduced, whose symmetric solutions give rise to perm bialgebras. There is a correspondence between symmetric solutions of the perm Yang-Baxter equation in perm algebras and certain skew-symmetric solutions of the classical Yang-Baxter equation in the infinite-dimensional Lie algebras induced from the perm algebras. In the case of pre-Lie algebras, the corresponding bialgebra structure is a pre-Lie bialgebra which is well-constructed. The similar correspondences for the related structures are given.</description>

      <title>Divided Power Integral forms of Affine Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we shall prove that the integral subalgebra generated by the divided powers of the Drinfeld generators of an affine Kac-Moody algebra is an integral form. We compare this integral form with the analogous one derived from the Chevalley generators studied by Mitzman and Garland. We shall prove that the integral forms coincide outside the twisted A type, and that it is strictly smaller in the latter case. Moreover, if the rank of the algebra is greater than one, a completely new fact emerges: the subalgebra generated by the imaginary vectors is, in fact, not a polynomial algebra, and we describe its structure. To address this problem, we introduce two other integral forms in the low-rank case in order to obtain the desired polynomial property.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric polynomials and algebro-combinatorial duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we develop a systematic combinatorial definition for constructed earlier supersymmetric polynomial families. These polynomial families generalize canonical Schur, Jack and Macdonald families so that the new polynomials depend on odd Grassmann variables as well. Members of these families are labeled by respective modifications of Young diagrams. We show that the super-Macdonald polynomials form a representation of a super-algebra analog $\mathsf{T}(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_{1|1})$ of Ding-Ioahara-Miki (quantum toroidal) algebra, emerging as a BPS algebra of D-branes on a conifold. A supersymmetric modification for Young tableaux and Kostka numbers are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Frobenius algebra objects in Temperley-Lieb categories at roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new definition of a Frobenius structure on an algebra object in a monoidal category, generalising Frobenius algebras in the category of vector spaces. Our definition allows Frobenius forms valued in objects other than the unit object, and can be seen as a categorical version of Frobenius extensions of the second kind. When the monoidal category is pivotal we define a Nakayama morphism for the Frobenius structure and explain what it means for this morphism to have finite order.
  Our main example is a well-studied algebra object in the (additive and idempotent completion of the) Temperley-Lieb category at a root of unity. We show that this algebra has a Frobenius structure and that its Nakayama morphism has order 2. As a consequence, we obtain information about Nakayama morphisms of preprojective algebras of Dynkin type, considered as algebras over the semisimple algebras on their vertices.</description>
