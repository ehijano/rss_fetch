      <title>Random phase approximation-based local natural orbital coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical applications of fragment embedding and closely related local correlation methods critically depend on a judicious choice of a low-level theory to define the local embedding subspace and to capture long-range electrostatic and correlation effects outside the embedding region. Second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) is by far the most widely used correlated low-level theory; however, its applicability becomes questionable in systems where MP2 is known to fail either quantitatively or qualitatively. In this work, we present the random phase approximation (RPA) as a promising alternative low-level theory to MP2 within the local natural orbital-based coupled-cluster (LNO-CC) framework. We demonstrate that RPA-based LNO-CC closely matches the performance of its MP2-based counterpart for systems with sizable energy gaps, while delivering significantly faster convergence toward the canonical coupled-cluster limit for metallic systems, particularly as the thermodynamic limit is approached. These results highlight the critical role of the low-level theory in fragment embedding and local correlation methods and identify RPA as a compelling alternative to the commonly used MP2.</description>

      <title>Reassessing carotenoid photophysics -- new light on dark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carotenoid molecules are critical in photosynthesis, performing functions at the heart of both light-harvesting and photoprotection. As both these processes involve excitation energy transfer, fully understanding them requires a precise description of the electronic states involved. The excited state manifold of carotenoids is not yet fully characterised, however, and includes several dark electronic states that remain elusive. Using femtosecond stimulated resonance Raman spectroscopy, where the vibrational contributions of each excited state can be observed selectively as a function of the Raman excitation, we reveal the nature and symmetry of no less than four different dark states. These results end long-standing controversies in carotenoid research, shining new light on the photophysics of these essential molecules and establishing a spectroscopic framework for characterising their multiple roles.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning for Quantum-Informed Property Predictions in Artificial Sensing Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital sensing faces challenges in developing sustainable methods to extend the applicability of customized e-noses to complex body odor volatilome (BOV). To address this challenge, we developed MORE-ML, a computational framework that integrates quantum-mechanical (QM) property data of e-nose molecular building blocks with machine learning (ML) methods to predict sensing-relevant properties. Within this framework, we expanded our previous dataset, MORE-Q, to MORE-QX by sampling a larger conformational space of interactions between BOV molecules and mucin-derived receptors. This dataset provides extensive electronic binding features (BFs) computed upon BOV adsorption. Analysis of MORE-QX property space revealed weak correlations between QM properties of building blocks and resulting BFs. Leveraging this observation, we defined electronic descriptors of building blocks as inputs for tree-based ML models to predict BFs. Benchmarking showed CatBoost models outperform alternatives, especially in transferability to unseen compounds. Explainable AI methods further highlighted which QM properties most influence BF predictions. Collectively, MORE-ML combines QM insights with ML to provide mechanistic understanding and rational design principles for molecular receptors in BOV sensing. This approach establishes a foundation for advancing artificial sensing materials capable of analyzing complex odor mixtures, bridging the gap between molecular-level computations and practical e-nose applications.</description>

      <title>AceFF: A State-of-the-Art Machine Learning Potential for Small Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce AceFF, a pre-trained machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) optimized for small molecule drug discovery. While MLIPs have emerged as efficient alternatives to Density Functional Theory (DFT), generalizability across diverse chemical spaces remains difficult. AceFF addresses this via a refined TensorNet2 architecture trained on a comprehensive dataset of drug-like compounds. This approach yields a force field that balances high-throughput inference speed with DFT-level accuracy. AceFF fully supports the essential medicinal chemistry elements (H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, I) and is explicitly trained to handle charged states. Validation against rigorous benchmarks, including complex torsional energy scans, molecular dynamics trajectories, batched minimizations, and forces and anergy accuracy demonstrates that AceFF establishes a new state-of-the-art for organic molecules. The AceFF-2 model weights and inference code are available at https://huggingface.co/Acellera/AceFF-2.0.</description>

      <title>Fast Ewald Summation with Prolates for Charged Systems in the NPT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an NPT extension of Ewald summation with prolates (ESP), a spectrally accurate and scalable particle-mesh method for molecular dynamics simulations of periodic, charged systems. Building on the recently introduced ESP framework, this work focuses on rigorous and thermodynamically consistent pressure/stress evaluation in the isothermal--isobaric ensemble. ESP employs prolate spheroidal wave functions as both splitting and spreading kernels, reducing the Fourier grid size needed to reach a prescribed pressure accuracy compared with current widely used mesh-Ewald methods based on Gaussian splitting and B-spline spreading. We derive a unified pressure-tensor formulation applicable to isotropic, semi-isotropic, anisotropic, and fully flexible cells, and show that the long-range pressure can be evaluated with a single forward FFT followed by diagonal scaling, whereas force evaluation requires both forward and inverse transforms. We provide production implementations in LAMMPS and GROMACS and validate pressure and force accuracy on bulk water, LiTFSI ionic liquids, and a transmembrane system. Benchmarks on up to $3\times 10^3$ CPU cores demonstrate strong scaling and reduced communication cost at matched accuracy, particularly for NPT pressure evaluation.</description>

      <title>Transient spark dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor with a liquid electrode for dye degradation: A primary study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential application of non-thermal plasma in treating textile industrial wastewater motivates researchers to develop innovative techniques at a laboratory scale to achieve the goal of wastewater mineralization. In line with this objective, a dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor with a liquid electrode has been built for the study of synthetic dye degradation. The plasma reactor was optimized by altering various operating conditions to achieve a higher degradation efficiency at given discharge conditions. The reaction kinetics of crystal violet degradation were studied, and the same plasma reactor was tested for other synthetic dyes (wastewater model samples). The results suggest that the proposed dielectric barrier post-discharge plasma reactor may offer a promising solution for treating dye effluents from the textile industry.</description>

      <title>Multistep quantum master equation theory for response functions in four wave mixing electronic spectroscopy of multichromophoric macromolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides an alternative derivation of third order response functions in four wave mixing spectroscopy of multichromophoric macromolecular systems considering only single exciton states. For the case of harmonic oscillator bath linearly and diagonally coupled to exciton states, closed form expressions showing all the explicit time dependences are derived. These expressions can provide more solid physical basis for understanding 2-dimensional electronic spectroscopy signals. For more general cases of system-bath coupling, the quantum master equation (QME) approach is employed for the derivation of multistep time evolution equations for Green function-like operators. Solution of these equations is feasible at the level of 2nd order non-Markovian QME, and the new approach can account for inter-exciton coupling, dephasing, relaxation, and non-Markovian effects in a consistent manner.</description>

      <title>Coupled thermo-chemo-mechanical phase field-based modelling of hydrogen-assisted cracking in girth welds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new computational framework is presented to predict the structural integrity of welds in hydrogen transmission pipelines. The framework combines: (i) a thermo-mechanical weld process model, and (ii) a coupled deformation-diffusion-fracture phase field-based model that accounts for plasticity and hydrogen trapping, considering multiple trap types, with stationary and evolving trap densities. This enables capturing, for the first time, the interplay between residual stresses, trap creation, hydrogen transport, and fracture. The computational framework is particularised and applied to the study of weld integrity in X80 pipeline steel. The focus is on girth welds, as they are more complex due to their multi-pass nature. The weld process model enables identifying the dimensions and characteristics of the three weld regions: base metal, heat-affected zone, and weld metal, and these are treated distinctively. This is followed by virtual fracture experiments, which reveal a very good agreement with laboratory studies. Then, weld pipeline integrity is assessed, estimating critical failure pressures for a wide range of scenarios. Of particular interest is to assess the structural integrity implications of welding defects present in existing natural gas pipelines under consideration for hydrogen transport: pores, lack of penetration, imperfections, lack of fusion, root contraction, and undercutting. The results obtained in hydrogen-containing environments reveal an important role of the weld microstructure and the detrimental effect of weld defects that are likely to be present in existing natural gas pipelines, as they are considered safe in gas pipeline standards.</description>

      <title>Automated decision-making by chemical echolocation in active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motile microorganisms, like bacteria and algae, unify abilities like self-propulsion, autonomous navigation, and decision-making on the micron scale. While recent breakthroughs have led to the creation of synthetic microswimmers and nanoagents that can also self-propel, they still lack the functionality and sophistication of their biological counterparts. This study pioneers a mechanism enabling synthetic agents to autonomously navigate and make decisions, allowing them to solve mazes and transport cargo through complex environments without requiring external cues or guidance. The mechanism exploits chemo-hydrodynamic signals, produced by agents like active droplets or colloids, to remotely sense and respond to their environment - similar to echolocation. Our research paves the way for endowing autonomous, motile synthetic agents with functionalities that have been so far exclusive to biological organisms.</description>

      <title>Computational Modeling of Exciton-bath Hamiltonians for LH2 and LH3 Complexes of Purple Photosynthetic Bacteria at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light harvesting 2 (LH2) complex is a primary component of the photosynthetic unit of purple bacteria that is responsible for harvesting and relaying excitons. The electronic absorption line shape of LH2 contains two major bands at 800 nm and 850 nm wavelength regions. Under low light condition, some species of purple bacteria replace LH2 with LH3, a variant form with almost the same structure as the former but with distinctively different spectral features. The major difference between the absorption line shapes of LH2 and LH3 is the shift of the 850 nm band of the former to a new 820 nm region. The microscopic origin of this difference has been subject to some theoretical/computational investigations. However, the genuine molecular level source of such difference is not clearly understood yet. This work reports a comprehensive computational study of LH2 and LH3 complexes so as to clarify different molecular level features of LH2 and LH3 complexes and to construct simple exciton-bath models with a common form. All-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both LH2 and LH3 complexes provide detailed molecular level structural differences of BChls in the two complexes, in particular, in their patterns of hydrogen bonding (HB) and torsional angles of the acetyl group. Time-dependent density functional theory calculation of the excitation energies of BChls for structures sampled from the MD simulations, suggests that the observed differences in HB and torsional angles cannot fully account for the experimentally observed spectral shift of LH3. Potential sources that can explain the actual spectral shift of LH3 are discussed, and their magnitudes are assessed through fitting of experimental line shapes.</description>

      <title>Effects of Donor-Acceptor Quantum Coherence and Non-Markovian Bath on the Distance Dependence of Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate information on the distance dependence of resonance energy transfer (RET) is crucial for its utilization as a spectroscopic ruler \re{of} nanometer scale distances. In this regard, understanding the effects of donor-acceptor quantum coherence and non-Markovian bath, which become significant at short distances, has significant implications. The present work investigates this issue theoretically by comparing results from a theory of coherent RET (CRET) with a nonequilibrium version of F\"{o}rster's RET (FRET) theory, both accounting for non-Markovian bath effects. Even for a model where the donor-acceptor electronic coupling is of transition dipole interaction form, it is shown that the RET rate in general deviates from the inverse sixth power distance dependence as opposed to the prediction of the original FRET. It is shown that the donor-acceptor quantum coherence makes the \re{distance} dependence steeper than the sixth power although detailed manner of enhancement is sensitive to specific values of parameters. On the other hand, the non-Markovian bath effects make the \re{distance} dependence more moderate than the sixth power for both CRET and nonueqilibrium FRET because finite time scale of the bath causes the rate to be smaller than the prediction of original FRET. While these effects are \re{demonstrated clearly} in the population dynamics at sub-picosecond time scales, their contributions to the conventional RET efficiency are relatively minor. This indicates that the actual detection of such effects through conventional RET efficiency measurement requires either high precision or utilization of a donor with fast spontaneous decay rate of excitation.</description>

      <title>Multistate iterative qubit coupled cluster (MS-iQCC): a quantum-inspired, state-averaged approach to ground- and excited-state energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the multistate iterative qubit coupled cluster (MS-iQCC) method, a quantum-inspired algorithm that runs efficiently on classical hardware and is designed to predict both ground and excited electronic states of molecules. Accurate excited-state energetics are essential for interpreting spectroscopy and chemical reactivity, but standard electronic structure methods are either too computationally expensive for larger systems or lose reliability in the presence of strong electron correlation. MS-iQCC addresses this challenge by simultaneously optimizing multiple electronic states in a single, state-averaged procedure that treats ground and excited states on equal footing. This removes the energetic bias that is introduced when excited states are computed one at a time and constrained to remain orthogonal to previously optimized states. The approach supports multireference electronic structure by allowing multideterminantal initial guesses and by adaptively building a compact exponential ansatz from a pool of qubit excitation generators. We apply MS-iQCC to H$_4$, H$_2$O, N$_2$, and C$_2$, including strongly correlated geometries, and observe robust convergence of all targeted state energies to chemically meaningful accuracy across their potential energy surfaces.</description>

      <title>Synchronous Differential Hot-charge Emission Spectroscopy: The Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy-level alignment (ELA) at buried interfaces between electrode and molecular materials sets charge injection barriers, carrier selectivity, and ultimately device efficiency, yet it is challenging to quantify under operating conditions. Hot-charge emission spectroscopy (HotES) probes ELA by injecting ballistic carriers across a tunneling oxide. Yet, the technique inherently convolutes the molecular response with a strong, energy-dependent tunneling background, complicating the isolation of the true ELA. We introduce synchronous differential HotES (sd-HotES), defined as the ratio of the differential conductance of the hot-charge and tunneling channels of the HotES. Physical modeling and numerical simulations validate that this ratio directly reconstructs the intrinsic molecular charge transmission, enabling the threshold-free and probe-bias-insensitive extraction of ELA. By effectively eliminating the masking tunneling background, sd-HotES substantially boosts detection sensitivity; weak spectral features previously hidden in conventional HotES become clearly resolvable, as demonstrated in lock-in simulations including realistic noise. This study establishes the fundamental operating principles of sd-HotES and highlights it as a powerful, broadly applicable strategy for accessing buried interface properties for the study of molecular and hybrid devices.</description>
