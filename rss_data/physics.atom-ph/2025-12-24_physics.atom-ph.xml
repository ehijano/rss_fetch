      <title>An atom chip interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have realized an interferometer using a thermal cloud of magnetically trapped rubidium 87 atoms on a chip. The interferometer resembles a Ramsey interferometer with a state selective spatial splitting of the two internal states as proposed in [M. Ammar, and al., Phys. Rev. A, 91, 053623]. The splitting is effected by microwave fields from two on-chip waveguides while the atoms remain magnetically trapped. The inferred maximum separation is $1.2\pm 0.1~\mu$m. We observe interference fringes with a contrast around 8\% limited by velocity difference of the two interferometer states when we close the interferometer. We devellop a model describing this contrast decay.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of a high intensity, superthermal muonium beam for gravity and laser spectroscopy experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universality of free fall, a cornerstone of Einstein's theory of gravity, has so far only been tested with neutral composite states of first-generation Standard Model (SM) particles, such as atoms or neutrons, and, most recently, antihydrogen. Extending these gravitational measurements to other sectors of the SM requires the formation of neutral bound states using higher-generation, unstable particles. Muonium, the bound state of an antimuon ($\mu^+$) and an electron ($e^-$), offers the possibility to probe gravity with second-generation (anti)leptons, in the absence of the strong interaction. However, the short $\mu^+$ lifetime ($\tau_{\mu}\approx 2.2~\mu$s) and the existing diffuse thermal muonium sources rendered such measurements unfeasible. Here, we report the synthesis of a high-brightness muonium beam, extracted from a thin layer of superfluid helium by exploiting its chemical potential and unique transport properties. The mean longitudinal velocity (${v}\approx 2180~\rm{m/s}$) and narrow distribution (${\Delta v}&lt; 150 ~\rm{m/s}$) of the atoms characterise a superthermal beam, while yields are similar to the highest intensity diffuse sources. This new beam is expected to enable muonium interferometry and a percent-level measurement of its gravitational acceleration, providing the first direct test of the Weak Equivalence Principle with second-generation (anti)matter. Its unprecedented brightness also opens the way to sub-kHz 1S-2S spectroscopy, enabling precise determination of the muon mass and stringent tests of bound-state quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Time-domain measurement of Auger electron dynamics in xenon atoms after giant resonant photoionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved measurement of Auger-Meitner (AM) decay [Nature 419, 803 (2002)] marked a milestone in the development of attosecond science. To date, the time constants for the AM decay processes obtained from the time-domain experiments were found to be consistent with the values deduced from conventional energy-domain measurements. One of the main factors limiting the temporal resolution of these studies is the unlocked carrier-envelope-phase (CEP) of the laser pulses used to probe the electronic dynamics triggered by inner-shell photoabsorption. In this work, we report time-resolved inner-shell electron spectroscopy of xenon and krypton using attosecond soft X-ray (atto-SXR) pulses centered at 130 eV in combination with CEP-stabilized few-cycle Yb laser pulses. We observed that the N$_{4,5}$OO Auger electrons from xenon exhibit a clear streaking pattern, but with an unexpected time shift of $\sim$ 1.32 fs relative to the 4$d$ photoelectrons. Furthermore, the energy-integrated yield of streaked Auger electrons from xenon exhibits a pronounced minimum at a pump-probe time delay of 4 fs. Neither of these observations can be explained by current streaking theories and both are inconsistent with lifetimes inferred from energy-domain measurements. The M$_{4,5}$NN Auger electrons from krypton partly overlap in energy with the 3$d$ inner-shell photoelectrons and do not show these anomalous features. This study offers new insights into the inner-shell electron dynamics of heavy atoms in the giant dipole resonance region, laying the groundwork for attosecond soft X-ray spectroscopy of molecular systems containing iodine or bromine atoms.</description>

      <title>Precision spectroscopy of the 2S-$n$P transitions in atomic hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision spectroscopy of atomic hydrogen is an important way to test bound-state quantum electrodynamics (QED), one of the building blocks of the Standard Model. In its simplest form, such a test consists of the comparison of a measured transition frequency with its QED prediction, which can be calculated with very high precision for the hydrogen atom. However, these calculations require some input in the form of physical constants, such as the Rydberg constant $R_\infty$ and the proton charge radius $r_\mathrm{p}$, both of which are currently determined to a large degree by hydrogen spectroscopy itself. Therefore, the frequency of at least three different transitions needs to be measured in order to test QED. Equivalently, a comparison of the values of $R_\infty$ and $r_\mathrm{p}$ determined from measurements of different transitions constitutes a test of QED.
 To this end, laser spectroscopy of optical 2S-$n$P transitions has been performed in this work. As these transitions are one-photon transitions, they are affected by a different set of systematic effects than the two-photon transitions on which most other spectroscopic measurements of hydrogen are based. In order to contribute to the test of QED, their transition frequencies must be determined with a relative uncertainty on the order of one part in $10^{12}$, corresponding to approximately 1 kHz in absolute terms. This is in turn approximately a factor of 10000 smaller than the relatively broad natural linewidth of the 2S-$n$P transitions, and a successful measurement requires both a very large experimental signal-to-noise ratio and a detailed theoretical understanding of the line shape of the observed resonance.
 The 2S-$n$P transitions were probed on a cryogenic beam of hydrogen atoms, which were optically excited to the metastable 2S level. The atomic beam was crossed at right angles with counter-propagating spectroscopy laser beams, which further excited the atoms to the $n$P level. The fluorescence from the subsequent rapid spontaneous decay served as experimental signal. The excitation with two counter-propagating beams led to two Doppler shifts of equal magnitude, but opposite sign, which thus canceled each other out. A velocity-resolved detection was used to determine any residual Doppler shifts, which could be excluded within the measurement uncertainty for both of the measurements discussed below.
 In a first experiment, the 2S-4P transition was probed. Quantum interference of neighboring atomic resonances produced subtle distortions of the line shape, which were found to be significant because of the very large resolution relative to the linewidth. The line shifts caused by the distortions were directly observed and could be removed by use of a line shape model based on perturbative calculations. With this, the transition frequency was determined with a relative uncertainty of 4 parts in $10^{12}$. In combination with the very precisely measured 1S-2S transition frequency, this allowed the, at the time, most precise determination of $R_\infty$ and $r_\mathrm{p}$ from atomic hydrogen. Moreover, good agreement was found with the much more precise value of $r_\mathrm{p}$ extracted from spectroscopy of muonic hydrogen, which had been in significant disagreement with previous data from (electronic) hydrogen, causing concern about the validity of QED. This result has since been confirmed by other experiments. The 2S-4P measurement is treated in the appendix of this thesis.
 The 2S-4P measurement, despite its large signal-to-noise ratio, was limited by counting statistics. To improve precision, a transition with a narrower linewidth and an improved experimental signal was necessary. Hence, the study of the 2S-6P transition, which offers a three times smaller natural linewidth, was begun. The atomic beam apparatus was upgraded, resulting in a corresponding decrease of the experimentally observed linewidth, and a close to an order of magnitude larger flux of atoms in the low-velocity tail of the atomic beam. Together with a detector redesign, this led to an up to 16 times larger signal than for the 2S-4P measurement, opening the path to increased precision. The Doppler-shift suppression was also rebuilt to support such precision, including a fiber collimator developed for this purpose, which provides high-quality spectroscopy beams at the new transition wavelength of 410 nm.
 This enabled a measurement of the 2S-6P transition frequency with a statistical uncertainty of 430 Hz, five times lower than for the 2S-4P measurement and corresponding to a suppression of the Doppler shift by six orders of magnitude. At this level of precision, the light force shift from the diffraction of atoms at the light grating formed by the counter-propagating spectroscopy beams becomes significant. This light force shift was directly observed for the first time for the 2S-$n$P transitions and found to be well-described by a model derived for this purpose. The size of all other systematic effects, except the very precisely known recoil shift, is estimated to be below 500 Hz each. The blind data analysis is ongoing at the time of writing and thus no transition frequencies can yet be given. However, a preliminary analysis suggests a five-fold improvement in the determination of $R_\infty$ and $r_\mathrm{p}$ as compared to the 2S-4P measurement, and a two-fold improvement over the currently most precise determination from atomic hydrogen. This places the uncertainty of the determined value of $r_\mathrm{p}$ within a factor of five of that of the muonic value. The 2S-6P measurement is treated in the main text of this thesis.</description>

      <title>Revealing Electron-Ytterbium Interactions through Rydberg Molecular Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divalent atoms have emerged as powerful alternatives to alkalis in ultracold atom platforms, offering unique advantages arising from their two-electron structure. Among these species, ytterbium (Yb) is especially promising, yet its anionic properties and its Rydberg spectrum remain comparatively unexplored. In this work, we perform a first and comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules (ULRMs) of $^{174}$Yb in $6sns\,^1S_0$ Rydberg states across nearly two decades in principal quantum number $n$ and three orders of magnitude in molecular binding energy. Using the Coulomb Green's function formalism, we compute Born-Oppenheimer molecular potentials describing the Rydberg atom in the presence of a ground-state perturber and achieve quantitative agreement with high-resolution molecular spectra. This enables the extraction of low-energy electron-Yb scattering phase shifts, including the zero-energy $s$-wave scattering length and the positions of two spin-orbit split $p$-wave shape resonances. Our results provide strong evidence that the Yb$^{-}$ anion exists only as a metastable resonance. We additionally show the sensitivity of ULRM spectra to the atomic quantum defects, using this to refine the value for the $6s23f\, ^1F_3$ quantum defect. Together, these findings establish Yb ULRMs as a powerful probe of electron-Yb interactions and lay essential groundwork for future Rydberg experiments with divalent atoms.</description>

      <title>Theory of Scalable Spin Squeezing with Disordered Quantum Dipoles</title>

Abstract: Spin squeezed entanglement enables metrological precision beyond the classical limit. Understood through the lens of continuous symmetry breaking, dipolar spin systems exhibit the remarkable ability to generate spin squeezing via their intrinsic quench dynamics. To date, this understanding has primarily focused on lattice spin systems; in practice however, dipolar spin systems$\unicode{x2014}$ranging from ultracold molecules to nuclear spin ensembles and solid-state color centers$\unicode{x2014}$often exhibit significant amounts of positional disorder. Here, we develop a theory for scalable spin squeezing in a two-dimensional randomly diluted lattice of quantum dipoles, which naturally realize a dipolar XXZ model. Via extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram for finite-temperature XY order, and by extension scalable spin squeezing, as a function of both disorder and Ising anisotropy. As the disorder increases, we find that scalable spin squeezing survives only near the Heisenberg point. We show that this behavior is due to the presence of rare tightly-coupled dimers, which effectively heat the system post-quench. In the case of strongly-interacting nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we demonstrate that an experimentally feasible strategy to decouple the problematic dimers from the dynamics is sufficient to enable scalable spin squeezing.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency loading of 2,400 Ytterbium atoms in optical tweezer arrays</title>

Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum computation, simulation, and metrology. Among them, alkaline-earth-like atoms exhibit distinct advantages, including long coherence time and high-fidelity Rydberg gates. However, their scalability has lagged behind that of the alkali atoms. Here, we report 2,400 Ytterbium-174 atoms trapped in an optical tweezer array with enhanced single-atom loading efficiency of 83.5(1)%. Notably, the loading efficiency is largely maintained for array sizes ranging from dozens to thousands, exhibiting excellent scalability. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the enhanced loading method by showing that the enhancement exists robustly across a range of interatomic potentials, suggesting its utility for other atomic species. To establish the capability of the 174Yb arrays toward universal quantum computation, we propose to encode the qubit in the ground-clock state manifold and estimate a 99.9% two-qubit gate fidelity with experimentally feasible parameters. Our work advances the prospects for realizing large-scale quantum computers using alkaline-earth-like atoms.</description>

      <title>Enabling atom-clad waveguide operation in a microfabricated alkali vapor-photonic integrated circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating alkali atomic vapors with nanophotonic devices offers a scalable route to quantum technologies that leverage strong atom-photon interactions. While there have been many approaches to such integration, the general reliance on traditional glass vapor cells, distilled alkali metals, and epoxy sealing limits reproducibility and scalability. Moreover, mitigating adverse Rb-photonics interactions is essential, particularly as devices become more compact and the alkali source lies in close proximity to the photonic elements. Here, we demonstrate the successful operation of compact and fully integrated devices that combine silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with microfabricated borosilicate vapor cells and pill-type rubidium (Rb) dispensers through hermetic seals via anodic bonding. We show how successful operation hinges on optically activating the dispenser in a low-power pulsed mode, releasing controlled amounts of Rb vapor on demand while mitigating photonic degradation. Simultaneously, a counter-propagating desorption laser completely suppresses Rb-induced losses and enables waveguide-based atomic vapor spectroscopy. Using this approach, we demonstrate repeatable control of vapor density by tuning activation pulse length, duty cycle, and device temperature. These results establish a compact, manufacturable, and scalable vapor-PIC device, and set the stage for future demonstrations in cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum nonlinear optics, and chip-scale atomic sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical skyrmions are topological structures of light whose defining property, the skyrmion number, is robust against perturbations. This makes them attractive for applications in quantum information storage, where resilience to decoherence is paramount. However, their preservation during coherent storage remains unexplored. We report the first experimental demonstration of storing and retrieving optical skyrmions in a cold $^{87}$Rb vapor using a dual-path electromagnetically induced transparency memory. Crucially, we show that the skyrmion number remains invariant for storage times up to several microseconds, even when subjected to imbalanced loss between the two paths and substantial perturbations in control beam power. Our work demonstrates the survival of a non-trivial topological invariant in a quantum memory, marking a significant step towards topologically protected photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Laser Stabilised Ionising Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a ionising electronic transition under resonant pumping. We demonstrate that, above a critical value of the pump intensity, a novel metastable electronic bound state is created, which can decay into the free electron continuum by two-photon ionization. We calculate the system's resonant fluorescence spectrum, finding results qualitatively different from the Mollow triplet expected in a bound-to-bound transition. The fluorescent emission can be used to measure the time-resolved population of the novel metastable state. Contrary to Kramers-Hennenberger atoms, stabilised by non-perturbative, non-resonant laser pulses, the physics we observe is inherently resonant and relies on perturbative level repulsion. In analogy to how the AC-Stark shift is a semiclassical version of the single-photon Rabi splitting observed in photonic cavity, the phenomenon we describe is better understood as a semiclassical version of recently observed excitons bound by a single cavity photon. Our results demonstrate a novel way to stabilise electronic states with intense laser fields, increasing our capability to design and engineer non-classical states of matter.</description>

      <title>Theory of Non-Dichroic Enantio-Sensitive Chiroptical Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the photoelectron angular distributions produced by elliptical and cross-polarized two-color laser fields interacting with randomly oriented chiral molecules decompose into four irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ point group. One of these ($A_u$) corresponds to a non-dichroic enantiosensitive (NoDES) contribution. This NoDES contribution has opposite sign for opposite enantiomers but remains invariant under reversal of the field ellipticity, enabling chirality detection that is robust against variations of the relative phase between orthogonal field components. We propose a protocol to isolate this component using only two velocity-map imaging projections and validate it through numerical simulations. Our calculations, performed in the two-photon resonantly-enhanced ionization, multi-photon, and strong-field ionization regimes with cross-polarized two-color fields show that the NoDES signal reaches about 1\% of the energy-resolved ionization yield, comparable to photoelectron circular dichroism and much larger than standard magnetic-dipole chiroptical effects. NoDES spectroscopy thus provides a symmetry-protected and phase-robust route to probe molecular chirality on the ultrafast time scale. The experimental confirmation of our theory is presented in the companion paper [L. Fede et al., arXiv:2512.19062 (2025)].</description>
