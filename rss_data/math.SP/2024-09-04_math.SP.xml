      <title>Inequalities for eigenvalues of Schr\"odinger operators with mixed boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalue problem for the Schr\"odinger operator on bounded, convex domains with mixed boundary conditions, where a Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed on a part of the boundary and a Neumann boundary condition on its complement. We prove inequalities between the lowest eigenvalues corresponding to two different choices of such boundary conditions on both planar and higher-dimensional domains. We also prove an inequality between higher order mixed eigenvalues and pure Dirichlet eigenvalues on multidimensional polyhedral domains.</description>

      <title>Mixed Steklov-Neumann problem: asymptotic analysis and applications to diffusion-controlled reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many first-passage processes in complex media and related diffusion-controlled reactions can be described by means of eigenfunctions of the mixed Steklov-Neumann problem. In this paper, we investigate this spectral problem in a common setting when a small target or escape window (with Steklov condition) is located on the reflecting boundary (with Neumann condition). We start by inspecting two basic settings: an arc-shaped target on the boundary of a disk and a spherical-cap-shaped target on the boundary of a ball. We construct the explicit kernel of an integral operator that determines the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and deduce their asymptotic behavior in the small-target limit. By relating the limiting kernel to an appropriate Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator, we extend these asymptotic results to other bounded domains with smooth boundaries. A straightforward application to first-passage processes is presented; in particular, we revisit the small-target behavior of the mean first-reaction time on perfectly or partially reactive targets, as well as for more sophisticated surface reactions that extend the conventional narrow escape problem.</description>

      <title>Tail Bounds for Functions of Weighted Tensor Sums Derived from Random Walks on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents significant advancements in tensor analysis and the study of random walks on manifolds. It introduces new tensor inequalities derived using the Mond-Pecaric method, which enriches the existing mathematical tools for tensor analysis. This method, developed by mathematicians Mond and Pecaric, is a powerful technique for establishing inequalities in linear operators and matrices, using functional analysis and operator theory principles. The paper also proposes novel lower and upper bounds for estimating column sums of transition matrices based on their spectral information, which is critical for understanding random walk behavior. Additionally, it derives bounds for the right tail of weighted tensor sums derived from random walks on manifolds, utilizing the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator over the underlying manifolds and new tensor inequalities to enhance the understanding of these complex mathematical structures.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Thirring inequalities for the shifted Coulomb Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove sharp Lieb-Thirring (LT) inequalities for the family of shifted Coulomb Hamiltonians. More precisely, we prove the classical LT inequalities with the semi-classical constant for this family of operators in any dimension $d\geqslant 3$ and any $\gamma \geqslant 1$. We also prove that the semi-classical constant is never optimal for the Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum (CLR) inequalities for this family of operators in any dimension. In this case, we characterize the optimal constant as the minimum of a finite set and provide an asymptotic expansion as the dimension grows. Using the same method to prove the CLR inequalities for Coulomb, we obtain more information about the conjectured optimal constant in the CLR inequality for arbitrary potentials.</description>

      <title>The principal eigenvalue problem for time-periodic nonlocal equations with drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a general time-periodic linear transport equation with integral source term. We prove the existence of a Floquet principal eigenvalue, namely a real number such that the equation rescaled by this number admits nonnegative periodic solutions. We also prove the exponential attractiveness of these solutions. The method relies on general spectral results about positive operators.</description>

      <title>First Eigenvalue Estimates for Asymptotically Hyperbolic Manifolds and their Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a sharp upper bound for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_{1,p}$ of the $p$-Laplacian on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. We then prove that a particular class of conformally compact submanifolds within asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds are themselves asymptotically hyperbolic. As a corollary, we show that for any minimal conformally compact submanifold $Y^{k+1}$ within $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}(-1)$, $\lambda_{1,p}(Y)=\left(\frac{k}{p}\right)^{p}$. We then obtain lower bounds on $\lambda_{1,2}(Y)$ in the case where minimality is replaced with a bounded mean curvature assumption and where the ambient space is a general Poincar\'e-Einstein space whose conformal infinity is of non-negative Yamabe type. In the process, we introduce an invariant $\hat \beta^Y$ for each such submanifold, enabling us to generalize a result due to Cheung-Leung.</description>

      <title>Circle Foliations Revisited: Periods of Flows whose Orbits are all Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our purpose here is to adapt the results of Geodesic circle foliations for Reeb flows or Hamiltonian flows on contact manifolds. Consequently, all periods are exactly the same if the contact manifold is connected and all orbits on the contact manifold are closed. We also present concrete examples of periodic flows, all of whose orbits are closed, such as Harmonic oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and others. Lotka-Volterra systems, Reeb flows, and some geodesic flows have non-trivial periods, whereas the periods of Harmonic oscillators and similar systems can be easily obtained through direct calculations. As an application to quantum mechanics, we examine the spectrum of semiclassical Shr\"odinger operators. Then we have one of the semiclassical analogies of the Helton-Guillemin theorem.</description>
