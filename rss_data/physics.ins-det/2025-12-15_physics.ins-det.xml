      <title>Characterization of CRYO ASIC for charge readout in the nEXO experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: nEXO is a proposed next-generation experiment searching for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{136}$Xe using a tonne-scale liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chamber (TPC). To image the ionization signals from events in the liquid xenon, the detector will employ metallized fused-silica charge collection tiles instrumented with cryogenic application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), referred to as CRYO ASIC, which are designed to operate directly in LXe to minimize input capacitance and pick-up noise. Here we present the performance of the CRYO ASIC mounted on an auxiliary printed circuit board and evaluated both in a cryogenic environmental chamber and in a dedicated LXe test stand. We demonstrate that the ASICs achieve the desired performance at liquid xenon temperatures, showing a gain stability better than 0.2% over 24-hour operation and reliable in-situ calibration using an on-chip pulser. In the LXe test stand, we show that boiling caused by the chip heat dissipation can be mitigated by operating the system above ~0.1 MPa. The in-LXe noise measured agrees with simulation, which indicates it the $150~e^-$ design requirement can be satisfied. These results establish CRYO ASIC as a viable low-noise in-LXe charge readout solution for nEXO.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Monte Carlo Simulation Studies to Investigate the Working Principle of Compact Nanodosimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, compact nanodosimetric detectors based on ion multiplication in low-pressure gas have been developed and gained attention in the scientific community. These detectors use strong electric fields to collect and multiply positive ions produced by the incident radiation in mm-sized cell holes in dielectric materials, achieving a nm-equivalent spatial resolution of the localization of ionization events, when scaled to liquid water with unit density. Their design assumes that ion impact ionizations of gas molecules within the cell holes dominate signal formation, yet this assumption has lacked direct physical verification. Electron emission from the cell hole walls due to ion impact could also contribute, requiring alternative designs to optimize efficiency.
  To investigate this, a nanodosimetric detector featuring a single cell hole with a diameter of 1.5 mm in a dielectric plate was developed. Ion collection and multiplication were achieved by applying a negative high voltage to the glass cathode 0.5 mm below the cell hole, assisted by a low drift field above the plate. A grounded readout electrode with a 0.8 mm hole covers the cell hole to prevent interactions of collected ions with the hole walls. High signal yields in 1 mbar and 2 mbar propane gas were observed and indicated that ion impact ionizations of the gas molecules are indeed the primary mechanism for signal induction. The compact nanodosimeter setup was further modeled with Geant4-DNA and Garfield++ for deeper insight. The results of these studies are important for understanding and developing a new class of nanodosimeters with potential applications in particle therapy, radiation protection, space dosimetry, and particle physics.</description>

      <title>Multichannel SiPM test readout system for gamma-ray measurements with monolithic inorganic CeBr_{3}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy resolution and the detection efficiency for gamma quanta are fundamental properties in the construction of detectors for ionizing radiation. In this study, a SiPM-based photodetector coupled to a monolithic inorganic CeBr_{3} crystal is exposed to gamma rays in order to study the performance of the CeBr_{3} crystal. Measurements are made using three different radioactive sources - ^{137}Cs, ^{22}Na, and ^{60}Co. For each source, the measurements are conducted at several SiPM bias voltages. Furthermore, two CeBr_{3} crystals with different thicknesses are used in order to study how detector efficiency is affected by crystal dimensions. A preliminary analysis of the data is presented.</description>

      <title>Design optimization of hadronic calorimeters for future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calorimeters are a crucial component in modern particle detectors. They are responsible for providing accurate energy measurements of particles produced in high-energy collisions. The demanding requirements set for next-generation collider experiments impose new challenges on the design of new detectors, and a systematic approach to their optimization is increasingly necessary. The performance of calorimeters is primarily characterized by their energy resolution, parameterized by a stochastic and a constant term, related to sampling fluctuations and non-uniformities respectively. To improve the reconstruction quality of physics objects in the calorimeter, both terms need to be taken into account. Changes in a longitudinally constrained design usually result in a trade-off between these terms, making optimization a non-trivial task. This work focuses on the optimization of a hadronic sampling calorimeter, based on the FCC-ee ALLEGRO detector concept. By controlling the absorber layer thickness in a Geant4 simulation, the impact of the passive to active material proportion on the deposited energy distribution and resolution can be analyzed. Our methodology aims at exploring the design space with practical considerations, paving the way for the development of a closed optimization framework that can evaluate multiple designs against physics performance targets.</description>

      <title>A low-cost ice melt monitoring system using wind-induced motion of mass-balance stakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface ablation measurements of glaciers are critical for understanding mass change over time. Mass-balance stakes are commonly used for localized measurements, with the exposed length typically measured manually at infrequent intervals. This paper presents the design and validation of new instrumentation that automates mass-balance stake readings, thus enabling continuous measurements with high temporal resolution. The instrumentation comprises readout electronics that are mounted on mass-balance stakes to measure wind-induced vibrations. The stake vibrational frequency depends sensitively on the exposed length, and changes in the measured frequency therefore probe glacier surface melt and accumulation. Initial instrumentation field tests conducted at Color Lake on Umingmat Nunaat (Axel Heiberg Island), Nunavut, demonstrate centimeter-level precision on length measurements. The instrumentation can be attached to existing mass-balance stakes and is low-cost (~ $50 USD) in comparison to many other systems that perform automated surface ablation measurements. The accessibility of this instrumentation opens new possibilities for localized, high temporal resolution measurements of glacier surface activity at any locations where mass balance stakes are deployed.</description>

      <title>Vibration Isolation for the Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA) presents a novel concept for observing gravitational waves from astrophysical sources at sub-Hertz frequencies. Compared to the Earth, the seismic environment of the moon, while uncertain, is known to be orders of magnitude lower, opening the possibility for achieving this sub-Hz band. This band fills the gap between space-based detectors (mHz) and Earth-based detectors (10 Hz to a few kHz). The initial version of LILA, known as LILA Pioneer, calls for non-suspended optics, relying on the moon's resonant modes to respond to gravitational waves. However, the follow-on design, LILA Horizon, requires suspensions to realize in-band free floating test masses and to filter the residual seismic background. This paper will establish baseline designs for these suspensions for different assumptions of the seismic background.</description>

      <title>An exploratory study of a tellurium-loaded liquid scintillator based on water and p-dioxane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13926v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tellurium-loaded liquid scintillators are critical for neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments. However, conventional organic scintillators are constrained by the limited solubility of organic tellurium compounds compared with that of inorganic ones in water, whereas water-based scintillators are likely constrained by the destabilization of surfactants caused by inorganic tellurium compounds. In this work, a surfactant-free water-containing route is explored, in which an aqueous telluric acid solution is introduced into a water-miscible organic scintillator comprising p-dioxane, naphthalene, and PPO. The phase behavior of this system is mapped to delineate homogeneous-mixture domains and to estimate practical upper bounds on tellurium loading. Optical properties are characterized by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. The scintillation light yield is obtained with a relative method that compares to a reference LAB-PPO scintillator. The measurements demonstrate scintillation quenching induced by water and by tellurium acid. These results provide benchmarks for water-containing and surfactant-free formulations and support the development of high-loading liquid scintillators for future detector design.</description>

      <title>First direct search for light dark matter interactions in a transition-edge sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the use of transition-edge sensor (TES) single-photon detectors as a simultaneous target and sensor for direct dark matter searches, and report results from the first search of this kind. We perform a 489 h science run with a TES device optimized for the detection of 1064 nm photons, with a mass of ~0.2 ng and an energy threshold of ~0.3 eV, and set new limits on dark matter interactions with both electrons and nucleons for dark matter with mass below the MeV scale. With their excellent energy resolution, TESs enable search strategies that are complementary to recent results from superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors and kinetic inductance detectors. We show that next-generation TES arrays hold promise to probe new regions of light dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Angular Resolution Enhancement of Electron Backscatter Diffraction Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple 'shift-and-add' based improvement in the angular resolution of single electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) patterns. Sub-pixel image registration is used to measure the (sub-pixel) difference in projection parameters for patterns collected within a map, and then the pattern is shifted and added together. The resultant EBSD-pattern is shown to contain more angular information than a long-exposure single pattern, via 2D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based analysis. In particular, this method has the potential to enhance the scope of small compact direct electron detectors (DEDs).</description>

      <title>A Novel, Steerable, Low-Energy Proton Source for Detector Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the conversion of the Manitoba II mass spectrometer into a versatile low-energy proton beam facility. This infrastructure is adaptable to any detector-under-test (DUT), and has proven itself effective with the characterization of silicon detectors used in subatomic beyond-the-StandardModel (BSM) searches, namely the Nab experiment. A pencil beam of monoenergetic protons can be produced in a range from 25 keV to 35 keV, achieving a beamcurrent of ~1x10-18 A. Electrostatic steering plates were constructed to direct the Gaussian-profile proton beam over a 117mm diameter areaof-interest with full-width at half-maxima (FWHM) ranging from 0.6 mm to 1.26 mm. This work discusses the modifications and subsequent tests to confirm the beam specifications met the demands of the aforementioned detectors.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Noise Characterization and Suppression in Low-Field MRI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Low-field MRI systems operate at single MHz-range frequencies, where signal losses are primarily dominated by thermal noise from the radio-frequency (RF) receive coils. Achieving operation close to this limit is essential for maximizing imaging performance and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, electromagnetic interference (EMI) from cabling, electronics, and patient loading often degrades system performance. Our goal is to develop and validate a practical protocol that guides users in identifying and suppressing electromagnetic noise in low-field MRI systems, enabling operation near the thermal noise limit.
  Methods: We present a systematic, stepwise methodology that includes diagnostic measurements, hardware isolation strategies, and good practices for cabling and shielding. Each step is validated with corresponding noise measurements under increasingly complex system configurations, both unloaded and with a human subject present.
  Results: Noise levels were monitored through the incremental assembly of a low-field MRI system, revealing key sources of EMI and quantifying their impact. Final configurations achieved noise within 1.5x the theoretical thermal bound with a subject in the scanner. Image reconstructions illustrate the direct relationship between system noise and image quality.
  Conclusion: The proposed protocol enables low-field MRI systems to operate close to fundamental noise limits in realistic conditions. The framework also provides actionable guidance for the integration of additional system components, such as gradient drivers and automatic tuning networks, without compromising SNR.</description>
