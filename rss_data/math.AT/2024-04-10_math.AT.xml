      <title>Lefschetz fixed-object and fixed-morphism theorems for acyclic categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two novel complementary notions of the Lefschetz number for a functor from a finite acyclic category to itself and we prove a Lefschetz fixed-object theorem and a Lefschetz fixed-morphism theorem. In order to do so, we use the connection between these type of categories and simplicial structures, such as trisps or delta complexes. Through the use of a pair of functors that, when composed, form the barycentric subdivision, we are not only able to identify fixed objects but also fixed chains of morphisms.</description>

      <title>Bigraded path homology and the magnitude-path spectral sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two important invariants of directed graphs, namely magnitude homology and path homology, have recently been shown to be intimately connected: there is a 'magnitude-path spectral sequence' or 'MPSS' in which magnitude homology appears as the first page, and in which path homology appears as an axis of the second page. In this paper we study the homological and computational properties of the spectral sequence, and in particular of the full second page, which we now call 'bigraded path homology'. We demonstrate that every page of the MPSS deserves to be regarded as a homology theory in its own right, satisfying excision and Kunneth theorems (along with a homotopy invariance property already established by Asao), and that magnitude homology and bigraded path homology also satisfy Mayer-Vietoris theorems. We construct a homotopy theory of graphs (in the form of a cofibration category structure) in which weak equivalences are the maps inducing isomorphisms on bigraded path homology, strictly refining an existing structure based on ordinary path homology. And we provide complete computations of the MPSS for two important families of graphs - the directed and bi-directed cycles - which demonstrate the power of both the MPSS, and bigraded path homology in particular, to distinguish graphs that ordinary path homology cannot.</description>

      <title>On the rank of the double cohomology of moment-angle complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{LPSS-2023}, the authors construct a cochain complex
  $C\!H^*(\ZZ_{\K})$ on the cohomology of a moment-angle complex $\ZZ_{\K}$
  and call the resulting cohomology the double cohomology,
  $H\!H^*(\ZZ_{\K})$. In this paper, we study the change of
  rank in double cohomology after gluing an $n$-simplex to
  a simplicial complex $\K$ in certain conditions. As an application,
  we give a positive answer to an open problem in \cite{LPSS-2023}:
  For any even integer $r$, there always
  exists a simlicial complex $\K$ such that
  $\opn{rank} H\!H^*(\ZZ_{\K})=r$.</description>

      <title>Homology of Moment Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using homological techniques we show that a pin-anchored frame that involves only moments and shears provides a conceptual bridge between the statics of moment frames and the kinematics of pin-jointed trusses. One immediate result is a long exact sequence whose alternating sum of dimensions gives a novel counting rule for self-stresses and mechanisms. This combines the Maxwell-Calladine count for pin-jointed trusses with the circuit rank (first Betti number) associated with self-stresses in moment frames. These relations apply to frames in 2, 3 or any dimensions. This work heralds a shift towards a deeper study of the relationships and dualities that exist between structural equilibria and kinematics.</description>

      <title>Bredon motivic cohomology of the real numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the real numbers with $\Z/2-$coefficients, we compute the $C_2$-equivariant Borel motivic cohomology ring, the Bredon motivic cohomology groups and prove that the Bredon motivic cohomology ring of the real numbers is a proper subring in the $RO(C_2\times C_2)$-graded Bredon cohomology ring of a point.
  This generalizes Voevodsky's computation of the motivic cohomology ring of the real numbers to the $C_2$-equivariant setting. These computations are extended afterwards to any real closed field.</description>

      <title>Massively Parallel Computation of Similarity Matrices from Piecewise Constant Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computational framework for piecewise constant functions (PCFs) and use this for several types of computations that are useful in statistics, e.g., averages, similarity matrices, and so on. We give a linear-time, allocation-free algorithm for working with pairs of PCFs at machine precision. From this, we derive algorithms for computing reductions of several PCFs. The algorithms have been implemented in a highly scalable fashion for parallel execution on CPU and, in some cases, (multi-)GPU, and are provided in a \proglang{Python} package. In addition, we provide support for multidimensional arrays of PCFs and vectorized operations on these. As a stress test, we have computed a distance matrix from 500,000 PCFs using 8 GPUs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the homology of periodic cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A periodic cell complex, $K$, has a finite representation as the quotient space, $q(K)$, consisting of equivalence classes of cells identified under the translation group acting on $K$. We study how the Betti numbers and cycles of $K$ are related to those of $q(K)$, first for the case that $K$ is a graph, and then higher-dimensional cell complexes. When $K$ is a $d$-periodic graph, it is possible to define $\mathbb{Z}^d$-weights on the edges of the quotient graph and this information permits full recovery of homology generators for $K$. The situation for higher-dimensional cell complexes is more subtle and studied in detail using the Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>
