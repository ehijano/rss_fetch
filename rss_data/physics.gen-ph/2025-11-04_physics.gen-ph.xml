      <title>Equivalence between the pair correlation functions of primes and of spins in a two-dimensional Ising model with randomly distributed competing interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we prove the equivalence between the pair correlation functions of primes, and of spins in a two-dimensional (2D) Ising model with a mixture of ferromagnetic and randomly distributed competing interactions. At first, we prove that the correlation function between a pair of spins in a distance l within the 2D Ising model is larger than zero at whole temperature region. Second, we prove that the pair correlation function of spins in the model is equivalent to the pair correlation function of its energy levels. Third, we prove that the energy-energy correlation function of the model is equivalent to the pair correlation function of nontrivial zeros of the Dirichlet function (including the Riemann zeta function). Fourth, we prove that the pair correlation function between the nontrivial zeros of the Dirichlet function is equivalent to the correlation function between a pair of primes p and p+q for every even q. In a conclusion, we have proven that the pair correlation function of primes p and p+q for every even q is larger than zero.</description>

      <title>Mechanics as a general-relativistic gauge field theory, and Relational Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We treat Mechanics as a 1-dimensional general-relativistic gauge field theory, Mechanical Field Theory (MFT), introducing what we call the Mechanical Field Space (MFS) and exploiting its bundle geometry. The diffeomorphism covariance of MFT encodes its relational character, arising - as in all general-relativistic physics - via the conjunction of a hole and a point-coincidence argument. Any putative "boundary problem", meaning the claim that boundaries break diffeomorphism and gauge symmetries, thereby dissolves. It is highlighted that the standard path integral (PI) on the MFS, the exact analogue of the PI used in gauge field theory, is conceptually and technically distinct from the standard PI of Quantum Mechanics.
  We then use the Dressing Field Method to give a manifestly invariant and relational reformulation of MFT, which reproduces the standard textbook formulation when a clock field is chosen as a (natural) dressing field. The dressed, or basic, PI on the MFS, defining Relational Quantization - i.e. the quantization of invariant relational d.o.f. - is shown to reproduce the standard PI of Quantum Mechanics. This establishes the soundness of Relational Quantization as a general guiding principle: We outline it for general-relativistic gauge field theories.</description>

      <title>Light Propagation in $\kappa$-Minkowski Space-Time: Gauge Ambiguities and Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the noncommutative $U(1)$ gauge theory on the $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time at the semiclassical approximation. We construct exact solutions of the deformed Maxwell equations in vacuum, describing localized signals propagating in a given direction. The propagation velocity appears to be arbitrary. We figure out that the wave packets with different values of the propagation velocity are related by noncommutative gauge transformations. Moreover, we show that spatial distances between particles are gauge-dependent as well. We explain how these two gauge dependencies compensate each other, recovering gauge invariance of measurement results. According to our analysis, the gauge ambiguity of the speed of light can be absorbed into a redefinition of the unit of length and, therefore, cannot be measured experimentally.</description>
