      <title>Bulk-Surface Event Discrimination in Point Contact Germanium Detectors at Near-Threshold Energies with Shape-Matching Pulse-Shape Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The p-type point-contact germanium (pPCGe) detectors have been widely adopted in searches for low energy physics events such as neutrinos and dark matter. This is due to their enhanced capabilities of background rejection, sensitivity at energies as low as the sub-keV range and particularly fine energy resolution. Nonetheless, the pPCGe is subject to irregular behaviour caused by surface effects for events near the passivated surface. These surface events can, in general, be distinguished from events that occur in the germanium crystal bulk by its slower pulse rise time. Unfortunately, the rise-time spectra of bulk and surface events starts to convolve with each other at sub-keV energies. In this work, we propose a novel method based on cross-correlation shape-matching combined with a low-pass filter to constrain the initial parameter estimates of the signal pulse. This improvement at the lowest level leads to a 50% reduction in computation time and refinements in the rise-time resolution, which will, in the end, enhance the overall analysis. To evaluate the performance of the method, we simulate artificial pulses that resembles bulk and surface pulses by using a programmable pulse generator module (pulser). The pulser-generated pulses are then used to examine the pulse behaviours at near-threshold energies, suggesting a roughly 70% background-leakage reduction in the bulk spectrum. Finally, the method is tested on data collected from the TEXONO experiment, where the results are consistent with our observations in pulser and demonstrated the possibility of lowering the analysis threshold by at least 10eV.</description>

      <title>Software-defined lock-in demodulator for low-frequency resistance noise measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resolution of low-frequency resistance noise measurements is increased by amplitude modulation, shifting the spectrum of the resistance fluctuations away from the 1/f noise contributed by measurement instruments. However, commercial lock-in amplifiers used for de-modulating the fluctuations exhibit a problematic 1/f noise contribution, which imposes a hard lower limit on the relative resistance noise that can be detected. We replace the lock-in amplifier hardware by equivalent digital signal processing performed using open-source software and inexpensive data acquisition systems. Our solution offers superior low-frequency noise performance with a reduction of the voltage power spectral density by about two orders of magnitude compared to high-end commercial instruments.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Frequency Comb High-Resolution Heterodyne Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the advantages of THz frequency combs for high-resolution spectroscopy. This benefits from wide spectral coverage and the exact knowledge of the frequency position of each comb component. Heterodyne detection combined with a fast Fourier spectrometer enables rapid and simultaneous measurement of more than 80 frequency comb modes covering a 7.5 GHz bandwidth. A spectrum is obtained in under 20 minutes yielding a uniform resolution of 70 kHz. This new setup has been validated by recording more than 150 lines of methanol around 723 GHz, and represents a new solution to exploit THz frequency combs for high-resolution spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of food spoilage by high resolution THz analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High resolution rotational Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy has been widely applied to the studies of numerous polar gas phase molecules, in particular volatile organic compounds (VOCs). During the storage of foodstuffs packed under a protective atmosphere, microbial activity will lead to the generation of a complex mixture of trace gases that could be used as food spoilage indicators. Here we have demonstrated that the THz instrumentation presently available provides sufficient sensitivity and selectivity to monitor the generation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the headspace of packed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fillet portions. A comprehensive comparison was made by selective-ion flow-tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) in order to validate the THz measurements and protocol. The detectivity of a range of alternative compounds for this application is also provided, based on the experimental detection limit observed and molecular spectroscopic properties. Molecules like ethanol, methyl mercaptan and ammonia are suitable indicators with the presently available sensitivity levels, while dimethyl sulfide, acetone and butanone may be considered with a sensitivity improvement of 2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Accurate transient heat flux from simple treatment of surface temperature distribution in the semi-infinite case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the variations of surface temperature are measured both spatially and temporally, analytical expressions that correctly account for multi-dimensional transient conduction can be applied. To enhance the accessibility of these accurate multi-dimensional methods, expressions for converting between surface temperature and heat flux are presented as the sum of the one-dimensional component plus the multi-dimensional component. Advantage arises herein because potential numerical challenges are isolated within the one-dimensional component and practitioners are already familiar with well-established one-dimensional methods. The second derivative of the surface heat flux distribution scaled by the thermal diffusivity and the duration of the experiment delivers an approximation of the multi-dimensional conduction term. For the analysis of experiments in which multi-dimensional effects are significant, a simplified numerical approach in which the temperature within each pixel is treated as uniform is demonstrated. The approach involves convolution of temperature differences and pixel-based impulse response functions, followed by a summation of results across the region of interest, but there are no singularities that require special treatment in the multi-dimensional component. Recovery of heat flux distributions to within 1% is demonstrated for two-dimensional heat flux distributions discretized using several tens of elements, and for a three-dimensional distribution discretized using several hundred pixels. Higher accuracy can be achieved by using finer spatial resolution, but the level of discretization used herein is likely sufficient for practical applications since typical experimental uncertainties are much larger than 1%.</description>

      <title>Performance of the LABDOS01 spectrometer in dosimetric measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the performance of the LABDOS01, a silicon diode-based spectrometer suitable for dose measurements in mixed radiation fields. The instrument is currently being used in two high-altitude environmental dose monitoring projects: SAMADHA (South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly Dosimetry at High Altitude) at Chacaltaya (Bolivia, 5240 m a.s.l.) and CORDIAL (COsmic Rays Dosimetry In Antarctic Latitudes) at the Concordia station (Antarctica, 3233 m a.s.l.). Before installing two of these devices at the measurement sites, the detectors were tested on flight routes covering a wide range of geomagnetic latitudes. The collected dosimetric data were compared with the expectations derived by the CARI-7A software, which provides the absorbed dose rate in silicon due to cosmic ray secondaries at a given position on the Earth. The measured dose rates along the flights at variable altitude and rigidity cutoff agree well with the simulated ones. By analyzing the spectrum of the energy deposited in the silicon layer, we derive an empirical method to approximately evaluate the ambient dose equivalent $H^{*}(10)$, a quantity directly related to the biological damage caused by environmental radiation.</description>

      <title>Micro-cavity length stabilization for fluorescence enhancement using schemes based on higher order spatial modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on experimental investigation of potential high-performance cavity length stabilization using odd-indexed higher-order spatial modes. Schemes based on higher-order modes are particularly useful for micro-cavities that are used for enhanced fluorescence detection of a few emitters, which need to minimize photons leaking from a stabilization beam. We describe the design and construction of an assembly for a microcavity setup with tunable high passive stability. In addition, different types of active stabilization techniques based on higher-order modes, are then implemented and characterized based on their performance. We achieved a stability of about 0.5 pm RMS, while the error photons leaking from the continuous locking beam to a fluorescence detector are suppressed by more than 100-fold. We expect these results to be important for quantum technology implementations of various emitter-cavity setups, where these techniques provide a useful tool to meet the highly challenging demands.</description>

      <title>TOrsion-Bar Antenna: A Ground-Based Detector for Low-Frequency Gravity Gradient Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Torsion-Bar Antenna (TOBA) is a torsion pendulum-based gravitational detector developed to observe gravitational waves in frequencies between 1 mHz and 10 Hz. The low resonant frequency of the torsion pendulum enables observation in this frequency band on the ground. The final target of TOBA is to observe gravitational waves with a 10 m detector and expand the observation band of gravitational waves. In this paper, an overview of TOBA, including the previous prototype experiments and the current ongoing development, is presented.</description>

      <title>Local Avalanche Photodetectors Driven by Lightning-rod Effect and Surface Plasmon Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensitive avalanche photodetectors (APDs) that operate within the ultraviolet spectrum are critically required for applications in detecting fire and deep-space exploration. However, the development of such devices faces significant challenges, including high avalanche breakdown voltage, the necessity for complex quenching circuits, and thermal runaway associated with Geiger-mode avalanche operation. To mitigate these issues, we report on a 4H-SiC APD design utilizing micro-holes (MHs) structures and Al nano-triangles (NTs) to enhance surface electric field driven by strong localized surface plasmon excitations and lightning-rod effect. The device demonstrates a record low avalanche breakdown voltage of approximately 14.5 V, a high detectivity of 7E13 Jones, a nanosecond-level response time, and repeated stable detections without the requirement of a quenching circuit. Collectively, when compared with the conventional wide-bandgap-based APDs, this device achieves a reduction in avalanche breakdown voltage by an order of magnitude and exhibits a substantial increase in detectivity. Consequently, the proposed APD configuration presents a promising candidate for ultraviolet detection and integrated optoelectronic circuits.</description>

      <title>Endoscopic Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy through a fiber microprobe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a powerful analytical method for not only the chemical identification of solid, liquid, and gas species, but also the quantification of their concentration. However, the chemical quantification capability of FTIR is significantly hindered when the analyte is surrounded by a strong IR absorbing medium, such as liquid solutions. To overcome this limit, here we develop an IR fiber microprobe that can be inserted into liquid medium, and obtain full FTIR spectra at points of interest. To benchmark this endoscopic FTIR method, we insert the microprobe into bulk water covering a ZnSe substrate and measure the IR transmittance of water as a function of the probe-substrate distance. The obtained vibrational modes, overall transmittance vs z profiles, quantitative absorption coefficients, and micro z-section IR transmittance spectra are all consistent with the standard IR absorption properties of water. The results pave the way for endoscopic chemical profiling inside bulk liquid solutions, promising for applications in many biological, chemical, and electrochemical systems.</description>

      <title>The CuboDAQ Data Acquisition System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CuboDAQ is a custom data acquisition system to read out SiPM-based detectors. It features electronic boards to digitize the SiPMs signal, an FPGA-based system-on-module board, the connectivity to transmit the data to a central server, and all the software necessary to operate them. The front-end is based on the TOFPET2 ASIC, produced by PETsys, connected to a custom board, featuring an Enclustra Mercury SA1 module with a Cyclone~V FPGA. Multiple boards can be operated synchronously by distributing the clock and synchronous reset signals from a central source. The system features a complete software framework to calibrate and monitor the detectors, to acquire and process data and to perform track reconstruction. The CuboDAQ system performance has been evaluated in different scenarios and can cope with sustained rates of above $4\cdot 10^6$ hits/s, with peaks of more than $7\cdot 10^6$ hits/s. This system has been employed for the readout of the SND@LHC detector at CERN, a testbeam telescope and lab setups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on measurements of 1 and 1.5 MeV monoenergetic electrons with a Timepix3-based detector using a 0.5 mm thick silicon sensor. A $^{90}$Sr $\beta$-emitting radioisotope was used as the source of electrons, and a monochromator equipped with an adjustable magnetic field was employed to only pass electrons of desired energy into the detector. We provide experimental results of deposited-energy spectrum in the sensor and linearity of detected tracks. Alongside with the experiment, the whole system has been modelled in software and a Monte Carlo Geant4 / Allpix$^2$ simulation of the experiment has been carried out. Generally, we find a good agreement between the two.</description>
