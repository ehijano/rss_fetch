      <title>Combining straight-line and map-based distances to investigate the connection between proximity to healthy foods and disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthy foods are essential for a healthy life, but accessing healthy food can be more challenging for some people than others. This disparity in food access may lead to disparities in well-being, potentially with disproportionate rates of diseases in communities that face more challenges in accessing healthy food (i.e., low-access communities). Identifying low-access, high-risk communities for targeted interventions is a public health priority, but current methods to quantify food access rely on distance measures that are either computationally simple (like the length of the shortest straight-line route) or accurate (like the length of the shortest map-based driving route), but not both. We propose a multiple imputation approach to combine these distance measures, allowing researchers to harness the computational ease of one with the accuracy of the other. The approach incorporates straight-line distances for all neighborhoods and map-based distances for just a subset, offering comparable estimates to the ``gold standard'' model using map-based distances for all neighborhoods and improved efficiency over the ``complete case'' model using map-based distances for just the subset. Through the adoption of a measurement error framework, information from the straight-line distances can be leveraged to compute informative placeholders (i.e., impute) for any neighborhoods without map-based distances. Using simulations and data for the Piedmont Triad region of North Carolina, we quantify and compare the associations between various health outcomes (diabetes and obesity) and neighborhood-level proximity to healthy foods. The imputation procedure also makes it possible to predict the full landscape of food access in an area without requiring map-based measurements for all neighborhoods.</description>

      <title>Efficient mid-term forecasting of hourly electricity load using generalized additive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate mid-term (weeks to one year) hourly electricity load forecasts are essential for strategic decision-making in power plant operation, ensuring supply security and grid stability, and energy trading. While numerous models effectively predict short-term (hours to a few days) hourly load, mid-term forecasting solutions remain scarce. In mid-term load forecasting, besides daily, weekly, and annual seasonal and autoregressive effects, capturing weather and holiday effects, as well as socio-economic non-stationarities in the data, poses significant modeling challenges. To address these challenges, we propose a novel forecasting method using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) built from interpretable P-splines and enhanced with autoregressive post-processing. This model uses smoothed temperatures, Error-Trend-Seasonal (ETS) modeled non-stationary states, a nuanced representation of holiday effects with weekday variations, and seasonal information as input. The proposed model is evaluated on load data from 24 European countries. This analysis demonstrates that the model not only has significantly enhanced forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods but also offers valuable insights into the influence of individual components on predicted load, given its full interpretability. Achieving performance akin to day-ahead TSO forecasts in fast computation times of a few seconds for several years of hourly data underscores the model's potential for practical application in the power system industry.</description>

      <title>Modelling between- and within-season trajectories in elite athletic performance data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Athletic performance follows a typical pattern of improvement and decline during a career. This pattern is also often observed within-seasons as athlete aims for their performance to peak at key events such as the Olympic Games or World Championships. A Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to analyse the evolution of athletic sporting performance throughout an athlete's career and separate these effects whilst allowing for confounding factors such as environmental conditions. Our model works in continuous time and estimates both the average performance level of the population, $g(t)$, at age $t$ and how each $i$-th athlete differs from the average $f_i(t)$. We further decompose $f_i(t)$ into changes from season-to-season, termed the between-season performance trajectory, and within-season performance trajectories which are modelled by a constrained Bernstein polynomial. Hence, the specific focus of this project is to identify the differences in performance that exist both between and within-seasons for each athlete. For the implementation of the model an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm is used. An illustration of algorithm's performance on 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle swimming in both female and male athletes is presented.</description>

      <title>Multicalibration for Censored Survival Data: Towards Universal Adaptability in Predictive Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional statistical and machine learning methods assume identical distribution for the training and test data sets. This assumption, however, is often violated in real applications, particularly in health care research, where the training data~(source) may underrepresent specific subpopulations in the testing or target domain. Such disparities, coupled with censored observations, present significant challenges for investigators aiming to make predictions for those minority groups. This paper focuses on target-independent learning under covariate shift, where we study multicalibration for survival probability and restricted mean survival time, and propose a black-box post-processing boosting algorithm designed for censored survival data. Our algorithm, leveraging the pseudo observations, yields a multicalibrated predictor competitive with propensity scoring regarding predictions on the unlabeled target domain, not just overall but across diverse subpopulations. Our theoretical analysis for pseudo observations relies on functional delta method and $p$-variational norm. We further investigate the algorithm's sample complexity and convergence properties, as well as the multicalibration guarantee for post-processed predictors. Our theoretical insights reveal the link between multicalibration and universal adaptability, suggesting that our calibrated function performs comparably to, if not better than, the inverse propensity score weighting estimator. The performance of our proposed methods is corroborated through extensive numerical simulations and a real-world case study focusing on prediction of cardiovascular disease risk in two large prospective cohort studies. These empirical results confirm its potential as a powerful tool for predictive analysis with censored outcomes in diverse and shifting populations.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis for Attributable Effects in Case$^2$ Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The case$^2$ study, also referred to as the case-case study design, is a valuable approach for conducting inference for treatment effects. Unlike traditional case-control studies, the case$^2$ design compares treatment in two types of cases with the same disease. A key quantity of interest is the attributable effect, which is the number of cases of disease among treated units which are caused by the treatment. Two key assumptions that are usually made for making inferences about the attributable effect in case$^2$ studies are 1.) treatment does not cause the second type of case, and 2.) the treatment does not alter an individual's case type. However, these assumptions are not realistic in many real-data applications. In this article, we present a sensitivity analysis framework to scrutinize the impact of deviations from these assumptions on obtained results. We also include sensitivity analyses related to the assumption of unmeasured confounding, recognizing the potential bias introduced by unobserved covariates. The proposed methodology is exemplified through an investigation into whether having violent behavior in the last year of life increases suicide risk via 1993 National Mortality Followback Survey dataset.</description>

      <title>On the PM2.5 -- Mortality Relationship: A Bayesian Dynamic Model for Spatio-Temporal Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial confounding, often regarded as a major concern in epidemiological studies, relates to the difficulty of recovering the effect of an exposure on an outcome when these variables are associated with unobserved factors. This issue is particularly challenging in spatio-temporal analyses, where it has been less explored so far. To study the effects of air pollution on mortality in Italy, we argue that a model that simultaneously accounts for spatio-temporal confounding and for the non-linear form of the effect of interest is needed. To this end, we propose a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model, which allows for a non-linear association and for a decomposition of the exposure effect into two components. This decomposition accommodates associations with the outcome at fine and coarse temporal and spatial scales of variation. These features, when combined, allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the true shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results from the real-data application indicate that the exposure effect seems to have different magnitudes in different seasons, with peaks in the summer. We hypothesize that this could be due to possible interactions between the exposure variable with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</description>

      <title>Acquiring Better Load Estimates by Combining Anomaly and Change-point Detection in Power Grid Time-series Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present novel methodology for automatic anomaly and switch event filtering to improve load estimation in power grid systems. By leveraging unsupervised methods with supervised optimization, our approach prioritizes interpretability while ensuring robust and generalizable performance on unseen data. Through experimentation, a combination of binary segmentation for change point detection and statistical process control for anomaly detection emerges as the most effective strategy, specifically when ensembled in a novel sequential manner. Results indicate the clear wasted potential when filtering is not applied. The automatic load estimation is also fairly accurate, with approximately 90% of estimates falling within a 10% error margin, with only a single significant failure in both the minimum and maximum load estimates across 60 measurements in the test set. Our methodology's interpretability makes it particularly suitable for critical infrastructure planning, thereby enhancing decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Fast Emulation and Modular Calibration for Simulators with Functional Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable surrogate models enable efficient emulation of computer models (or simulators), particularly when dealing with large ensembles of runs. While Gaussian Process (GP) models are commonly employed for emulation, they face limitations in scaling to truly large datasets. Furthermore, when dealing with dense functional output, such as spatial or time-series data, additional complexities arise, requiring careful handling to ensure fast emulation. This work presents a highly scalable emulator for functional data, building upon the works of Kennedy and O'Hagan (2001) and Higdon et al. (2008), while incorporating the local approximate Gaussian Process framework proposed by Gramacy and Apley (2015). The emulator utilizes global GP lengthscale parameter estimates to scale the input space, leading to a substantial improvement in prediction speed. We demonstrate that our fast approximation-based emulator can serve as a viable alternative to the methods outlined in Higdon et al. (2008) for functional response, while drastically reducing computational costs. The proposed emulator is applied to quickly calibrate the multiphysics continuum hydrodynamics simulator FLAG with a large ensemble of 20000 runs. The methods presented are implemented in the R package FlaGP.</description>

      <title>Latent Energy-Based Odyssey: Black-Box Optimization via Expanded Exploration in the Energy-Based Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline Black-Box Optimization (BBO) aims at optimizing a black-box function using the knowledge from a pre-collected offline dataset of function values and corresponding input designs. However, the high-dimensional and highly-multimodal input design space of black-box function pose inherent challenges for most existing methods that model and operate directly upon input designs. These issues include but are not limited to high sample complexity, which relates to inaccurate approximation of black-box function; and insufficient coverage and exploration of input design modes, which leads to suboptimal proposal of new input designs. In this work, we consider finding a latent space that serves as a compressed yet accurate representation of the design-value joint space, enabling effective latent exploration of high-value input design modes. To this end, we formulate an learnable energy-based latent space, and propose Noise-intensified Telescoping density-Ratio Estimation (NTRE) scheme for variational learning of an accurate latent space model without costly Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The optimization process is then exploration of high-value designs guided by the learned energy-based model in the latent space, formulated as gradient-based sampling from a latent-variable-parameterized inverse model. We show that our particular parameterization encourages expanded exploration around high-value design modes, motivated by inversion thinking of a fundamental result of conditional covariance matrix typically used for variance reduction. We observe that our method, backed by an accurately learned informative latent space and an expanding-exploration model design, yields significant improvements over strong previous methods on both synthetic and real world datasets such as the design-bench suite.</description>

      <title>The Multi-Range Theory of Translation Quality Measurement: MQM scoring models and Statistical Quality Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The year 2024 marks the 10th anniversary of the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework for analytic translation quality evaluation. The MQM error typology has been widely used by practitioners in the translation and localization industry and has served as the basis for many derivative projects. The annual Conference on Machine Translation (WMT) shared tasks on both human and automatic translation quality evaluations used the MQM error typology.
  The metric stands on two pillars: error typology and the scoring model. The scoring model calculates the quality score from annotation data, detailing how to convert error type and severity counts into numeric scores to determine if the content meets specifications. Previously, only the raw scoring model had been published. This April, the MQM Council published the Linear Calibrated Scoring Model, officially presented herein, along with the Non-Linear Scoring Model, which had not been published before.
  This paper details the latest MQM developments and presents a universal approach to translation quality measurement across three sample size ranges. It also explains why Statistical Quality Control should be used for very small sample sizes, starting from a single sentence.</description>

      <title>Exact phylodynamic likelihood via structured Markov genealogy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider genealogies arising from a Markov population process in which individuals are categorized into a discrete collection of compartments, with the requirement that individuals within the same compartment are statistically exchangeable. When equipped with a sampling process, each such population process induces a time-evolving tree-valued process defined as the genealogy of all sampled individuals. We provide a construction of this genealogy process and derive exact expressions for the likelihood of an observed genealogy in terms of filter equations. These filter equations can be numerically solved using standard Monte Carlo integration methods. Thus, we obtain statistically efficient likelihood-based inference for essentially arbitrary compartment models based on an observed genealogy of individuals sampled from the population.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Innovation School System in Korea: A Latent Space Item Response Model with Neyman-Scott Point Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: South Korea's educational system has faced criticism for its lack of focus on critical thinking and creativity, resulting in high levels of stress and anxiety among students. As part of the government's effort to improve the educational system, the innovation school system was introduced in 2009, which aims to develop students' creativity as well as their non-cognitive skills. To better understand the differences between innovation and regular school systems in South Korea, we propose a novel method that combines the latent space item response model (LSIRM) with the Neyman-Scott (NS) point process model. Our method accounts for the heterogeneity of items and students, captures relationships between respondents and items, and identifies item and student clusters that can provide a comprehensive understanding of students' behaviors/perceptions on non-cognitive outcomes. Our analysis reveals that students in the innovation school system show a higher sense of citizenship, while those in the regular school system tend to associate confidence in appearance with social ability. We compare our model with exploratory item factor analysis in terms of item clustering and find that our approach provides a more detailed and automated analysis. A comparison with exploratory item factor analysis highlights our method's advantages in terms of uncertainty quantification of the clustering process and more detailed and nuanced clustering results. Our method is made available to an existing R package, lsirm12pl.</description>

      <title>A flexible model for correlated count data, with application to multi-condition differential expression analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting differences in gene expression is an important part of single-cell RNA sequencing experiments, and many statistical methods have been developed for this aim. Most differential expression analyses focus on comparing expression between two groups (e.g., treatment vs. control). But there is increasing interest in multi-condition differential expression analyses in which expression is measured in many conditions, and the aim is to accurately detect and estimate expression differences in all conditions. We show that directly modeling single-cell RNA-seq counts in all conditions simultaneously, while also inferring how expression differences are shared across conditions, leads to greatly improved performance for detecting and estimating expression differences compared to existing methods. We illustrate the potential of this new approach by analyzing data from a single-cell experiment studying the effects of cytokine stimulation on gene expression. We call our new method "Poisson multivariate adaptive shrinkage", and it is implemented in an R package available online at https://github.com/stephenslab/poisson.mash.alpha.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Bayesian inference for community detection and connectivity of functional brain networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies rely on estimates of hierarchically organised brain networks whose segregation and integration reflect the dynamic transitions of latent cognitive states. However, most existing methods for estimating the community structure of networks from both individual and group-level analysis neglect the variability between subjects and lack validation. In this paper, we develop a new multilayer community detection method based on Bayesian latent block modelling. The method can robustly detect the group-level community structure of weighted functional networks that give rise to hidden brain states with an unknown number of communities and retain the variability of individual networks. For validation, we propose a new community structure-based multivariate Gaussian generative model to simulate synthetic signal. Our result shows that the inferred community memberships using hierarchical Bayesian analysis are consistent with the predefined node labels in the generative model. The method is also tested using real working memory task-fMRI data of 100 unrelated healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project. The results show distinctive community structure patterns between 2-back, 0-back, and fixation conditions, which may reflect cognitive and behavioural states under working memory task conditions.</description>

      <title>Continual Release of Differentially Private Synthetic Data from Longitudinal Data Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by privacy concerns in long-term longitudinal studies in medical and social science research, we study the problem of continually releasing differentially private synthetic data from longitudinal data collections. We introduce a model where, in every time step, each individual reports a new data element, and the goal of the synthesizer is to incrementally update a synthetic dataset in a consistent way to capture a rich class of statistical properties. We give continual synthetic data generation algorithms that preserve two basic types of queries: fixed time window queries and cumulative time queries. We show nearly tight upper bounds on the error rates of these algorithms and demonstrate their empirical performance on realistically sized datasets from the U.S. Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Likelihood Analysis for Student-L\'evy Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quasi-likelihood analysis for a linear regression model driven by a Student-t L\'{e}vy process with constant scale and arbitrary degrees of freedom. The model is observed at high frequency over an extending period, under which we can quantify how the sampling frequency affects estimation accuracy. In that setting, joint estimation of trend, scale, and degrees of freedom is a non-trivial problem. The bottleneck is that the Student-t distribution is not closed under convolution, making it difficult to estimate all the parameters fully based on the high-frequency time scale. To efficiently deal with the intricate nature from both theoretical and computational points of view, we propose a two-step quasi-likelihood analysis: first, we make use of the Cauchy quasi-likelihood for estimating the regression-coefficient vector and the scale parameter; then, we construct the sequence of the unit-period cumulative residuals to estimate the remaining degrees of freedom. In particular, using full data in the first step causes a problem stemming from the small-time Cauchy approximation, showing the need for data thinning.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Safe Policy Learning with Chance Constrained Optimization: Application to Military Security Assessment during the Vietnam War</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic decisions and recommendations are used in many high-stakes decision-making settings such as criminal justice, medicine, and public policy. We investigate whether it would have been possible to improve a security assessment algorithm employed during the Vietnam War, using outcomes measured immediately after its introduction in late 1969. This empirical application raises several methodological challenges that frequently arise in high-stakes algorithmic decision-making. First, before implementing a new algorithm, it is essential to characterize and control the risk of yielding worse outcomes than the existing algorithm. Second, the existing algorithm is deterministic, and learning a new algorithm requires transparent extrapolation. Third, the existing algorithm involves discrete decision tables that are difficult to optimize over.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Average Conditional Risk (ACRisk), which first quantifies the risk that a new algorithmic policy leads to worse outcomes for subgroups of individual units and then averages this over the distribution of subgroups. We also propose a Bayesian policy learning framework that maximizes the posterior expected value while controlling the posterior expected ACRisk. This framework separates the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects from policy optimization, enabling flexible estimation of effects and optimization over complex policy classes. We characterize the resulting chance-constrained optimization problem as a constrained linear programming problem. Our analysis shows that compared to the actual algorithm used during the Vietnam War, the learned algorithm assesses most regions as more secure and emphasizes economic and political factors over military factors.</description>

      <title>Dynamic survival analysis: modelling the hazard function via ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05205v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hazard function represents one of the main quantities of interest in the analysis of survival data. We propose a general approach for parametrically modelling the dynamics of the hazard function using systems of autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This modelling approach can be used to provide qualitative and quantitative analyses of the evolution of the hazard function over time. Our proposal capitalises on the extensive literature of ODEs which, in particular, allow for establishing basic rules or laws on the dynamics of the hazard function via the use of autonomous ODEs. We show how to implement the proposed modelling framework in cases where there is an analytic solution to the system of ODEs or where an ODE solver is required to obtain a numerical solution. We focus on the use of a Bayesian modelling approach, but the proposed methodology can also be coupled with maximum likelihood estimation. A simulation study is presented to illustrate the performance of these models and the interplay of sample size and censoring. Two case studies using real data are presented to illustrate the use of the proposed approach and to highlight the interpretability of the corresponding models. We conclude with a discussion on potential extensions of our work and strategies to include covariates into our framework. Although we focus on examples on Medical Statistics, the proposed framework is applicable in any context where the interest lies on estimating and interpreting the dynamics hazard function.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Evolutionary Trends in Corporate ESG Reporting: A Study based on Knowledge Management Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07001</link>

Abstract: Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reports are globally recognized as a keystone in sustainable enterprise development. However, current literature has not concluded the development of topics and trends in ESG contexts in the twenty-first century. Therefore, We selected 1114 ESG reports from firms in the technology industry to analyze the evolutionary trends of ESG topics by text mining. We discovered the homogenization effect towards low environmental, medium governance, and high social features in the evolution. We also designed a strategic framework to look closer into the dynamic changes of firms' within-industry scores and across-domain importances. We found that companies are gradually converging towards the third quadrant, which indicates that firms contribute less to industrial outstanding and professional distinctiveness in ESG reporting. Firms choose to imitate ESG reports from each other to mitigate uncertainty and enhance behavioral legitimacy.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-loop: Towards Label Embeddings for Measuring Classification Difficulty</title>

Abstract: Uncertainty in machine learning models is a timely and vast field of research. In supervised learning, uncertainty can already occur in the first stage of the training process, the annotation phase. This scenario is particularly evident when some instances cannot be definitively classified. In other words, there is inevitable ambiguity in the annotation step and hence, not necessarily a "ground truth" associated with each instance. The main idea of this work is to drop the assumption of a ground truth label and instead embed the annotations into a multidimensional space. This embedding is derived from the empirical distribution of annotations in a Bayesian setup, modeled via a Dirichlet-Multinomial framework. We estimate the model parameters and posteriors using a stochastic Expectation Maximization algorithm with Markov Chain Monte Carlo steps. The methods developed in this paper readily extend to various situations where multiple annotators independently label instances. To showcase the generality of the proposed approach, we apply our approach to three benchmark datasets for image classification and Natural Language Inference. Besides the embeddings, we can investigate the resulting correlation matrices, which reflect the semantic similarities of the original classes very well for all three exemplary datasets.</description>

      <title>Decoding Social Sentiment in DAO: A Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Governance Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blockchain technology is leading a revolutionary transformation across diverse industries, with effective governance being critical for the success and sustainability of blockchain projects. Community forums, pivotal in engaging decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), significantly impact blockchain governance decisions. Concurrently, Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, provides powerful insights from textual data. While prior research has explored the potential of NLP tools in social media sentiment analysis, there is a gap in understanding the sentiment landscape of blockchain governance communities. The evolving discourse and sentiment dynamics on the forums of top DAOs remain largely unknown. This paper delves deep into the evolving discourse and sentiment dynamics on the public forums of leading DeFi projects: Aave, Uniswap, Curve DAO, Yearn.finance, Merit Circle, and Balancer, focusing primarily on discussions related to governance issues. Our study shows that participants in decentralized communities generally express positive sentiments during Discord discussions. Furthermore, there is a potential interaction between discussion intensity and sentiment dynamics; higher discussion volume may contribute to a more stable sentiment from code analysis. The insights gained from this study are valuable for decision-makers in blockchain governance, underscoring the pivotal role of sentiment analysis in interpreting community emotions and its evolving impact on the landscape of blockchain governance. This research significantly contributes to the interdisciplinary exploration of the intersection of blockchain and society, specifically emphasizing the decentralized blockchain governance ecosystem. We provide our data and code for replicability as open access on GitHub.</description>
