      <title>Structured illumination microscopy with extreme ultraviolet pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relentless pursuit of understanding matter at ever-finer scales has pushed optical microscopy to surpass the diffraction limit and produced the super-resolution microscopy which enables visualizing structures shorter than the wavelength of light. In the present work, we harnessed extreme ultraviolet beams to create a sub-{\mu}m grating structure, which was revealed by extreme ultraviolet structured illumination microscopy. This achievement marks the first step toward extending such a super-resolution technique into the X-ray regime, where achieving atomic-scale resolution becomes a charming possibility.</description>

      <title>Dynamic interaction between chiral currents and surface waves in topological superfluids: a pathway to detect Majorana fermions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental efforts over the past two decades, the quest for Majorana fermions in superconductors remains inconclusive. We propose an experimental method that can conclusively confirm, or rule out, the existence of these quasiparticles: Firstly, we shift focus from superconductors, whose very topological nature is disputed, to the unambiguous topological superfluid $^3$He. Secondly, we identify the interaction between surface waves and the chiral Majorana current in the bulk of a topological superfluid of varying density. The proposed experiment provides a path towards the detection of the Majorana fermion, an 80-year-old theoretical prediction. It is realistically achievable based on the advent of microscopic superfluid resonators coupled to optical cavities. The proposal may open the door to experiments ranging from simulations of exotic cosmological particles to topological acoustics and fault tolerant quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast exciton transport in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons in van der Waals heterostructures based on atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides are considered as potential candidates for the formation of a superfluid state in two-dimensional systems. A number of studies reported observations of ultrafast nondiffusive propagation of excitons in van der Waals heterostructures, which was considered by their authors as possible evidence of collective effects in excitonic systems. In this paper, after a brief analysis of exciton propagation regimes in two-dimensional semiconductors, an alternative model of ultrafast exciton transport is proposed, based on the formation of waveguide modes in van der Waals heterostructures and the radiation transfer by these modes.</description>

      <title>Topology of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02792v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the quantum spin-Hall edge channels of two-dimensional colloidal nanocrystals of the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ were observed directly. Motivated by this development, we reconsider the four-band effective model which has been traditionally employed in the past to describe thin nanosheets of this material. Derived from a three-dimensional $\boldsymbol{k} \boldsymbol{\cdot} \boldsymbol{p}$ model, it physically describes the top and bottom electronic surface states at the $\Gamma$ point that become gapped due to the material's small thickness. However, we find that the four-band model for the surface states alone, as derived directly from the three-dimensional theory, is inadequate for the description of thin films of a few quintuple layers and even yields an incorrect topological invariant within a significant range of thicknesses. To address this limitation we propose an eight-band model which, in addition to the surface states, also incorporates the set of bulk states closest to the Fermi level. We find that the eight-band model not only captures most of the experimental observations, but also agrees with previous first-principles calculations of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ invariant in thin films of varying thickness. The band inversion around the $\Gamma$ point, which endows the surface-like bands with topology, is shown to be enabled by the presence of the additional bulk-like states without requiring any reparametrization of the resulting effective Hamiltonian.</description>
