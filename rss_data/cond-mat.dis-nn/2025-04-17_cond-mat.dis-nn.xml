      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Multiscale Modeling of Polymer Composite Materials Using Physically Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates whether Physically Recurrent Neural Networks (PRNNs), a recent surrogate model for heterogeneous materials, trained on a micromodel with fixed material parameters, can maintain accuracy for varying material properties without retraining, and propagate uncertainty in a multiscale framework. Unlike conventional RNNs, where parameter changes require training or explicit inclusion of material properties as extra input features, PRNNs embeds material models in their material layer that allow for modification of material parameters after training. When adjusting material properties dynamically according to the input during testing, PRNN shows high accuracy across a wide range of parameters. Therefore the surrogate can be applied to multiscale uncertainty quantification (UQ). Compared to the full-order simulations on an overly coarse mesh, the PRNN-driven model reduces simulation time by over 7000 times while accurately capturing highly nonlinear evolution of the probability density for the macroscopic response as a result of a given distribution for microscale material parameters. A PRNN-driven UQ is demonstrated on a more accurate finer mesh that would be computationally infeasible with the full-order model.</description>

      <title>Training and synchronizing oscillator networks with Equilibrium Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillator networks represent a promising technology for unconventional computing and artificial intelligence. Thus far, these systems have primarily been demonstrated in small-scale implementations, such as Ising Machines for solving combinatorial problems and associative memories for image recognition, typically trained without state-of-the-art gradient-based algorithms. Scaling up oscillator-based systems requires advanced gradient-based training methods that also ensure robustness against frequency dispersion between individual oscillators. Here, we demonstrate through simulations that the Equilibrium Propagation algorithm enables effective gradient-based training of oscillator networks, facilitating synchronization even when initial oscillator frequencies are significantly dispersed. We specifically investigate two oscillator models: purely phase-coupled oscillators and oscillators coupled via both amplitude and phase interactions. Our results show that these oscillator networks can scale successfully to standard image recognition benchmarks, such as achieving nearly 98\% test accuracy on the MNIST dataset, despite noise introduced by imperfect synchronization. This work thus paves the way for practical hardware implementations of large-scale oscillator networks, such as those based on spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Max-Cut graph-driven quantum circuit design for planar spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the ground state of spin glasses is a challenging problem with broad implications. Many hard optimization problems, including NP-complete problems, can be mapped, for instance, to the Ising spin glass model. We present a graph-based approach that allows for accurate state initialization of a frustrated triangular spin-lattice with up to 20 sites that stays away from barren plateaus. To optimize circuit efficiency and trainability, we employ a clustering strategy that organizes qubits into distinct groups based on the maximum cut technique, which divides the lattice into two subsets maximally disconnected. We provide evidence that this Max-Cut-based lattice division offers a robust framework for optimizing circuit design and effectively modeling frustrated systems at polynomial cost. All simulations are performed within the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) formalism, the current paradigm for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ), but can be extended beyond. Our results underscore the potential of hybrid quantum-classical methods in addressing complex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.</description>

      <title>Control-driven critical fluctuations across quantum trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitored quantum circuits in which entangling unitary dynamics compete with projective local measurements can host measurement-induced phase transitions witnessed by entanglement measures at late times. Adding feedback conditioned on the measurement outcomes gives rise to another type of phase transition witnessed by local order parameters and correlation functions. These transitions, known as control or absorbing-state transitions, generically occur within the area-law entanglement phase and are thought to be governed by classical physics in that their critical exponents match those of the classical limit of the model. In this work, we examine quantum features of these transitions, focusing on a Bernoulli circuit model with a well-defined classical limit. First we demonstrate that, in the local basis defined by the absorbing state, the steady-state quantum coherence undergoes a phase transition at the control transition, where its logarithm changes discontinuously from volume- to area-law scaling. Second, we analyze the control transition from the perspective of fluctuations in observables, which carry two contributions: classical fluctuations over circuit realizations (present in the classical limit), and quantum fluctuations over trajectories and states (both absent in the classical limit). Both contributions can be estimated in experiments without post-selection. The circuit-to-circuit fluctuations, the dominant contribution, carry the critical behavior of the classical limit. However, the subleading quantum fluctuations that represent fluctuations between different quantum "worlds" also go critical at the control transition. These critical quantum fluctuations at the control transition also occur in other models, and we discuss how they can be measured experimentally without post-selection.</description>

      <title>Reconstructions and Dynamics of $\beta$-Lithium Thiophosphate Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium thiophosphate (LPS) is a promising solid electrolyte for next-generation lithium-ion batteries due to its superior energy storage, high ionic conductivity, and low-flammability components. Despite its potential, the high reactivity of LPS with common contaminants such as atmospheric water, preparation solvents, and electrode materials poses significant challenges for commercialization. The lack of understanding regarding the structure, morphology, and chemical behavior of LPS's surface slows down the search for solutions to these issues. Here, we utilize a machine learning interatomic potential to achieve a fundamental, atomistic understanding of the mechanical and chemical properties of the $\beta$-Li$_3$PS$_4$ surfaces. Employing molecular dynamics simulations, we identify relevant surface complexions formed by surface reconstructions, determine their surface energies and compute the Wulff shape of $\beta$-LPS. The most stable complexions exhibit properties distinctly different from the bulk, including amorphization, increased density, decreased conductivity and large deformation of the structure building blocks. We demonstrate that these surfaces are not static, but undergo significant dynamical activity which is clearly identified by an analysis featuring a time-averaged structural descriptor. Finally, we examine the changes of the electronic structure induced by the surface complexions, which provides us with details on changes in surface reactivity and active sites, underlining the importance to investigate surface complexions under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium physics of brain dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information processing in the brain is coordinated by the dynamic activity of neurons and neural populations at a range of spatiotemporal scales. These dynamics, captured in the form of electrophysiological recordings and neuroimaging, show evidence of time-irreversibility and broken detailed balance suggesting that the brain operates in a nonequilibrium stationary state. Furthermore, the level of nonequilibrium, measured by entropy production or irreversibility appears to be a crucial signature of cognitive complexity and consciousness. The subsequent study of neural dynamics from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical physics is an emergent field that challenges the assumptions of symmetry and maximum-entropy that are common in traditional models. In this review, we discuss the plethora of exciting results emerging at the interface of nonequilibrium dynamics and neuroscience. We begin with an introduction to the mathematical paradigms necessary to understand nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous and discrete state-spaces. Next, we review both model-free and model-based approaches to analysing nonequilibrium dynamics in both continuous-state recordings and neural spike-trains, as well as the results of such analyses. We briefly consider the topic of nonequilibrium computation in neural systems, before concluding with a discussion and outlook on the field.</description>

      <title>Scaling of the Integrated Quantum Metric in Disordered Topological Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12677v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a study of a disorder-dependent real-space representation of the quantum geometry in topological systems. Thanks to the development of an efficient linear-scaling numerical methodology based on the kernel polynomial method, we can explore nontrivial behavior of the integrated quantum metric and Chern number in disordered systems with sizes reaching the experimental scale. We illustrate this approach in the disordered Haldane model, examining the impact of Anderson disorder and vacancies on the trivial and topological phases captured by this model.</description>

      <title>Scale-free localization versus Anderson localization in unidirectional quasiperiodic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scale-free localization emerging in non-Hermitian physics has recently garnered significant attention. In this work, we explore the interplay between scale-free localization and Anderson localization by investigating a unidirectional quasiperiodic model with generalized boundary conditions. We derive analytical expressions of Lyapunov exponent from the bulk equations. Together with the boundary equation, we can determine properties of eigenstates and spectrum and establish their exact relationships with the quasiperiodic potential strength and boundary parameter. While eigenstates exhibit scale-free localization in the weak disorder regime, they become localized in the strong disorder regime. The scale-free and Anderson localized states satisfy the boundary equation in distinct ways, leading to different localization properties and scaling behaviors. Generalizing our framework, we design a model with exact energy edges separating the scale-free and Anderson localized states via the mosaic modulation of quasiperiodic potentials. Our models can be realized experimentally in electric circuits.</description>

      <title>Critical exponents at the Nishimori point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nishimori point of the random bond Ising model is a prototype of renormalization group fixed points with strong disorder. We show that the exact correlation length and crossover critical exponents at this point can be identified in two and three spatial dimensions starting from properties of the Nishimori line. These are the first exact exponents for frustrated random magnets, a circumstance to be also contrasted with the fact that the exact exponents of the Ising model without disorder are not known in three dimensions. Our considerations extend to higher dimensions and models other than Ising.</description>
