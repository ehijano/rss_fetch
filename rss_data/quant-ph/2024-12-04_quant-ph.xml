      <title>Contractive Unitary and Classical Shadow Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum technology demands efficient characterization of complex quantum many-body states. However, full quantum state tomography requires an exponential number of measurements in system size, preventing its practical use in large-scale quantum devices. A major recent breakthrough in this direction, called classical shadow tomography, significantly reduces the sample complexity, the number of samples needed to estimate properties of a state, by implementing random Clifford rotations before measurements. Despite many recent efforts, reducing the sample complexity below $\mathbf{2^k}$ for extracting any non-successive local operators with a size $\sim \mathbf{k}$ remains a challenge. In this work, we achieve a significantly smaller sample complexity of $\mathbf{\sim 1.8^k}$ using a protocol that hybridizes locally random and globally deterministic unitary operations. The key insight is the discovery of a deterministic global unitary, termed as \textit{contractive unitary}, which is more efficient in reducing the operator size to enhance tomography efficiency. The contractive unitary perfectly matches the advantages of the atom array quantum computation platform and is readily realized in the atom array quantum processor. More importantly, it highlights a new strategy in classical shadow tomography, demonstrating that a random-deterministic hybridized protocol can be more efficient than fully random measurements.</description>

      <title>Generalized Loschmidt echo and information scrambling in open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, typically explored in closed quantum systems, describes the spread of initially localized information throughout a system and can be quantified by measures such as the Loschmidt echo (LE) and out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). In this paper, we explore information scrambling in the presence of dissipation by generalizing the concepts of LE and OTOC to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. We investigate the universal dynamics of the generalized LE across regimes of weak and strong dissipation. In the weak dissipation regime, we identify a universal structure, while in the strong dissipation regime, we observe a distinctive two-local-minima structure, which we interpret through an analysis of the Lindblad spectrum. Furthermore, we establish connections between the thermal averages of LE and OTOC and prove a general relation between OTOC and R\'enyi entropy in open systems. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol for measuring OTOC in open systems. These findings provide deeper insights into information scrambling under dissipation and pave the way for experimental studies in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>MQFL-FHE: Multimodal Quantum Federated Learning Framework with Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01858v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) in federated learning (FL) has led to significant advances in data privacy. However, during the aggregation phase, it often results in performance degradation of the aggregated model, hindering the development of robust representational generalization. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal quantum federated learning framework that utilizes quantum computing to counteract the performance drop resulting from FHE. For the first time in FL, our framework combines a multimodal quantum mixture of experts (MQMoE) model with FHE, incorporating multimodal datasets for enriched representation and task-specific learning. Our MQMoE framework enhances performance on multimodal datasets and combined genomics and brain MRI scans, especially for underrepresented categories. Our results also demonstrate that the quantum-enhanced approach mitigates the performance degradation associated with FHE and improves classification accuracy across diverse datasets, validating the potential of quantum interventions in enhancing privacy in FL.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Frameworks of All-Quantum Mode Adaptable Communication Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diversity of quantum communication protocols and their rapid growth entail the development of the Quantum Internet, the interconnection of various quantum communication nodes and systems. One of the challenges posed by this development is all-quantum mode adaptation, which is essential for adapting different quantum nodes to the common network, enhancing the efficiency and scalability of quantum information transmission. This paper investigates the mathematical frameworks of all-quantum mode adaptation, focusing on three essential elements-mode expansion, mode reduction, and mode mapping-which are crucial for managing compatibility among different quantum signals. By leveraging various degrees of freedom of photons, we demonstrate the possibility of adaptable all-quantum processors that can dynamically adjust to different communication environments, addressing real-world challenges in the Quantum Internet.</description>

      <title>Approximate Quantum Circuit Synthesis for Diagonal Unitary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum circuit synthesis problem bridges quantum algorithm design and quantum hardware implementation in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In quantum circuit synthesis problems, diagonal unitary synthesis plays a crucial role due to its fundamental and versatile nature. Meanwhile, experimental results have shown that moderately approximating the original algorithm to conserve quantum resources can improve the fidelity of algorithms during quantum execution. Building on this insight, we propose a quantum circuit synthesis algorithm to design diagonal unitary implementations based on specified quantum resource limits. Our algorithm can synthesize diagonal unitary for quantum circuits with up to 15 qubits on an ordinary laptop. In algorithm efficiency, synthesizing an n-qubit unitary matrix with an exact algorithm requires $2^n$ CNOT gates as a baseline. Within the algorithm error $\varepsilon $ range of interest (0\%-12\%), our algorithm achieves a $3.2\varepsilon $ reduction in CNOT gates on average. In runtime, the algorithm efficiently performs, synthesizing 12-qubit diagonal unitary in an average of 6.57 seconds and 15-qubit in approximately 561.71 seconds.</description>

      <title>Matchgate circuits deeply thermalize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ensemble of states generated by performing projective measurements on the output of a random matchgate (or free-fermionic) quantum circuit. We rigorously show that this `projected ensemble' exhibits deep thermalization: For large system sizes, it converges towards a universal ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As well as proving moment-wise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale $t \sim L^2$ set by the diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Universal microscopic descriptions for statistics of particles and extended excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistics of excitations play an essential role in understanding phases of matter. In this paper, we introduce a universal method for studying the generalized statistics of Abelian particles and extended excitations in lattices of any dimension. We compute the statistics using the Berry phase of a sequence of unitary operators that transports the excitations while canceling local ambiguities at each step. The sequence is derived from locality, using the Smith normal form. We show that the statistics are quantized invariants. Our method unifies the statistics for the braiding and fusion of particles and loops, and leads to the discovery of novel statistics for membrane excitations. The statistics can be interpreted as the quantum anomaly of a generalized global symmetry, which manifests as an obstruction to gauging the symmetry on lattices. Furthermore, we show that non-trivial statistics forbid short-range entangled states, establishing the dynamical consequence of anomalies in microscopic lattice models.</description>

      <title>An access model for quantum encoded data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a data access model (approximate sample and query) that is satisfiable by the preparation and measurement of block encoded states, as well as in contexts such as classical quantum circuit simulation or Pauli sampling. We illustrate that this abstraction is compositional and has some computational power. We then apply these results to obtain polynomial improvements over the state of the art in the sample and computational complexity of distributed inner product estimation. By doing so, we provide a new interpretation for why Pauli sampling is useful for this task. Our results partially characterize the power of time-limited fault-tolerant quantum circuits aided by classical computation. They are a first step towards extending the classical data Quantum Singular Value Transform dequantization results to a quantum setting.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space separability and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics is formulated on a Hilbert space that is assumed to be separable. However, there seems to be no clear reason justifying this assumption. Does it have physical implications? We answer in the positive by proposing a test that witnesses the non-separability of the Hilbert space, at the expense of requiring measurements with uncountably many outcomes. In the search for a less elusive manifestation of non-separability, we consider the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) state as a candidate for possessing nonlocal correlations stronger than any state in a separable Hilbert space. Nevertheless, we show that, under mild assumptions, this state is not a vector in any bipartite space, even non-separable, and therefore cannot be described within the standard Hilbert space formalism.</description>

      <title>Spin Qubit Performance at the Error Correction Threshold: Advancing Quantum Information Processing Above 700 mK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a characterization of a two-qubit processor in a 6-quantum dot array in SiGe, from the perspective of its quantum information processing capabilities. The analysis includes randomized benchmarking of single- and two-qubit gates, SPAM characterization, and Bell's state tomography; all basic functionality required for universal quantum computation. In light of our efforts to combine spin qubits with integrated cryogenic electronics, we evaluate the qubits' performance metrics at 300mK and 740mK. The latter temperature lies within the realistic thermal budget for integrated cryogenic electronics, making it particularly relevant for assessing qubit performance in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Implementing Semiclassical Szegedy Walks in Classical-Quantum Circuits for Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cloud services continue to expand, the security of private data stored and processed in these environments has become paramount. This work delves into quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE), an emerging technology that facilitates secure computation on encrypted quantum data without revealing the underlying information. We reinterpret QHE schemes through classical-quantum circuits, enhancing efficiency and addressing previous limitations related to key computations. Our approach eliminates the need for exponential key preparation by calculating keys in real-time during simulation, leading to a linear complexity in classically controlled gates. We also investigate the $T/T^{\dagger}$-gate complexity associated with various quantum walks, particularly Szegedy quantum and semiclassical algorithms, demonstrating efficient homomorphic implementations across different graph structures. Our simulations, conducted in Qiskit, validate the effectiveness of QHE for both standard and semiclassical walks. The rules for the homomorphic evaluation of the reset and intermediate measurement operations have also been included to perform the QHE of semiclassical walks. Additionally, we introduce the CQC-QHE library, a comprehensive tool that simplifies the construction and simulation of classical-quantum circuits tailored for quantum homomorphic encryption. Future work will focus on optimizing classical functions within this framework and exploring broader graph types to enhance QHE applications in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian characterisation of multi-time processes with classical memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central problem in the study of open quantum systems is the characterisation of non-Markovian processes, where an environment retains memory of its interaction with the system. A key distinction is whether or not this memory can be simulated classically, as this can lead to efficient modelling and noise mitigation. Powerful tools have been developed recently within the process matrix formalism, a framework that conveniently characterises all multi-time correlations through a sequence of measurements. This leads to a detailed classification of classical and quantum-memory processes and provides operational procedures to distinguish between them. However, these results leave open the question of what type of system-environment interactions lead to classical memory. More generally, process-matrix methods lack a direct connection to joint system-environment evolution, a cornerstone of open-system modelling. In this work, we characterise Hamiltonian and circuit-based models of system-environment interactions leading to classical memory. We show that general time-dependent Hamiltonians with product eigenstates, and where the environment's eigenstates form a time-independent, orthonormal basis, always produce a particular type of classical memory: probabilistic mixtures of unitary processes. Additionally, we show that the most general type of classical-memory processes can be generated by a quantum circuit in which system and environment interact through a specific class of controlled unitaries. Our results establish the first strong link between process-matrix methods and traditional Hamiltonian-based approaches to open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>CaliScalpel: In-Situ and Fine-Grained Qubit Calibration Integrated with Surface Code Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is a cornerstone of fault-tolerant, large-scale quantum computing. However, qubit error drift significantly degrades QEC performance over time, necessitating periodic calibration. Traditional calibration methods disrupt quantum states, requiring system downtime and making in situ calibration infeasible. We present CaliScalpel, an innovative framework for in situ calibration in surface codes. The core idea behind CaliScalpel is leveraging code deformation to isolate qubits undergoing calibration from logical patches. This allows calibration to proceed concurrently with computation, while code enlargement maintains error correction capabilities with minimal qubit overhead. Additionally, CaliScalpel incorporates optimized calibration schedules derived from detailed device characterization, effectively minimizing physical error rates. Our results show that CaliScalpel achieves concurrent calibration and computation with modest qubit overhead and negligible execution time impact, marking a significant step toward practical in situ calibration in surface-code-based quantum computing systems.</description>

      <title>High-resolution, Wide-frequency-range Magnetic Spectroscopy with Solid-state Spin Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems composed of solid-state electronic spins can be sensitive detectors of narrowband magnetic fields. A prominent example is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which has been employed for magnetic spectroscopy with high spatial and spectral resolution. However, NV-diamond spectroscopy protocols are typically based on dynamical decoupling sequences, which are limited to low-frequency signals ($\lesssim{20}\,$MHz) due to the technical requirements on microwave (MW) pulses used to manipulate NV electronic spins. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a high-resolution magnetic spectroscopy protocol that integrates a quantum frequency mixing (QFM) effect in a dense NV ensemble with coherently averaged synchronized readout (CASR) to provide both a wide range of signal frequency detection and sub-Hz spectral resolution. We assess the sensitivity of this QFM-CASR protocol across a frequency range of 10$\,$MHz to 4$\,$GHz. By measuring the spectra of multi-frequency signals near 0.6, 2.4 and 4$\,$GHz, we demonstrate sub-Hz spectral resolution with a nT-scale noise floor for the target signal, and precise phase measurement with error $&lt;1^\circ$. Compared to state-of-the-art NV-diamond techniques for narrowband magnetic spectroscopy, the QFM-CASR protocol greatly extends the detectable frequency range, enabling applications in high-frequency radio frequency (RF) and MW signal microscopy and analysis, as well as tesla-scale nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of small samples.</description>

      <title>A Classic-Quantum Hybrid Network Framework: CQH-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning has shown remarkable capabilities in pattern recognition, feature extraction, and classification decision-making. With the rise of quantum computing, the potential of quantum neural networks (QNNs) in Artificial Intelligence is emerging. However, the intrinsic mechanisms and decision transparency of QNNs remain unclear. In this paper, we propose a classic-quantum hybrid network framework (CQH-Net), which uses traditional machine learning methods for feature extraction and quantizes neural networks for classification tasks. We apply CQH-Net to image classification on public datasets. Experimentally, CQH-Net achieves an average convergence rate improvement of 72.8% compared to classical convolutional networks (CNNs) with identical parameters. On the Fashion MNIST dataset, it reaches a final accuracy of 99.02%, representing a significant increase of 5.07% over CNNs. Furthermore, we explore visual explanations for CQH-Net's decision-making process. Results show that the model effectively captures key data features during training and establishes associations between these features and their corresponding categories. This study demonstrates that quantization enhances the models ability to tackle complex classification problems while providing transparency in its decision-making process further supporting quantum advantages in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Integrated Differential Conjugate Homodyne Detection for Quantum Random Number Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform on-chip quantum random number generation (QRNG) that uses a novel differential amplifier configuration for conjugate homodyne detection. Leveraging separate integrated photonics and integrated analog circuit platforms, we present an alternative method for QRNG. This approach exploits the observable $\hat{\text{Z}}$, derived from the sum of squared conjugate quadrature distributions which we compare to the traditional single quadrature approach. Utilizing this method, we report a shot noise clearance (SNC) of 25.6 dB and a common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 69 dB for our homodyne detection system. We used a variety of design tools to model and predict performance and compare results with our measurements. The realization of our QRNG system consists of a 90{\deg} optical hybrid, a dual differential transimpedance amplifier (TIA), and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) used for the real-time post-processing to produce a uniform random bitstream. The randomness extraction is implemented using a Toeplitz hashing algorithm and is validated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness test suites.</description>

      <title>Implementing An Artificial Quantum Perceptron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Perceptron is a fundamental building block of a neural network. The flexibility and scalability of perceptron make it ubiquitous in building intelligent systems. Studies have shown the efficacy of a single neuron in making intelligent decisions. Here, we examined and compared two perceptrons with distinct mechanisms, and developed a quantum version of one of those perceptrons. As a part of this modeling, we implemented the quantum circuit for an artificial perception, generated a dataset, and simulated the training. Through these experiments, we show that there is an exponential growth advantage and test different qubit versions. Our findings show that this quantum model of an individual perceptron can be used as a pattern classifier. For the second type of model, we provide an understanding to design and simulate a spike-dependent quantum perceptron.

      <title>Theory of monochromatic advanced-wave picture and applications in biphoton optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Klyshko's advanced-wave picture (AWP) is mainly interpreted by replacing the nonlinear crystal producing biphotons via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) by a mirror in quantum imaging protocols with thin crystals, where the biphotons are perfectly correlated in position at the crystal. To better explain the biphoton spatial states produced by arbitrary crystals and pump beams, we develop a formal theory of AWP with monochromatic lights that the conditional wave function of one photon is calculated by propagation, multiplication, and another propagation. The case of more general photon postselection or no detection and the inclusion of polarization are studied. Then, we explain the form of biphoton state from SPDC with a bulk crystal and its free-space propagation. By treating the biphoton wave function as an impulse response function of a classical optical setup, we analyze quantum imaging with undetected photons and quantum holography with polarization entanglement, where properties like the spatial resolution can be concisely deduced. This method can be employed to design nonlinear materials or novel quantum imaging techniques. Finally, we discuss Klyshko's original proposal beyond monochromatic lights with the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect as an example.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of a groundstate fermionic many body gas subjected to a quench between parameter regimes of a topologically nontrivial Hamiltonian. By focusing on the role of the chiral edge states inherent to the system, we calculate the many body overlap and show that the characteristic monotonic decay of the orthogonality catastrophe with increasing system size is notably altered. Specifically, we demonstrate that the dynamics are governed not solely by the total particle number but rather by the number of occupied single particle edge states. This behavior is further explained through an analysis of the full work probability distribution, providing a deeper understanding of the system's dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A typical surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) system relies on deeply subwavelength field localization in nanoscale plasmonic cavities to enhance both the excitation and emission of Raman active molecules. Here, we demonstrate that a germanium-vacancy (GeV) defect in diamond can efficiently mediate the excitation process, by acting as a bright atomic antenna. At low temperatures, GeV exhibits low dissipation, allowing it to be efficiently populated by the incident field, resulting in a thousand-fold increase in the efficiency of Raman scattering. Additionally, we show that atomic antenna-enhanced Raman scattering can be distinguished from conventional SERS by tracing the dependence of Stokes intensity on input power, and the pronounced antibunching of the Raman emission.</description>

      <title>Ptychographic estimation of pure multiqubit states in a quantum device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum ptychography is a method for estimating an unknown pure quantum state by subjecting it to overlapping projections, each one followed by a projective measurement on a single prescribed basis. Here, we present a comprehensive study of this method applied for estimating $n$-qubit states in a circuit-based quantum computer, including numerical simulations and experiments carried out on an IBM superconducting quantum processor. The intermediate projections are implemented through Pauli measurements on one qubit at a time, which sets the number of ptychographic circuits to $3n$ (in contrast to the $3^n$ circuits for standard Pauli tomography); the final projective measurement in the computational basis is preceded by the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Due to the large depth and number of two-qubit gates of the QFT circuit, which is unsuitable for noisy devices, we also test the approximate QFT (AQFT) and separable unitary operations. Using the QFT and AQFT of degree $2$, we obtained high estimation fidelities in all tests with separable and entangled states for up to three and four qubits, respectively; on the other hand, the separable unitaries in this scenario provided good estimations only for separable states, in general. Our results compare favorably with recent results in the literature and we discuss further alternatives to make the ptychographic method scalable for the current noisy devices.</description>

      <title>Thermal state structure in the Tavis--Cummings model and rapid simulations in mesoscopic quantum ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems consisting of a collection of N spin-1/2 particles uniformly interacting with an electromagnetic field, such as one confined in a cavity, are important for the development of quantum information processors and will be useful for metrology, as well as tests of collective behavior. Such systems are often modeled by the Tavis-Cummings model and having an accurate understanding of the thermal behaviors of this system is needed to understand the behavior of them in realistic environments. We quantitatively show in this work that the Dicke subspace approximation is at times invoked too readily, in specific we show that there is a temperature above which the degeneracies in the system become dominant and the Dicke subspace is minimally populated. This transition occurs at a lower temperature than priorly considered. When in such a temperature regime, the key constants of the motion are the total excitation count between the spin system and cavity and the collective angular momentum of the spin system. These enable perturbative expansions for thermal properties in terms of the energy shifts of dressed states, called Lamb shifts herein. These enable efficient numeric methods for obtaining certain parameters that scale as $O(\sqrt{N})$, and is thus highly efficient. These provide methods for approximating, and bounding, properties of these systems as well as characterizing the dominant population regions, including under perturbative noise. In the regime of stronger spin-spin coupling the perturbations outweigh the expansion series terms and inefficient methods likely are needed to be employed, removing the computational efficiency of simulating such systems. The results in this work can also be used for related systems such as coupled-cavity arrays, cavity mediated coupling of collective spin ensembles, and collective spin systems.</description>

      <title>Density matrix exponentiation and sample-based Hamiltonian simulation: Non-asymptotic analysis of sample complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density matrix exponentiation (DME) is a quantum algorithm that processes multiple copies of a program state $\sigma$ to realize the Hamiltonian evolution $e^{-i \sigma t}$. While serving as a prototypical sample-based quantum algorithm, DME is a powerful tool for various quantum information processing tasks, such as quantum principal component analysis and Hamiltonian simulation. In this work, we present a detailed sample complexity analysis of DME and sample-based Hamiltonian simulation. In particular, we prove that the sample complexity of DME is no larger than $4t^2/\varepsilon$, where $t$ is the desired evolution time and $\varepsilon$ is the desired imprecision level, as quantified by the normalized diamond distance. We also establish a fundamental lower bound on the sample complexity of sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, which matches our DME sample complexity bound up to a constant multiplicative factor, thereby proving that DME is optimal for sample-based Hamiltonian simulation. Finally, we point out that the DME sample complexity analysis in Appendix A of [Kimmel et al., npj Quantum Information 3, 13 (2017)] appears to be incomplete, highlighting the need for the results presented here, given the extensive use of DME over the past decade since its original proposal.</description>

      <title>A unified framework of unitarily residual measures for quantifying dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are governed by both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, with dissipation arising from the latter. Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>FL-QDSNNs: Federated Learning with Quantum Dynamic Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Federated Learning-Quantum Dynamic Spiking Neural Networks (FL-QDSNNs) framework, an innovative approach specifically designed to tackle significant challenges in distributed learning systems, such as maintaining high accuracy while ensuring privacy. Central to our framework is a novel dynamic threshold mechanism for activating quantum gates in Quantum Spiking Neural Networks (QSNNs), which mimics classical activation functions while uniquely exploiting quantum operations to enhance computational performance. This mechanism is essential for tackling the typical performance variability across dynamically changing data distributions, a prevalent challenge in conventional QSNNs applications. Validated through extensive testing on datasets including Iris, digits, and breast cancer, our FL-QDSNNs framework has demonstrated superior accuracies-up to 94% on the Iris dataset and markedly outperforms existing Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) approaches. Our results reveal that our FL-QDSNNs framework offers scalability with respect to the number of clients, provides improved learning capabilities, and represents a robust solution to privacy and efficiency limitations posed by emerging quantum hardware and complex QSNNs training protocols. By fundamentally advancing the operational capabilities of QSNNs in real-world distributed environments, this framework can potentially redefine the application landscape of quantum computing in sensitive and critical sectors, ensuring enhanced data security and system performance.</description>

Abstract: We consider an inhomogeneous XX spin chain which interpolates between the Krawtchouk one with perfect state transfer and the homogeneous XX chain. This model can be exploited in order to perform state transfer of a qubit with sufficiently good fidelity. The advantage of this model with respect to the Krawtchouk chain is that while it achieves efficient state transfer, the coupling strengths are capped and do not become excessively large as the number of sites grows.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning to learn quantum states for Heisenberg scaling accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning quantum states is a crucial task for realizing the potential of quantum information technology. Recently, neural approaches have emerged as promising methods for learning quantum states. We propose a meta-learning model that employs reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize the process of learning quantum states. For learning quantum states, our scheme trains a Hardware efficient ansatz with a blackbox optimization algorithm, called evolution strategy (ES). To enhance the efficiency of ES, a RL agent dynamically adjusts the hyperparameters of ES. To facilitate the RL training, we introduce an action repetition strategy inspired by curriculum learning. The RL agent significantly improves the sample efficiency of learning random quantum states, and achieves infidelity scaling close to the Heisenberg limit. We showcase that the RL agent trained using 3-qubit states can be generalized to learning up to 5-qubit states. These results highlight the utility of RL-driven meta-learning to enhance the efficiency and generalizability of learning quantum states. Our approach can be applicable to improve quantum control, quantum optimization, and quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>On the Realization of quantum gates coming from the Tracy-Singh product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tracy-Singh product of matrices permits to construct a new gate $c \boxtimes c'$ from two $2$-qudit gates $c$ and $c'$. If $c$ and $c'$ are both Yang-Baxter gates, then $c \boxtimes c'$ is also a Yang-Baxter gate, and if at least one of them is entangling, then $c \boxtimes c'$ is also entangling. A natural question arises about the realisation of these gates, $c \boxtimes c'$, in terms of local and universal gates. In this paper, we consider this question and describe this realisation.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of atomic matter waves through a 2D crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometry of atomic matter waves is an essential tool in fundamental sciences [1-5] and for applied quantum sensors [6-10]. The sensitivity of interferometers scales with the momentum separation of the diffracted matter waves, leading to the development of large-momentum transfer beam splitters [11,12]. However, despite decades of research, crystalline gratings used since the first atomic diffraction experiments are still unmatched regarding momentum transfer [13]. So far, diffraction through such gratings has only been reported for subatomic particles, but never for atoms. Here, we answer to this century-old challenge by demonstrating diffraction of helium and hydrogen atoms at kiloelectronvolt energies through single-layer graphene at normal incidence. Despite the atoms' high kinetic energy and coupling to the electronic system of graphene, we observe diffraction patterns featuring coherent scattering of up to eight reciprocal lattice vectors. Diffraction in this regime is possible due to the short interaction time of the projectile with the atomically-thin crystal, limiting the momentum transfer to the grating. Our demonstration is the atomic counterpart of the first transmission experiments with electrons by Thomson and Reid [14,15], unlocking new potentials in atom diffraction. We expect our findings to inspire studies of decoherence in an uncharted energy regime and the development of new matter-wave-based sensors.</description>

      <title>Transition probabilities for a Rydberg atom in the field of a gravitational wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of an atomic detection of gravitational waves on earth is considered. The combination of extremely high lifetimes and resulting small radiative transition probabilities with rapidly growing interaction strength for Rydberg atoms having principal quantum numbers in a region $10^4\ldots 10^5$ might result in transition probabilities which are high enough to open up such a possibility. Transition probabilities and absorption cross sections are calculated as a function of the relevant quantum numbers of a highly excited electron. The orders of magnitude for the transition rate are evaluated for a realistic source of gravitational radiation. It is shown that no specific particle property enters the expression for the absorption cross section for gravitational waves. The only fundamental constant contained in this cross section is, apart from the fine structure constant $\alpha$, the Planck length $L^*=(\hbar G /c^3)^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>The fabulous world of GKP codes</title>

Abstract: Quantum error correction is an essential ingredient in the development of quantum technologies. Its subject is to investigate ways to embed quantum Hilbert spaces into a physical system such that this subspace is robust against small imperfections in the physical systems. This task is exceedingly complex: for one, this is due to the vast diversity of possible physical systems with different structure to use. For another, every physical setting also comes with its own imperfections that need to be protected against. Bred by the complexity of a technological ambition, research on quantum error correction has developed into a large field of research that ranges from engineering of small systems with a single photon to the creation of macroscopic topological phases of matter and models of complex emergent physics. A quintessential tool in quantum error correction is the stabilizer formalism, which tames quantum systems by enforcing symmetries. A Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is a stabilizer code that creates a logical subspace within an infinite dimensional Hilbert space by endowing it with translational symmetries. While in practice the infinitude of the Hilbert space, as well as the infinitude of the translational symmetry group are considered as obstacles for implementation, in theory these are precisely the features that make the theory of GKP codes particularly rich, well behaved and well-connected to fascinating topics in mathematics. The purpose of this thesis is to explore these connections: to understand the coding theoretic and practical properties of GKP codes, utilizing its rich mathematical foundation, and to provide a foundation for future research. Along this journey we discover -- through the looking glass of GKP codes -- how quantum error correction fits into a fabulous mathematical world and formulate a series of dreams about possible directions of research.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a Photonic Time-Multiplexed C-NOT Gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-qubit controlled-not (C-NOT) gate is an essential component in the construction of a gate-based quantum computer. In fact, its operation, combined with single qubit rotations allows to realise any quantum circuit. Several strategies have been adopted in order to build quantum gates, among them the photonic one offers the dual advantage of excellent isolation from the external environment and ease of manipulation at the single qubit level. Here we adopt a scalable time-multiplexed approach in order to build a fully reconfigurable architecture capable of implementing a post-selected interferometric scheme that implements the C-NOT operation with a fidelity of $(93.8\pm1.4)\%$. We use our experimental platform to generate the four Bell states.</description>

      <title>Single-atom resolved collective spectroscopy of a one-dimensional atomic array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordered atomic arrays feature an enhanced collective optical response compared to random atomic ensembles due to constructive interference in resonant dipole-dipole interactions. One consequence is the existence of a large shift of the transition with respect to the bare atomic frequency. In the linear optics regime (low light intensity), one observes a spectroscopic shift of the Lorentzian atomic line often called the collective Lamb shift. For stronger driving, many excitations are present in the system rendering the calculation of this shift theoretically challenging, but its understanding is important for instance when performing Ramsey spectroscopy in optical clocks. Here we report on the study of the collective optical response of a one-dimensional array of 30 dysprosium atoms. We drive the atoms on the narrow intercombination transition isolating a 2-level system, and measure the atomic state with single-shot state readout using a broad transition. In the linear optics regime, we measure the shift of the resonance in steady state due to dipole interactions, and measure how this shift depends on the interatomic distance. We further resolve at the single atom level how the excitation is distributed over the array. Then, on the same transition we perform Ramsey spectroscopy \emph{i.\,e.}~away from the linear regime. We observe a time-dependent shift, that allows us to draw the connection between the collective Lamb shift observed in the linear optics regime and in the large-excitation case.</description>

      <title>Effects of multi-photon states in the calibration of single-photon detectors based on a portable bi-photon source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are ubiquitous in many protocols for quantum imaging, sensing, and communications. Many of these protocols critically depend on the precise knowledge of their detection efficiency. A method for the calibration of SPDs based on sources of quantum-correlated photon pairs uses single-photon detection to generate heralded single photons, which can be used as a standard of radiation at the single-photon level. These heralded photons then allow for precise calibration of SPDs in absolute terms. In this work, we investigate the absolute calibration of avalanche photodiodes based on a portable, commercial bi-photon source, and investigate the effects of multi-photon events from the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) process in these sources. We show that the multi-photon character of the bi-photon source, together with system losses, has a significant impact on the achievable accuracy for the calibration of SPDs. However, modeling the expected photon counting statistics from the squeezed vacuum in the SPDC process allows for accurate estimation of the efficiency of SPDs, assuming that the system losses are known. This study provides essential information for the design and optimization of portable bi-photon sources for their application in on-site calibration of SPDs with high accuracy, without requiring any other reference standard.</description>

      <title>Ground State Energy Estimation on Current Quantum Hardware Through The Variational Quantum Eigensolver: A Comprehensive Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While numerical simulations are presented in most papers introducing new methods to enhance the VQE performance, comprehensive, comparative, and applied studies remain relatively rare. We present a comprehensive, yet concise guide for the implementation of the VQE for molecular problems on NISQ devices, specifically applied to estimate the ground state energy of the BeH2 molecule using hardware-efficient and chemically informed ans\"atze. This work clarifies several under-documented aspects in the literature, such as the construction of the electronic Hamiltonian, the transformation of fermionic operators into qubit operators via second quantization, and the mathematical framework's details for the unitary coupled cluster single and double (UCCSD) ansatz. Our methodology, implemented using Qiskit 1.2, the latest release as of the date of this writing, is demonstrated on a noiseless simulator and further tested with noisy quantum circuits. The resilience of the VQE to quantum noise remains an open question. This study compares the computational accuracy of ground state energy estimations for molecules using the VQE across three different current quantum hardware noise models. Furthermore, our experiment on IBM's 156-qubit actual quantum computer revealed valuable insights on the real performance of the VQE on current quantum hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting work from a physical system is one of the cornerstones of quantum thermodynamics. The extractable work, as quantified by ergotropy, necessitates a complete description of the quantum system. This is significantly more challenging when the state of the underlying system is unknown, as quantum tomography is extremely inefficient. In this article, we analyze the number of samples of the unknown state required to extract work. With only a single copy of an unknown state, we prove that extracting any work is nearly impossible. In contrast, when multiple copies are available, we quantify the sample complexity required to estimate extractable work, establishing a scaling relationship that balances the desired accuracy with success probability. Our work develops a sample-efficient protocol to assess the utility of unknown states as quantum batteries and opens avenues for estimating thermodynamic quantities using near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Electron Beam Characterization via Quantum Coherent Optical Magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum optics-based detection method for determining the position and current of an electron beam. As electrons pass through a dilute vapor of rubidium atoms, their magnetic field perturb the atomic spin's quantum state and causes polarization rotation of a laser resonant with an optical transition of the atoms. By measuring the polarization rotation angle across the laser beam, we recreate a 2D projection of the magnetic field and use it to determine the e-beam position, size and total current. We tested this method for an e-beam with currents ranging from 30 to 110 {\mu}A. Our approach is insensitive to electron kinetic energy, and we confirmed that experimentally between 10 to 20 keV. This technique offers a unique platform for non-invasive characterization of charged particle beams used in accelerators for particle and nuclear physics research.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Imaginarity in Neutrino Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a fundamental question why quantum mechanics employs complex numbers rather than solely real numbers. In this letter, we conduct the first analysis of imaginarity quantification in neutrino flavor and spin-flavor oscillations. As quantum systems in coherent superposition, neutrinos are ideal candidates for quantifying imaginarity within the resource theoretic framework, using measures such as the $\ell_1$-norm and the relative entropy of imaginarity. Our findings reveal that even in the case of two-flavor mixing, these measures of imaginarity are nonzero. The measures of imaginarity reach their extreme values when the probabilistic features of quantum theory are fully maximized, i.e., both the transitional and survival probabilities are approximately equal, averaging around $1/2$. We further extend our analysis to explore the dynamics of three-flavor neutrino mixing, incorporating the effects of a nonzero CP phase. Our study reveals that the imaginarity in neutrino systems is not solely attributed to the CP-violating phase. More importantly, it can also arise from the intrinsic quantum dynamics of the neutrino mixing system itself.</description>

      <title>The Design and Implementation of a Quantum Information Science Undergraduate Program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information science is a burgeoning research field attracting vast public and private investment in the last decade. This quick rise has led to a talent gap, where there are more open positions than new graduates who can fill these roles. To meet this critical need, higher education has been challenged to react accordingly by assuring a flow of highly skilled individuals who must be trained quickly. We thus present how Universit\'e de Sherbrooke, in Quebec, Canada, responded by creating and launching an innovative undergraduate degree in quantum information science, aiming to address this gap by training quantum software developers in three and a half years. At the end of this program, they will be ready to join the quantum workforce. We detail the creative process leading to a coherent curriculum, as well as why the local ecosystem led to these choices. The guiding principles and lessons learned during the development of this interdepartmental and interfaculty degree are shared to inspire other quantum education institutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum information theory, the evolution of an open quantum system -- a unitary evolution followed by a measurement -- is described by a quantum channel or, more generally, a quantum instrument. In this work, we formulate spin and flavour measurements in collider experiments as a quantum instrument. We demonstrate that the Choi matrix, which completely determines input-output transitions, can be both theoretically computed from a given model and experimentally reconstructed from a set of final state measurements (quantum state tomography) using varied input states. The reconstruction of the Choi matrix, known as quantum process tomography, offers a powerful new approach for probing potential extensions of the Standard Model within the quantum field theory framework and also provides a fundamental test of quantum mechanics itself. As an example, we outline a quantum process tomography approach applied to the $e^+ e^- \to t \bar{t}$ process at a polarized lepton collider.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of time-dependent GGE under weak dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitary integrable models typically relax to a stationary Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), but in experimental realizations dissipation often breaks integrability. In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE (t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to atom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this description with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly captures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE approach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.</description>

      <title>Generalised second law beyond the semiclassical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the generalised second law (GSL), with an appropriate modification, holds in perturbative gravity to all orders beyond the semiclassical limit and without a UV cutoff imposed on the fields. Our proof uses algebraic techniques and builds on the recent work of Faulkner and Speranza, which combined Wall's proof of the GSL with the identification of generalised entropy as the von Neumann entropy of a boost-invariant crossed product algebra. The key additional step in our approach is to further impose invariance under null translations. Doing so requires one to describe horizon exterior regions in a relational manner, so we introduce `dynamical cuts': quantum reference frames which give the location of a cut of the horizon. We use idealised dynamical cuts, but expect that our methods can be generalised to more realistic models. The modified GSL that we prove says that the difference in generalised entropies of the regions outside two dynamical cuts is bounded below by the free energy of the degrees of freedom giving the location of the later cut. If one takes a semiclassical limit, imposes a UV cutoff, and requires the cuts to obey certain energy conditions, then our result reduces to the standard GSL.</description>

      <title>Overscreened spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kondo impurity and Shiba state at the edge of a one-dimensional spin-1 superconducting wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competes with the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a single spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire where spin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting) mass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivity leads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, there is a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity \textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale is dynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength are comparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens the impurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgap state is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rushinov (YSR) states that exist in the entire phase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconducting interaction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength, the impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSR phases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens the impurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in the thermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competition between different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipative Kondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impurity coupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensation competes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff and the bulk spin interaction compete with screening.</description>

      <title>Designing Optically Addressable Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Ultra-Small Nanodiamonds: Insights from First-Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasmall nanodiamonds (USNDs) are promising platforms for fluorescent and quantum sensing applications. Here we present first-principles electronic structure calculations of color centers in USNDs, specifically the nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) and we investigate their optical addressability as a function of the surface termination. We consider both isolated nanoparticles and arrays of USNDs with different degrees of packing, and we include quantum vibronic effects in our analysis, using stochastic methods. We find that the NV in USNDs can be stabilized in a negative charge state if the nanoparticles are terminated by fluorine, hydroxyl, and ether. While fluorine terminations can be used for fluorescent bio-tags, we suggest that hydroxyl and ether terminations are beneficial for quantum sensing applications. We also find that the NV- can be stabilized in arrays of USNDs when inter-particle separations are larger than the diameter of the nanoparticle. Interestingly, the phonon renormalizations of single-particle energy levels found in arrays contribute to the charge stability of negatively charged NV centers.</description>

      <title>Teaching Quantum Formalism and Postulates to First-Year Undergraduates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to undergraduate-level quantum mechanics require extensive mathematical preparation, preventing most students from enrolling in a quantum mechanics course until the third year of a physics major. Here we describe an approach to teaching quantum formalism and postulates that can be used with first-year undergraduate students and even high school students. The only pre-requisite is a familiarity with vector dot products. This approach enables students to learn Dirac notation and core postulates of quantum mechanics at a much earlier stage in their academic career, which can help students prepare for careers in quantum science and engineering and advance the Second Quantum Revolution.</description>

      <title>Spread complexity and the saturation of wormhole size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent proposals equate the size of Einstein-Rosen bridges in JT gravity to spread complexity of a dual, double-scaled SYK theory (DSSYK). We show that the auxiliary ``chord basis'' of these proposals is an extrapolation from a sub-exponential part of the finite-dimensional physical Krylov basis of a spreading thermofield double state. The physical tridiagonal Hamiltonian coincides with the DSSYK approximation on the initial Krylov basis, but deviates markedly over an exponentially large part of the state space. We non-perturbatively extend the identification of ER bridge size and spread complexity to the complete Hilbert space, and show that it saturates at late times. We use methods for tridiagonalizing random Hamiltonians to study all universality classes to which large N SYK theories and JT gravities can belong. The saturation dynamics depends on the universality class, and displays ``white hole'' physics at late times where the ER bridge shrinks from maximum size to a plateau. We describe extensions of our results to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Structure of Quantum Mean Force Gibbs States for Coupled Harmonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An open quantum system interacting with a heat bath at given temperature is expected to reach the mean force Gibbs (MFG) state as a steady state. The MFG state is given by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom from the equilibrium Gibbs state of the total system plus bath. When the interaction between the system and the bath is not negligible, it is different from the usual system Gibbs state obtained from the system Hamiltonian only. Using the path integral method, we present the exact MFG state for a coupled system of quantum harmonic oscillators in contact with multiple thermal baths at the same temperature. We develop a nonperturbative method to calculate the covariances with respect to the MFG state. By comparing them with those obtained from the system Gibbs state, we find that the effect of coupling to the bath decays exponentially as a function of the distance from the system-bath boundary. This is similar to the skin effect found recently for a quantum spin chain interacting with an environment. Using the exact results, we also investigate the ultrastrong coupling limit where the coupling between the system and the bath gets arbitrarily large and make a connection with the recent result found for a general quantum system.</description>

      <title>Anomalous wave-packet transport on boundaries of Floquet topological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02086v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional periodically driven (Floquet) system with zero winding number in the absence of time-reversal symmetry is usually considered topologically trivial. Here, we study the dynamics of a Gaussian wave packet placed at the boundary of a two-dimensional driven system with zero winding numbers but multiple valley-protected edge states that can be realized in a square Raman lattice, and investigate the unidirectionally propagating topological edge currents. By carefully tuning the initial parameters of the wave packet including its spin polarization as well as the initial time of the periodic driving, we control the population of different edge states, where the speed of the resulting propagation establishes a direct correspondence with the target dispersions across different gaps and valleys. Interestingly, we find that the edge states at different valleys in the $\pi$ gap can hybridize and form bowtie-shaped edge bands fully detached from the bulk. This phase, not only presents a favorable regime with narrower bulk bands, but also exhibits distinct edge dynamics where the majority of particles bounce back-and-forth confined to a boundary while a small portion can follow a chiral transport around the sample.</description>

      <title>Quantum Decision Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose to use the formalism of quantum mechanics to describe and explain the so-called "abnormal" behaviour of agents in certain decision or choice contexts. The basic idea is to postulate that the preferences of these agents are indeterminate (in the quantum sense of the term) before the choice is made or the decision is taken. An agent's state before the decision is represented by a superposition of potential preferences. The decision is assimilated to a measure of the agent's state and leads to a projection of the state onto one of the particular preferences. We therefore consider that uncertainty about preferences is not linked to incomplete information but to essential indeterminacy. We explore the consequences of these hypotheses on the usual concepts of decision theory and apply the formalism to the problem of the so-called "framing" effect.</description>

      <title>Optical losses as a function of beam position on the mirrors in a 285-m suspended Fabry-Perot cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing optical losses is crucial for reducing quantum noise in gravitational-wave detectors. Losses are the main source of degradation of the squeezed vacuum. Frequency dependent squeezing obtained via a filter cavity is currently used to reduce quantum noise in the whole detector bandwidth. Such filter cavities are required to have high finesse in order to produce the optimal squeezing angle rotation and the presence of losses is particularly detrimental for the squeezed beam, as it does multiple round trip within the cavity. Characterising such losses is crucial to assess the quantum noise reduction achievable. In this paper we present an in-situ measurement of the optical losses, done for different positions of the beam on the mirrors of the Virgo filter cavity. We implemented an automatic system to map the losses with respect to the beam position on the mirrors finding that optical losses depend clearly on the beam hitting position on input mirror, varying from 42 ppm to 87 ppm, while they are much more uniform when we scan the end mirror (53 ppm to 61 ppm). We repeated the measurements on several days, finding a statistical error smaller than 4 ppm. The lowest measured losses are not much different with respect to those estimated from individual mirror characterisation performed before the installation (30.3 - 39.3 ppm). This means that no major loss mechanism has been neglected in the estimation presented here. The larger discrepancy found for some beam positions is likely to be due to contamination. In addition to a thorough characterisation of the losses, the methodology described in this paper allowed to find an optimal cavity axis position for which the cavity round trip losses are among the lowest ever measured. This work can contribute to achieve the very challenging losses goals for the optical cavities of the future gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Susceptibility of entanglement entropy: a universal indicator of quantum criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A measure of how sensitive the entanglement entropy is in a quantum system, has been proposed and its information geometric origin is discussed. It has been demonstrated for two exactly solvable spin systems, that thermodynamic criticality is directly \textit{indicated} by finite size scaling of the global maxima and turning points of the susceptibility of entanglement entropy through numerical analysis - obtaining power laws. Analytically we have proved those power laws for $| \ \lambda_c(N)-\lambda_c^{\infty}|$ as $N\to \infty$ in the cases of finite 1D transverse field ising model (TFIM) ($\lambda=h$) and XY chain ($\lambda=\gamma$). The integer power law appearing for XY model has been verified using perturbation theory in $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{N})$ and the fractional power law appearing in the case of TFIM, is verified by an exact approach involving Chebyshev polynomials, hypergeometric functions and complete elliptic integrals. Furthermore a set of potential applications of this quantity under quantum dynamics and also for non-integrable systems, are briefly discussed. The simplicity of this setup for understanding quantum criticality is emphasized as it takes in only the reduced density matrix of appropriate rank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian evolution is a landmark in modern theoretical physics. But if non-commutative dynamics has a significant impact in the control of entanglement and transport in quantum systems is an open question. Here we propose to utilize non-Abelian Thouless pumping in one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks in lattices with degenerate Bloch-bands. We show how the interplay of non-commutativity and topology enables geometrically protected quantum coin and shift operators. By composing different non-Abelian pumping cycles, different classes of tunable protected quantum walks arise. Surprisingly, the walks break parity symmetry and generate a dynamic process described by a Weyl-like equation. The amount of entanglement can be varied by acting on the initial conditions. The asymptotic statistical distribution and its features are determined by closed form analytical expression and confirmed numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is dedicated to analysing the generation and destruction of quantum correlations in the context of inflationary cosmology and an experiment of 'analogue' preheating. Inflation is a phase of accelerated expansion of the Universe, preceding the so-called Standard Model of Big Bang cosmology, introduced to solve some shortcomings of this model. It also provides a mechanism for the emergence of primordial inhomogeneities by amplification of initial quantum fluctuations. Inflation is followed by a 'reheating' period, in which most particles are expected to be generated and reach thermal equilibrium, setting the stage for the standard Big Bang of cosmology. During a 'preheating' period, this creation proceeds partly by parametric excitation of resonant modes of the matter fields initially in their vacuum, a genuine quantum process. The physics of both situations, inflation and preheating, is that of a strong classical field acting on a quantum field to produce entangled (quasi-)particles. When the classical source is the space-time metric itself, as in inflation, we are in the framework of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Space-time (QFTCS). The evolution of the generated quantum correlations is the topic of this PhD.</description>

Abstract: The use of Neural Networks in quantum many-body theory has seen a formidable rise in recent years. Among the many possible applications, one surely is to make use of their pattern recognition power when dealing with the study of equilibrium phase diagram. Within this context, Learning by Confusion has emerged as an interesting, unbiased scheme. The idea behind it briefly consists in iteratively label numerical results in a random way and then train and test a Neural Network; while for a generic random labeling the Network displays low accuracy, the latter shall display a peak when data are divided into a correct, yet unknown way. Here, we propose a generalization of this confusion scheme for systems with more than two phases, for which it was originally proposed. Our construction simply relies on the use of a slightly different Neural Network: from a binary classificator we move to a ternary one, more suitable to detect systems exhibiting three phases. After introducing this construction, we test is onto the free and the interacting Kitaev chain and on the one-dimensional Extended Hubbard model, always finding results compatible with previous works. Our work opens the way to wider use of Learning by Confusion, showing once more the usefulness of Machine Learning to address quantum many-body problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proof of quantumness is a protocol through which a classical machine can test whether a purportedly quantum device, with comparable time and memory resources, is performing a computation that is impossible for classical computers. Existing approaches to provide proofs of quantumness depend on unproven assumptions about some task being impossible for machines of a particular model under certain resource restrictions. We study a setup where both devices have space bounds $\mathit{o}(\log \log n)$. Under such memory budgets, it has been unconditionally proven that probabilistic Turing machines are unable to solve certain computational problems. We formulate a new class of problems, and show that these problems are polynomial-time solvable for quantum machines, impossible for classical machines, and have the property that their solutions can be "proved" by a small-space quantum machine to a classical machine with the same space bound. These problems form the basis of our newly defined protocol, where the polynomial-time verifier's verdict about the tested machine's quantumness is not conditional on an unproven weakness assumption.</description>

Abstract: We show that locally-interacting, periodically-driven (Floquet) Hamiltonian dynamics coupled to a Langevin bath support finite-temperature discrete time crystals (DTC) with an infinite auto-correlation time. By contrast to both prethermal and many-body localized DTCs, the time crystalline order we uncover is stable to arbitrary perturbations, including those that break the time translation symmetry of the underlying drive. Our approach utilizes a general mapping from probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) to open classical Floquet systems undergoing continuous-time Langevin dynamics. Applying this mapping to a variant of the Toom cellular automata, which we dub the ''$\pi$-Toom time crystal'', leads to a 2D Floquet Hamiltonian with a finite-temperature DTC phase transition. We provide numerical evidence for the existence of this transition, and analyze the statistics of the finite temperature fluctuations. Finally, we discuss how general results from the field of probabilistic cellular automata imply the existence of discrete time crystals (with an infinite auto-correlation time) in all dimensions, $d \geq 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.10162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) represents a real scalar polynomial of degree $d$ using a product of unitary matrices of size $2\times 2$, parameterized by $(d+1)$ real numbers called the phase factors. This innovative representation of polynomials has a wide range of applications in quantum computation. When the polynomial of interest is obtained by truncating an infinite polynomial series, a natural question is whether the phase factors have a well defined limit as the degree $d\to \infty$. While the phase factors are generally not unique, we find that there exists a consistent choice of parameterization so that the limit is well defined in the $\ell^1$ space. This generalization of QSP, called the infinite quantum signal processing, can be used to represent a large class of non-polynomial functions. Our analysis reveals a surprising connection between the regularity of the target function and the decay properties of the phase factors. Our analysis also inspires a very simple and efficient algorithm to approximately compute the phase factors in the $\ell^1$ space. The algorithm uses only double precision arithmetic operations, and provably converges when the $\ell^1$ norm of the Chebyshev coefficients of the target function is upper bounded by a constant that is independent of $d$. This is also the first numerically stable algorithm for finding phase factors with provable performance guarantees in the limit $d\to \infty$.</description>

Abstract: The spectral variant of the quantum marginal problem asks: Given prescribed spectra for a set of overlapping quantum marginals, does there exist a compatible joint state? The main idea of this work is a symmetry-reduced semidefinite programming hierarchy that detects when when no such joint state exists. The hierarchy is complete, in the sense that it detects every incompatible set of spectra. The refutations it provides are dimension-free, certifying incompatibility in all local dimensions. The hierarchy also applies to the sums of Hermitian matrices problem, the compatibility of local unitary invariants, for certifying vanishing Kronecker coefficients, and to optimize over equivariant state polynomials.</description>

Abstract: Coherent control errors, for which ideal Hamiltonians are perturbed by unknown multiplicative noise terms, are a major obstacle for reliable quantum computing. In this paper, we present a framework for analyzing the robustness of quantum algorithms against coherent control errors using Lipschitz bounds. We derive worst-case fidelity bounds which show that the resilience against coherent control errors is mainly influenced by the norms of the Hamiltonians generating the individual gates. These bounds are explicitly computable even for large circuits, and they can be used to guarantee fault-tolerance via threshold theorems. Moreover, we apply our theoretical framework to derive a novel guideline for robust quantum algorithm design and transpilation, which amounts to reducing the norms of the Hamiltonians. Using the $3$-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform as an example application, we demonstrate that this guideline targets robustness more effectively than existing ones based on circuit depth or gate count. Furthermore, we apply our framework to study the effect of parameter regularization in variational quantum algorithms. The practicality of the theoretical results is demonstrated via implementations in simulation and on a quantum computer.</description>

Abstract: Quasiprobability has become an increasingly popular notion for characterising non-classicality in quantum information, thermodynamics, and metrology. Two important distributions with non-positive quasiprobability are the Wigner function and the Glauber-Sudarshan function. Here we study properties of the spin Wigner function for finite-dimensional quantum systems and draw comparisons with its infinite-dimensional analog, focusing in particular on the relation to the Glauber-Sudarshan function and the existence of absolutely Wigner-bounded states. More precisely, we investigate unitary orbits of mixed spin states that are characterized by Wigner functions lower-bounded by a specified value. To this end, we extend a characterization of the set of absolutely Wigner positive states as a set of linear eigenvalue constraints, which together define a polytope centred on the maximally mixed state in the simplex of spin-$j$ states. The lower bound determines the relative size of such absolutely Wigner bounded (AWB) polytopes and we study their geometric characteristics. In each dimension a Hilbert-Schmidt ball representing a tight purity-based sufficient condition to be AWB is exactly determined, while another ball representing a necessary condition to be AWB is conjectured. Special attention is given to the case where the polytope separates orbits containing only positive Wigner functions from other orbits because of the use of Wigner negativity as a witness of non-classicality. Comparisons are made to absolute symmetric state separability and spin Glauber-Sudarshan positivity, with additional details given for low spin quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Erasure conversion in Majorana qubits via local quasiparticle detection</title>

Abstract: Quasiparticle poisoning errors in Majorana-based qubits are not suppressed by the underlying topological properties, which undermines the usefulness of this proposed platform. This work tackles the errors originating from intrinsically excited quasiparticles by developing an erasure conversion scheme based on local quasiparticle detection. To model such measurements, we begin by constructing the quasiparticle position operator for the Kitaev chain. A measurement probe coupling to this operator is shown to allow projective measurements in the Wannier quasiparticle basis. Detection of quasiparticles in a region of width $d$ adjacent to each Majorana zero-energy mode allows implementation of an error-detecting Majorana stabilizer code $\mathcal{C}_d$ based on microscopic fermionic (non-topological) physical degrees of freedom. The implementation of $\mathcal{C}_d$ converts a large fraction of Pauli errors to erasure errors, thus achieving `erasure conversion' in Majorana qubits. We show that the fraction of Pauli errors escaping conversion to erasure errors is exponentially small in $d$, a result tied to the exponential localization of Wannier functions which we prove rigorously. The suppression in Pauli error rate comes at the cost of the erasure rate increasing sublinearly with $d$, but this can be readily compensated for by a suitable outer code, with the net effect being a higher threshold rate of quasiparticle poisoning. The framework developed here serves as a basis for understanding how realistic measurements, such as conductance measurements, could be utilized for achieving fault tolerance in these systems.</description>

Abstract: The exponential convergence to invariant subspaces of quantum Markov semigroups plays a crucial role in quantum information theory. One such example is in bosonic error correction schemes, where dissipation is used to drive states back to the code-space - an invariant subspace protected against certain types of errors. In this paper, we investigate perturbations of quantum dynamical semigroups that operate on continuous variable (CV) systems and admit an invariant subspace. First, we prove a generation theorem for quantum Markov semigroups on CV systems under the physical assumptions that (i) the generator is in GKSL form with corresponding jump operators defined as polynomials of annihilation and creation operators; and (ii) the (possibly unbounded) generator increases all moments in a controlled manner. Additionally, we show that the level sets of operators with bounded first moments are admissible subspaces of the evolution, providing the foundations for a perturbative analysis. Our results also extend to time-dependent semigroups and multi-mode systems. We apply our general framework to two settings of interest in continuous variable quantum information processing. First, we provide a new scheme for deriving continuity bounds on the energy-constrained capacities of Markovian perturbations of quantum dynamical semigroups. Second, we provide quantitative perturbation bounds for the steady state of the quantum Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup and the invariant subspace of the photon dissipation used in bosonic error correction.</description>

Abstract: We investigate quantum algorithms derived from tensor networks to simulate the static and dynamic properties of quantum many-body systems. Using a sequentially prepared quantum circuit representation of a matrix product state (MPS) that we call a quantum tensor network (QTN), we demonstrate algorithms to prepare ground and excited states on a quantum computer and apply them to molecular nanomagnets (MNMs) as a paradigmatic example. In this setting, we develop two approaches for extracting the spectral correlation functions measured in neutron scattering experiments: (a) a generalization of the SWAP test for computing wavefunction overlaps and, (b) a generalization of the notion of matrix product operators (MPOs) to the QTN setting which generates a linear combination of unitaries. The latter method is discussed in detail for translationally invariant spin-half systems, where it is shown to reduce the qubit resource requirements compared with the SWAP method, and may be generalized to other systems. We demonstrate the versatility of our approaches by simulating spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 MNMs, with the latter being an experimentally relevant model of a Cr$^{3+}_8$ ring. Our approach has qubit requirements that are independent of the number of constituents of the many-body system and scale only logarithmically with the bond dimension of the MPS representation, making them appealing for implementation on near-term quantum hardware with mid-circuit measurement and reset.</description>

Abstract: The Grover algorithm is a crucial solution for addressing unstructured search problems and has emerged as an essential quantum subroutine in various complex algorithms. By using a different approach with previous studies, this research extensively investigates Grover's search methodology within non-uniformly distributed databases, a scenario frequently encountered in practical applications. Our analysis reveals that the behavior of the Grover evolution differs significantly when applied to non-uniform databases compared to uniform or 'unstructured databases'. Based on the property of differential equation, it is observed that the search process facilitated by this evolution does not consistently result in a speed-up, and we have identified specific criteria for such situations. Furthermore, we have extended this investigation to databases characterized by coherent states, confirming the speed-up achieved through Grover evolution via rigorous numerical verification. In conclusion, our study provides an enhancement to the original Grover algorithm, offering insights to optimize implementation strategies and broaden its range of applications.</description>

Abstract: Quantum sensors offer control flexibility during estimation by allowing manipulation by the experimenter across various parameters. For each sensing platform, pinpointing the optimal controls to enhance the sensor's precision remains a challenging task. While an analytical solution might be out of reach, machine learning offers a promising avenue for many systems of interest, especially given the capabilities of contemporary hardware. We have introduced a versatile procedure capable of optimizing a wide range of problems in quantum metrology, estimation, and hypothesis testing by combining model-aware reinforcement learning (RL) with Bayesian estimation based on particle filtering. To achieve this, we had to address the challenge of incorporating the many non-differentiable steps of the estimation in the training process, such as measurements and the resampling of the particle filter. Model-aware RL is a gradient-based method, where the derivatives of the sensor's precision are obtained through automatic differentiation (AD) in the simulation of the experiment. Our approach is suitable for optimizing both non-adaptive and adaptive strategies, using neural networks or other agents. We provide an implementation of this technique in the form of a Python library called qsensoropt, alongside several pre-made applications for relevant physical platforms, namely NV centers, photonic circuits, and optical cavities. This library will be released soon on PyPI. Leveraging our method, we've achieved results for many examples that surpass the current state-of-the-art in experimental design. In addition to Bayesian estimation, leveraging model-aware RL, it is also possible to find optimal controls for the minimization of the Cram\'er-Rao bound, based on Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Electrically controlled focusing of de Broglie matter waves by Fresnel zone plate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution from classical to quantum matter wave optics has been influenced by transformative optical devices. Fresnel zone plates (FZP), initially designed for light manipulation, have now found expanded applications in matter waves. In this study, focusing of helium atoms by an electrically biased FZP is investigated numerically. The $n$th opaque zone of the FZP is subject to electrostatic biasing using three ways: (i) $V_n=V_1$, where $V_1$ is the biasing voltage applied to the central zone, (ii) $V_n=V_1 \sqrt{n}$, and (iii) $V_n = V_1 \sin (k_E n)$, with $k_E$ being the radial modulation factor. The effect of biasing the FZP on the transmission coefficient ($T_c$), focal length ($f$), size of the focused wave packet ($\sigma_F$), transverse intensity profile, and focusing efficiency ($\eta$) is investigated. The study reveals that the electrical biasing of the FZP modulates the diffractive focusing of neutral atoms by altering the atom-surface interaction with induced polarization potential. It is observed that biasing with $V_n=V_1$ induces multi-focusing of the FZP, reducing wave packet transmission and focusing efficiency. Biasing with $V_n=V_1 \sqrt{n}$ significantly enhances the transmission coefficient by $23.7\%$, increases the focal length $f$ by $103\%$, and improves the focusing efficiency from $10\%$ to $20.17\%$, indicating enhanced focusing performance. Biasing with $V_n=V_1 \sin(k_E n)$ offers increased controllability in focusing matter waves through the parameters $k_E$ and $V_1$. In this case, a highly intense focused wave packet with a better efficiency of $20.3\%$ is observed compared to the other cases. The findings will be helpful in various emerging applications of atom optics, such as improving the performance of helium microscopes, enabling control in cold atom trapping on atom chips, and high-precision atom lithography for quantum electronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Quantum security over long distances with untrusted relays is largely unfounded and is still an open question for active research. Nevertheless, quantum networks based on trusted relays are being built across the globe. However, standard QKD network architecture implores a complete trust requirement on QKD relays, which is too demanding and limits the use cases for QKD networks. In this work, we explore the possibility to securely relay a secret in a QKD network by relaxing the trust assumptions (if not completely) on the relay. We characterize QKD relays with different trust levels, namely, Full Access Trust (FAT), Partial Access Trust (PAT), and No Access Trust (NAT). As the name suggests, each level defines the degree with which a relay is required to be trusted with the secret provided by the key management system for end-to-end communication. We then review and propose multiple constructions of the QKD key management system based on the different trust levels. Main contribution of the paper is realized by evaluating key management systems with no access trust level. In principle, we review key management with centralized topology and propose a new decentralized key management system. These different topologies provide various advantages based on the QKD network requirements, allowing an operational flexibility in the architecture. We believe this work presents a new perspective to the open problem of providing a confiding and a practical solution for future long range secure communications</description>

      <title>Dynamical Logical Qubits in the Bacon-Shor Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bacon-Shor code is a quantum error correcting subsystem code composed of weight 2 check operators that admits a single logical qubit, and has distance $d$ on a $d \times d$ square lattice. We show that when viewed as a Floquet code, by choosing an appropriate measurement schedule of the check operators, it can additionally host several dynamical logical qubits. Specifically, we identify a period 4 measurement schedule of the check operators that preserves logical information between the instantaneous stabilizer groups. Such a schedule measures not only the usual stabilizers of the Bacon-Shor code, but also additional stabilizers that protect the dynamical logical qubits against errors. We show that the code distance of these Floquet-Bacon-Shor codes scales as $\Theta(d/\sqrt{k})$ on an $n = d \times d$ lattice with $k$ dynamical logical qubits, along with the logical qubit of the parent subsystem code. Unlike the usual Bacon-Shor code, the Floquet-Bacon-Shor code family introduced here can therefore saturate the subsystem bound $kd = O(n)$. Moreover, several errors are shown to be self-corrected purely by the measurement schedule itself. This work provides insights into the design space for dynamical codes and expands the known approaches for constructing Floquet codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum many-body systems, interactions play a crucial role in the emergence of information scrambling. When particles interact throughout the system, the entanglement between them can lead to a rapid and chaotic spreading of quantum information, typically probed by the growth in operator size in the Heisenberg picture. In this study, we explore whether the operator undergoes scrambling when particles interact solely through a single impurity in generic spatial dimensions, focusing on fermion systems with spatial and temporal random hoppings. By connecting the dynamics of the operator to the symmetric exclusion process with a source term, we demonstrate the presence of an escape-to-scrambling transition when tuning the interaction strength for fermions in three dimensions. As a comparison, systems in lower dimensions are proven to scramble at arbitrarily weak interactions unless the hopping becomes sufficiently long-ranged. Our predictions are validated using both a Brownian circuit with a single Majorana fermion per site and a solvable Brownian SYK model with a large local Hilbert space dimension. This suggests the universality of the theoretical picture for free fermion systems with spatial and temporal randomness.</description>

Abstract: We introduce protocols to prepare many-body quantum states with quantum circuits assisted by local operations and classical communication. We show that by lifting the requirement of exact preparation, one can substantially save resources. In particular, the so-called $W$ and, more generally, Dicke states require a circuit depth and number of ancillas per site that are independent of the system size. As a byproduct of our work, we introduce an efficient scheme to implement certain non-local, non-Clifford unitary operators. We also discuss how similar ideas may be applied in the preparation of eigenstates of well-known spin models, both free and interacting.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11306v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) leverage inherent, non-clonable physical randomness to generate unique input-output pairs, serving as secure fingerprints for cryptographic protocols like authentication. Quantum PUFs (QPUFs) extend this concept by using quantum states as input-output pairs, offering advantages over classical PUFs, such as challenge reusability via public channels and eliminating the need for trusted parties due to the no-cloning theorem. Recent work introduced a generalized mathematical framework for QPUFs. It was shown that random unitary QPUFs cannot achieve existential unforgeability against Quantum Polynomial Time (QPT) adversaries. Security was possible only with additional uniform randomness. To avoid the cost of external randomness, we propose a novel measurement-based scheme. Here, the randomness naturally arises from quantum measurements. Additionally, we introduce a second model where the QPUF functions as a nonunitary quantum channel, which guarantees existential unforgeability. These are the first models in the literature to demonstrate a high level of provable security. Finally, we show that the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) protocol, applied to a Haar random unitary, serves as an approximate implementation of the second type of QPUF by approximating a von Neumann measurement on the unitary's eigenbasis.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Coherent Errors using Matrix-Element Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Repeating a gate sequence multiple times amplifies systematic errors coherently, making it a useful tool for characterizing quantum gates. However, the precision of such an approach is limited by low-frequency noises, while its efficiency hindered by time-consuming scans required to match up the phases of the off-diagonal matrix elements being amplified. Here, we overcome both challenges by interleaving the gate of interest with dynamical decoupling sequences in a protocol we call Matrix-Element Amplification using Dynamical Decoupling (MEADD). Using frequency-tunable superconducting qubits from a Google Sycamore quantum processor, we experimentally demonstrate that MEADD surpasses the accuracy and precision of existing characterization protocols for estimating systematic errors in single- and two-qubit gates. In particular, MEADD yields factors of 5 to 10 improvements in estimating coherent parameters of the $\mathrm{CZ}$ gates compared to existing methods, reaching a precision below one milliradian. We also use it to characterize coherent crosstalk in the processor which was previously too small to detect reliably.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum control techniques play an important role in manipulating and harnessing the properties of different quantum systems, including isolated atoms. Here, we propose to achieve quantum control over a single on-surface atomic spin using Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry implemented with Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). Specifically, we model how the application of time-dependent, non-resonant AC electric fields across the STM tip-surface gap makes it possible to achieve precise quantum state manipulation in an isolated Fe atom on a MgO/Ag(100) surface. We propose a protocol to combine Landau Zener tunneling with LZSM interferometry that permits one to measure the quantum spin tunneling of an individual Fe atom. The proposed experiments can be implemented with ESR-STM instrumentation, opening a new venue in the research of on-surface single spin control.</description>

      <title>Expressiveness of Commutative Quantum Circuits: A Probabilistic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the frame potential and expressiveness of commutative quantum circuits. Based on the Fourier series representation of these circuits, we express quantum expectation and pairwise fidelity as characteristic functions of random variables, and expressiveness as the recurrence probability of a random walk on a lattice. A central outcome of our work includes formulas to approximate the frame potential and expressiveness for any commutative quantum circuit, underpinned by convergence theorems in probability theory. We identify the lattice volume of the random walk as means to approximate expressiveness based on circuit architecture. In the specific case of commutative circuits involving Pauli-$Z$ rotations, we provide theoretical results relating expressiveness and circuit structure. Our probabilistic representation also provide means for bounding and approximately calculating the frame potential of a circuit through sampling methods.</description>

      <title>Estimating Non-Stabilizerness Dynamics Without Simulating It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Iterative Clifford Circuit Renormalization (ICCR), a novel technique designed to efficiently handle the dynamics of non-stabilizerness (a.k.a. quantum magic) in generic quantum circuits. ICCR iteratively adjusts the starting circuit, transforming it into a Clifford circuit where all elements that can alter the non-stabilizerness, such as measurements or T gates, have been removed. In the process the initial state is renormalized in such a way that the new circuit outputs the same final state as the original one. This approach embeds the complex dynamics of non-stabilizerness in the flow of an effective initial state, enabling its efficient evaluation while avoiding the need for direct and computationally expensive simulation of the original circuit. The initial state renormalization can be computed explicitly using a matrix-product state approximation that can be systematically improved. We implement the ICCR algorithm to evaluate the non-stabilizerness dynamics for systems of size up to N = 1000. We validate our method by comparing it to tensor networks simulations. Finally, we employ the ICCR technique to study a magic purification circuit, where a measurement-induced transition is observed.</description>

Abstract: Strong excitation of nuclear resonances, particularly of M\"ossbauer nuclei, has been a longstanding goal and the advance of novel x-ray sources is promising new options in this regard. Here we map out the necessary experimental conditions for the more general goal of realizing nonlinear optics with nuclei and compare with available technology. In particular, we present a comprehensive theory of nonlinear nuclear excitation in thin-film x-ray cavities by focused x-ray pulses. We thereby identify cavity geometries with broad resonances which allow one to boost the nuclear excitation even at moderately tight focusing and offer the possibility to mitigate radiation damage.</description>

Abstract: A method to compute the excitation of narrow transitions at hard x-ray energies by short focused x-ray pulses is developed. In particular, the effect of thin-film cavities on the pulse propagation is incorporated via a semi-analytical algorithm requiring the numerical evaluation of only one two-dimensional Fourier transform. We investigate various limiting cases to confirm the reliability of the algorithm. As an application, we show how a focused x-ray pulse propagates in cavity structures utilized in previous theoretical studies and experiments with collimated beams.</description>

      <title>Analytically exact solution of the Schrodinger equation for neutral helium in the ground state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03020v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This report presents the analytical solution of the Schrodinger equation and its corresponding wave function for the neutral helium or helium-like atoms in the ground state. The entangled state function of the electrons for S,L=0 is examined in detail. The basic idea is, though we treat the electron as a point like particle, not to understand its field as a point charge with the typical Coulomb field as in common approaches, but to solve the Schrodinger equation with an electric potential taking Heisenberg uncertainty principle into account. A method for describing a generic electron potential is derived, and the result was integrated into the Schrodinger equation. As a direct consequence the electromagnetic coupling of the electrons was investigated by introducing an effective interaction distance to describe vacuum polarization effects. The Schrodinger equation is solved using Laplace transformations. By determining the effective interaction distance iteratively, the ground state energy was calculated and compared with the literature values. It could be shown that with a given value the backward calculation of the effective interaction distance gives plausible results of the ground state energy thus providing us with a convincing method to describe the helium atom analytically. An upper limit estimation for the spatial dimension of the interaction distance for quantum-electrodynamical effects around the electron is given as well as the existence of a minimal distance of a stable bonding state between two electrons in the nucleonic field. As a result, the chemical inertness of helium regarding chemical reactions i.e., the principle of the "closed" electron shell - can be made plausible. The wave function found for the helium atom is compared with the known solutions for the hydrogen atom and Hylleraas function as well, and differences between those are worked out.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Synchronization of Active Quantum Spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active agents are capable of exerting nonreciprocal forces upon one another. For instance, one agent, say $A$, may attract another agent $B$ while $B$ repels $A$. These antagonistic nonreciprocal interactions have been extensively studied in classical systems, revealing a wealth of exciting phenomena such as novel phase transitions and traveling-wave states. Whether these phenomena can originate in quantum many-body systems is an open issue, and proposals for their realization are lacking. In this work, we present a model of two species of quantum spins that interact in an antagonistic nonreciprocal way of the attraction-repulsion type. We propose an implementation based on two atomic ensembles coupled via chiral waveguides featuring both braided and non-braided geometries. The spins are active due to the presence of local gain, which allows them to synchronize. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that nonreciprocal interactions result in a nonreciprocal phase transition to time-crystalline traveling-wave states, associated with spontaneous breaking of parity-time symmetry. We establish how this symmetry emerges from the microscopic quantum model. For a finite number of spins, signatures of the time-crystal phase can still be identified by inspecting equal-time or two-time correlation functions. Remarkably, continuous monitoring of the output field of the waveguides induces a quantum traveling-wave state: a time-crystalline state of a finite-size quantum system, in which parity-time symmetry is spontaneously broken. Our work lays the foundation to explore nonreciprocal interactions in active quantum matter.</description>

Abstract: High-dimensional multipartite entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information science. However, existing schemes for generating such entanglement become complex and costly as the dimension of quantum units increases. In this work, we overcome the limitation by proposing a significantly enhanced linear optical heralded scheme that generates the $d$-level $N$-partite GHZ state with single-photon sources and linear operations. Our scheme requires $dN$ photons, which is the minimal required photon number, with substantially improved success probability from previous schemes. It employs linear optical logic gates compatible with any qudit encoding system and can generate generalized GHZ states with installments of beamsplitters. With efficient generations of high-dimensional resource states, our work opens avenues for further exploration in high-dimensional quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Memory Lifetime with Measurement-Free Local Error Correction and Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable quantum computation requires systematic identification and correction of errors that occur and accumulate in quantum hardware. To diagnose and correct such errors, standard quantum error-correcting protocols utilize $\textit{global}$ error information across the system obtained by mid-circuit readout of ancillary qubits. We investigate circuit-level error-correcting protocols that are measurement-free and based on $\textit{local}$ error information. Such a local error correction (LEC) circuit consists of faulty multi-qubit gates to perform both syndrome extraction and ancilla-controlled error removal. We develop and implement a reinforcement learning framework that takes a fixed set of faulty gates as inputs and outputs an optimized LEC circuit. To evaluate this approach, we quantitatively characterize an extension of logical qubit lifetime by a noisy LEC circuit. For the 2D classical Ising model and 4D toric code, our optimized LEC circuit performs better at extending a memory lifetime compared to a conventional LEC circuit based on Toom's rule in a sub-threshold gate error regime. We further show that such circuits can be used to reduce the rate of mid-circuit readouts to preserve a 2D toric code memory. Finally, we discuss the application of the LEC protocol on dissipative preparation of quantum states with topological phases.</description>

Abstract: Quantum metrology offers significant improvements in several quantum technologies. In this work, we propose a Gaussian quantum metrology protocol assisted by initial position-momentum correlations (PM). We employ a correlated Gaussian wave packet as a probe to examine the dynamics of Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and purity based on PM correlations to demonstrate how to estimate the PM correlations and, more importantly, to unlock its potential applications such as a resource to enhance quantum thermometry. In the low-temperature regime, we find an improvement in the thermometry of the surrounding environment when the original system exhibits a non-null initial correlation (correlated Gaussian state). In addition, we explore the connection between the loss of purity and the gain in QFI during the process of estimating the effective environment coupling and its effective temperature.</description>

Abstract: Realization of quantum computing requires the development of high-fidelity quantum gates that are resilient to decoherence, control errors, and environmental noise. While non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation (NHQC) offers a promising approach, it often necessitates system-specific adjustments. This work presents a versatile scheme for implementing NHQC gates across multiple qubit systems by optimizing multiple degrees of freedom using a genetic algorithm. The scheme is applied to three qubit systems: ensemble rare-earth ion (REI) qubits, single REI qubits, and superconducting transmon qubits. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the optimized gate operations are robust against frequency detuning and induce low off-resonant excitations, making the scheme effective for advancing fault-tolerant quantum computation across various platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that classical mechanics can be recovered as the high-entropy limit of quantum mechanics. That is, the high entropy masks quantum effects, and mixed states of high enough entropy can be approximated with classical distributions. The mathematical limit $\hbar \to 0$ can be reinterpreted as setting the zero entropy of pure states to $-\infty$, in the same way that non-relativistic mechanics can be recovered mathematically with $c \to \infty$. Physically, these limits are more appropriately defined as $S \gg 0$ and $v \ll c$. Both limits can then be understood as approximations independently of what circumstances allow those approximations to be valid. Consequently, the limit presented is independent of possible underlying mechanisms and of what interpretation is chosen for both quantum states and entropy.</description>

      <title>Scar-induced imbalance in staggered Rydberg ladders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the kinematically-constrained model of Rydberg atoms on a two-leg ladder with staggered detuning, $\Delta \in [0,1]$, has quantum many-body scars (QMBS) in its spectrum and represents a non-perturbative generalization of the paradigmatic PXP model defined on a chain. We show that these QMBS result in coherent many-body revivals and site-dependent magnetization dynamics for both N\'eel and Rydberg vacuum initial states around $\Delta=1$. The latter feature leads to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)-violating finite imbalance at long times in a disorder-free system. This is further demonstrated by constructing appropriate local imbalance operators that display nonzero long-time averages for N\'eel and vacuum initial states. We also study the fidelity and Shannon entropy for such dynamics which, along with the presence of long-time finite imbalance, brings out the qualitatively different nature of QMBS in PXP ladders with $\Delta \sim 1$ from those in the PXP chain. Finally, we identify additional exact mid-spectrum zero modes that stay unchanged as a function of $\Delta$ and violate ETH.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Dynamical Codes for Biased Noise: The X$^3$Z$^3$ Floquet Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the X$^3$Z$^3$ Floquet code, a type of dynamical code with improved performance under biased noise compared to other Floquet codes. The enhanced performance is attributed to a simplified decoding problem resulting from a persistent symmetry under infinitely biased noise, which surprisingly exists in a code without constant stabilisers. Even if such a symmetry is allowed, we prove that a general dynamical code with two-qubit parity measurements cannot admit one-dimensional decoding graphs, a key feature resulting in the high performance of bias-tailored stabiliser codes. Despite this limitation, we demonstrate through our comprehensive numerical simulations that the symmetry of the X$^3$Z$^3$ Floquet code renders its performance under biased noise far better than several leading Floquet code candidates. Furthermore, to maintain high-performance implementation in hardwares without native two-qubit parity measurements, we introduce ancilla-assisted bias-preserving parity measurement circuits. Our work establishes the X$^3$Z$^3$ code as a prime quantum error-correcting code candidate, particularly for devices with reduced connectivity, such as the honeycomb and heavy-hexagonal architectures.</description>

      <title>The time-dependent quantum harmonic oscillator: a pedagogical approach via the Lewis-Riesenfeld dynamical invariant method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics courses, students often solve the Schr\"odinger equation for the harmonic oscillator with time-independent parameters. However, time-dependent quantum harmonic oscillators are relevant in modeling several problems as, for instance, the description of quantum motion of particles in traps, shortcuts to adiabaticity, as well as quantum scalar fields evolving in expanding universes. In the present paper, we discuss, with a pedagogical approach, the quantum harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequency via the Lewis-Riesenfeld dynamical invariant method, revisiting the main steps to obtain the wave function associated with this model, and briefly discussing the relation between this oscillator and the generation of squeezed states. As examples of didactic applications of time-dependent harmonic oscillators and the Lewis-Riesenfeld method in quantum mechanics courses, we solve the following problems: the calculation of the transition probability associated with a harmonic oscillator which undergoes jumps in its frequency, and the analysis of the dynamics of a quantum particle in a Paul trap.</description>

      <title>Efficient Eigenstate Preparation in an Integrable Model with Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the preparation of all the eigenstates of spin chains using quantum circuits. It is known that generic eigenstates of free-fermionic spin chains can be prepared with circuits whose depth grows only polynomially with the length of the chain and the number of particles. We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Going beyond quantum Markovianity and back to reality: An exact master equation study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise characterization of dynamics in open quantum systems often presents significant challenges, leading to the introduction of various approximations to simplify a model. One commonly used strategy involves Markovian approximations, assuming a memoryless environment. In this study, such approximations are not used and an analytical dynamical depiction of an open quantum system is provided. The system under consideration is an oscillator that is surrounded by a bath of oscillators. The resulting dynamics are characterized by a second-order complex coefficient linear differential equation, which may be either homogeneous or inhomogeneous. Moreover, distinct dynamical regions emerge, depending on certain parameter values. Notably, the steady-state average excitation number (AEN) of the system shows rapid escalation with increasing non-Markovianity, reflecting the intricacies of real-world dynamics. In cases where there is detuning between the system frequency and the environmental central frequency within a non-Markovian regime, the AEN maintains its initial value for an extended period. Furthermore, the application of pulse control can effectively protect the quantum system from decoherence effects without using approximations. The pulse control can not only prolong the relaxation time of the oscillator, but can also be used to speed up the relaxation process, depending on the specifications of the pulse. By employing a kick pulse, the Mpemba effect can be observed in the non-Markovian regime in a surprisingly super-cooling-like effect.</description>

Abstract: We present our recent studies on thermal field theories using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the representation of quantum fields via qubits on general digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Then, we show our numerical results of thermal field theories in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. Both fermion and scalar fields will be discussed. These studies aim to understand thermal fixed points for our forthcoming work on studying thermalisation in quantum field theories in real time quantum simulation.</description>

Abstract: High-precision, robust quantum gates are essential components in quantum computation and information processing. In this study, we present an alternative perspective, exploring the potential applicability of quantum gates that exhibit heightened sensitivity to errors. We investigate such sensitive quantum gates, which, beyond their established use in in vivo NMR spectroscopy, quantum sensing, and polarization optics, may offer significant utility in precision quantum metrology and error characterization. Utilizing the composite pulses technique, we derive three fundamental quantum gates with narrowband and passband characteristics -- the X (NOT) gate, the Hadamard gate, and gates enabling arbitrary rotations. To systematically design these composite pulse sequences, we introduce the SU(2), modified-SU(2), and regularization random search methodologies. These approaches, many of which are novel, demonstrate superior performance compared to established sequences in the literature, including NB1, SK1, and PB1.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Logical Bell State Generation in Memory Assisted Quantum Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the feasibility of utilizing quantum error correction (QEC) to generate and store logical Bell states in heralded quantum entanglement protocols, crucial for quantum repeater networks. Two novel lattice surgery-based protocols (local and non-local) are introduced to establish logical Bell states between distant nodes using an intermediary node. In the local protocol, the intermediary node creates and directly transmits the logical Bell states to quantum memories. In contrast, the non-local protocol distributes auxiliary Bell states, merging boundaries between pre-existing codes in the quantum memories.
  We simulate the protocols using realistic experimental parameters, including cavity-enhanced atomic frequency comb quantum memories and multimode fiber-optic noisy channels. The study evaluates rotated and planar surface codes alongside Bacon-Shor codes for small code distances $(d = 3, 5)$ under standard and realistic noise models. We observe pseudo-thresholds, indicating that when physical error rates exceed approximately $p_{\text{err}} \sim 10^{-3}$, QEC codes do not provide any benefit over using unencoded Bell states. Moreover, to achieve an advantage over unencoded Bell states for a distance of $1 \, \mathrm{km}$ between the end node and the intermediary, gate error rates must be reduced by an order of magnitude $(0.1p_{\text{err}_H}$, $0.1p_{\text{err}_{CX}}$, and $0.1p_{\text{err}_M}$), highlighting the need for significant hardware improvements to implement logical Bell state protocols with quantum memories. Finally, both protocols were analyzed for their achieved rates, with the non-local protocol showing higher rates, ranging from $6.64 \, \mathrm{kHz}$ to $1.91 \, \mathrm{kHz}$, over distances of $1$ to $9 \, \mathrm{km}$ between the end node and the intermediary node.</description>

      <title>Magic State Injection on IBM Quantum Processors Above the Distillation Threshold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface code family is a promising approach to implementing fault-tolerant quantum computations by providing the desired reliability via scaling the code size. For universal fault-tolerance requiring logical non-Clifford quantum operations in addition to Clifford gates, it is imperative to experimentally demonstrate the implementation of additional resources known as magic states, which is a highly non-trivial task. Another key challenge is efficient embedding of surface code in quantum hardware layout to harness its inherent error resilience and magic state preparation techniques, which becomes a difficult task for hardware platforms with connectivity constraints. This work simultaneously addresses both challenges by proposing a qubit-efficient rotated heavy-hexagonal surface code embedding in IBM quantum processors (\texttt{ibm\_fez}) and implementing the code-based magic state injection protocol. Our work reports error thresholds for both logical bit- and phase-flip errors, obtaining $\approx0.37\%$ and $\approx0.31\%$, respectively, which are higher than the threshold values previously reported with traditional embedding. The post-selection-based preparation of logical magic states $|H_L\rangle$ and $|T_L\rangle$ achieve fidelities of $0.8806\pm0.0002$ and $0.8665\pm0.0003$, respectively, which are both above the magic state distillation threshold. Additionally, we report the minimum fidelity among injected arbitrary single logical qubit states as $0.8356\pm0.0003$. Our work demonstrates the potential for implementing non-Clifford logical gates by producing high-fidelity logical magic states on IBM quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a fascinating interdisciplinary research field that promises to revolutionize computing by efficiently solving previously intractable problems. Recent years have seen tremendous progress on both the experimental realization of quantum computing devices as well as the development and implementation of quantum algorithms. Yet, realizing computational advantages of quantum computers in practice remains a widely open problem due to numerous fundamental challenges. Interestingly, many of these challenges are connected to performance, robustness, scalability, optimization, or feedback, all of which are central concepts in control theory. This paper provides a tutorial introduction to quantum computing from the perspective of control theory. We introduce the mathematical framework of quantum algorithms ranging from basic elements including quantum bits and quantum gates to more advanced concepts such as variational quantum algorithms and quantum errors. The tutorial only requires basic knowledge of linear algebra and, in particular, no prior exposure to quantum physics. Our main goal is to equip readers with the mathematical basics required to understand and possibly solve (control-related) problems in quantum computing. In particular, beyond the tutorial introduction, we provide a list of research challenges in the field of quantum computing and discuss their connections to control.</description>

Abstract: Atom-ion hybrid systems are promising platforms for the quantum simulation of polaron physics in certain quantum materials. Here, we investigate the ionic Fermi polaron, a charged impurity in a polarized Fermi bath, at zero temperature using quantum Monte Carlo techniques. We compute the energy spectrum, residue, effective mass, and structural properties. Significant deviations from field-theory prediction occur in the strong coupling regime due to large density inhomogeneities around the ion. We observe a smooth polaron-molecule transition in contrast with the neutral case. This study provides insights into solid-state systems like Fermi exciton polarons in thin semiconductors and quantum technologies based on atom-ion platforms.</description>

Abstract: Berry phases have long been known to significantly alter the properties of periodic systems, resulting in anomalous terms in the semiclassical equations of motion describing wave-packet dynamics. In non-Hermitian systems, generalizations of the Berry connection have been proposed and shown to have novel effects on dynamics and transport. In this work, we consider perturbing fields which are themselves non-Hermitian, in the form of complex external electric fields, which are realizable as gain/loss gradients. We derive the full set of semiclassical equations of motion and show that the anomalous velocity depends not only on the Berry curvature, but on the entirety of the quantum geometric tensor, including the quantum metric. This quantum metric dependent velocity appears regardless of whether the unperturbed Hamiltonian is Hermitian or not. These analytical results are compared with numerical lattice simulations which reveal these anomalous terms even in one-dimension. Our work expands the range of phenomena expected to be detectable in experimental setups, which should be realizable in currently available metamaterials and classical wave systems, including mechanical, acoustic, and optical.</description>

      <title>Switching, Amplifying, and Chirping Diode Lasers with Current Pulses for High Bandwidth Quantum Technologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A series of simple and low-cost devices for switching, amplifying, and chirping diode lasers based on current modulation are presented. Direct modulation of diode laser currents is rarely sufficient to establish precise amplitude and phase control over light, as its effects on these parameters are not independent. These devices overcome this limitation by exploiting amplifier saturation and dramatically outperform commonly used external modulators in key figures of merit for quantum technological applications. Semiconductor optical amplifiers operated on either rubidium D line are recast as intensity switches and shown to achieve ON:OFF ratios $&gt;10^6$ in as little as 50 ns. Current is switched to a 795 nm wavelength (Rb D1) tapered amplifier to produce optical pulses of few nanosecond duration and peak powers of 3 W at a similar extinction ratio. Fast rf pulses are applied directly to a laser diode to shift its emission frequency by up to 300 MHz in either direction and at a maximum chirp rate of 150 MHz/ns. Finally, the latter components are combined, yielding a system that produces watt-level optical pulses with arbitrary frequency chirps in the given range and &lt;2% residual intensity variation, all within 65 ns upon asynchronous demand. Such systems have broad application in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, and are of particular interest to fast experiments simultaneously requiring high power and low noise, for example quantum memory experiments with atomic vapors.</description>

      <title>Impact of quantum noise on phase transitions in an atom-cavity system with limit cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations are inherent in open quantum systems and they affect not only the statistical properties of the initial state but also the time evolution of the system. Using a generic minimal model, we show that quantum noise smoothens the transition between a stationary and a dynamical phase corresponding to a limit cycle (LC) in the semiclassical mean-field approximation of a generic open quantum system. Employing truncated Wigner approximation (TWA), we show that the inherent quantum noise pushes the system to exhibit signatures of LCs for interaction strengths lower than the critical value predicted by the standard mean-field theory, suggesting a noise-induced emergence of temporal ordering. Our work demonstrates that the apparent crossover-like behaviour between stationary phases brought by finite-size effects from quantum fluctuations also apply to transitions involving dynamical phases. To demonstrate this on a specific physical system, we consider a transversely pumped atom-cavity setup, wherein LCs have been observed and identified as continuous time crystals (CTCs). We compare the oscillation frequencies of the LCs in the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) regimes, and find that the frequencies have larger shot-to-shot fluctuations in 1D. This has an important consequence in the effectiveness of entrainment of LCs for a periodically driven pump intensity or light-matter coupling strength.</description>

Abstract: The interactions between Rydberg atoms and microwave fields provide a valuable framework for studying the complex dynamics out of equilibrium, exotic phases, and critical phenomena in many-body physics. This unique interplay allows us to explore various regimes of nonlinearity and phase transitions. Here, we observe a phase transition from the state in the regime of bistability to that in multistability in strongly interacting Rydberg atoms by varying the microwave field intensity, accompanying with the breaking of Z3-symmetry. During the phase transition, the system experiences a hidden critical point, in which the multistable states are difficult to be identified. Through changing the initial state of system, we can identify a hidden multistable state and reveal a hidden trajectory of phase transition, allowing us to track to a hidden critical point. In addition, we observe multiple phase transitions in spectra, suggesting higher-order symmetry breaking. The reported results shed light on manipulating multistability in dissipative Rydberg atoms systems and hold promise in the applications of non-equilibrium many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Two-Time Measurement of Entropy Transfer in Markovian Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a protocol for the two-time measurement of entropic observables in quantum open systems driven out of thermal equilibrium by coupling to several heat baths. We concentrate on the Markovian approximation of the time-evolution and relate the expected value of the so defined entropy variations with the well-known expression of entropy production due to Lebowitz and Spohn. We do so under the detailed balance condition and, as a byproduct, we show that the probabilities of outcomes of two-time measurements are given by a continuous time Markov process determined by the Lindblad generator of the Markovian quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum-critical and dynamical properties of the XXZ bilayer with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the XXZ square lattice bilayer model with antiferromagnetic non-frustrating long-range interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Employing large-scale high-order series expansions with classical Monte Carlo integration (pCUT+MC) about the limit of isolated Heisenberg dimers in the rung-singlet phase, we investigate the one-triplon dispersion and the corresponding spectral weight along the parameter axes of the long-range decay exponent and the XXZ anisotropy. By tuning the latter, we observe two extended regions of 3d XY and Ising universality as well as 3d Heisenberg critical exponents at the isotropic point. Along the decay exponent axis, we demonstrate mean-field behavior for strong long-range couplings, the aforementioned three universality classes for sufficiently weak interactions, and continuously varying critical exponents in-between. Using extrapolations we are able to determine the one-triplon dispersion in a quantitative fashion up to the quantum-critical breakdown of the rung-singlet phase. This allows to extract the dynamical critical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay exponent, displaying a universal behavior. The detected $z&lt;1$ for small decay exponents is in agreement with the expected properties of the anomalous Goldstone modes in the ordered phases with broken continuous symmetry.</description>

      <title>Variational approach to atom-membrane dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Dirac-Frenkel variational principle, a time-dependent description of the dynamics of a two-level system coupled to a bosonic bath is formulated. The method is applied to the case of a gas of cold atoms adsorbing to an elastic membrane at finite temperature via phonon creation. The time-dependence of the system state is analytically calculated using Laplace transform methods, and a closed-form expression for the transition rate is obtained. Atoms in the gas transition to the adsorbed state through a resonance that has contributions from a distribution of vibrational modes of the membrane. The resonance can decay with the creation of a phonon to complete the adsorption process. The adsorption rate at low membrane temperatures agrees with the golden rule estimate to lowest order in the coupling constant for values greater than a critical coupling strength. Below this critical coupling strength, the adsorption rate is exponentially suppressed by a phonon reduction factor whose exponent diverges with increasing adsorbent size. The rate changes discontinuously with coupling strength for low temperature membranes, and the magnitude of the discontinuity decreases with increasing temperature. These variational results suggest the quantum adsorption model may contain a first-order quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>SUSY Quantum Mechanics, (non)-Analyticity and $\ldots$ Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown by analyzing the $1D$ Schr\"odinger equation that discontinuities in the coupling constant can occur in both the energies and the eigenfunctions. Surprisingly, those discontinuities, which are present in the energies {\it versus} the coupling constant, are of three types only: (i) discontinuous energies (similar to 1st order phase transitions), (ii) discontinuous first derivative in the energy while the energy is continuous (similar to 2nd order phase transitions), (iii) the energy and all its derivatives are continuous but the functions are different below and above the point of discontinuity (similar to infinite order phase transitions). Supersymmetric (SUSY) Quantum Mechanics provides a convenient framework to study this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Kinetic magnetism and stripe order in the antiferromagnetic bosonic ${t-J}$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the microscopic mechanisms governing the physics of doped quantum magnets is key to advancing our understanding of strongly correlated quantum matter. Quantum simulation platforms, e.g., ultracold atoms in optical lattices or tweezer arrays, provide a powerful tool to investigate the interplay between spin and charge motion in microscopic detail. Here, in a new twist, we disentangle the role of particle statistics from the physics of strong correlations by exploring the strong coupling limit of doped \emph{bosonic} quantum magnets, specifically the antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t-J$ model. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we map out the phase diagram on the 2D square lattice at finite doping. In the low-doping regime, bosonic holes form partially-filled stripes, akin to those observed in high-$T_c$ cuprates. As doping increases, a transition occurs to a partially-polarized ferromagnetic (FM) phase, driven by the motion of mobile bosonic charge carriers forming Nagaoka polarons. At high doping or large $t/J$, the system evolves into a fully-polarized ferromagnet. These findings shed new light on the role of particle statistics in strongly correlated many-body systems, revealing connections to stripe formation and the physics of kinetic (i.e., Nagaoka-type) ferromagnetism. Our results may be realized in state-of-the-art quantum simulation platforms with bosonic quantum gas microscopes and Rydberg atom tweezer arrays, paving the way for future experimental studies of doped bosonic quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>A Hodge Theory for Entanglement Cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore and extend the application of homological algebra to describe quantum entanglement, initiated in arXiv:1901.02011, focusing on the Hodge-theoretic structure of entanglement cohomology in finite-dimensional quantum systems. We construct analogues of the Hodge star operator, inner product, codifferential, and Laplacian for entanglement $k$-forms. We also prove that such $k$-forms obey versions of the Hodge isomorphism theorem and Hodge decomposition, and that they exhibit Hodge duality. As a corollary, we conclude that the dimensions of the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th cohomologies coincide for entanglement in $n$-partite pure states, which explains a symmetry property ("Poincare duality") of the associated Poincare polynomials.</description>

      <title>Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry T. Different from the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.</description>

      <title>How quantum computing can enhance biomarker discovery for multi-factorial diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomarkers play a central role in medicine's gradual progress towards proactive, personalized precision diagnostics and interventions. However, finding biomarkers that provide very early indicators of a change in health status, particularly for multi-factorial diseases, has been challenging. Discovery of such biomarkers stands to benefit significantly from advanced information processing and means to detect complex correlations, which quantum computing offers. In this perspective paper, quantum algorithms, particularly in machine learning, are mapped to key applications in biomarker discovery. The opportunities and challenges associated with the algorithms and applications are discussed. The analysis is structured according to different data types - multi-dimensional, time series, and erroneous data - and covers key data modalities in healthcare - electronic health records (EHRs), omics, and medical images. An outlook is provided concerning open research challenges.</description>
