      <title>Reconstruction of a function defined on a sphere using the Funk transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the Funk transform (the Funk-Radon transform) is invertible in the class of even (symmetric) continuous functions defined on the unit 2-sphere S^2. In this article, for the reconstruction of f from C(S^2) (can be non-even), an additional condition (to reconstruct an odd function) is found, and the injectivity of the so-called two data Funk transform is considered. An iterative inversion formula of the transform is presented. Such inversions have theoretical significance in convexity theory, integral geometry and spherical tomography. Also, the Funk-Radon transform is used in Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.</description>

      <title>Uniform $h$-dichotomies: noncritical uniformity and expansivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The property of exponential dichotomy can be seen as a generalization of the hyperbolicity condition for non autonomous linear finite dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations. In 1978 W.A. Coppel proved that the exponential dichotomy on the half line is equivalent to the property of noncritical uniformity provided that a condition of bounded growth is verified. In 2006 K.J. Palmer extended this result by proving that -- also assuming the bounded growth property -- the exponential dichotomy on the half line, noncritical uniformity and the exponential expansiveness are equivalent. The main contribution of this article is to generalize these results for the property of uniform $h$-dichotomy. This has been carried out due to a recent idea: under suitable conditions any $h$-dichotomy can be associated to a totally ordered topological group, which becomes the additive group $(\mathbb{R},+)$ in case of the exponential dichotomy. The properties of this new group make possible such generalization.</description>

      <title>Fourier optimization and consequences of the generalized Riemann hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an exposition of some connections between Fourier optimization problems and problems in number theory. In particular, we present some recent conditional bounds under the generalized Riemann hypothesis, achieved via a Fourier optimization framework, on bounding the maximum possible gap between consecutive prime numbers represented by a given quadratic form; and on bounding the least quadratic non-residue modulo a prime number. This is based on joint works with Emanuel Carneiro, Andr\'es Chirre, Micah Milinovich, and Antonio Pedro Ramos.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Ratios of Toroidal Dupin Cyclides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of recent results due to Yu and Chen [Proc. AMS 150(4), 2020, 1749-1765] and to Bostan and Yurkevich [Proc. AMS 150(5), 2022, 2131-2136] shows that the 3-D Euclidean shape of the square Clifford torus is uniquely determined by its isoperimetric ratio. This solves part of the still open uniqueness problem of the Canham model for biomembranes. In this work we investigate the generalization of the aforementioned result to the case of a rectangular Clifford torus. Like the square case, we find closed-form formulas in terms of hypergeometric functions for the isoperimetric ratio of its stereographic projection to $\mathbb{R}^3$ and show that the corresponding function is strictly increasing. But unlike the square case, we show that the isoperimetric ratio does not uniquely determine the Euclidean shape of a rectangular Clifford torus.</description>

      <title>Partial fraction expansions and zeros of Hankel transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proved by the method of partial fraction expansions and Sturm's oscillation theory that the zeros of certain Hankel transforms are all real and distributed regularly between consecutive zeros of Bessel functions. As an application, the sufficient or necessary conditions on parameters for which ${}_1F_2$ hypergeometric functions belong to the Laguerre-P\'olya class are investigated in a constructive manner.</description>

      <title>Classification of discrete weak KAM solutions on linearly repetitive quasi-periodic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In discrete schemes, weak KAM solutions may be interpreted as approximations of correctors for some Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the periodic setting. It is known that correctors may not exist in the almost periodic setting. We show the existence of discrete weak KAM solutions for non-degenerate and weakly twist interactions in general. Furthermore, assuming equivariance with respect to a linearly repetitive quasi-periodic set, we completely classify all possible types of weak KAM solutions.</description>
