      <title>Resolving the Electron Plume within a Scanning Electron Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), a century-old technique, is today a ubiquitous method of imaging the surface of nanostructures. However, most SEM detectors simply count the number of secondary electrons from a material of interest, and thereby overlook the rich material information contained within them. Here, by simple modifications to a standard SEM tool, we resolve the momentum and energy information of secondary electrons by directly imaging the electron plume generated by the electron beam of the SEM. Leveraging these spectroscopic imaging capabilities, our technique is able to image lateral electric fields across a prototypical silicon p-n junctions and to distinguish differently doped regions, even when buried beyond depths typically accessible by SEM. Intriguingly, the sub-surface sensitivity of this technique reveals unexpectedly strong surface band bending within nominally passivated semiconductor structures, providing useful insights for complex layered component designs, in which interfacial dynamics dictate device operation. These capabilities for non-invasive, multi-modal probing of complicated electronic components are crucial in today's electronic manufacturing but is largely inaccessible even with sophisticated techniques. These results show that seemingly simple SEM can be extended to probe complex and useful material properties.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Ultrafast Thermalization of Photoexcited Carriers in Two-Dimensional Materials Induced by Orbital Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of photoexcited carriers is essential for advancing photoelectronic device design. Photon absorption generates electron-hole pairs, and subsequent scatterings can induce ultrafast thermalization within a picosecond, forming a quasi-equilibrium distribution with overheated electrons. The high-energy tail of this distribution enables carriers to overcome energy barriers, thereby enhancing quantum efficiency--a phenomenon known as photo-thermionic emission (PTE). Despite its importance, the onset and mechanisms of PTE remain under debate. Using real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT), we investigate ultrafast carrier thermalization in two-dimensional materials graphene and PtTe2, and the results reveal distinct differences. In graphene, both electrons and holes thermalize into Fermi-Dirac distributions with good agreement to experiment, while PtTe2 exhibits anomalous high-energy tails for both electrons and holes, deviating significantly from Fermi-Dirac behavior. We attribute this anomaly to differences in orbital coupling between the two materials, from which we derive design principles for identifying optimal PTE candidates and, ultimately, improving photodetector performance.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Leveraged Tight-binding Insights into Inorganic Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to first principles studies like DFT (physically accurate, computationally expensive), the TB approach allows the disentanglement of the region of interest, to wit the fermi level. This allows the creation of simplified, highly interpretable models that give chemically grounded insights. In this paper we employ a Wannierized TB approach to tune the bandgap and electronic structure via anion exchange and investigate its impact on the orbital interactives of inorganic lead halide perovskites. Further adjustment of the hopping norm and maximum distance leads to a reduced TB model which regenerates the broad features of the band structure with a fraction of the parameters, thereby making the model simpler and highly interpretable. We observe that due to the asymmetry of the unit cell and the delocalized nature of its orbitals, CsPbBrI2 follows a many-small hopping scheme different in character from the few-big strategy taken by the other perovskites. Finally we leverage the TB model to study the electronic and thermal transport properties of these materials. These insight enable the identification of optimal doping strategies that could enhance thermoelectric performance by improving carrier mobility or optimizing the Seebeck coefficient.</description>

      <title>Correlation effects in two-dimensional MX_2 and MA_2Z_4 (M= Nb, Ta; X= S, Se, Te; A=Si, Ge; Z=N, P) cold metals: Implications for device applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold metals, characterized by their distinctive band structures, hold promise for innovative electronic devices such as tunnel diodes with negative differential resistance (NDR) effect and field-effect transistors (FETs) with sub-60 mV/dec subthreshold swing (SS). In this study, we employ the GW approximation and HSE06 hybrid functional to investigate the correlation effects on the electronic band structure of two-dimensional (2D) cold metallic materials, specifically focusing on MX_2 and MA_2Z_4 (M=Nb, Ta; X=S, Se, Te; A=Si, Ge; Z= N, P) compounds in 1H structure. These materials exhibit a unique band structure with an isolated metallic band around the Fermi energy, denoted as W_m, as well as two energy gaps: the internal gap E^I_g below the Fermi level and the external gap E^E_g above the Fermi level. These three electronic structure parameters play a decisive role in determining the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of tunnel diodes, the nature of the NDR effect, and the transfer characteristics and SS value of FETs. Our calculations reveal that both GW and HSE06 methods yield consistent electronic structure properties for all studied compounds. We observed a consistent increase in both internal and external band gaps, as well as metallic bandwidths, across all pn-type cold metal systems. Notably, the internal band gap E^I_g exhibits the most substantial enhancement, highlighting the sensitivity of these materials to correlation effects. In contrast, the changes in the metallic bandwidth W_m and external band gap E^E_g are relatively modest. These findings offer valuable insights for designing and optimizing cold metal-based devices. Materials like NbSi_2N_4, NbGe_2N_4, and TaSi_2N_4 show particular promise for high-performance NDR tunnel diodes and sub-60 mV/dec SS FETs.</description>

      <title>Fermi Level and Light Driven Defect Generation in Silicon Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has had a long standing role as a passivating dielectric for c-Si, often utilized in the early development of ICs and more recently for Si solar cells. Although it has been studied for more than 60 years, several questions about the material properties remain open, including light-induced degradation and the Fermi level dependence on the mobility of hydrogen. Here we study the origin of these phenomenon using electronic structure based calculations. First, we use density functional theory (DFT) and the nudged elastic band (NEB) method to examine defect generation via Si-H bond breaking in p-type, intrinsic, and n-type a-Si:H. We find that the energy barrier controlling this defect generation, shows the same asymmetric reduction of $\sim 0.3$ eV for p-type and $\sim 0.1$ eV for n-type, observed in experimental studies. We then develop a model based on the local Coulomb interactions at the transition state, which provides compelling evidence that the asymmetry results from the emergence of a high energy donor state created by the interstitial H. Finally, we repeat our Si-H bond breaking analysis, combining NEB with constrained density functional perturbation theory (c-DFPT) to simulate defect generation dynamics in illuminated a-Si:H. Here we find that e-p pair results in a combined effect that reduces the barrier by $\sim 0.4$, in close agreement with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modelling of Buffer Layers for Advancing CZTSSe Solar Cell Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kesterite is a leading candidate among inorganic thin-film photovoltaic technologies, offering sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions without reliance on critical raw materials. This study investigates the performance of CZTSSe-based kesterite solar cells using SCAPS-1D simulations. Four device configurations are analyzed by integrating the CZTSSe absorber layer with buffer materials, including CdS, SnS2, IGZO, and ZnSe, selected based on their energy band alignment. Moreover, key parameters influencing device efficiency, such as absorber defect density, buffer layer thickness, and the donor and defect densities of the buffer materials, are systematically examined. The thickness of the absorber layer and acceptor density are optimized, considering practical manufacturing constraints. Following optimization, the i-ZnO/SnS2/CZTSSe/Au configuration achieves a notable efficiency of 28.38%, with a VOC of 0.83 V, a JSC of 39.93 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 85.4%. Furthermore, the stability of the optimized structures is evaluated under varying conditions, including resistances, temperature, generation and recombination dynamics, as well as JV and QE characteristics. These findings provide valuable insights for advancing the efficiency and stability of CZTSSe solar cells, contributing to the development of sustainable photovoltaic technologies.</description>

Abstract: The exploration of ultrafast phenomena is a frontier of condensed matter research, where the interplay of theory, computation, and experiment is unveiling new opportunities for understanding and engineering quantum materials. With the advent of advanced experimental techniques and computational tools, it has become possible to probe and manipulate nonequilibrium processes at unprecedented temporal and spatial resolutions, providing insights into the dynamical behavior of matter under extreme conditions. These capabilities have the potential to revolutionize fields ranging from optoelectronics and quantum information to catalysis and energy storage.
  This Roadmap captures the collective progress and vision of leading researchers, addressing challenges and opportunities across key areas of ultrafast science. Contributions in this Roadmap span the development of ab initio methods for time-resolved spectroscopy, the dynamics of driven correlated systems, the engineering of materials in optical cavities, and the adoption of FAIR principles for data sharing and analysis. Together, these efforts highlight the interdisciplinary nature of ultrafast research and its reliance on cutting-edge methodologies, including quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory, correlated electronic structure methods, nonequilibrium Green's function approaches, quantum and ab initio simulations.</description>

      <title>Fatigue-free ferroelectricity in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 ultrathin films via interfacial design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to traits of CMOS compatibility and scalability, HfO2-based ferroelectrics are promising candidates for next-generation memory devices. However, their commercialization has been greatly hindered by reliability issues, with fatigue being a major impediment. We report the fatigue-free behavior in interface-designed Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based heterostructures. A coherent CeO2-x/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 heterointerface is constructed, wherein CeO2-x acts as an oxygen sponge, capable of reversibly accepting and releasing oxygen vacancies. This design effectively alleviates defect aggregation at the electrode-ferroelectric interface, enabling improved switching characteristics. Further, a symmetric capacitor architecture is designed to minimize the imprint, thereby suppressing the cycling-induced oriented defect drift. The two-pronged technique mitigates oxygen-voltammetry-generated chemical/energy fluctuations, suppressing the formation of paraelectric phase and polarization degradation. The design ensures a fatigue-free feature exceeding 10^11 switching cycles and an endurance lifetime surpassing 10^12 cycles for Hf0.5Zr0.5O2-based capacitors, along with excellent temperature stability and retention. These findings pave the way for developing ultra-stable hafnia-based ferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy-Boosted Funnel Learning for Identifying Semiconductors with Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven machine learning (ML) has demonstrated tremendous potential in material property predictions. However, the scarcity of materials data with costly property labels in the vast chemical space presents a significant challenge for ML in efficiently predicting properties and uncovering structure-property relationships. Here, we propose a novel hierarchy-boosted funnel learning (HiBoFL) framework, which is successfully applied to identify semiconductors with ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_\mathrm{L}$). By training on only a few hundred materials targeted by unsupervised learning from a pool of hundreds of thousands, we achieve efficient and interpretable supervised predictions of ultralow $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$, thereby circumventing large-scale brute-force calculations without clear objectives. As a result, we provide a list of candidates with ultralow $\kappa_\mathrm{L}$ for potential thermoelectric applications and discover a new factor that significantly influences structural anharmonicity. This study offers a novel practical pathway for accelerating the discovery of functional materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-breaking induced transition among net-zero-magnetization magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Net-zero-magnetization magnets have garnered intensive research attention due to their ultradense and ultrafast potential. In terms of the symmetric classification of connecting magnetic atoms with opposite spin polarization, the net-zero-magnetization magnets mainly include $PT$-antiferromagnet (the joint symmetry ($PT$) of space inversion symmetry ($P$) and time-reversal symmetry ($T$)), altermagnet and fully-compensated ferrimagnet. Studying transitions among net-zero-magnetization magnets is essentially the research on symmetry breaking, which can also clearly reveal the transformation of spin-splitting symmetry. Symmetry breaking can be achieved through methods such as Janus engineering, isovalent alloying, and external electric field. Here, we start from a parent $PT$-antiferromagnet that simultaneously possesses both $P$ and rotational/mirror symmetries to induce altermagnet and fully-compensated ferrimagnet. Based on first-principles calculations, the proposed transitions can be verified in $PT$-antiferromagnet $\mathrm{CrC_2S_6}$ monolayer. By Janus engineering and isovalent alloying, $\mathrm{CrC_2S_6}$ can change into altermagnetic $\mathrm{CrC_2S_3Se_3}$ and fully-compensated ferrimagnetic $\mathrm{CrMoC_2S_6}$. The $\mathrm{CrC_2S_3Se_3}$ can also become fully-compensated ferrimagnetic $\mathrm{CrMoC_2S_3Se_3}$ by isovalent alloying. Our work provides a clear and intuitive example to explain the transitions among net-zero-magnetization magnets, which can inspire more research on net-zero-magnetization magnets.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent resonant dynamics of stripes and skyrmions in Re/Co/Pt multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic behavior and stabilization of skyrmions in magnetic multilayers are critical for advancing spintronic and magnonic technologies. In our study, we investigate the static and dynamic properties of $[Re/Co(d_{Co})/Pt]_{20}$ multilayers with varying Co thicknesses $(6\text{-}24 \, \text{\r{A}})$, showcasing a transition from out-of-plane to in-plane magnetic anisotropy. Magnetization reversal leads to a transformation from labyrinth domains to skyrmion bubbles due to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI). Using angle-dependent imaging at remanence, we confirm that skyrmions can be stabilized without an external magnetic field at specific polar angles, with the stabilization angle increasing alongside Co thickness. Ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveals four distinct resonant modes, including low-frequency $(2\text{-}18\text{GHz})$, high-frequency $(20\text{-}35 \, \text{GHz})$ modes, depending on the magnetization texture. The frequency range of these modes narrows with decreasing effective anisotropy and iDMI strength decreases in thicker Co layers in perpendicular configurations. Moreover, we observe a decrease in effective Gilbert damping with increasing Co thickness, highlighting the potential for efficient energy dissipation. These findings link between material properties and skyrmion dynamics directly and demonstrate tunable resonant modes for magnonic devices. By addressing both static and dynamic aspects, our work advances the development of next-generation spintronic and magnonic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials emitting circularly polarized light (CPL) are highly sought after for applications ranging from efficient displays to quantum information technologies. Established methods for time-resolved CPL characterization have significant limitations, preventing in-depth photophysical insight necessary for materials development. We have designed and built a high-sensitivity (noise level 10^-4), broadband (ca. 400-900 nm), transient (ns resolution, ms range) full-Stokes (CPL and linear polarizations) spectroscopy setup. We demonstrate its broad applicability by measuring compounds with low dissymmetry factors across various timescales, as well as tracking the temporal evolution of linear polarization components alongside associated CPL artefacts. We have written open-source software and used stock optical components to make transient CPL spectroscopy practically accessible to a wide audience, enabling the study of chiral materials in numerous diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Coupled Oscillators and Dielectric Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized Sellmeier model, also referred to as the Lorentz-Dirac model, has been used for the description of the dielectric function of a number of technologically important materials in the literature. This model represents the frequency-dependent dielectric function as a sum over Green functions of classical damped harmonic oscillators, much in analogy with the functional form used for the dynamic polarizability of an atom, but with one important addition, namely, a complex-valued oscillator strength in the numerator. Here, we show that this generalized functional form can be justified based on the response function of coupled damped oscillators. The encountered analogies suggest an explanation for the generally observed success of the Lorentz--Dirac model in describing the dielectric function of crystals of consummate technological significance.</description>

      <title>Large Anomalous Hall Effect in a Noncoplanar Magnetic Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in magnetic systems and also unexpectedly in non-magnetic materials adjacent to magnetic insulators via the heterointerface interactions. However, the AHE in heterostructures induced by magnetic proximity effect remains quite weak, restricting their practical device applications. Here, we report a large intrinsic AHE with a resistivity of 142 n{\Omega} cm at 5 K in noncoplanar magnetic heterostructures of Cr5Te6/Pt. This is the record-high AHE value among all the magnetic insulators/heavy metal heterostructures. A reversal of the AHE signal occurs due to the reconstruction of Berry curvature at the Fermi surface, which is verified by the first-principles calculations. Topological spin textures at the interface are directly visualized via high-magnetic-field magnetic force microscopy, which accounts for the large AHE, as confirmed by the atomic simulations. These findings open a new avenue for exploring large anomalous Hall response in heterointerfaces and facilitate the potential applications in topological spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Effects of the built-in electric field on free and bound excitons in a polar GaN/AlGaN/GaN based heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-temperature luminescence spectra reveal the presence of two independant populations of GaN excitons within a $\mathrm{GaN/AlGaN/GaN/Al_2O_3}$ heterostructure in which a thick (1.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$) AlGaN layer separates a thin (150 nm) top GaN layer and a thick (3.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$) bottom GaN layer grown on sapphire. The presence of these two spectrally-distinct families of excitons in each GaN layer of the heterostructure is demonstrated using three different experimental methods: (i) low-power $\mathrm{\mu}$-photoluminescence ($\mathrm{\mu PL}$) using laser excitation sources with wavelengths above and below the AlGaN bandgap, (ii) $\mathrm{\mu PL}$ as a function of optically injected free carrier density, and (iii) quantitative numerical simulation of the $\mathrm{\mu}$-Reflectivity ($\mathrm{\mu R}$). One major impact of the built-in electric field is the reduction of the excitonic lifetime in the GaN surface layer, which transitions from less than 10 ps in the presence of the built-in electric field to the bulk lifetime (90 ps) when the field is screened. This increase in the excitonic lifetime is related to the modification of the band structure in the presence of optically injected free carriers. The effect of these lifetime variations on the luminescence spectra is analyzed. Lastly, we provide an estimate of the Mott density in GaN as $n_{\mathrm{Mott}} = 4\times 10^{17}\, \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ at 130 K, consistent with values reported in the literature and accounting for the free carrier density required to screen the electric field.</description>

      <title>Impact of impurities on leakage current induced by High-Energy Density Pulsed Laser Annealing in Si diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For semiconductor device fabrication, Pulsed Laser Annealing (PLA) offers significant advantages over conventional thermal processes. Notably, it can provide ultrafast (~ns) and high temperature profiles ($&gt;1000^\circ$C). When the maximum temperature exceeds the melting point, a solid-liquid phase transition is observed, immediately followed by rapid recrystallization. This unique annealing mechanism gives raises questions about dopant diffusion and residual defects, in not only in the recrystallized region, but also just below it. As power devices require micrometer-sized junctions, high laser energy densities are needed, which were proved to promote the incorporation of complex impurities from the surface and the creation of defects at the liquid/solid interface. This paper reports on the impact of laser annealing at high energy densities (up to 8.0 J/cm$^2$) on the leakage current, using Schottky and PN diodes, and DLTS measurements. Various laser annealing conditions were used: energy densities between 1.7 and 8.0 J/cm$^2$ with 1 to 10 pulses. Our results suggest that the liquid and solid solubility of vacancies in silicon are fixed by the maximum temperature reached, so to the energy density. Increasing the number of laser pulses allows, not only to reach this maximum vacancy concentration but also to promote their diffusion towards the surface. Concomitantly, the in-diffusion of complex impurities inside the melted region allows the coupling between both defect types to create trap centers, responsible for the degradation of the leakage current.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile Magnonics in Bilayer Magnetic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonvolatile control of spin order or spin excitations offers a promising avenue for advancing spintronics; however, practical implementation remains challenging. In this letter, we propose a general framework to realize electrical control of magnons in 2D magnetic insulators. We demonstrate that in bilayer ferromagnetic insulators with strong spin-layer coupling, electric field Ez can effectively manipulate the spin exchange interactions between the layers, enabling nonvolatile control of the corresponding magnons. Notably, in this bilayer, Ez can induce nonzero Berry curvature and orbital moments of magnons, the chirality of which are coupled to the direction of Ez. This coupling facilitates Ez manipulate the corresponding magnon valley and orbital Hall currents. Furthermore, such bilayers can be easily engineered, as demonstrated by our density-functional-theory calculations on Janus bilayer Cr-based ferromagnets. Our work provides an important step toward realizing nonvolatile magnonics and paves a promising way for future magnetoelectric coupling devices.</description>

      <title>From Solution to Surface: Persistence of the Diradical Character of a Diindenoanthracene Derivative on a Metallic Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic diradicals are envisioned as elementary building blocks for designing a new generation of spintronic devices and have been used in constructing prototypical field effect transistors and non-linear optical devices. Open-shell systems, however, are also reactive, thus requiring design strategies to protect their radical character from the environment, especially when they are embedded into solid-state devices. Here, we report the persistence on a metallic surface of the diradical character of a diindeno[b,i]anthracene (DIAn) core protected by bulky end-groups. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on single-molecules detected singlet-triplet excitations that were absent for DIAn species packed in assembled structures. Density functional theory simulations unravel that molecular geometry on the metal substrate can crucially modify the value of the single-triplet gap via the delocalization of the radical sites. The persistence of the diradical character over metallic substrates is a promising finding for integrating radical-based materials in functional devices.</description>

      <title>Theoretical characterization of NV-like defects in 4H-SiC using ADAQ with the SCAN and r2SCAN meta-GGA functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is widely used for screening color centers in semiconductors. While the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is efficient, it often lacks precision in describing defects. The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) functional is more accurate but computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale screening. However, third-rung functionals of "Jacob's ladder" remain largely under explored in this context. This study evaluates the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) family of meta-GGA functionals as potential alternatives to PBE for characterizing NV-like color centers in 4H-SiC using the Automatic Defect Analysis and Qualification (ADAQ) framework. We examine nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, sulfur, and chlorine vacancies in 4H-SiC, focusing on applications in quantum technology. Our results show that SCAN and r2SCAN achieve greater accuracy than PBE, approaching HSE's precision at a lower computational cost. This suggests that the SCAN family offers a practical improvement for screening new color centers, with computational demands similar to PBE.</description>

      <title>Million-atom simulation of the set process in phase change memories at the real device scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase change materials are exploited in several enabling technologies such as storage class memories, neuromorphic devices and memories embedded in microcontrollers. A key functional property for these applications is the fast crystal nucleation and growth in the supercool liquid phase. Over the last decade, atomistic simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) have provided crucial insights on the early stage of this process. These simulations are, however, restricted to a few hundred atoms for at most a few ns. More recently, the scope of the DFT simulations have been greatly extended by leveraging on machine learning techniques. In this paper, we show that the exploitation of a recently devised neural network potential for the prototypical phase change compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$, allows simulating the crystallization process in a multimillion atom model at the length and time scales of the real memory devices. The simulations provide a vivid atomistic picture of the subtle interplay between crystal nucleation and crystal growth from the crystal/amorphous rim. Moreover, the simulations have allowed quantifying the distribution of point defects controlling electronic transport, in a very large crystallite grown at the real conditions of the set process of the device.</description>

      <title>Correlation stabilized ferromagnetic MnRuAs with distorted kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of MnRuAs, a compound crystallizing in the P$\bar{6}$2m symmetry with a distorted kagome lattice, revealing its distinctive structural, magnetic, and electronic properties through state-of-the-art ab initio calculations. By incorporating strong correlation effects using the DFT+U approach, we demonstrate the stabilization of MnRuAs, transforming its inherent dynamical instability into a robust ferromagnetic state with significant coupling along the $c$ axis. The calculated magnon dispersion reveals a parabolic profile with a minimum at the $\Gamma$ point, indicative of ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, MnRuAs exhibits intriguing electronic properties, including quasi-one-dimensional Fermi surface and the formation of nodal sphere. Our study also delves into the electronic surface states and constant energy contours, offering valuable insights into the complex physics of this material.</description>

      <title>On the role of Electronic Doorway States in the Secondary Electron Emission from Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of secondary low-energy electron emission from graphene and graphite. By applying a coincidence detection of the primary scattered and an emitted secondary electron, we disentangle specific features otherwise hidden in the essentially featureless secondary electron spectrum. Hand-in-hand with density functional theory calculations, we show that this slow electron emission is governed not only by the density of states in the occupied and unoccupied band structure but is also modulated by the coupling of levels above the vacuum energy to free-vacuum states. This implies electronic doorway states which facilitate efficient propagation of electrons from the solid to vacuum, some of which only open for samples with more than 5 layers.</description>

      <title>Mechanics and Design of Metastructured Auxetic Patches with Bio-inspired Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastructured auxetic patches, characterized by negative Poisson's ratios, offer unique mechanical properties that closely resemble the behavior of human tissues and organs. As a result, these patches have gained significant attention for their potential applications in organ repair and tissue regeneration. This study focuses on neural networks-based computational modeling of auxetic patches with a sinusoidal metastructure fabricated from silk fibroin, a bio-inspired material known for its biocompatibility and strength. The primary objective of this research is to introduce a novel, data-driven framework for patch design. To achieve this, we conducted experimental fabrication and mechanical testing to determine material properties and validate the corresponding finite element models. Finite element simulations were then employed to generate the necessary data, while greedy sampling, an active learning technique, was utilized to reduce the computational cost associated with data labeling. Two neural networks were trained to accurately predict Poisson's ratios and stresses for strains up to 15\%, respectively. Both models achieved $R^2$ scores exceeding 0.995, which indicates highly reliable predictions. Building on this, we developed a neural network-based design model capable of tailoring patch designs to achieve specific mechanical properties. This model demonstrated superior performance when compared to traditional optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, by providing more efficient and precise design solutions. The proposed framework represents a significant advancement in the design of bio-inspired metastructures for medical applications, paving the way for future innovations in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new physics-based model for analytical calculation of Soft Error Rate (SER) in digital memory circuits under the influence of heavy ions in space orbits is proposed. This method is based on parameters that are uniquely determined from the results of ground tests under nor-mal ion incidence. It is shown that preliminary averaging over the total solid angle within the standard inverse cosine model allows one to take into account the effect of isotropic flow, which increases the effective SER. The model includes the ability to estimate the contribution to SER of the low LET spectrum region, which is very important for modern ICs with low Single Event Upset tolerance.</description>

      <title>High-pressure growth effect on the properties of high-Tc iron-based superconductors: A short review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-pressure growth technique is a vital approach that facilitates the stabilization of new phases and allows for meticulous control of structural parameters, which significantly impact electronic and magnetic properties. We present a short review of our ongoing investigations into various families of iron-based superconductors (IBS), employing the high-gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method. This technique is capable of producing the gas pressures up to 1.8 GPa and a heating temperature of up to 1700 {\deg}C through a three-zone furnace within a cylindrical chamber. Different kinds of IBS samples are prepared using HPHTS and characterized through various measurements to reach the final conclusions. The results demonstrate that the high-pressure growth technique significantly enhances the properties of IBS, including the transition temperature, critical current density, and pinning force. In addition, the quality of the samples and their density are improved through the intergrain connections. Furthermore, the comprehensive evaluations and investigations prove that a growth pressure of 0.5 GPa is sufficient for producing high-quality IBS bulks under the optimized synthesis conditions.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Basis for Classifying Hyperuniform States of Two-Component Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform states of matter exhibit unusual suppression of density fluctuations at large scales, contrasting sharply with typical disordered configurations. Various types of hyperuniformity emerge in multicomponent disordered systems, significantly enhancing their functional properties for advanced applications. This paper focuses on developing a theoretical framework for two-component hyperuniform systems. We provide a robust theoretical basis to identify novel conditions on structure factors for a variety of hyperuniform binary mixtures, classifying them into five distinct types with seven unique states. Our findings also offer valuable guidelines for designing multihyperuniform materials where each component preserves hyperuniformity, added to the overall hyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>A plastic damage model with mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening for low-cycle fatigue in 7020 aluminum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper at hand presents an in-depth investigation into the fatigue behavior of the high-strength aluminum alloy EN AW-7020 T6 using both experimental and numerical approaches. Two types of specimens are investigated: a dog-bone specimen subjected to cyclic loading in a symmetric strain-controlled regime, and a compact tension specimen subjected to repeated loading and unloading, which leads to damage growth from the notch tip. Experimental data from these tests are used to identify the different phases of fatigue. Subsequently, a plastic-damage model is developed, incorporating J2 plasticity with Chaboche-type mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening. A detailed investigation reveals that the Chaboche model must be blended with a suitable isotropic hardening and combined with a proper damage growth model to accurately describe cyclic fatigue including large plastic strains up to failure. Multiple back-stress components with independent properties are superimposed, and exponential isotropic hardening with saturation effects is introduced to improve alignment with experimental results. For damage, different stress splits are tested, with the deviatoric/volumetric split proving successful in reproducing the desired degradation in peak stress and stiffness. A nonlinear activation function is introduced to ensure smooth transitions between tension and compression. Two damage indices, one for the deviatoric part and one for the volumetric part, are defined, each of which is governed by a distinct trilinear damage growth function. The governing differential equation of the problem is regularized by higher-order gradient terms to address the ill-posedness induced by softening. Finally, the plasticity model is calibrated using finite element simulations of the dog-bone test and subsequently applied to the cyclic loading of the compact tension specimen.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Molecular Weight Dependence Reveals the Origin of Mechanical Enhancement in Polymer Nanocomposite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers at the interface exhibit frustrated chain conformation distinct from the bulk, impacting particle dispersion and properties of polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). Utilizing bimodal molecular weight (MW) PNCs, we observed unusual chain elongation of interfacial polymers, which promotes networked structures at low particle loadings. Paradoxically, reducing the average MW in bimodal PNCs significantly enhances the shear modulus by up to 103 times, challenging the conventional preference for higher MW in property enhancement. The mechanical reinforcement, aided by stretched chains, manifests when the short chain is substantially shorter than the long chain (Rg ratio &gt;~2), indicating a universal stretching factor of 2.3.</description>

      <title>Switching Graphitic Polytypes in Elastically Coupled Islands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals polytypes are commensurate configurations of two-dimensional layers with discrete crystalline symmetries and distinct stacking-dependent properties. In graphitic polytypes, the different stacking arrangements of graphene sheets exhibit rich electronic phases, such as intrinsic electric polarizations, orbital magnetizations, superconductivity, and anomalous fractional Hall states. Switching between these metastable periodic configurations by controlling interlayer shifts unlocks intriguing multiferroic responses. Here, we report super-lubricant arrays of polytypes (SLAP) devices, with nanometer-scale islands of Bernal polytypes that switch into Rhombohedral crystals and vice versa under a shear force as low as 6 nano-Newtons. We assemble these four-layer SLAP structures by aligning a pair of graphene bilayers above and under circular cavities in a misaligned spacer layer. Using local current measurements, we detect the shifts between the active bilayers and reveal long-range elastic relaxations outside the cavities that enable efficient nucleation and spontaneous sliding of stacking dislocation inside the islands. We demonstrate configurable, deterministic, and robust polytype switching by confining these boundary strips in narrow cavity channels that connect the islands. Such controlled switching between elastically-coupled single-crystalline islands is appealing for novel multiferroic SlideTronic applications.</description>

      <title>Comparison of NiFeCr and NiFe in ferromagnetic Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. Some memory applications rely on the ability to reverse the magnetization direction of a "soft" magnetic layer within the junction using a small local magnetic field generated on the chip. It is crucial, therefore, to find a suitable soft magnetic material with a low switching field and low switching energy. A popular magnetic material for such applications is Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$, also known as Permalloy, however Permalloy has a rather large magnetization, leading to large magnetic switching energies. In this work we explore Cr-doped Permalloy, specifically Ni$_{73}$Fe$_{18}$Cr$_{9}$, which has a saturation magnetization just under two-thirds that of Permalloy. Josephson junctions containing this NiFeCr alloy undergo a 0-$\pi$ transition at a NiFeCr thickness of 2.3 nm, and the critical supercurrent decays in the alloy over a short characteristic length of 0.36 nm. Switching fields of a few millitesla are promising, but the short decay length and overall small values of the critical current in the Josephson junctions may preclude the use of NiFeCr in current cryogenic memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Striped twisted state in the orientational epitaxy on quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal "twisted" geometry of a crystalline layer on a crystal is long known, but that on a quasicrystal is still unknown and open. We predict analytically that the layer equilibrium configuration will generally exhibit a nonzero misfit angle. The theory perfectly agrees with numerical optimization of a colloid monolayer on a quasiperiodic decagonal optical lattice. Strikingly different from crystal-on-crystal epitaxy, the structure of the novel emerging twisted state exhibits an unexpected stripe pattern. Its high anisotropy should reflect on the tribomechanical properties of this unconventional interface.</description>

      <title>On the origin of heating-induced stiffening and enthalpic reinforcement in elastomeric nanocomposites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite a century of use, the mechanism of nanoparticle-driven mechanical reinforcement of elastomers is unresolved. A major hypothesis attributes it to glassy interparticle bridges, supported by an observed inversion of the variation of the modulus E(T) on heating -- from entropic stiffening in elastomers to enthalpic softening in nanocomposites. Here, molecular simulations reveal that this instead arises from a bulk-modulus mediated competition between elastomer and nanoparticulate networks over preferred nonequilibrium densities under deformation. A theory accounting for softening of the bulk modulus on heating quantitatively predicts the simulated E(T) inversion, suggesting that reinforcement is driven by a volume-competition mechanism unique to co-continuous systems of soft and rigid networks.</description>

      <title>Observation of magnetic skyrmion lattice in Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge by small-angle neutron scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incommensurate magnetic phases in chiral cubic crystals are an established source of topological spin textures such as skyrmion and hedgehog lattices, with potential applications in spintronics and information storage. We report a comprehensive small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) study on the $B20$-type chiral magnet Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge, exploring its magnetic phase diagram and confirming the stabilization of a skyrmion lattice under low magnetic fields. Our results reveal a helical ground state with a decreasing pitch from 40 nm to 35 nm upon cooling, and a skyrmion phase stable in applied magnetic fields of 10-30 mT, and over an unusually wide temperature range for chiral magnets of 6 K ($\sim T_\textrm{C}/2 &lt; T &lt; T_\textrm{C}$, $T_\textrm{C}=13$ K). The skyrmion lattice forms a standard two-dimensional hexagonal coordination that can be trained into a single domain, distinguishing it from the three-dimensional hedgehog lattice observed in MnGe-based systems. Additionally, we demonstrate the persistence of a metastable SkL at 2 K, even at zero field. These findings advance our understanding of magnetic textures in Cr-based $B20$ compounds, highlighting Cr$_{0.82}$Mn$_{0.18}$Ge~as a promising material for further exploration in topological magnetism.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial thin films of pyrochlore iridates: a forward looking approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum materials that show strongly correlated electrons as well as topological order, for which spin-orbit coupling is a key ingredient, exhibit novel states of matter. One such example is the family of pyrochlore iridates, featuring strong spin-orbital coupling, strong electron interactions as well as geometric frustration, making them an ideal platform to study novel topological phases. High-quality epitaxial pyrochlore iridate films, although challenging to produce, provide a pathway to explore unconventional behaviours and unravel the intrinsic properties of these largely unexplored materials. Additionally, designing interfaces with specific properties is crucial to create multilayered devices that can achieve significant technological breakthroughs using topological states of these materials. This article reviews experimental work on epitaxial pyrochlore iridate thin films, discussing evidence of topological phases found in them. Future research directions are outlined, which include exploring the rich tunability offered by chemical doping, especially when combined with the design of epitaxial heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Competing Effects of Local Solvation Structures on Chemical Shift Changes of Liquid Electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal charge transport in polar Dirac metals with tunable spin-valley coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal charge transport in solids, where resistance is different between rightward and leftward currents, is a key function of rectifying devices in the modern electronics, as exemplified by $p$-$n$ semiconductor junctions. Recently, this was also demonstrated in noncentrosymmetric materials in magnetic fields, since their band structure exhibits spin polarization coupled to the position of momentum space due to the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling. To enhance the magnitude of nonreciprocal effect, it is essential to tune such spin-momentum coupling, which has been hampered in the conventional materials owing to the difficulty in controlling the broken inversion symmetry built into the lattice and interfacial structures. Here we report large nonreciprocal resistivity in layered polar metal BaMn$X_2$ ($X$=Sb, Bi), where the spin-polarized Dirac dispersion depends on the in-plane polarization tunable by chemical substitution of the $X$ site. For $X$=Sb with a pair of single-type valleys, the nonreciprocal resistivity increases monotonically with decreasing temperature, while for $X$=Bi with multiple types of valleys it is reduced by about an order of magnitude and exhibits a peak at a low temperature. Theoretical calculations indicate that the nonreciprocal resistivity is sensitive not only to the spin-momentum (spin-valley) coupling, but also to the Fermi energy and the Dirac dispersion. The observed significant variation of nonreciprocal transport in the same series of materials might be of great use in the design of junction-free rectifying devices and circuits.</description>

Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) present new possibilities for designing novel electronic devices. An efficient contacting scheme is required to take advantage of exceptional opto-electronic properties of TMDCs in future electronic devices. This is however challenging for TMDCs, mostly due to the typically high Schottky barrier formed between a metal and a semiconductor. Here we investigate different approaches for contacting MoS$_{2}$, utilizing both metallic gold and semimetallic bismuth as contact materials. The collected I-V characteristics of Bi-contacted devices are compared with the performance of traditional gold contacts. The method of AFM ironing, which we used to enhance the parameters of gold contacts, is also described. Additionally, we show preliminary results regarding an optical response for both types of samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cluster magnetic multipoles are order parameters that describe the symmetry of spin arrangements in magnetic materials. High-order multipoles are particularly important in non-collinear antiferromagnets, where they determine key physical properties such as the anomalous Hall effect and the magneto-optical Kerr effect. Although non-uniform multipole states have been observed at the micrometer scale, their mesoscopic properties remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a general micromagnetic formalism for cluster magnetic multipoles, enabling the study of the spin dynamics in non-uniform multipole systems. As an example, we apply this formalism to investigate magnetic-octupole domain-wall dynamics in the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. Our results capture key features of domain-wall motion, including deformation and the emergence of effective inertial mass. This study provides a general framework for studying the dynamics of high-order cluster magnetic multipoles, which is essential for determining the mesoscopic physical properties of non-collinear magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epitaxial growth of \k{appa}-phase Ga2O3 thin films are investigated on c-plane sapphire, GaN- and AlNon-sapphire, and (100) oriented yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The structural and surface morphological properties are investigated by comprehensive material characterization. Phase pure \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films are successfully grown on GaN-, AlN-on sapphire, and YSZ substrates through a systematical tuning of the growth parameters including the precursor molar flow rates, chamber pressure and growth temperature, whereas the growth on c-sapphire substrates leads to a mixture of \b{eta}- and \k{appa}polymorphs of Ga2O3 under the investigated growth conditions. The influence of the crystalline structure, surface morphology and roughness of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films grown on different substrates are investigated as a function of precursor flow rate. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) imaging of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 films reveals abrupt interfaces between the epitaxial film and the sapphire, GaN and YSZ substrates. The growth of single crystal orthorhombic \k{appa}Ga2O3 films is confirmed by analyzing the STEM nano-diffraction pattern. The chemical composition, surface stoichiometry, and the bandgap energies of \k{appa}-Ga2O3 thin films grown on different substrates are studied by high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. The type-II (staggered) band alignments at three interfaces between \k{appa}-Ga2O3 and c-sapphire, AlN, and YSZ substrates are determined by XPS, with the exception of \k{appa}-Ga2O3/GaN interface, which shows type I (straddling) band alignment.</description>

Abstract: The in-situ metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth of Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films is investigated as a function of crystal orientations and Al compositions of $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films. The interface and film qualities of Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics are evaluated by high resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) imaging, which indicate the growth of high quality amorphous Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics with abrupt interfaces on (010), (100) and (-201) oriented $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films. The surface stoichiometries of Al$_2$O$_3$ deposited on all orientations of $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ are found to be well maintained with a bandgap energy of 6.91 eV as evaluated by high resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which is consistent with the atomic layer deposited (ALD) Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics. The evolution of band offsets at both in-situ MOCVD and ex-situ ALD deposited Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ are determined as a function of Al composition, indicating the influence of the deposition method, orientation, and Al composition of $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films on resulting band alignments. Type II band alignments are determined at the MOCVD grown Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ interfaces for (010) and (100) orientations, whereas type I band alignments with relatively lower conduction band offsets are observed along (-201) orientation. Results from this work revealed that the in-situ MOCVD deposited high quality Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics with sharp interfaces can be considered as a viable alternative of commonly used ex-situ deposited (ALD) Al$_2$O$_3$ for developing high performance $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ based devices.</description>

      <title>Detecting charge transfer at defects in 2D materials with electron ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04469v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic charge transfer at the atomic scale can reveal fundamental information about chemical bonding, but is far more challenging to directly image than the atomic structure. The charge density is dominated by the atomic nuclei, with bonding causing only a small perturbation. Thus detecting any change due to bonding requires a higher level of sensitivity than imaging structure and the overall charge density. Here we achieve the sensitivity required to detect charge transfer in both pristine and defected monolayer WS\textsubscript{2} using the high dose efficiency of electron ptychography and its ability to correct for lens aberrations. Excellent agreement is achieved with first-principles image simulations including where thermal diffuse scattering is explicitly modeled via finite-temperature molecular dynamics based on density functional theory. The focused-probe ptychography configuration we use also provides the important ability to concurrently collect the annular dark-field signal, which can be unambiguously interpreted in terms of the atomic structure and chemical identity of the atoms, independently of the charge transfer. Our results demonstrate both the power of ptychographic reconstructions and the importance of quantitatively accurate simulations to aid their interpretation.</description>

      <title>Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition of \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 thin films on (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase pure \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 thin films are grown on (001) oriented \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). By systematically tuning the precursor molar flow rates, the epitaxial growth of coherently strained \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films are demonstrated with up to 25% Al compositions as evaluated by high resolution x-ray diffraction (XRD). The asymmetrical reciprocal space mapping confirms the growth of coherent \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films (x &lt; 25%) on (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates. While the films show smooth surface morphologies, the alloy inhomogeneity with local segregation of Al along (-201) plane is observed from atomic resolution STEM imaging, resulting in wavy and inhomogeneous interfaces in \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 superlattice structure. Room temperature Raman spectra of \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films show similar characteristics peaks as (001) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrate without obvious Raman shifts for films with different Al compositions. Atom probe tomography (APT) was used to investigate the atomic level structural chemistry with increasing Al content in the \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3 films. A monotonous increase in chemical heterogeneity is observed from the in-plane Al/Ga distributions which was further confirmed via statistical frequency distribution analysis (FDA). Although the films exhibit alloy fluctuations, n-type doping with good electrical properties are demonstrated for films with various Al compositions. The determined valence and conduction band offsets at \b{eta}-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunctions using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveal the formation of type-II (staggered) band alignment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unique zero thermal expansion (ZTE) materials are valuable for use in precision instruments, including electronics, aerospace parts, and engines. However, most ZTE materials have a temperature range less than 1000 K under which they do not expand. In this study, we present a uniaxial ZTE in the low-cost Mn2OBO3 with a thermal expansion coefficient of $\alpha$= -4(1)$\times$10^(-7) K-1 along the X1 principal axis from 3.5 to 1250 K. The monoclinic structure of Mn2OBO3 remains stable over the entire temperature range in ambient conditions. Considerable thermal contraction on the BO3 trigonal planar and thermal expansion on the MnO6 octahedra combine to produce uniaxial ZTE. Temperature-dependent Raman scattering reveals anharmonic low-frequency modes associated with MnO6 Rigid Unit Modes (RUMs), which likely play a critical role in driving thermal contraction in the BO3 trigonal planar. No charge order-disorder transition, which could cause thermal contraction, was observed up to 1250 K.</description>

      <title>Design of 2D Skyrmionic Metamaterial Through Controlled Assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions, a significant challenge remains in crafting nontrivial high-order skyrmionic textures with varying, or even tailor-made, topologies. We address this challenge, by focusing on a construction pathway of skyrmionic metamaterials within a monolayer thin film and suggest several skyrmionic metamaterials that are surprisingly stable, i.e., long-lived, due to a self-stabilization mechanism. This makes these new textures promising for applications. Central to our approach is the concept of 'simulated controlled assembly', in short, a protocol inspired by 'click chemistry' that allows for positioning topological magnetic structures where one likes, and then allowing for energy minimization to elucidate the stability. Utilizing high-throughput atomistic-spin-dynamic simulations alongside state-of-the-art AI-driven tools, we have isolated skyrmions (topological charge Q=1), antiskyrmions (Q=-1), and skyrmionium (Q=0). These entities serve as foundational 'skyrmionic building blocks' to form the here reported intricate textures. In this work, two key contributions are introduced to the field of skyrmionic systems. First, we present a a novel combination of atomistic spin dynamics simulations and controlled assembly protocols for the stabilization and investigation of new topological magnets. Second, using the aforementioned methods we report on the discovery of skyrmionic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Room temperature quantum emitters in van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum emitters in solid-state materials are highly promising building blocks for quantum information processing and communication science. Recently, single-photon emission from van der Waals materials has been reported in transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, exhibiting the potential to realize photonic quantum technologies in two-dimensional materials. Here, we report the generation of room temperature single-photon emission from exfoliated and thermally annealed single crystals of van der Waals {\alpha}-MoO3. The second-order correlation function measurement displays a clear photon antibunching, while the luminescence intensity exceeds 0.4 Mcts/s and remains stable under laser excitation. The theoretical calculation suggests that an oxygen vacancy defect is a possible candidate for the observed emitters. Together with photostability and brightness, quantum emitters in {\alpha}-MoO3 provide a new avenue to realize photon-based quantum information science in van der Waals materials.</description>

      <title>Toward thermoelectric characterization of (nano)materials by in situ transmission electron microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility to perform an in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) thermoelectric characterization of materials. A differential heating element on a custom in-situ TEM microchip allows to generate a temperature gradient across the studied materials, which are simultaneously measured electrically. A thermovoltage was induced in all studied devices, whose sign corresponds to the sign of the Seebeck coefficient of the tested materials. The results indicate that in-situ thermoelectric TEM studies can help to profoundly understand fundamental aspects of thermoelectricity, which is exemplary demonstrated by tracking the thermovoltage during in-situ crystallization of an amorphous Ge thin film. We propose an improved in-situ TEM microchip design, which should facilitate a full quantitative measurement of the induced temperature gradient, the electrical and thermal conductivities, as well as the Seebeck coefficient. The benefit of the in-situ approach is the possibility to directly correlate the thermoelectric properties with the structure and chemical composition of the entire studied device down to the atomic level, including grain boundaries, dopants or crystal defects, and to trace its dynamic evolution upon heating or during the application of electrical currents</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the critical role of buffer layers in enhancing the efficiency of thin-film CdTe solar cells. We explore non-toxic buffer materials, specifically ZnSe, ZnMgO, 3C-SiC, and WS2, as potential replacements for the traditional Cd-based CdS buffer layer. Our analysis includes a thorough evaluation of the electrical and optical performance of these buffer materials in conjunction with CdTe absorbers. We optimize the thickness of both the buffer and absorber layers to achieve the best performance. Additionally, we examine the impact of defect density variations in the buffer materials and their corresponding temperature effects. Among the tested materials, ZnSe and ZnMgO demonstrate the highest potential, achieving power conversion efficiencies of 20.74% and 20.73%, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism exhibits zero net magnetization and spin-splitting electronic structure. The interplay between altermagnetism and topological physics becomes an important topic in the condensed matter physics. In this letter, we propose that the altermagnet Ce4Sb3 hosts Dirac fermions through first-principles calculations and tight-binding model analysis. When subjected to external magnetic field, the altermagnet Ce4Sb3 change from altermagnetic state to ferromagnetic state. Accompanied with magnetic order transition, the four-fold degenerate Dirac points are transited into sextuple degenerate points. Especially, spin-orbital coupling effect has little influence about the Dirac fermions. The topological phases in the altermagnetic state may hold the exotic spin-splitter torque and remarkable nonlinear transport effect. Our work paves the way for exploring the interplay between altermagnetism and non-trivial topological phase.</description>

      <title>Sub-cycle Nanotip Field Emission of Electrons Driven by Air Plasma Generated THz Pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz pulses generated by two-color laser plasmas have reported peak field strengths exceeding MV/cm, and when illuminating metal nanotips the near-field enhancement at the tip apex should result in extremely high bunch charges and electron energies via sub-cycle cold field emission. Here, electron emission from tungsten nanotips driven by THz pulses generated by a long filament air-plasma are reported. Electron energies up to 1.1 keV and bunch charges up to 2x$10^5$ electrons per pulse were detected, well below values expected for peak field calculated via the time averaged Poynting vector. Investigations revealed a failure in the use of the time-averaged Poynting vector when applied to long filament THz pulses, due to spatio-temporal restructuring of the THz pulse in the focus. Accounting for this restructuring significantly reduces the field strength to approximately 160 ~kV/cm, consistent with the observed electron bunch charges, peak energies and their dependence on the tip position in the THz focus. Despite these findings, our results surpass previous THz plasma-driven electron generation by an order of magnitude in both electron energy and bunch charge and a path to increasing these by an additional order of magnitude by modification of the THz optics is proposed.</description>

      <title>Effect of Biaxial Strain on Cation Octahedral Rotations and Magnetic Structure of the Antiperovskite Mn$_{3}$GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density functional theory is used to study the effect of compressive and tensile biaxial strain on Mn$_{3}$GaN. Mn$_{3}$GaN is a non-collinear antiferromagnetic antiperovskite with a similar structure to that of an ideal cubic oxide perovskite, but with cations at the octahedral sites while the anion, nitrogen, is found at the B site. The present study explores the response of Mn$_{3}$GaN to (001) strain, considering biaxial strain levels ranging from -5% to 5%. It is found that the electron structure is insensitive to tensile strain. The study supports previous results in that a spin-canted antiferromagnetic order emerges due to tensile strain, inducing net magnetization. Compressive strain collapses the non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin structure and induces a ferrimagnetic order at -2% strain. Notably, in contrast with oxide perovskites, Mn$_{3}$GaN does not respond to strain by octahedral tilt, but rather by intraband redistributions of charge between Mn $d$ states. Despite the similar structure to oxide perovskites, the bonds between the B site anion and octahedral site cations in Mn$_{3}$GaN bonds are less rigid, such that strain is instead accommodated by a change in bond length rather than a change in bond angles.</description>

Abstract: Ice nucleation and growth are critical in many fields, including atmospheric science, cryobiology, and aviation. However, understanding the detailed mechanisms of ice crystal growth remains challenging. In this work, crystallization at the ice/quasi-liquid layer (QLL) interface of the basal and primary prism (prism1) surfaces of hexagonal ice (Ih) was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations across a wide range of temperatures for the TIP4P/Ice model, with comparisons to the mW coarse-grained model. Together with elucidating the temperature-dependent mechanisms of crystallization, face-specific growth rates were systematically estimated. While the prism surface generally exhibits faster growth rates than the basal surface, a temperature-dependent crossover in growth rates between the basal and prism surfaces is observed in TIP4P/Ice simulations, which correlates with crossovers in QLL thickness and properties and with the well-known column to platelets transition in ice-crystal habits at low vapor pressure. This observation helps decode the complex dependence between crystal morphology and temperature in ice crystals.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Bandgap in Nano-Scale Graphite: A Computational and Experimental Study</title>

Abstract: Bandgaps in layered materials are critical for enabling functionalities such as tunable photodetection, efficient energy conversion, and nonlinear optical responses, which are essential for next-generation photonic and quantum devices. Gap engineering could form heterostructures with complementary materials like transition metal dichalcogenides or perovskites for multi-functional devices. Graphite, conventionally regarded as a gapless material, exhibits a bandgap of ~100 meV in nano-scale patterned highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), as revealed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and Raman measurements. Our state-of-the-art calculations, incorporating photoemission matrix element effects, predict this bandgap with remarkable accuracy and attribute it to mechanical distortions introduced during patterning. This work bridges theory and experiment, providing the direct evidence of a tunable bandgap in HOPG. Beyond its fundamental significance, this finding opens new possibilities for designing materials with tailored electronic properties, enabling advancements in terahertz devices and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>$\mu$SR evidence of a marked exchange interaction effect on the local spin dynamics of Tb-based molecular nanomagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the spin dynamics of two Terbium-based molecular nanomagnets, Tb-SQ and Tb-Trp, investigated by means of longitudinal muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements as a function of applied field, flanked by AC susceptibility characterization. In the two molecules Tb(III) magnetic ion has an isotructural coordination sphere, but in the former the Tb(III) is coordinated by an organic paramagnetic ligand (SQ), while the latter is coordinated by a diamagnetic one (Trp). Thus Tb-SQ presents an exchange interaction between the Tb(III) ion and a radical while Tb-Trp does not. Both the samples exhibit a muon spin-lattice relaxation rate $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ peak in the temperature range 10-25 K at all applied longitudinal magnetic fields $B_L = 50, 150, 300$ mT. In Tb-SQ, $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ displays a BPP-like behavior led by three different correlations times: the first, dominating for $T\geq15K$, follows a thermally activated law $\tau_c =\tau_0 \exp(\sigma_A / k_B T)$ with energy barrier $\sigma_A/k_B$, while the second and third ones, dominating respectively for $8&lt;T&lt;15$ K and $T&lt;8$ K, follow a power-law-like behavior $\tau_c = c_0 T^{-\alpha}$ with two different values of $c_0$ and $\alpha$. On the other hand, the temperature and field behavior of $\lambda_1(T, B_L)$ in Tb-Trp strongly deviates from a BPP law, displaying a strongly anomalous character. Our results indicate that, in the absence of an exchange interaction and maintaining all the other relevant interactions constants, the local spin dynamics of single ion magnets strongly differ from the one observed in the presence of such interaction. The combination of $\mu$SR and AC susceptibility allows us to disentangle the different Orbach, Raman and direct mechanisms which are the key ingredients that control the spin dynamics in Tb-SQ, and evidence the potentiality of $\mu$SR in elucidating complex spin dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigated the growth of Si-doped $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films using LPCVD system, achieving high electron mobilities of 162 cm$^2$/V.s and 149 cm$^2$/V.s at carrier concentrations of $1.51 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively, for homoepitaxial (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates and heteroepitaxial (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films grown on off-axis c-sapphire substrates with 6{\deg} miscut, representing the highest mobilities reported for LPCVD-grown $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ materials. Carrier concentrations were precisely tuned by varying SiCl$_4$ flow rates at a growth temperature of 1000{\deg}C, resulting in concentrations ranging from $1.15 \times 10^{17}$ to $1.19 \times 10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$, as confirmed by both Hall and C-V measurements. The films exhibited high crystalline quality, confirmed by high-resolution XRD and Raman spectroscopy, indicating phase purity and structural integrity. Surface morphologies characterized by FESEM and AFM imaging showed a strong correlation between carrier concentrations and surface smoothness, with lower concentrations resulting in reduced RMS roughness. SIMS analysis revealed uniform Si incorporation, with low carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine impurities below detection limits, indicating high purity of the films. A high low-temperature peak mobility exceeding 843 cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s was achieved for (-201) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films at 80 K, highlighting the high purity and low compensation of these films. These findings emphasize the potential of LPCVD growth system for producing high-purity $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films with thickness ranging between ~2.3-11.7 $\mu$m and faster growth rates (~4.7-17 $\mu$m/hr), promising transport properties, controllable doping, and scalability for developing high power vertical devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the electronic structure and bonding properties of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory calculations. Through the analysis of band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics of various MX$_2$ compounds, the electronic properties and chemical bonding features are comprehensively examined. The findings demonstrate that charge transfer plays a critical role in electron mass fluctuation, with the incorporation of topological geometric analysis confirming the influence of mass changes on atomic bonding and electronic states. Furthermore, Heterojunctions between distinct atomic layers are shown to effectively modulate the band gap of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing the application of these materials.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic favourability of 1T phase over 1H phase in group III metal monochalcogenide zigzag nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owing to the promising optoelectric and thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) group III-VI materials (MXs), their nanoribbons (NRs) have attracted notable attention as an emerging class of quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) nanostructures. Due to the fact that the most stable 2D monolayer polymorph of MXs is the 1H phase, to date, existing studies in the literature have predominantly focused on the NRs formed from 1H phase MXs. Nevertheless, NRs of the 1T phase have received little to no attention. Employing ab initio simulations based on density functional theory, we systematically compared the thermodynamic stability of hydrogen passivated and unpassivated 1T and 1H ZNRs of GaS, GaSe, and InSe. Our results reveal that 1T phase MX ZNRs are thermodynamically favorable at widths up to 34 nm, a range that is realizable through contemporary experimental fabrication techniques. Furthermore, unlike metallic 1H ZNRs, 1T ZNRs remain semiconductor and retain a Mexican-hat-shaped top valence band without any built-in potential between the edges. Complementarily, hydrogenation energies of 1T InSe ZNRs are positive, and due to the edge-localized states, the 1T unpassivated ZNRs possess nearly flat top valence bands. Our findings serve as a compass for subsequent synthesis pathways of group III-VI NRs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the interatomic bonding and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for preparing high-performance 2D semiconductor materials. We have calculated the band structure, electronic properties, and bonding characteristics of SnO in 2D materials by using density functional theory (DFT) and combining bond energy and bond charge models. Atomic bonding analysis enables us to deeply and meticulously analyze the interatomic bonding and charge transfer in the layered structure of SnO. This study greatly enhances our understanding of the local bonding state on the surface of 2D structural materials. In addition, we use the renormalization method to operate energy to determine the wave function at different quantum resolutions. This is of great significance for describing the size and phase transition of nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the temperature-dependent spin-polarized electron transport in iron via spin-wave Doppler shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An electric current flowing in a ferromagnetic metal carries spin angular momentum, i.e. it is spin-polarized. Here, we measure the spin-wave Doppler shift induced by the transfer of angular momentum from the diffusive spin-polarized electric current onto coherent spin waves in epitaxial MgO/Fe/MgO thin films. We follow this Doppler shift as function of the temperature and determine that the degree of spin-polarization of the current increases from 77$\%$ to 86$\%$ when cooling the device from 303K down to 10K. Interpreting these measurements within the two-current model, we separate the contributions from electron-surface, electron-phonon and electron-magnon scatterings to the spin-dependent resistivity of Fe.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the longitudinal exciton dispersion in hBN by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements on the prototypical hexagonal boron nitride hBN layered compound. The RIXS results at the B and N K edges have been combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) experiments and ab initio calculations within the framework of the Bethe-Salpeter equation of many-body perturbation theory. By means of this tight interplay of different spectroscopies, the lowest longitudinal exciton of hBN has been identified. Moreover, its qualitatively different dispersions along the $\Gamma$K and the $\Gamma$M directions of the Brillouin zone have been determined. Our study advocates soft X-ray RIXS and EELS to be a promising combination to investigate electronic excitations in materials.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Theory of Proximity Ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where the multilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression" where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of dielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozen ferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Giant High-order Nonlinear and Nonreciprocal Electrical Transports Induced by Valley Flipping in Bernal Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electrical transport properties of the mini-valley polarized state proposed recently in slightly doped Bernal Bilayer Graphene (BLG) in large electric displacement fields. By minimizing the Hartree-Fock energy functional, we first confirm the appearance of mini-valley polarized phase. At the low carrier doping regime, the 1-pocket state will be stabilized where only one of the trigonal-wrapping-induced Fermi pockets near the atomic-valley center is filled. Then we study the electrical transport of the 1-pocket state by solving the Boltzmann equation. We find that the valley polarization could be easily flopped by an in-plane electrical field, which will lead to hysteresis loop in the direct current (DC) $I-V$ curves. Such irreversible current responses in the DC limit will directly induce strong nonlinear and nonreciprocal alternating current (AC) responses, which has been already observed in the recent experiments on BLG.</description>

      <title>InAs on Insulator: A New Platform for Cryogenic Hybrid Superconducting Electronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits based on hybrid InAs Josephson Junctions (JJs) play a starring role in the design of fast and ultra-low power consumption solid-state quantum electronics and exploring novel physical phenomena. Conventionally, 3D substrates, 2D quantum wells (QWs), and 1D nanowires (NWs) made of InAs are employed to create superconducting circuits with hybrid JJs. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages. Here, we proposed the InAs-on-insulator (InAsOI) as a groundbreaking platform for developing superconducting electronics. An epilayer of semiconducting InAs with different electron densities was grown onto an InAlAs metamorphic buffer layer, efficiently used as a cryogenic insulator to decouple adjacent devices electrically. JJs with various lengths and widths were fabricated employing Al as a superconductor and InAs with different electron densities. We achieved a switching current density of 7.3 uA/um, a critical voltage of 50-to-80 uV, and a critical temperature equal to that of the superconductor used. For all the JJs, the switching current follows a characteristic Fraunhofer pattern with an out-of-plane magnetic field. These achievements enable the use of InAsOI to design and fabricate surface-exposed Josephson Field Effect Transistors with high critical current densities and superior gating properties.</description>

      <title>Laser-scanning of induction-melted Al alloys: are they representative of additively manufactured ones?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bottleneck of alloy design for powder-based additive manufacturing (AM) resides in customized powder production - an expensive and time-consuming process hindering the rapid closed-loop design iterations. This study analyzed an expedited experimental workflow, i.e., multipath laser scanning of induction-melted samples, to mimic rapid solidification of AM to serve as an alternative approach to down-select from the design space. Using Al-Ni-Zr-Er model alloy, comprehensive multi-scale characterizations were performed to compare microstructural features between laser-scanned and laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) samples. Although demonstrating a difference in melt pool geometries, the microstructures in scanning electron microscopy (SEM)- and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)- scale demonstrate a high degree of similarity, in terms of microstructure morphology, grain size, presence of precipitates, and phase distribution. The mechanical performance was evaluated by microhardness tests. The results revealed a 20% reduction in laser-scanned samples compared to LPBF samples, attributed to the thermal history and potential differences in phase fractions. The decreasing trend was also observed in the benchmark alloy showing a 10% absolute error with respect to the model alloy. This study underscores the potential of this workflow to accelerate alloy design in AM by circumventing customized powder production and encourages further exploration across diverse materials and processing parameters.</description>

      <title>Encoded probabilistic imaginary-time evolution on a trapped-ion quantum computer for ground and excited states of spin qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we employed a quantum computer to solve a low-energy effective Hamiltonian for spin defects in diamond (so-called NV centre) and wurtzite-type aluminium nitride, which are anticipated to be qubits. The probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE) method, designed for use in a fault-tolerant quantum computer (FTQC) era, was employed to calculate the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state, as represented by the effective Hamiltonian. It is difficult to compute the spin singlet state correctly using density functional theory (DFT), which should be described by multiple Slater determinants. To mitigate the effects of quantum errors inherent in current quantum computers, we implemented a $[[ n+2,n,2 ]]$ quantum error detection (QED) code called the Iceberg code. Despite the inevitable destruction of the encoded state resulting from the measurement of the ancilla qubit at each PITE step, we were able to successfully re-encode and recover the logical success state. In the implementation of the PITE, it was observed that the effective Hamiltonian comprises large components of the diagonal part and a relatively small non-diagonal part, which is frequently the case with quantum chemistry calculations. An efficient implementation of Hamiltonian simulations, in which the diagonal components dominate, was developed on a quantum computer based on the second-order Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. This is the first instance of an encoded PITE circuit being executed on a trapped-ion quantum computer. Our results demonstrate that QED effectively reduces quantum errors and that we successfully obtained both the ground and excited states of the spin singlet state. Our demonstration clearly manifests that Zr$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, Ti$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$, and Hf$_{\rm Al}$V$_{\rm N}$ defects have a high potential as spin qubits for quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement and Quantum Sensing in a Spin-5/2 Heisenberg Molecular Iron(III) Triangle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides insights into the static and dynamic quantum properties of the trinuclear high-spin iron(III) molecular complex $[\mathrm{Fe}_3\mathrm{Cl}_3(\mathrm{saltag^\mathrm{Br}})(\mathrm{py})_6]\mathrm{ClO}_4$ to be further abbreviated as Fe$_3$. Using exact diagonalization of a spin-5/2 Heisenberg triangle in a magnetic field, we model the corresponding quantum behavior of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our rigorous analysis employs various key metrics to explore a rich quantum behavior of this molecular compound. At sufficiently low temperatures, the bipartite negativity reveals that the pairwise entanglement between any pair of iron(III) magnetic ions of the molecular complex Fe$_3$ can be significantly enhanced by a small magnetic field. This enhancement is followed by unconventional step-like changes characterized by a sequence of plateaus and sudden downturns as the magnetic field further increases. A qualitatively similar behavior is also observed in the genuine tripartite entanglement among all three iron(III) magnetic ions in the trinuclear complex Fe$_3$. Notably, the bipartite and tripartite entanglement persist in the molecular complex Fe$_3$ up to moderate temperatures of approximately 30~K and 70~K, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the achievement of quantum-enhanced sensitivity by initializing the molecular complex Fe$_3$ in Dicke states. Finally, we investigated a quantum-sensing protocol by applying a local magnetic field specifically to one iron(III) magnetic ion of the molecular compound Fe$_3$ and performing readout sequentially on one of two remaining iron(III) magnetic ions.</description>

Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators with high quality factors (\Qm{}) enable mechanics-based quantum technologies, in particular quantum sensing and quantum transduction. High-\Qm{} nanomechanical resonators in the kHz to MHz frequency range can be realized in tensile-strained thin films that allow the use of dissipation dilution techniques to drastically increase \Qm{}. In our work, we study the material properties of tensile-strained piezoelectric films made from aluminium nitride (AlN). We characterize crystalline AlN films with a thickness ranging from \SI{45}{\nano\meter} to \SI{295}{\nano\meter}, which are directly grown on Si(111) by metal-organic vapour-phase epitaxy. We report on the crystal quality and surface roughness, the piezoelectric response, and the residual and released stress of the AlN thin films. Importantly, we determine the intrinsic quality factor of the films at room temperature in high vacuum. We fabricate and characterize AlN nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution to enhance the intrinsic quality factor by utilizing the tensile strain in the film. We find that AlN nanomechanical resonators below \SI{200}{\nano\meter} thickness exhibit the highest \Qf{}-product, on the order of $10^{12}$\,Hz. We discuss possible strategies to optimize the material growth that should lead to devices that reach even higher \Qf{}-products. This will pave the way for future advancements of optoelectromechanical quantum devices made from tensile-strained piezoelectric AlN.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Thermal Properties in Multilayer Systems for Advanced Thermoreflectance Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08480v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermoreflectance techniques, including time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), and the square-pulsed source (SPS) method, are powerful tools for characterizing the thermal properties of bulk and thin-film materials. However, accurately interpreting their signals remains challenging due to intricate interdependencies among experimental variables. This study introduces a systematic framework based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to decouple these interdependent parameters and enhance the reliability of thermal property extraction. By applying SVD to the sensitivity matrix, we identify key parameter combinations and establish essential dimensionless numbers that govern thermoreflectance signals. The framework is applied to a GaN/Si heterostructure, where the performance of TDTR, FDTR, and SPS is evaluated and compared. The results demonstrate a high degree of consistency across all three techniques. Notably, with the intricate relationships of parameters unraveled, TDTR, FDTR, and SPS demonstrate significant potential to simultaneously and accurately extract five to seven key thermal properties, including thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and interfacial thermal conductance of the GaN/Si multilayer system. This framework not only improves the precision of thermoreflectance measurements but also lays a foundation for advanced thermal metrology in research and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>A cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff metric approach for quantifying molecular similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce, for the first time, a cohomology-based Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric method to analyze 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional (co)homology groups, focusing on loops, voids, and higher-dimensional cavity structures in simplicial complexes, to address typical clustering questions arising in molecular data analysis. The Gromov-Hausdorff distance quantifies the dissimilarity between two metric spaces. In this framework, molecules are represented as simplicial complexes, and their cohomology vector spaces are computed to capture intrinsic topological invariants encoding loop and cavity structures. These vector spaces are equipped with a suitable distance measure, enabling the computation of the Gromov-Hausdorff ultrametric to evaluate structural dissimilarities. We demonstrate the methodology using organic-inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) structures. The results highlight the effectiveness of this approach in clustering various molecular structures. By incorporating geometric information, our method provides deeper insights compared to traditional persistent homology techniques.</description>

      <title>Electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence based on the formation of charge-transfer excimers</title>

Abstract: Despite the extensive use of electrochemiluminescence in sensing applications, its potential in lighting and display technology has been constrained by the low luminance and short operational lifetime of electrochemiluminescence devices (ECLDs). Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the luminance, efficiency, and operational longevity of ECLDs by introducing electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence (ECiHF) via electrogeneration of charge-transfer (CT) excimers and subsequent energy transfer to fluorescent acceptors. By assuming a double-decker arrangement of the electron donor and acceptor groups, the molecule TpAT-tFFO supports solution-state thermally activated delayed fluorescence from a CT excimer state and efficient energy transfer to the rubrene dye TBRb. Optimized ECLDs based on this material combination achieve an unprecedented luminance of 6,220 cd/m2 and their operational lifetime (LT50) at an initial luminance of 100 cd/m2 exceeds 20 minutes, more than 10-fold longer than other ECLDs with meaningful efficiency or brightness. We identify energy level alignment between the excimer and the emitter as a crucial factor for efficient ECiHF. In mixtures with energy gaps &gt; 0.5 eV, electron transfer results in reduced performance and renders the operation strongly dependent on applied voltage and frequency. By contrast, spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that devices with favorable energy level alignment operate on a pure excimer mechanism across a wide range of frequencies. These findings highlight the innovative potential of ECiHF in improving the performance of ECLD, which can be widely applied in future commercial lighting solutions.</description>
