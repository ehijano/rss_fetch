      <title>Performance study of a bakelite RPC prototype built by new technique of linseed oil coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) is one of the most commonly used detectors in high energy physics experiments for triggering and tracking because of its good efficiency ($\textgreater$~90\%) and time resolution ($\sim$~1-2~ns). Generally, the bakelite which is one of the most commonly used materials used as electrode plates in RPC, sometimes suffer from surface roughness issues. If the surface is not smooth, the micro discharge probability and spurious pulses increase, which leads to the deterioration in the performance of the detector. We have developed a new method of linseed oil coating for the bakelite based detectors to avoid the surface roughness issue. The detector is characterised with Tetrafluoroethane based gas mixture. The detector is also tested with a high rate of gamma radiation environment in the lab for the radiation hardness test. The detailed measurement procedure and test results are presented in this article.</description>

      <title>Beyond spectral resolution in optical sensing: Picometer-level precision with multispectral readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical sensors offer precision, remote read-out, and immunity to electromagnetic interference but face adoption challenges due to complex and costly readout instrumentation, mostly based on high-resolution. This article challenges the notion that high spectral resolution is necessary for high performance optical sensing. We propose co-optimizing the linewidths of sensor and readout to achieve picometer-level precision using low-resolution multispectral detector arrays and incoherent light sources. This approach is validated in temperature sensing, fiber-tip refractive index sensing, and biosensing, achieving superior precision to high-resolution spectrometers. This paradigm change in readout will enable optical sensing systems with costs and dimensions comparable to electronic sensors.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo assessment of the spectral performance of four types of photon counting detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous publications, we have presented an alternative approach to determine essential detector properties like the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), the Noise Power Spectrum (NPS) and the Detective Quantum Efficiency (DQE) based on a Monte Carlo model of the detection process. If a Monte Carlo model for the detector response to photons impinging at various locations of a pixel is available, the full statistics of the detector can be derived in a straightforward manner. The purpose of this paper is to describe the method in detail and to apply it to four types of realistic detectors: direct converting detectors using CdTe and silicon, a CdTe photon counter with additional coincidence counters and an optical counting system using LaBr3 as scintillator.</description>

      <title>Resistance standards with calculable, nearly negligible AC-DC difference at frequencies up to 2 MHz for the calibration of precision LCR meters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have developed novel impedance standards based on thin-film surface-mount-device (SMD) resistors. Due to the small dimensions of such resistors, the quantities determining their frequency dependence are very small and can be either measured or numerically calculated. A series connection of thin-film SMD resistors allows us to further improve the DC and the AC properties. The nominal resistance value of our application is 12.906 kohm but other values are just as possible. At frequencies up to 2 MHz, the calculated frequency dependence amounts to only a few parts per million of the DC value, which is about four orders of magnitude smaller than for all conventional calculable AC-DC resistors having a similar nominal DC value. To measure the frequency dependence, we use a precision inductance-capacitance-resistance (LCR) meter at frequencies up to 2 MHz that has a reproducibility of a few parts per million but a systematic uncertainty which is specified by the manufacturer to increase from 300 parts per million in the lower frequency range to 3000 parts per million at 2 MHz. Measurements of two very different SMD-based resistance standards allow verification of the model calculation as well as the calibration of the precision LCR meter, both with a relative uncertainty of a few parts per million in the whole frequency range. This boost in precision enables new applications in this frequency range such as the verification of conventional calculable resistance standards, the calibration of impedance standards, and future measurements of the quantum Hall resistance.</description>

      <title>SymbolNet: Neural Symbolic Regression with Adaptive Dynamic Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrary to genetic programming, the neural network approach to symbolic regression can efficiently handle high-dimensional inputs and leverage gradient methods for faster equation searching. Common ways of constraining expression complexity often involve multistage pruning with fine-tuning, which can result in significant performance loss. In this work, we propose $\tt{SymbolNet}$, a neural network approach to symbolic regression in a novel framework that allows dynamic pruning of model weights, input features, and mathematical operators in a single training process, where both training loss and expression complexity are optimized simultaneously. We introduce a sparsity regularization term for each pruning type, which can adaptively adjust its strength, leading to convergence at a target sparsity ratio. Unlike most existing symbolic regression methods that struggle with datasets containing more than $\mathcal{O}(10)$ inputs, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the LHC jet tagging task (16 inputs), MNIST (784 inputs), and SVHN (3072 inputs). Our approach enables symbolic regression to achieve fast inference with nanosecond-scale latency on FPGAs for high-dimensional datasets in environments with stringent computational resource constraints, such as the high-energy physics experiments at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Nanodosimetric investigation of the track structure of therapeutic carbon ion radiation. Part 1: Measurement of ionization cluster size distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center, the track structure of carbon ions of therapeutic energy after penetrating layers of simulated tissue was investigated for the first time. Measurements were conducted with carbon ion beams of different energies and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) absorbers of different thicknesses to realize different depths in the phantom along the pristine Bragg peak. Ionization cluster size (ICS) distributions resulting from the mixed radiation field behind the PMMA absorbers were measured using an ion-counting nanodosimeter. Two different measurements were carried out: (i) variation of the PMMA absorber thickness with constant carbon ion beam energy and (ii) combined variation of PMMA absorber thickness and carbon ion beam energy such that the kinetic energy of the carbon ions in the target volume is constant. The data analysis revealed unexpectedly high mean ICS values compared to stopping power calculations and the data measured at lower energies in earlier work. This suggests that in the measurements the carbon ion kinetic energies behind the PMMA absorber may have deviated considerably from the expected values obtained by the calculations. In addition, the results indicate the presence of a marked contribution of nuclear fragments to the measured ICS distributions, especially if the carbon ion does not cross the target volume.</description>
