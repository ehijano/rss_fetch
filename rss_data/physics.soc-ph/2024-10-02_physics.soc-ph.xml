      <title>Consequences of non-Markovian healing processes on epidemic models with recurrent infections on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infections diseases are marked by recovering time distributions which can be far from the exponential one associated with Markovian/Poisson processes, broadly applied in epidemic compartmental models. In the present work, we tackled this problem by investigating a susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible model on networks with $\eta$ independent infectious compartments (SI$_{\eta}$RS), each one with a Markovian dynamics, that leads to a Gamma-distributed recovering times. We analytically develop a theory for the epidemic lifespan on star graphs with a center and $K$ leaves showing that the epidemic lifespan scales with a non-universal power-law $\tau_{K}\sim K^{\alpha/\mu\eta}$ plus logarithm corrections, where $\alpha^{-1}$ and $\mu^{-1}$ are the mean waning immunity and recovering times, respectively. Compared with standard SIRS dynamics with $\eta=1$ and the same mean recovering time, the epidemic lifespan on star graphs is severely reduced as the number of stages increases. In particular, the case $\eta\rightarrow\infty$ leads to a finite lifespan. Numerical simulations support the approximated analytical calculations. For the SIS dynamics, numerical simulations show that the lifespan increases exponentially with the number of leaves, with a nonuniversal rate that decays with the number of infectious compartments. We investigated the SI$_{\eta}$RS dynamics on power-law networks with degree distribution $P(K)\sim k^{-\gamma}$. When $\gamma&lt;5/2$, the epidemic spreading is ruled by a maximum $k$-core activation, the alteration of the hub activity time does not alter either the epidemic threshold or the localization pattern. For $\gamma&gt;3$, where hub mutual activation is at work, the localization is reduced but not sufficiently to alter the threshold scaling with the network size. Therefore, the activation mechanisms remain the same as in the case of Markovian healing.</description>

      <title>CompLex: legal systems through the lens of complexity science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While "complexity science" has achieved significant successes in several interdisciplinary fields such as economics and biology, it is only a very recent observation that legal systems -- from the way legal texts are drafted and connected to the rest of the corpus, up to the level of how judges and courts reach decisions under a variety of conflicting inputs -- share several features with standard Complex Adaptive Systems. This review is meant as a gentle introduction to the use of quantitative tools and techniques of complexity science to describe, analyse, and tame the complex web of human interactions that the Law is supposed to regulate. We offer an overview of the main directions of research undertaken so far as well as an outlook for future research, and we argue that statistical physicists and complexity scientists should not ignore the opportunities offered by the cross-fertilisation between legal scholarship and complex-systems modelling.</description>

      <title>Measuring Global Urban Complexity from the Perspective of Living Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As urban critic Jane Jacobs conceived, a city is essentially the problem of organized complexity. What underlies the complexity refers to a structural factor, called living structure, which is defined as a mathematical structure composed of hierarchically organized substructures. Through these substructures, the complexity of cities, or equivalent to the livingness of urban space (L), can be measured by the multiplication the number of cities or substructures (S) and their scaling hierarchy (H), indicating that complexity is about both quantity of cities and how well the city is organized hierarchically. In other words, complexity emerges from a hierarchical structure where there are far more small cities or substructures than large ones across all scales, and cities are more or less similar within each individual hierarchical level. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive case studies to investigate urban complexity on a global scale using multisource geospatial data. We develop an efficient approach to recursively identifying all natural cities with their inner hotspots worldwide through connected component analysis. To characterize urban complexity, urban space is initially represented as a hierarchy of recursively defined natural cities, and all the cities are then represented as a network for measuring the degree of complexity or livingness of the urban space. The results show the Earth's surface is growing more complex from an economic perspective, and the dynamics of urban complexity are more explicit from nighttime light imagery than from population data. We further discuss the implications in city science, aiming to help create and recreate urban environments that are more resilient and livable by fostering organized complexity from the perspective of living structure.</description>

      <title>Spread of Crime Dynamics: A mathematical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the spread of crime dynamics in the US is analyzed from a mathematical scope, an epidemiological model is established, including five compartments: Susceptible (S), Latent 1 (E1), Latent 2 (E2), Incarcerated (I), and Recovered (R). A system of differential equations is used to model the spread of crime. A result to show the positivity of the solutions for the system is included. The basic reproduction number and the stability for the disease-free equilibrium results are calculated following epidemiological theories. Numerical simulations are performed with US parameter values. Understanding the dynamics of the spread of crime helps to determine what factors may work best together to reduce violent crime.</description>

      <title>Socioeconomic disparities in mobility behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile phone data have played a key role in quantifying human mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing studies on mobility patterns have primarily focused on regional aggregates in high-income countries, obfuscating the accentuated impact of the pandemic on the most vulnerable populations. Leveraging geolocation data from mobile-phone users and population census for 6 middle-income countries across 3 continents between March and December 2020, we uncovered common disparities in the behavioral response to the pandemic across socioeconomic groups. Users living in low-wealth neighborhoods were less likely to respond by self-isolating, relocating to rural areas, or refraining from commuting to work. The gap in the behavioral responses between socioeconomic groups persisted during the entire observation period. Among users living in low-wealth neighborhoods, those who commute to work in high-wealth neighborhoods pre-pandemic were particularly at risk of experiencing economic stress, facing both the reduction in economic activity in the high-wealth neighborhood and being more likely to be affected by public transport closures due to their longer commute distances. While confinement policies were predominantly country-wide, these results suggest that, when data to identify vulnerable individuals are not readily available, GPS-based analytics could help design targeted place-based policies to aid the most vulnerable.</description>

      <title>A primer on the use of probability generating functions in infectious disease modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.05136v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the application of probability generating functions (PGFs) to invasive processes, focusing on infectious disease introduced into large populations. Our goal is to acquaint the reader with applications of PGFs, moreso than to derive new results. PGFs help predict a number of properties about early outbreak behavior while the population is still effectively infinite, including the probability of an epidemic, the size distribution after some number of generations, and the cumulative size distribution of non-epidemic outbreaks. We show how PGFs can be used in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings, and discuss how to use these results to infer disease parameters from observed outbreaks. In the large population limit for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemics PGFs lead to survival-function based models that are equivalent the the usual mass-action SIR models but with fewer ODEs. We use these to explore properties such as the final size of epidemics or even the dynamics once stochastic effects are negligible. We target this tutorial to biologists and public health researchers who want to learn how to apply PGFs to invasive diseases, but it could also be used in an introductory mathematics course on PGFs. We include many exercises to help demonstrate concepts and to give practice applying the results. We summarize our main results in a few tables. Additionally we provide a small python package which performs many of the relevant calculations.</description>
