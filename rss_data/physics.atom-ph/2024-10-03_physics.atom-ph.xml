      <title>Energy-conservation conditions in saddle-point approximation for the strong-field-ionization of atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbit-based methods are widespread in strong-field laser-matter interaction. They provide a framework in which photoelectron momentum distributions can be interpreted as the quantum interference between different semi-classical pathways the electron can take on its way to the detector, which brings with it great predictive power. The transition amplitude of an electron going from a bound state to a final continuum state is often written as multiple integrals, which can be computed either numerically, or by employing the saddle-point method. If one computes the momentum distribution via a saddle-point method, the obtained distribution is highly dependent on the time window from which the saddle points are selected for inclusion in the "sum over paths". In many cases, this leads to the distributions not even satisfying the basic symmetry requirements and often containing many more oscillations and interference fringes than their numerically integrated counterparts. Using the strong-field approximation, we find that the manual enforcement of the energy-conservation condition on the momentum distribution calculated via the saddle-point method provides a unique momentum distribution which satisfies the symmetry requirements of the system and which is in a good agreement with the numerical results. We illustrate our findings using the example of the Ar atom ionized by a selection of monochromatic and bichromatic linearly polarized fields.</description>

      <title>Distribution of angular momenta $M_L$ and $M_S$ in non-relativistic configurations: statistical analysis using cumulants and Gram-Charlier series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distributions $P(M_L,M_S)$ of the total magnetic quantum numbers $M_L$ and $M_S$ for $N$ electrons of angular momentum $\ell$, as well as the enumeration of $LS$ spectroscopic terms and spectral lines, are crucial for the calculation of atomic structure and spectra, in particular for the modeling of emission or absorption properties of hot plasmas. However, no explicit formula for $P(M_L,M_S)$ is known yet. In the present work, we show that the generating function for the cumulants, which characterize the distribution, obeys a recurrence relation, similar to the Newton-Girard identities relating elementary symmetric polynomials to power sums. This enables us to provide an explicit formula for the generating function. We also analyze the possibility of representing the $P(M_L,M_S)$ distribution by a bi-variate Gram-Charlier series, which coefficients are obtained from the knowledge of the exact moments of $P(M_L,M_S)$. It is shown that a simple approximation is obtained by truncating this series to the first few terms, though it is not convergent.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and electron-correlation effects in static dipole polarizabilities for group 11 elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The static dipole polarizabilities of group 11 elements (Cu, Ag, and Au) are computed using the relativistic coupled-cluster method with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations. Three types of relativistic effects on dipole polarizabilities are investigated: scalar-relativistic, spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and fully relativistic Dirac-Coulomb contributions. The final recommended values, including uncertainties, are $46.91 \pm 1.30$ for Cu, $50.97 \pm 1.88$ for Ag, and $36.68 \pm 0.62$ for Au. Our results show close agreement with the values recommended in the 2018 table of static dipole polarizabilities for neutral elements [Mol. Phys. \textbf{117}, 1200 (2019)], with reduced uncertainties for Ag and Au. The analysis indicates that scalar-relativistic effects are the dominant relativistic contribution for these elements, while SOC effects are negligible. The influence of electron correlation across all relativistic regimes is also evaluated, demonstrating its significant role in the accurate calculation of dipole polarizabilities.</description>

      <title>Measurement of ionization delays in atomic REMPI using photoelectron vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study time-delays in atomic multiphoton ionization (MPI) using the phase-sensitive detection of photoelectron vortices. Photoelectron vortices are created by MPI with counter-rotating circularly polarized (CRCP) ultrashort double pulse sequences. The vortices are characterized by a spiral-shaped photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) resulting from the Ramsey-type interference of the partial photoelectron wave packets created by each pulse. The slope of the spiral arms encodes the time-delay between the partial wave packets with interferometric precision. We study the ionization time-delay in the (1+2) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) of potassium atoms using femtosecond CRCP white-light supercontinuum pulses. Pairwise interference of the partial wave packets with a reference wave packet gives rise to vortices of different rotational symmetry, which are superimposed to form the total PMD. The PMD is reconstructed tomographically and decomposed into the vortices using 3D Fourier analysis. From the energy-dependent spectral phases of the vortices, we retrieve a resonant ionization delay in the order of 1 fs, much shorter than the pulse duration. Our results demonstrate the power of photoelectron vortices for the accurate determination of photoionization time-delays and open up new perspectives for photoelectron chronoscopy including the measurement of ionization delays on the attosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Rabi oscillations at three-photon laser excitation of a single rubidium Rydberg atom in an optical dipole trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an experiment on three-photon laser excitation $5S_{1/2} \to 5P_{3/2} \to 6S_{1/2} \to 37P_{3/2}$ of a single $^{87}$Rb Rydberg atom in an optical dipole trap, we have observed for the first time three-photon Rabi oscillations between the ground and the Rydberg states. The single atom was detected optically by measuring the signal of resonant fluorescence with a low-noise sCMOS video camera. Relative probability of the atom to remain in the trap after the action of three synchronized laser excitation pulses was measured for their durations varied in the range from 100 ns to 2 $\mu$s. A specific feature of the experiment was the usage of intense laser radiation at the wavelength of 1367 nm on the second excitation step, which provided the single-photon Rabi frequency up to 2 GHz to control the effective detunings of the intermediate levels of the three-photon transition due to ac Stark effect. We have detected Rabi oscillations with frequency from 1 to 5 MHz depending on the intensities of the laser pulses on the first and the second excitation steps with the coherence time of 0.7-0.8 $\mu$s. The ways to increase the coherence time and contrast of the three-photon Rabi oscillations for applications in quantum information processing with Rydberg atoms are discussed.</description>

      <title>$^{229}\mathrm{ThF}_4$ thin films for solid-state nuclear clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After nearly fifty years of searching, the vacuum ultraviolet $^{229}$Th nuclear isomeric transition has recently been directly laser excited [1,2] and measured with high spectroscopic precision [3]. Nuclear clocks based on this transition are expected to be more robust [4,5] than and may outperform [6,7] current optical atomic clocks. They also promise sensitive tests for new physics beyond the standard model [5,8,9]. In light of these important advances and applications, a dramatic increase in the need for $^{229}$Th spectroscopy targets in a variety of platforms is anticipated. However, the growth and handling of high-concentration $^{229}$Th-doped crystals [5] used in previous measurements [1-3,10] are challenging due to the scarcity and radioactivity of the $^{229}$Th material. Here, we demonstrate a potentially scalable solution to these problems by demonstrating laser excitation of the nuclear transition in $^{229}$ThF$_4$ thin films grown with a physical vapor deposition process, consuming only micrograms of $^{229}$Th material. The $^{229}$ThF$_4$ thin films are intrinsically compatible with photonics platforms and nanofabrication tools for integration with laser sources and detectors, paving the way for an integrated and field-deployable solid-state nuclear clock with radioactivity up to three orders of magnitude smaller than typical \thor-doped crystals [1-3,10]. The high nuclear emitter density in $^{229}$ThF$_4$ also potentially enables quantum optics studies in a new regime. Finally, we describe the operation and present the estimation of the performance of a nuclear clock based on a defect-free ThF$_4$ crystal.</description>

      <title>Microwave Cavity Resonator with Extreme Dispersion to Enable a Test of the Electric-Scalar Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A cylindrical microwave cavity resonator operating in the TM$_{0,1,0}$ mode was excited using an interferometric configuration that allowed manipulation of the electric field and potential within the resonator by adjusting the phase and amplitude in the two interferometer arms driving the resonator. With precise tuning of the phase and amplitude, 25 dB suppression of the electric field at the resonance frequency was achieved while simultaneously resonantly enhancing the amplitude of the time-varying electric-scalar potential. Under these balanced conditions, the system demonstrated extreme dispersion in the cavity response due to the introduction of an anti-resonance at the resonance frequency. This creates a phenomenon similar to electromagnetically induced transparency, leading to an increase in the cavity phase response by an order of magnitude. This work presents an experimental setup with the features that will allow the electric-scalar Aharonov-Bohm effect to be tested under conditions involving a time-varying electric-scalar potential, without the presence of an electric field or magnetic vector potential, an experiment that has not yet been realised.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of isotope shifts in the barium 6s$^2$ $^1$S$_0$-5d6p $^3$D$^\text{o}_1$ transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the direct measurement of isotope shifts of the barium 6s$^2$ $^1$S$_0$ --5d6p $^3$D$^\text{o}_1$ 413-nm electric quadrupole transition, which is utilized for efficient barium ion trapping via photoionization using a single coherent light source. The measured isotope shifts relative to $^{138}$Ba are $392.9\pm0.9$ MHz, $178.1\pm0.8$ MHz, $401.4\pm1.2$ MHz, and $124.3\pm1.3$ MHz for isotopes with atomic numbers 137, 136, 135, and 134, respectively. We verify the measured isotopes with King plot analysis and compare the result with the formerly known shifts inferred from previous studies on neighboring transitions. The results can be used for efficient isotope selective loading of low-abundant barium ions, while careful suppression of line broadening is required for successful isotopic selectivity.</description>

      <title>Effect of trap imperfections on the density of a quasi-two-dimensional uniform dipolar quantum Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the impact of weak static perturbations of a flat potential on the density of a quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose gas. {We consider the perturbative effects of potential perturbations at first order and restrict to the mean-field stable regime. We first study cosinusoidal potential perturbations at a given spatial frequency; this allows us to understand the effects of optical lattices as well as of isolated momentum contributions in the Fourier decomposition of an arbitrary potential. We then study potential perturbations characterized by a static white-noise spectrum over a given momentum range; this captures the effects of inherent optical aberrations in setups that create uniform optical dipole traps.</description>
