      <title>A Constructive Method for Designing Safe Multirate Controllers for Differentially-Flat Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-rate control architecture that leverages fundamental properties of differential flatness to synthesize controllers for safety-critical nonlinear dynamical systems. We propose a two-layer architecture, where the high-level generates reference trajectories using a linear Model Predictive Controller, and the low-level tracks this reference using a feedback controller. The novelty lies in how we couple these layers, to achieve formal guarantees on recursive feasibility of the MPC problem, and safety of the nonlinear system. Furthermore, using differential flatness, we provide a constructive means to synthesize the multi-rate controller, thereby removing the need to search for suitable Lyapunov or barrier functions, or to approximately linearize/discretize nonlinear dynamics. We show the synthesized controller is a convex optimization problem, making it amenable to real-time implementations. The method is demonstrated experimentally on a ground rover and a quadruped robotic system.</description>

      <title>Learning Piecewise Residuals of Control Barrier Functions for Safety of Switching Systems using Multi-Output Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have recently been introduced as a systematic tool to ensure safety by establishing set invariance. When combined with a control Lyapunov function (CLF), they form a safety-critical control mechanism. However, the effectiveness of CBFs and CLFs is closely tied to the system model. In practice, model uncertainty can jeopardize safety and stability guarantees and may lead to undesirable performance. In this paper, we develop a safe learning-based control strategy for switching systems in the face of uncertainty. We focus on the case that a nominal model is available for a true underlying switching system. This uncertainty results in piecewise residuals for each switching surface, impacting the CLF and CBF constraints. We introduce a batch multi-output Gaussian process (MOGP) framework to approximate these piecewise residuals, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of uncertainty. A particular structure of the covariance function enables us to convert the MOGP-based chance constraints CLF and CBF into second-order cone constraints, which leads to a convex optimization. We analyze the feasibility of the resulting optimization and provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for feasibility. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated through a simulation of a switching adaptive cruise control system.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Boundary Control of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky Equation Under Intermittent Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in this paper boundary stabilization, in the L2 sense, of the one-dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation subject to intermittent sensing. We assume that we measure the state of this spatio-temporal equation on a given spatial subdomain during certain intervals of time, while we measure the state on the remaining spatial subdomain during the remaining intervals of time. As a result, we assign a feedback law at the boundary of the spatial domain and force to zero the value of the state at the junction of the two subdomains. Throughout the study, the destabilizing coefficient is assumed to be space-dependent and bounded but unknown. Adaptive boundary controllers are designed under different assumptions on the forcing term. In particular, when the forcing term is null, we guarantee global exponential stability of the origin. Furthermore, when the forcing term is bounded and admits a known upper bound, we guarantee input-to-state stability, and only global uniform ultimate boundedness is guaranteed when the upper bound is unknown. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate our results</description>

      <title>Path Integral Control with Rollout Clustering and Dynamic Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has proven to be a powerful tool for the control of uncertain systems (such as systems subject to disturbances and systems with unmodeled dynamics). One important limitation of the baseline MPPI algorithm is that it does not utilize simulated trajectories to their fullest extent. For one, it assumes that the average of all trajectories weighted by their performance index will be a safe trajectory. In this paper, multiple examples are shown where the previous assumption does not hold, and a trajectory clustering technique is presented that reduces the chances of the weighted average crossing in an unsafe region. Secondly, MPPI does not account for dynamic obstacles, so the authors put forward a novel cost function that accounts for dynamic obstacles without adding significant computation time to the overall algorithm. The novel contributions proposed in this paper were evaluated with extensive simulations to demonstrate improvements upon the state-of-the-art MPPI techniques.</description>

      <title>From Sontag s to Cardano-Lyapunov Formula for Systems Not Affine in the Control: Convection-Enabled PDE Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the first generalization of Sontag s universal controller to systems not affine in the control, particularly, to PDEs with boundary actuation. We assume that the system admits a control Lyapunov function (CLF) whose derivative, rather than being affine in the control, has either a depressed cubic, quadratic, or depressed quartic dependence on the control. For each case, a continuous universal controller that vanishes at the origin and achieves global exponential stability is derived. We prove our result in the context of convectionreaction-diffusion PDEs with Dirichlet actuation. We show that if the convection has a certain structure, then the L2 norm of the state is a CLF. In addition to generalizing Sontag s formula to some non-affine systems, we present the first general Lyapunov approach for boundary control of nonlinear PDEs. We illustrate our results via a numerical example.</description>

      <title>ANOCA: AC Network-aware Optimal Curtailment Approach for Dynamic Hosting Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With exponential growth in distributed energy resources (DERs) coupled with at-capacity distribution grid infrastructure, prosumers cannot always export all extra power to the grid without violating technical limits. Consequently, a slew of dynamic hosting capacity (DHC) algorithms have emerged for optimal utilization of grid infrastructure while maximizing export from DERs. Most of these DHC algorithms utilize the concept of operating envelopes (OE)}, where the utility gives prosumers technical power export limits, and they are free to export power within these limits. Recent studies have shown that OE-based frameworks have drawbacks, as most develop power export limits based on convex or linear grid models. As OEs must capture extreme operating conditions, both convex and linear models can violate technical limits in practice because they approximate grid physics. However, AC models are unsuitable because they may not be feasible within the whole region of OE. We propose a new two-stage optimization framework for DHC built on three-phase AC models to address the current gaps. In this approach, the prosumers first run a receding horizon multi-period optimization to identify optimal export power setpoints to communicate with the utility. The utility then performs an infeasibility-based optimization to either accept the prosumer's request or dispatch an optimal curtail signal such that overall system technical constraints are not violated. To explore various curtailment strategies, we develop an L1, L2, and Linf norm-based dispatch algorithm with an exact three-phase AC model. We test our framework on a 1420 three-phase node meshed distribution network and show that the proposed algorithm optimally curtails DERs while guaranteeing the AC feasibility of the network.</description>

      <title>Multiple Model Reference Adaptive Control with Blending for Non-Square Multivariable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a multiple model reference adaptive controller (MMRAC) with blending. The systems under consideration are non-square, i.e., the number of inputs is not equal to the number of states; multi-input, linear, time-invariant with uncertain parameters that lie inside of a known, compact, and convex set. Moreover, the full state of the plant is available for feedback. A multiple model online identification scheme for the plant's state and input matrices is developed that guarantees the estimated parameters converge to the underlying plant model under the assumption of persistence of excitation. Using an exact matching condition, the parameter estimates are used in a control law such that the plant's states asymptotically track the reference signal generated by a state-space model reference. The control architecture is proven to provide boundedness of all closed-loop signals and to asymptotically drive the state tracking error to zero. Numerical simulations illustrate the stability and efficacy of the proposed MMRAC scheme.</description>

      <title>Incentive Designs for Learning Agents to Stabilize Coupled Exogenous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a large population of learning agents noncooperatively selecting strategies from a common set, influencing the dynamics of an exogenous system (ES) we seek to stabilize at a desired equilibrium. Our approach is to design a dynamic payoff mechanism capable of shaping the population's strategy profile, thus affecting the ES's state, by offering incentives for specific strategies within budget limits. Employing system-theoretic passivity concepts, we establish conditions under which a payoff mechanism can be systematically constructed to ensure the global asymptotic stabilization of the ES's equilibrium. In comparison to previous approaches originally studied in the context of the so-called epidemic population games, the method proposed here allows for more realistic epidemic models and other types of ES, such as predator-prey dynamics. Stabilization is established with the support of a Lyapunov function, which provides useful bounds on the transients.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Compatible Vertiport Reservation in Advanced Air Mobility: An Auction-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of advanced air mobility (AAM) is expected to become a multibillion-dollar industry in the near future. Market-based mechanisms are touted to be an integral part of AAM operations, which comprise heterogeneous operators with private valuations. In this work, we study the problem of designing a mechanism to coordinate the movement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, operated by multiple operators each having heterogeneous valuations associated with their fleet, between vertiports, while enforcing the arrival, departure, and parking constraints at vertiports. Particularly, we propose an incentive-compatible and individually rational vertiport reservation mechanism that maximizes a social welfare metric, which encapsulates the objective of maximizing the overall valuations of all operators while minimizing the congestion at vertiports. Additionally, we improve the computational tractability of designing the reservation mechanism by proposing a mixed binary linear programming approach that is based on constructing network flow graph corresponding to the underlying problem.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant properties of scale-free linear protocols for synchronization of homogeneous multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originally, protocols were designed for multi-agent systems (MAS) using information about the network. However, in many cases there is no or only limited information available about the network. Recently, there has been a focus on scale-free synchronization of multi-agent systems (MAS). In this case, the protocol is designed without any prior information about the network. As long as the network contains a directed spanning tree, the scale-free protocol guarantees that the network achieves synchronization.
  If there is no directed spanning tree for the network then synchronization cannot be achieved. But what happens when these scale-free protocols are applied to such a network where the directed spanning tree no longer exists? The latter might arise if, for instance, a fault occurs in one of more crucial links. This paper establishes that the network decomposes into a number of basic bicomponents which achieves synchronization among all nodes in this basic bicomponent. On the other hand, nodes which are not part of any basic bicomponent converge to a weighted average of the synchronized trajectories of the basic bicomponents. The weights are independent of the initial conditions and are independent of the designed protocol.</description>

      <title>An Execution-time-certified QP Algorithm for $\ell_1$ penalty-based Soft-constrained MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Providing an execution time certificate and handling possible infeasibility in closed-loop are two pressing requirements of Model Predictive Control (MPC). To simultaneously meet these two requirements, this paper uses $\ell_1$ penalty-based soft-constrained MPC formulation and innovatively transforms the resulting non-smooth QP into a box-constrained QP, which is solved by our previously proposed direct and execution-time certified algorithm with only dimension-dependent (data-independent) and exact number of iterations [1]. This approach not only overcomes the limitation of our previously proposed algorithm [1], only applicable to input-constrained MPC, but also enjoys exact recovery feature (exactly recover the same solution when the original problem is feasible) of $\ell_1$ penalty-based soft-constrained MPC formulation without suffering numerical difficulty of the resulting non-smoothness. Other various real-time QP applications, not limited to MPC, will also benefit from our QP algorithm with execution-time certificate and global feasibility.</description>

      <title>Linear Hybrid Asymmetrical Load-Modulated Balanced Amplifier with Multi-Band Reconfigurability and Antenna-VSWR Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first-ever highly linear and load-insensitive three-way load-modulation power amplifier (PA) based on reconfigurable hybrid asymmetrical load modulated balanced amplifier (H-ALMBA). Through proper amplitude and phase controls, the carrier, control amplifier (CA), and two peaking balanced amplifiers (BA1 and BA2) can form a linear high-order load modulation over wide bandwidth. Moreover, it is theoretically unveiled that the load modulation behavior of H-ALMBA can be insensitive to load mismatch by leveraging bias reconfiguration and the intrinsic load-insensitivity of balanced topology. Specifically, the PA's linearity and efficiency profiles can be maintained against arbitrary load mismatch through $Z_\mathrm{L}$-dependent reconfiguration of CA supply voltage ($V_\mathrm{DD,CA}$) and turning-on sequence of BA1 and BA2. Based on the proposed theory, an RF-input linear H-ALMBA is developed with GaN transistors and wideband quadrature hybrids. Over the design bandwidth from $1.7$-$2.9$ GHz, an efficiency of $56.8\%$$-$$72.9\%$ at peak power and $49.8\%$$-$$61.2\%$ at $10$-dB PBO are measured together with linear AMAM and AMPM responses. In modulated evaluation with 4G LTE signal, an EVM of $3.1\%$, ACPR of $-39$ dB, and average efficiency of up to $52\%$ are measured. Moreover, the reconfigurable H-ALMBA experimentally maintains an excellent average efficiency and linearity against arbitrary load mismatch at $2:1$ VSWR, and this mismatch-resilient operation can be achieved at any in-band frequencies. The overall measured performance favorably outperforms the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distributed Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization with Quantized Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new distributed nonconvex stochastic optimization algorithm that can achieve privacy protection, communication efficiency and convergence simultaneously. Specifically, each node adds time-varying privacy noises to its local state to avoid information leakage, and then quantizes its noise-perturbed state before transmitting to improve communication efficiency. By employing the subsampling method controlled through the sample-size parameter, the proposed algorithm reduces the impact of privacy noises, and enhances the differential privacy level. When the global cost function satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, the mean and high-probability convergence rate and the oracle complexity of the proposed algorithm are given. Importantly, the proposed algorithm achieves both the mean convergence and a finite cumulative differential privacy budget over infinite iterations as the sample-size goes to infinity. A numerical example of the distributed training on the "MNIST" dataset is given to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Dual Gradient Tracking for Distributed Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates privacy issues in distributed resource allocation over directed networks, where each agent holds a private cost function and optimizes its decision subject to a global coupling constraint through local interaction with other agents. Conventional methods for resource allocation over directed networks require all agents to transmit their original data to neighbors, which poses the risk of disclosing sensitive and private information. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm called differentially private dual gradient tracking (DP-DGT) for distributed resource allocation, which obfuscates the exchanged messages using independent Laplacian noise. Our algorithm ensures that the agents' decisions converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solution almost surely. Furthermore, without the assumption of bounded gradients, we prove that the cumulative differential privacy loss under the proposed algorithm is finite even when the number of iterations goes to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simultaneously achieve these two goals in distributed resource allocation problems over directed networks. Finally, numerical simulations on economic dispatch problems within the IEEE 14-bus system illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Multivariable control of modular multilevel converters with convergence and safety guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Well-designed current control is a key factor in ensuring the efficient and safe operation of modular multilevel converters (MMCs). Even though this control problem involves multiple control objectives, conventional current control schemes are comprised of independently designed decoupled controllers, e.g., proportional-integral (PI) or proportional-resonant (PR). Due to the bilinearity of the MMC dynamics, tuning PI and PR controllers so that good performance and constraint satisfaction are guaranteed is quite challenging. This challenge becomes more relevant in an AC/AC MMC configuration due to the complexity of tracking the single-phase sinusoidal components of the MMC output. In this paper, we propose a method to design a multivariable controller, i.e., a static feedback gain, to regulate the MMC currents. We use a physics-informed transformation to model the MMC dynamics linearly and synthesise the proposed controller. We use this linear model to formulate a linear matrix inequality that computes a feedback gain that guarantees safe and effective operation, including (i) limited tracking error, (ii) stability, and (iii) meeting all constraints. To test the efficacy of our method, we examine its performance in a direct AC/AC MMC simulated in Simulink/PLECS and in a scaled-down AC/AC MMC prototype to investigate the ultra-fast charging of electric vehicles.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Economic Model Predictive Control for linear systems with performance guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model predictive control (MPC) formulation to directly optimize economic criteria for linear constrained systems subject to disturbances and uncertain model parameters. The proposed formulation combines a certainty equivalent economic MPC with a simple least-squares parameter adaptation. For the resulting adaptive economic MPC scheme, we derive strong asymptotic and transient performance guarantees. We provide a numerical example involving building temperature control and demonstrate performance benefits of online parameter adaptation.</description>

      <title>Feedback Linearizable Discretizations of Second Order Mechanical Systems using Retraction Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical systems, in nature, are often described by a set of continuous-time, nonlinear, second-order differential equations (SODEs). This has motivated designs of various control laws implemented on digital controllers, consequently requiring numerical discretization schemes. Feedback linearizability of such sampled systems depends on the discretization scheme or map choice. In this article, we utilize retraction maps and their lifts to construct feedback linearizable discretizations for SODEs, which can be applied to various mechanical systems.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Programming Approach for Road Traffic Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a road network represented by a directed graph. We assume to collect many measurements of traffic flows on all the network arcs, or on a subset of them. We assume that the users are divided into different groups. Each group follows a different path. The flows of all user groups are modeled as a set of independent Poisson processes. Our focus is estimating the paths followed by each user group, and the means of the associated Poisson processes. We present a possible solution based on a Dynamic Programming algorithm. The method relies on the knowledge of high order cumulants. We discuss the theoretical properties of the introduced method. Finally, we present some numerical tests on well-known benchmark networks, using synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification with Constrained Polynomial Logical Zonotope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose using constrained polynomial logical zonotopes for formal verification of logical systems. We perform reachability analysis to compute the set of states that could be reached. To do this, we utilize a recently introduced set representation called polynomial logical zonotopes for performing computationally efficient and exact reachability analysis on logical systems. Notably, polynomial logical zonotopes address the "curse of dimensionality" when analyzing the reachability of logical systems since the set representation can represent 2^n binary vectors using n generators. After finishing the reachability analysis, the formal verification involves verifying whether the intersection of the calculated reachable set and the unsafe set is empty or not. However, polynomial logical zonotopes are not closed under intersections. To address this, we formulate constrained polynomial logical zonotopes, which maintain the computational efficiency and exactness of polynomial logical zonotopes for reachability analysis while supporting exact intersections. Furthermore, we present an extensive empirical study illustrating and verifying the benefits of using constrained polynomial logical zonotopes for the formal verification of logical systems.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Guarantees: Stability and Performance Analysis for Dynamic Encrypted Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encrypted dynamic controllers that operate for an unlimited time have been a challenging subject of research. The fundamental difficulty is the accumulation of errors and scaling factors in the internal state during operation. Bootstrapping, a technique commonly employed in fully homomorphic cryptosystems, can be used to avoid overflows in the controller state but can potentially introduce significant numerical errors. In this paper, we analyze dynamic encrypted control with explicit consideration of bootstrapping. By recognizing the bootstrapping errors occurring in the controller's state as an uncertainty in the robust control framework, we can provide stability and performance guarantees for the whole encrypted control system. Further, the conservatism of the stability and performance test is reduced by using a lifted version of the control system.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control Synthesis of Markov Decision Processes for Efficiency with Surveillance Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of optimal control synthesis for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), addressing both qualitative and quantitative objectives. Specifically, we require the system to fulfill a qualitative surveillance task in the sense that a specific region of interest can be visited infinitely often with probability one. Furthermore, to quantify the performance of the system, we consider the concept of efficiency, which is defined as the ratio between rewards and costs. This measure is more general than the standard long-run average reward metric as it aims to maximize the reward obtained per unit cost. Our objective is to synthesize a control policy that ensures the surveillance task while maximizes the efficiency. We provide an effective approach to synthesize a stationary control policy achieving $\epsilon$-optimality by integrating state classifications of MDPs and perturbation analysis in a novel manner. Our results generalize existing works on efficiency-optimal control synthesis for MDP by incorporating qualitative surveillance tasks. A robot motion planning case study is provided to illustrate the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>MPC-CBF with Adaptive Safety Margins for Safety-critical Teleoperation over Imperfect Network Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper focuses on the design of a control strategy for safety-critical remote teleoperation. The main goal is to make the controlled system track the desired velocity specified by an operator while avoiding obstacles despite communication delays. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are used to define the safety constraints that the system has to respect to avoid obstacles, while Model Predictive Control (MPC) provides the framework for adjusting the desired input, taking the constraints into account. The resulting input is sent to the remote system, where appropriate low-level velocity controllers translate it into system-specific commands. The main novelty of the paper is a method to make the CBFs robust against the uncertainties caused by the network delays affecting the system's state and do so in a less conservative manner. The results show how the proposed method successfully solves the safety-critical teleoperation problem, making the controlled systems avoid obstacles with different types of network delay. The controller has also been tested in simulation and on a real manipulator, demonstrating its general applicability when reliable low-level velocity controllers are available.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Risk-aware Branch MPC for Automated Driving that is Robust to Uncertain Vehicle Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the critical challenges in automated driving is ensuring safety of automated vehicles despite the unknown behavior of the other vehicles. Although motion prediction modules are able to generate a probability distribution associated with various behavior modes, their probabilistic estimates are often inaccurate, thus leading to a possibly unsafe trajectory. To overcome this challenge, we propose a risk-aware motion planning framework that appropriately accounts for the ambiguity in the estimated probability distribution. We formulate the risk-aware motion planning problem as a min-max optimization problem and develop an efficient iterative method by incorporating a regularization term in the probability update step. Via extensive numerical studies, we validate the convergence of our method and demonstrate its advantages compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Fpga-Based Neural Thrust Controller for UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has improved a variety of fields by providing a versatile, cost-effective and accessible platform for implementing state-of-the-art algorithms. To accomplish a broader range of tasks, there is a growing need for enhanced on-board computing to cope with increasing complexity and dynamic environmental conditions. Recent advances have seen the application of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), particularly in combination with Reinforcement Learning (RL), to improve the adaptability and performance of UAVs, especially in unknown environments. However, the computational requirements of DNNs pose a challenge to the limited computing resources available on many UAVs. This work explores the use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) as a viable solution to this challenge, offering flexibility, high performance, energy and time efficiency. We propose a novel hardware board equipped with an Artix-7 FPGA for a popular open-source micro-UAV platform. We successfully validate its functionality by implementing an RL-based low-level controller using real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Circuit-centric Genetic Algorithm (CGA) for Analog and Radio-Frequency Circuit Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an automated method for optimizing parameters in analog/high-frequency circuits, aiming to maximize performance parameters of a radio-frequency (RF) receiver. The design target includes a reduction of power consumption and noise figure and an increase in conversion gain. This study investigates the use of an artificial algorithm for the optimization of a receiver, illustrating how to fulfill the performance parameters with diverse circuit parameters. To overcome issues observed in the traditional Genetic Algorithm (GA), the concept of the Circuit-centric Genetic Algorithm (CGA) is proposed as a viable approach. The new method adopts an inference process that is simpler and computationally more efficient than the existing deep learning models. In addition, CGA offers significant advantages over manual design of finding optimal points and the conventional GA, mitigating the designer's workload while searching for superior optimum points.</description>

      <title>Code Generation for Conic Model-Predictive Control on Microcontrollers with TinyMPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conic constraints appear in many important control applications like legged locomotion, robotic manipulation, and autonomous rocket landing. However, current solvers for conic optimization problems have relatively heavy computational demands in terms of both floating-point operations and memory footprint, making them impractical for use on small embedded devices. We extend TinyMPC, an open-source, high-speed solver targeting low-power embedded control applications, to handle second-order cone constraints. We also present code-generation software to enable deployment of TinyMPC on a variety of microcontrollers. We benchmark our generated code against state-of-the-art embedded QP and SOCP solvers, demonstrating a two-order-of-magnitude speed increase over ECOS while consuming less memory. Finally, we demonstrate TinyMPC's efficacy on the Crazyflie, a lightweight, resource-constrained quadrotor with fast dynamics. TinyMPC and its code-generation tools are publicly available at https://tinympc.org.</description>

      <title>A Study of Three Influencer Archetypes for the Control of Opinion Spread in Time-Varying Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the impact of information spread in time-varying social networks, where agents request to follow other agents with aligned opinions while dropping ties to neighbors whose posts are too dissimilar to their own views. Opinion control and rhetorical influence has a very long history, employing various methods including education, persuasion, propaganda, marketing, and manipulation through mis-, dis-, and mal-information. The automation of opinion controllers, however, has only recently become easily deployable at a wide scale, with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI that can translate the quantified commands from opinion controllers into actual content with the appropriate nuance. Automated agents in social networks can be deployed for various purposes, such as breaking up echo chambers, bridging valuable new connections between agents, or shaping the opinions of a target population -- and all of these raise important ethical concerns that deserve serious attention and thoughtful discussion and debate. This paper attempts to contribute to this discussion by considering three archetypal influencing styles observed by human drivers in these settings, comparing and contrasting the impact of these different control methods on the opinions of agents in the network. We will demonstrate the efficacy of current generative AI for generating nuanced content consistent with the command signal from automatic opinion controllers like these, and we will report on frameworks for approaching the relevant ethical considerations.</description>

      <title>HyRRT-Connect: A Bidirectional Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees Motion Planning Algorithm for Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a bidirectional rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) algorithm to solve the motion planning problem for hybrid systems. The proposed algorithm, called HyRRT-Connect, propagates in both forward and backward directions in hybrid time until an overlap between the forward and backward propagation results is detected. Then, HyRRT-Connect constructs a motion plan through the reversal and concatenation of functions defined on hybrid time domains, ensuring the motion plan thoroughly satisfies the given hybrid dynamics. To address the potential discontinuity along the flow caused by tolerating some distance between the forward and backward partial motion plans, we reconstruct the backward partial motion plan by a forward-in-hybrid-time simulation from the final state of the forward partial motion plan. By applying the reversed input of the backward partial motion plan, the reconstruction process effectively eliminates the discontinuity and ensures that as the tolerance distance decreases to zero, the distance between the endpoint of the reconstructed motion plan and the final state set approaches zero. The proposed algorithm is applied to an actuated bouncing ball example and a walking robot example so as to highlight its generality and computational improvement.</description>

      <title>Safe and Robust Reinforcement-Learning: Principles and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in solving relatively complex tasks, yet the deployment of RL systems in real-world scenarios poses significant challenges related to safety and robustness. This paper aims to identify and further understand those challenges thorough the exploration of the main dimensions of the safe and robust RL landscape, encompassing algorithmic, ethical, and practical considerations. We conduct a comprehensive review of methodologies and open problems that summarizes the efforts in recent years to address the inherent risks associated with RL applications.
  After discussing and proposing definitions for both safe and robust RL, the paper categorizes existing research works into different algorithmic approaches that enhance the safety and robustness of RL agents. We examine techniques such as uncertainty estimation, optimisation methodologies, exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and adversarial training. Environmental factors, including sim-to-real transfer and domain adaptation, are also scrutinized to understand how RL systems can adapt to diverse and dynamic surroundings. Moreover, human involvement is an integral ingredient of the analysis, acknowledging the broad set of roles that humans can take in this context.
  Importantly, to aid practitioners in navigating the complexities of safe and robust RL implementation, this paper introduces a practical checklist derived from the synthesized literature. The checklist encompasses critical aspects of algorithm design, training environment considerations, and ethical guidelines. It will serve as a resource for developers and policymakers alike to ensure the responsible deployment of RL systems in many application domains.</description>

      <title>Stability Properties of the Impulsive Goodwin's Oscillator in 1-cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Impulsive Goodwin's Oscillator (IGO) is a mathematical model of a hybrid closed-loop system. It arises by closing a special kind of continuous linear positive time-invariant system with impulsive feedback, which employs both amplitude and frequency pulse modulation. The structure of IGO precludes the existence of equilibria, and all its solutions are oscillatory. With its origin in mathematical biology, the IGO also presents a control paradigm useful in a wide range of applications, in particular dosing of chemicals and medicines. Since the pulse modulation feedback mechanism introduces significant nonlinearity and non-smoothness in the closedloop dynamics, conventional controller design methods fail to apply. However, the hybrid dynamics of IGO reduce to a nonlinear, time-invariant discrete-time system, exhibiting a one-to-one correspondence between periodic solutions of the original IGO and those of the discrete-time system. The paper proposes a design approach that leverages the linearization of the equivalent discrete-time dynamics in the vicinity of a fixed point. A simple and efficient local stability condition of the 1-cycle in terms of the characteristics of the amplitude and frequency modulation functions is obtained.</description>

      <title>From Virtual Reality to the Emerging Discipline of Perception Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper makes the case that a powerful new discipline, which we term perception engineering, is steadily emerging. It follows from a progression of ideas that involve creating illusions, from historical paintings and film, to video games and virtual reality in modern times. Rather than creating physical artifacts such as bridges, airplanes, or computers, perception engineers create illusory perceptual experiences. The scope is defined over any agent that interacts with the physical world, including both biological organisms (humans, animals) and engineered systems (robots, autonomous systems). The key idea is that an agent, called a producer, alters the environment with the intent to alter the perceptual experience of another agent, called a receiver. Most importantly, the paper introduces a precise mathematical formulation of this process, based on the von Neumann-Morgenstern notion of information, to help scope and define the discipline. It is then applied to the cases of engineered and biological agents with discussion of its implications on existing fields such as virtual reality, robotics, and even social media. Finally, open challenges and opportunities for involvement are identified.</description>

      <title>Addressing Data Annotation Challenges in Multiple Sensors: A Solution for Scania Collected Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data annotation in autonomous vehicles is a critical step in the development of Deep Neural Network (DNN) based models or the performance evaluation of the perception system. This often takes the form of adding 3D bounding boxes on time-sequential and registered series of point-sets captured from active sensors like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR). When annotating multiple active sensors, there is a need to motion compensate and translate the points to a consistent coordinate frame and timestamp respectively. However, highly dynamic objects pose a unique challenge, as they can appear at different timestamps in each sensor's data. Without knowing the speed of the objects, their position appears to be different in different sensor outputs. Thus, even after motion compensation, highly dynamic objects are not matched from multiple sensors in the same frame, and human annotators struggle to add unique bounding boxes that capture all objects. This article focuses on addressing this challenge, primarily within the context of Scania collected datasets. The proposed solution takes a track of an annotated object as input and uses the Moving Horizon Estimation (MHE) to robustly estimate its speed. The estimated speed profile is utilized to correct the position of the annotated box and add boxes to object clusters missed by the original annotation.</description>

      <title>Neural Network-Based Piecewise Survival Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a family of neural network-based survival models is presented. The models are specified based on piecewise definitions of the hazard function and the density function on a partitioning of the time; both constant and linear piecewise definitions are presented, resulting in a family of four models. The models can be seen as an extension of the commonly used discrete-time and piecewise exponential models and thereby add flexibility to this set of standard models. Using a simulated dataset the models are shown to perform well compared to the highly expressive, state-of-the-art energy-based model, while only requiring a fraction of the computation time.</description>

      <title>Connections between Reachability and Time Optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the concept of an equivalence relation between the set of optimal control problems. By leveraging this concept, we show that the boundary of the reachability set can be constructed by the solutions of time optimal problems. Alongside, a more generalized equivalence theorem is presented together. The findings facilitate the use of solution structures from a certain class of optimal control problems to address problems in corresponding equivalent classes. As a byproduct, we state and prove the construction methods of the reachability sets of three-dimensional curves with prescribed curvature bound. The findings are twofold: Firstly, we prove that any boundary point of the reachability set, with the terminal direction taken into account, can be accessed via curves of H, CSC, CCC, or their respective subsegments, where H denotes a helicoidal arc, C a circular arc with maximum curvature, and S a straight segment. Secondly, we show that any boundary point of the reachability set, without considering the terminal direction, can be accessed by curves of CC, CS, or their respective subsegments. These findings extend the developments presented in literature regarding planar curves, or Dubins car dynamics, into spatial curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For higher dimensions, we confirm that the problem of identifying the reachability set of curvature bounded paths subsumes the well-known Markov-Dubins problem. These advancements in understanding the reachability of curvature bounded paths in $\mathbb{R}^3$ hold significant practical implications, particularly in the contexts of mission planning problems and time optimal guidance.</description>

      <title>Usage-Specific Survival Modeling Based on Operational Data and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate predictions of when a component will fail are crucial when planning maintenance, and by modeling the distribution of these failure times, survival models have shown to be particularly useful in this context. The presented methodology is based on conventional neural network-based survival models that are trained using data that is continuously gathered and stored at specific times, called snapshots. An important property of this type of training data is that it can contain more than one snapshot from a specific individual which results in that standard maximum likelihood training can not be directly applied since the data is not independent. However, the papers show that if the data is in a specific format where all snapshot times are the same for all individuals, called homogeneously sampled, maximum likelihood training can be applied and produce desirable results. In many cases, the data is not homogeneously sampled and in this case, it is proposed to resample the data to make it homogeneously sampled. How densely the dataset is sampled turns out to be an important parameter; it should be chosen large enough to produce good results, but this also increases the size of the dataset which makes training slow. To reduce the number of samples needed during training, the paper also proposes a technique to, instead of resampling the dataset once before the training starts, randomly resample the dataset at the start of each epoch during the training. The proposed methodology is evaluated on both a simulated dataset and an experimental dataset of starter battery failures. The results show that if the data is homogeneously sampled the methodology works as intended and produces accurate survival models. The results also show that randomly resampling the dataset on each epoch is an effective way to reduce the size of the training data.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Control Allocation: A Learning Based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.06180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern aircraft are designed with redundant control effectors to cater for fault tolerance and maneuverability requirements. This leads to aircraft being over-actuated and requires control allocation schemes to distribute the control commands among control effectors. Traditionally, optimization-based control allocation schemes are used; however, for nonlinear allocation problems, these methods require large computational resources. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) based nonlinear control allocation scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme is composed of learning the inverse of the control effectiveness map through ANN, and then implementing it as an allocator instead of solving an online optimization problem. Stability conditions are presented for closed-loop systems incorporating the allocator, and computational challenges are explored with piece-wise linear effectiveness functions and ANN-based allocators. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme, it is compared with a standard quadratic programming-based method for control allocation.</description>

      <title>Redesigning Large-Scale Multimodal Transit Networks with Shared Autonomous Mobility Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16075v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses a large-scale multimodal transit network design problem, with Shared Autonomous Mobility Services (SAMS) as both transit feeders and an origin-to-destination mode. The framework captures spatial demand and modal characteristics, considers intermodal transfers and express services, determines transit infrastructure investment and path flows, and generates transit routes. A system-optimal multimodal transit network is designed with minimum total door-to-door generalized costs of users and operators, satisfying transit origin-destination demand within a pre-set infrastructure budget. Firstly, the geography, demand, and modes in each zone are characterized with continuous approximation. The decisions of network link investment and multimodal path flows in zonal connection optimization are formulated as a minimum-cost multi-commodity network flow (MCNF) problem and solved efficiently with a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solver. Subsequently, the route generation problem is solved by expanding the MCNF formulation to minimize intramodal transfers. The model is illustrated through a set of experiments with the Chicago network comprised of 50 zones and seven modes, under three scenarios. The computational results present savings in traveler journey time and operator cost demonstrating the potential benefits of collaboration between multimodal transit systems and SAMS.</description>

      <title>Aggregate Model of District Heating Network for Integrated Energy Dispatch: A Physically Informed Data-Driven Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The district heating network (DHN) is essential in enhancing the operational flexibility of integrated energy systems (IES). Yet, it is hard to obtain an accurate and concise DHN model for the operation owing to complicated network features and imperfect measurements. Considering this, this paper proposes a physical-ly informed data-driven aggregate model (AGM) for the DHN, providing a concise description of the source-load relationship of DHN without exposing network details. First, we derive the analytical relationship between the state variables of the source and load nodes of the DHN, offering a physical fundament for the AGM. Second, we propose a physics-informed estimator for the AGM that is robust to low-quality measurements, in which the physical constraints associated with the parameter normalization and sparsity are embedded to improve the accuracy and robustness. Finally, we propose a physics-enhanced algorithm to solve the nonlinear estimator with non-closed constraints efficiently. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Unconstrained learning of networked nonlinear systems via free parametrization of stable interconnected operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper characterizes a new parametrization of nonlinear networked incrementally $L_2$-bounded operators in discrete time. The distinctive novelty is that our parametrization is \emph{free} -- that is, a sparse large-scale operator with bounded incremental $L_2$ gain is obtained for any choice of the real values of our parameters. This property allows one to freely search over optimal parameters via unconstrained gradient descent, enabling direct applications in large-scale optimal control and system identification. Further, we can embed prior knowledge about the interconnection topology and stability properties of the system directly into the large-scale distributed operator we design. Our approach is extremely general in that it can seamlessly encapsulate and interconnect state-of-the-art Neural Network (NN) parametrizations of stable dynamical systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we provide a simulation example showcasing the identification of a networked nonlinear system. The results underscore the superiority of our free parametrizations over standard NN-based identification methods where a prior over the system topology and local stability properties are not enforced.</description>

      <title>Robust Commutation Design: Applied to Switched Reluctance Motors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Switched Reluctance Motors (SRMs) are cost-effective electric actuators that utilize magnetic reluctance to generate torque, with torque ripple arising from unaccounted manufacturing defects in the rotor tooth geometry. This paper aims to design a versatile, resource-efficient commutation function for accurate control of a range of SRMs, mitigating torque ripple despite manufacturing variations across SRMs and individual rotor teeth. The developed commutation function optimally distributes current between coils by leveraging the variance in the torque-current-angle model and is designed with few parameters for easy integration on affordable hardware. Monte Carlo simulations and experimental results show a tracking error reduction of up to 31% and 11%, respectively. The developed approach is beneficial for applications using a single driver for multiple systems and those constrained by memory or modeling effort, providing an economical solution for improved tracking performance and reduced acoustic noise.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Disturbance Rejection Performance by Synthesizing Grid-Following and Grid-Forming Inverters in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To satisfy dynamic requirements of power systems, it is imperative for grid-tied inverters to ensure good disturbance rejection performance (DRP) under variable grid conditions. This letter discovers and theoretically proves that for general networks, synthesizing grid-following (GFL) inverters and grid-forming (GFM) inverters can always more effectively ensure the DRP of multiple inverters, as compared to homogeneous inverter-based systems that solely utilize either GFL or GFM inverters. The synthesis of GFL inverters and GFM inverters can concurrently increase the smallest eigenvalue and decrease the largest eigenvalue of the network grounded Laplacian matrix. This can be equivalent to rematching the proper short-circuit ratio (SCR) for GFL and GFM inverters, thereby ensuring the DRP of inverters both in weak and strong grids. The results reveal the necessity of synthesizing diverse inverter control schemes from the network-based perspective. Sensitivity function-based tests and real-time simulations validate our results.</description>

Abstract: We present CrystalBox, a novel, model-agnostic, posthoc explainability framework for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) controllers in the large family of input-driven environments which includes computer systems. We combine the natural decomposability of reward functions in input-driven environments with the explanatory power of decomposed returns. We propose an efficient algorithm to generate future-based explanations across both discrete and continuous control environments. Using applications such as adaptive bitrate streaming and congestion control, we demonstrate CrystalBox's capability to generate high-fidelity explanations. We further illustrate its higher utility across three practical use cases: contrastive explanations, network observability, and guided reward design, as opposed to prior explainability techniques that identify salient features.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Performance, Calibration Time and Efficiency in Brain-Machine Interfaces through Transfer Learning and Wearable EEG Technology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have emerged as a transformative force in assistive technologies, empowering individuals with motor impairments by enabling device control and facilitating functional recovery. However, the persistent challenge of inter-session variability poses a significant hurdle, requiring time-consuming calibration at every new use. Compounding this issue, the low comfort level of current devices further restricts their usage. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive solution that combines a tiny CNN-based Transfer Learning (TL) approach with a comfortable, wearable EEG headband. The novel wearable EEG device features soft dry electrodes placed on the headband and is capable of on-board processing. We acquire multiple sessions of motor-movement EEG data and achieve up to 96% inter-session accuracy using TL, greatly reducing the calibration time and improving usability. By executing the inference on the edge every 100ms, the system is estimated to achieve 30h of battery life. The comfortable BMI setup with tiny CNN and TL paves the way to future on-device continual learning, essential for tackling inter-session variability and improving usability.</description>

Abstract: In fields such as mining, search and rescue, and archaeological exploration, ensuring real-time, collision-free navigation of robots in confined, cluttered environments is imperative. Despite the value of established path planning algorithms, they often face challenges in convergence rates and handling dynamic infeasibilities. Alternative techniques like collision cones struggle to accurately represent complex obstacle geometries. This paper introduces a novel category of control barrier functions, known as Polygonal Cone Control Barrier Function (PolyC2BF), which addresses overestimation and computational complexity issues. The proposed PolyC2BF, formulated as a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem, proves effective in facilitating collision-free movement of multiple robots in complex environments. The efficacy of this approach is further demonstrated through PyBullet simulations on quadruped (unicycle model), and crazyflie 2.1 (quadrotor model) in cluttered environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of neural networks into safety-critical systems has shown great potential in recent years. However, the challenge of effectively verifying the safety of Neural Network Controlled Systems (NNCS) persists. This paper introduces a novel approach to NNCS safety verification, leveraging the inductive invariant method. Verifying the inductiveness of a candidate inductive invariant in the context of NNCS is hard because of the scale and nonlinearity of neural networks. Our compositional method makes this verification process manageable by decomposing the inductiveness proof obligation into smaller, more tractable subproblems. Alongside the high-level method, we present an algorithm capable of automatically verifying the inductiveness of given candidates by automatically inferring the necessary decomposition predicates. The algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline method and shows remarkable reductions in execution time in our case studies, shortening the verification time from hours (or timeout) to seconds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational efficiency and non-adversarial robustness are critical factors in real-world engineering applications. Yet, conventional neural networks often fall short in addressing both simultaneously, or even separately. Drawing insights from natural physical systems and existing literature, it is known that an input convex architecture enhances computational efficiency, while a Lipschitz-constrained architecture bolsters non-adversarial robustness. By leveraging the strengths of convexity and Lipschitz continuity, we develop a novel network architecture, termed Input Convex Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Networks. This model is explicitly designed for fast and robust optimization-based tasks and outperforms existing recurrent units across a spectrum of engineering tasks in terms of computational efficiency and non-adversarial robustness, including real-world solar irradiance prediction for Solar PV system planning at LHT Holdings in Singapore and real-time Model Predictive Control optimization for a nonlinear chemical reactor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation to reality (sim2real) transfer from a dynamics and controls perspective usually involves re-tuning or adapting the designed algorithms to suit real-world operating conditions, which often violates the performance guarantees established originally. This work presents a generalizable framework for achieving reliable sim2real transfer of autonomy-oriented control systems using multi-model multi-objective robust optimal control synthesis, which lends well to uncertainty handling and disturbance rejection with theoretical guarantees. Particularly, this work is centered around a novel actuation-redundant scaled autonomous vehicle called Nigel, with independent all-wheel drive and independent all-wheel steering architecture, whose enhanced configuration space bodes well for robust control applications. To this end, we present the mechatronic design, dynamics modeling, parameter identification, and robust stabilizing as well as tracking control of Nigel using the proposed framework, with exhaustive experimentation and benchmarking in simulation as well as real-world settings.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by applications in large-scale and multi-agent reinforcement learning, we study the non-asymptotic performance of stochastic approximation (SA) schemes with delayed updates under Markovian sampling. While the effect of delays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they interact with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time performance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main contribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA update rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \emph{last iterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is \emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\tau_{max}$, and the mixing time $\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel inductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization analyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such, our proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the maximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time analysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling. In particular, we show that the exponent of convergence of this scheme gets scaled down by $\tau_{avg}$, as opposed to $\tau_{max}$ for the vanilla delayed SA rule; here, $\tau_{avg}$ denotes the average delay across all iterations. Moreover, the adaptive scheme requires no prior knowledge of the delay sequence for step-size tuning. Our theoretical findings shed light on the finite-time effects of delays for a broad class of algorithms, including TD learning, Q-learning, and stochastic gradient descent under Markovian sampling.</description>

Abstract: Navigating multi-robot systems in complex terrains has always been a challenging task. This is due to the inherent limitations of traditional robots in collision avoidance, adaptation to unknown environments, and sustained energy efficiency. In order to overcome these limitations, this research proposes a solution by integrating living insects with miniature electronic controllers to enable robotic-like programmable control, and proposing a novel control algorithm for swarming. Although these creatures, called cyborg insects, have the ability to instinctively avoid collisions with neighbors and obstacles while adapting to complex terrains, there is a lack of literature on the control of multi-cyborg systems. This research gap is due to the difficulty in coordinating the movements of a cyborg system under the presence of insects' inherent individual variability in their reactions to control input. In response to this issue, we propose a novel swarm navigation algorithm addressing these challenges. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated through an experimental validation in which a cyborg swarm was successfully navigated through an unknown sandy field with obstacles and hills. This research contributes to the domain of swarm robotics and showcases the potential of integrating biological organisms with robotics and control theory to create more intelligent autonomous systems with real-world applications.</description>
