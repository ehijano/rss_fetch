      <title>Multilevel Particle Filters for Partially Observed McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the filtering problem associated to partially observed McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The model consists of data that are observed at regular and discrete times and the objective is to compute the conditional expectation of (functionals) of the solutions of the SDE at the current time. This problem, even the ordinary SDE case is challenging and requires numerical approximations. Based upon the ideas in [3, 12] we develop a new particle filter (PF) and multilevel particle filter (MLPF) to approximate the afore-mentioned expectations. We prove under assumptions that, for $\epsilon&gt;0$, to obtain a mean square error of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ the PF has a cost per-observation time of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-5})$ and the MLPF costs $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ (best case) or $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4}\log(\epsilon)^2)$ (worst case). Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Loss Estimation on Gibbs Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15649</link>

Abstract: In recent years, the shortcomings of Bayes posteriors as inferential devices has received increased attention. A popular strategy for fixing them has been to instead target a Gibbs measure based on losses that connect a parameter of interest to observed data. While existing theory for such inference procedures relies on these losses to be analytically available, in many situations these losses must be stochastically estimated using pseudo-observations. The current paper fills this research gap, and derives the first asymptotic theory for Gibbs measures based on estimated losses. Our findings reveal that the number of pseudo-observations required to accurately approximate the exact Gibbs measure depends on the rates at which the bias and variance of the estimated loss converge to zero. These results are particularly consequential for the emerging field of generalised Bayesian inference, for estimated intractable likelihoods, and for biased pseudo-marginal approaches. We apply our results to three Gibbs measures that have been proposed to deal with intractable likelihoods and model misspecification.</description>

      <title>Spatial best linear unbiased prediction: A computational mathematics approach for high dimensional massive datasets</title>

Abstract: With the advent of massive data sets much of the computational science and engineering community has moved toward data-intensive approaches in regression and classification. However, these present significant challenges due to increasing size, complexity and dimensionality of the problems. In particular, covariance matrices in many cases are numerically unstable and linear algebra shows that often such matrices cannot be inverted accurately on a finite precision computer. A common ad hoc approach to stabilizing a matrix is application of a so-called nugget. However, this can change the model and introduce error to the original solution. It is well known from numerical analysis that ill-conditioned matrices cannot be accurately inverted. In this paper we develop a multilevel computational method that scales well with the number of observations and dimensions. A multilevel basis is constructed adapted to a kD-tree partitioning of the observations. Numerically unstable covariance matrices with large condition numbers can be transformed into well conditioned multilevel ones without compromising accuracy. Moreover, it is shown that the multilevel prediction exactly solves the Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP) and Generalized Least Squares (GLS) model, but is numerically stable. The multilevel method is tested on numerically unstable problems of up to 25 dimensions. Numerical results show speedups of up to 42,050 times for solving the BLUP problem, but with the same accuracy as the traditional iterative approach. For very ill-conditioned cases the speedup is infinite. In addition, decay estimates of the multilevel covariance matrices are derived based on high dimensional interpolation techniques from the field of numerical analysis. This work lies at the intersection of statistics, uncertainty quantification, high performance computing and computational applied mathematics.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Weighted Moving Models</title>

Abstract: An exponentially weighted moving model (EWMM) for a vector time series fits a new data model each time period, based on an exponentially fading loss function on past observed data. The well known and widely used exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) is a special case that estimates the mean using a square loss function. For quadratic loss functions EWMMs can be fit using a simple recursion that updates the parameters of a quadratic function. For other loss functions, the entire past history must be stored, and the fitting problem grows in size as time increases. We propose a general method for computing an approximation of EWMM, which requires storing only a window of a fixed number of past samples, and uses an additional quadratic term to approximate the loss associated with the data before the window. This approximate EWMM relies on convex optimization, and solves problems that do not grow with time. We compare the estimates produced by our approximation with the estimates from the exact EWMM method.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for the Latent Shrinkage Position Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latent position model (LPM) is a popular method used in network data analysis where nodes are assumed to be positioned in a $p$-dimensional latent space. The latent shrinkage position model (LSPM) is an extension of the LPM which automatically determines the number of effective dimensions of the latent space via a Bayesian nonparametric shrinkage prior. However, the LSPM reliance on Markov chain Monte Carlo for inference, while rigorous, is computationally expensive, making it challenging to scale to networks with large numbers of nodes. We introduce a variational inference approach for the LSPM, aiming to reduce computational demands while retaining the model's ability to intrinsically determine the number of effective latent dimensions. The performance of the variational LSPM is illustrated through simulation studies and its application to real-world network data. To promote wider adoption and ease of implementation, we also provide open-source code.</description>

      <title>A sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of neuroimaging preprocessing strategies on subsequent statistical analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Even though novel imaging techniques have been successful in studying brain structure and function, the measured biological signals are often contaminated by multiple sources of noise, arising due to e.g. head movements of the individual being scanned, limited spatial/temporal resolution, or other issues specific to each imaging technology. Data preprocessing (e.g. denoising) is therefore critical. Preprocessing pipelines have become increasingly complex over the years, but also more flexible, and this flexibility can have a significant impact on the final results and conclusions of a given study. This large parameter space is often referred to as multiverse analyses. Here, we provide conceptual and practical tools for statistical analyses that can aggregate multiple pipeline results along with a new sensitivity analysis testing for hypotheses across pipelines such as "no effect across all pipelines" or "at least one pipeline with no effect". The proposed framework is generic and can be applied to any multiverse scenario, but we illustrate its use based on positron emission tomography data.</description>
