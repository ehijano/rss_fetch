      <title>Une interpretation du spin en mecanique relativiste</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims at studying the spin once again. The departure point is thus the Stern and Gerlach experimental results that can be described in a coherent way in the frame of quantum mechanics only. Instead, the relativistic mechanics point of view is proposed here following the work presented in a previous article about rigid body rotation. Indeed, a careful study of the horizon of this relativistic rigid body rotation appears to be invariant from any observation angle in full agreement with the spin property.</description>

      <title>The Reasonable Ineffectiveness of Aesthetics in Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, criticism of the methodology of particle physics beyond the Standard Model has increased, diagnosing too much reliance on aesthetic criteria for theory development and evaluation. Faced with several decades of experimental confirmation of all theories lacking, we subject four aesthetic criteria - simplicity, symmetry, elegance, and inevitability -, regularly mentioned in theory evaluation, to critical examination. We find that these criteria, all of which can be reduced to a desire for simplicity, have repeatedly misled modern particle physics. This is largely due to the lack of metatheoretical permanence of a uniform conception of simplicity. The reductionist claim of particle physics - the search for simple fundamental principles in a complex world - will be worked out as the reason why this discipline is particularly susceptible to the aesthetic appeal of simplicity. Thus, compared to disciplines dealing with complex phenomena, aesthetic criteria are much more frequently applied, exposing particle physics to the risk of missteps and dead ends.</description>

      <title>Are General Relativity and Teleparallel Gravity Theoretically Equivalent?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teleparallel gravity shares many qualitative features with general relativity, but differs from it in the following way: whereas in general relativity, gravitation is a manifestation of space-time curvature, in teleparallel gravity, spacetime is (always) flat. Gravitational effects in this theory arise due to spacetime torsion. It is often claimed that teleparallel gravity is an equivalent reformulation of general relativity. In this paper we question that view. We argue that the theories are not equivalent, by the criterion of categorical equivalence and any stronger criterion, and that teleparallel gravity posits strictly more structure than general relativity.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional representation of semantic relations between physical theories, fundamental constants and units of measurement with formal concept analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose several hierarchical graphs that represent the semantic relations between physical theories, their fundamental constants and units of measurement. We begin with an alternative representation of Zelmanov's cube of fundamental constants as a concept lattice. We then propose the inclusion of a new fundamental constant: Milgrom's critical acceleration and discuss the implications of such analysis. We then look for the same fundamental constants in a graph that relates magnitudes and units of measurement in the International System of Units. This exercise shows the potential of visualizing hierarchical networks as a tool to better comprehend the interrelations and dependencies of physical magnitudes, units and theories. New regimes of application may be deduced, as well as an interesting reflection on our ontologies and corresponding theoretical objects.</description>

      <title>In Memoriam: Peter Higgs (1929-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peter Higgs was a British theoretical physicist, famous for his work published in 1964, where he proposed a mechanism that can generate masses for elementary particles, while respecting gauge invariance. Half a century later, two experiments at CERN confirmed that this mechanism is realized in nature. On April 8th, we received the sad news of the passing of the great pioneer of elementary particle physics. This article is dedicated to his memory, and to the mechanism and particle that bear his name.

Medio siglo m\'as tarde, dos experimentos del CERN confirmaron que este mecanismo est\'a realizado en la naturaleza. El 8 de abril nos lleg\'o la triste noticia del fallecimiento del gran pionero de la fisica de part\'iculas elementales.

      <title>Implications of computer science theory for the simulation hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulation hypothesis has recently excited renewed interest, especially in the physics and philosophy communities. However, the hypothesis specifically concerns \textit{computers} that simulate physical universes, which means that to formally investigate it we need to couple computer science theory with physics. Here I couple those fields with the physical Church-Turing thesis. I then exploit that coupling to investigate of some of the computer science theory aspects of the simulation hypothesis. In particular, I use Kleene's second recursion theorem to prove that it is mathematically possible for us to be a simulation that is being run on a computer - by us. In such a self-simulation, there would be two identical instances of us; the question of which of those is ``really us'' is meaningless. I also show how Rice's theorem provides some interesting impossibility results concerning simulation and self-simulation; briefly describe the philosophical implications of fully homomorphic encryption for (self-)simulation; and briefly investigate the graphical structure of universes simulating universes simulating universes ..., among other issues. I end by describing some of the possible avenues for future research.</description>
