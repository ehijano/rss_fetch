      <title>Steady periodic hydroelastic waves on the water surface of finite depth with constant vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study analyzes steady periodic hydroelastic waves propagating on the water surface of finite depth beneath nonlinear elastic membranes. Unlike previous work \cite{BaldiT,BaldiT1,Toland,Toland1}, our formulation accommodates rotational flows in finite-depth water. We employ a conformal mapping technique to transform the free-boundary problem into a quasilinear pseudodifferential equation, resulting in a periodic function of a single variable. This reduction allows the existence question for such waves to be addressed within the framework of bifurcation theory. With the wavelength normalized to 2$\pi$, the problem features two free parameters: the wave speed and the constant vorticity. Under the assumption of the local convexity of undeformed membrane's stored energy, it is observed that the problem, when linearized about uniform horizontal flow, has at most two independent solutions for any values of the parameters. Fixing the vorticity and treating the wave speed as the bifurcation parameter, the linearized problem possesses a single solution. We demonstrate that the full nonlinear problem exhibits a sheet of solutions comprising a family of curves bifurcating from simple eigenvalues. Taking both the wave speed and vorticity as parameters, when the constant vorticity approaches critical values, the linearized problem exhibits a two-dimensional kernel. Near these critical points, a secondary bifurcation curve emerges from the primary solution branch. This secondary branch consists of ripple solutions on the surface.</description>

      <title>Coefficient Identification Problem with Integral Overdetermination Condition for Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a nonlinear inverse problem aimed at recovering a coefficient $a(t, x)$, dependent on both time and a subset of spatial variables, in a diffusion equation \( u_t - \Delta_x u - u_{yy} +a(t, x) u = f(t,x,y) \), using an additional measurement given as an integral over the spatial domain. Here \(x \in G \subset \mathbb{R}^m\) and \(y \in (0, \pi)\). We establish theorems on the existence and uniqueness of both local and global weak solutions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, under sufficient smoothness of the problem data, there exists a uniquely determined strong solution (both local and global) to the inverse problem. Our approach combines the Fourier method with a priori estimates. Previous studies have addressed similar inverse problems for parabolic equations defined over the entire space.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup for the infinite dimensional vorticity equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work with Tai-Peng Tsai, the author studied the dynamics of axisymmetric, swirl-free Euler equation in four and higher dimensions. One conclusion of this analysis is that the dynamics become dramatically more singular as the dimension increases. In particular, the barriers to finite-time blowup for smooth solutions which exist in three dimensions do not exist in higher dimensions $d\geq 4$. Motivated by this result, we will consider a model equation that is obtained by taking the formal limit of the scalar vorticity evolution equation as $d\to +\infty$. This model exhibits finite-time blowup of a Burgers shock type. The blowup result for the infinite dimensional model equation strongly suggests a mechanism for the finite-time blowup of smooth solutions of the Euler equation in sufficiently high dimensions. It is also possible to treat the full Euler equation as a perturbation of the infinite dimensional model equation, although this perturbation is highly singular.</description>

      <title>Optimal regularity for degenerate elliptic equations with Hamiltonian terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish optimal, quantitative H\"oder estimates for the gradient of solutions to a class of degenerate elliptic equations with Hamiltonian terms. The presence of such lower-order terms introduces additional challenges, particularly in regimes where the gradient is either very small or very large. Our approach adapts perturbative techniques to capture the interplay between the degeneracy rate and the Hamiltonian's growth. Our results naturally extend the regularity theory developed by Araujo-Ricarte-Teixeira (Calc. Var. 53:605-625, 2015) and Birindelli-Demengel (Nonlinear Differ. Equ. Appl. 23:41, 2016) to a more general setting.</description>

      <title>Micro-macro and macro-macro limits for controlled leader-follower systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a leader-follower system of interacting particles subject to feedback control and derive its mean-field limits through a two-step passage: first to a micro-macro system coupling leader particles with a follower fluid, and then to a fully continuum macro-macro system. For each limiting procedure, we establish quantitative stability and convergence estimates based on modulated energy methods and Wasserstein distances. These results provide a rigorous foundation for the hierarchical reduction of controlled multi-agent systems. Numerical simulations are presented, including examples with interaction potentials beyond the analytical class considered, to demonstrate the dynamics and support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of two-dimensional periodic waves in parabolic systems with conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a stability theory for two-dimensional periodic traveling waves of general parabolic systems, possibly including conservation laws. In particular, we identify a diffusive spectral stability assumption and prove that it implies nonlinear stability for variously-(non)localized perturbations, including critically nonlocalized perturbations. Thus we extend the stability parts of Johnson et al., Invent. Math. 2014, to two-dimensional patterns and of Melinand-Rodrigues, preprint 2024, to systems with conservation laws. In doing so we need to bypass two kinds of low spectral regularity, explicitly conic-like singularities due to multidimensionality and Jordan-block like singularities due to conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Smoothing effect for higher order dispersive equations and applications to nonlinear initial value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we deal with the initial value problem related to a family of dispersive inhomogeneous evolution equations Pu=f with variable coefficients belonging to the class of p-evolution equations, $p\geq 2$. We study the smoothing effect produced by some spatial decay assumptions on the imaginary part of the subleading coefficient of the linear operator P. Then we apply this result to nonlinear problems with derivative nonlinearities obtaining existence and uniqueness of the solution in a suitable Sobolev class. The nonlinear equations considered include various equations of physical interest such as KdV-type and Kawahara-type equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for a generalized two-component Novikov system with weak dissipation. We first establish the local well-posedness of solutions by using the Kato's theorem. Then we give the necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of wave breaking in a finite time. Finally, we investigate the persistence properties of strong solutions in the weighted $L^{p}(\mathbb{R})$ spaces for a large class of moderate weights.</description>

      <title>The effect of stratification on the stability of a rest state in the 2D inviscid Boussinesq system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate and quantify the effect of stratification on the stability time of a stably stratified rest state for the 2D inviscid Boussinesq system on $\mathbb{R}^2$. As an important consequence, we obtain stability of the steady state starting from an $\varepsilon$-sized initial perturbation of Sobolev regularity $H^{3^+}$ on a timescale $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4/3})$.
  In our setting, stratification induces dispersion and at the core of our approach are inhomogeneous Strichartz estimates used to control nonlinear contributions. This allows to keep only $L^2-$based regularity assumptions on the initial perturbation, whereas previous works impose additional localizations to achieve this timescale.
  We prove the analogous result for the related dispersive SQG equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the scattering coefficient of a simple radiative transport equation (RTE) used to model light propagation inside a scattering medium. To do so, we extract information from the second term in the collision expansion, that is, light that has been scattered by a single collision, for solutions to the RTE. We show that with proper sources and measurements, the scattering coefficient for the RTE can be obtained via an algebraic formula, resulting in a reconstruction with improved stability compared to the normal X-ray transform inversion method. We extend these theorems to apply to a multi-frequency setting in which photons change frequency after collisions. Then, we discuss potential applications of our theory for 3D image reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Effective interface laws of Navier-slip-type involving the elastic displacement for Stokes flow through a thin porous elastic layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous derivation of an effective model for fluid flow through a thin elastic porous membrane separating two fluid bulk domains. The microscopic setting involves a periodically structured porous membrane composed of a solid phase and fluid-filled pores, with thickness and periodicity of order $\varepsilon$, small compared to the size of the bulk regions. The microscopic model is governed by a coupled fluid-structure interaction system: instationary Stokes equations for the fluid and linear elasticity for the solid, with two distinct scalings of the elastic stress tensor yielding different effective behaviors.
  Using two-scale convergence techniques adapted to thin domains and oscillatory microstructures, the membrane is reduced to an effective interface across which transmission conditions are derived. The resulting macroscopic model couples the bulk fluid domains via effective interface laws of Navier-slip-type including the dynamic displacement. The character of this coupling depends critically on the choice of the scaling in the elastic stress tensor, leading to either a membrane equation or a Kirchhoff-Love plate equation for the effective displacement. The resulting interface conditions naturally admit mass exchange between the adjacent fluid regions. In the analytical framework, a new two-scale compactness theorem for the symmetric gradient is established, underpinning the passage to the limit in the coupled system. Moreover, cell problem techniques are employed systematically to construct admissible test functions and to rigorously extract the effective macroscopic coefficients.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Darcy-Brinkman flow with viscous dissipation and non-homogeneous thermal boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the steady-state Darcy-Brinkman flow within a thin, saturated porous domain, focusing on the effects of viscous dissipation and non-homogeneous boundary condition for the temperature. Employing asymptotic techniques with respect to the domain's thickness, we rigorously derive the simplified coupled model describing the fluid flow. The mathematical analysis is based on deriving the sharp a priori estimates and proving the compactness results of the rescaled functions. The resulting limit model incorporates contributions of viscous dissipation and thermal boundary conditions and thus could prove useful in the engineering applications involving porous media.</description>

      <title>Modeling non-Newtonian fluids in a thin domain perforated with cylinders of small diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the flow of a generalized Newtonian fluid through a thin porous medium of height $h_\varepsilon$ perforated with $\varepsilon$-periodically distributed solid cylinders of very small diameter $\varepsilon\delta_\varepsilon$, where the small parameters $\varepsilon, \delta_\varepsilon$ and $h_\varepsilon$ are devoted to tend to zero. We assume that the fluid is described by the 3D incompressible Stokes system with a non-linear power law viscosity of flow index $1&lt;r&lt;2$ (shear thinning). The particular case $h_\varepsilon=\sigma_\varepsilon$, where $\sigma_\varepsilon:=\varepsilon/\delta_\varepsilon^{{2-r\over r}}\to 0$, was recently published in (Anguiano and Su\'arez-Grau, \emph{Mediterr. J. Math.} (2021) 18:175). In this paper, we generalize previous study for any $h_\varepsilon$ and we provide a more complete description on the asymptotic behavior of non-Newtonian fluids in a thin porous medium composed by cylinders of small diameter. We prove that depending on the value of $\lambda:=\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\sigma_\varepsilon/h_\varepsilon\in [0,+\infty]$, there exist three types of lower-dimensional asymptotic models: a non-linear Darcy law in the case $\lambda=0$, a non-linear Brinkman-type law in the case $\lambda\in (0,+\infty)$, and a non-linear Reynolds law in the case $\lambda=+\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of hyperbolic approximations for several classes of higher-order PDEs, including the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony, Korteweg-de Vries, Gardner, Kawahara, and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, provided a smooth solution of the limiting problem exists. We only require weak (entropy) solutions of the hyperbolic approximations. Thereby, we provide a solid foundation for these approximations, which have been used in the literature without rigorous convergence analysis. We also present numerical results that support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between asymptotic characteristic initial data for the wave equation at past null infinity and the regularity of the solution at future null infinity on the Minkowski spacetime. By constructing estimates on a causal rectangle reaching the conformal boundary, we prove that the solution admits an asymptotic expansion near null and spatial infinity whose regularity is controlled quantitatively in terms of the regularity of the data at past null infinity. In particular, our method gives rise to solutions to the wave equation in a neighbourhood of spatial infinity satisfying the peeling behaviour, for data on past null infinity with non-compact support. Our approach makes use of Friedrich's conformal representation of spatial infinity in which we prove delicate non-degenerate Gr\"onwall estimates. We describe the relationship between the solution and the data both in terms of Friedrich's conformal coordinates and the usual physical coordinates on Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Scattering for wave equations with sources close to the lightcone and prescribed radiation fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10569v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct solutions with prescribed radiation fields for wave equations with polynomially decaying sources close to the lightcone. In this setting, which is motivated by semi-linear wave equations satisfying the weak null condition, solutions to the forward problem have a logarithmic leading order term on the lightcone and non-trivial homogeneous asymptotics in the interior of the lightcone. The backward scattering solutions we construct are given to second order by explicit asymptotic solutions in the wave zone, and in the interior of the light cone which satisfy novel matching conditions. In the process we find novel compatibility conditions for the scattering data at null infinity.
  We also relate the asymptotics of the radiation field towards space-like infinity to explicit homogeneous solutions in the exterior of the light cone. This is the setting of slowly polynomially decaying data corresponding to mass, charge and angular momentum in applications. We show that homogeneous data of degree -1 and -2 for the wave equation results in the same logarithmic terms on the lightcone and homogeneous asymptotics in the interior as for the equations with sources close to the lightcone. The proof requires a delicate analysis of the forward solution close to the light cone and uses the invertibility of the Funk transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a systematic approach based on trajectories to prove a Poincar\'e inequality for weak non-negative sub-solutions to hypoelliptic equations with an arbitrary number of H\"ormander commutators, both in the local and in the non-local case. As a consequence, we deduce the weak Harnack inequality and H\"older regularity along the line of the De Giorgi method.</description>

      <title>On the existence of extensions for manifold-valued Sobolev maps on perforated domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11690v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by manifold-constrained homogenization problems, we construct suitable extensions for Sobolev functions defined on a perforated domain and taking values in a compact, connected $C^2$-manifold without boundary. The proof combines a by now classical extension result for the unconstrained case with a retraction argument that heavily relies on the topological properties of the manifold. With the ultimate goal of providing necessary conditions for the existence of extensions for Sobolev maps between manifolds, we additionally investigate the relationship between this problem and the surjectivity of the trace operator for such functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with entropy solutions of scalar conservation laws of the form $\partial_{t}u+\diver f=0$ in $\mathbb{R}^d\times(0,\infty)$. The flux $f=f(x,u)$ depends explicitly on the spatial variable $x$. Using an extension of Kruzkov's method, we establish the $L^1$-contraction property of entropy solutions under minimal regularity assumptions on the flux.</description>

      <title>Drift-diffusion equations with saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on a family of nonlinear continuity equations for the evolution of a non-negative density $\rho$ with a continuous and compactly supported nonlinear mobility $\mathrm{m}(\rho)$ not necessarily concave. The velocity field is the negative gradient of the variation of a free energy including internal and confinement energy terms. Problems with compactly supported mobility are often called saturation problems since the values of the density are constrained below a maximal value. Taking advantage of a family of approximating problems, we show the existence of $C_0$-semigroups of $L^1$ contractions. We study the $\omega$-limit of the problem, its most relevant properties, and the appearance of free boundaries in the long-time behaviour. This problem has a formal gradient-flow structure, and we discuss the local/global minimisers of the corresponding free energy in the natural topology related to the set of initial data for the $L^\infty$-constrained gradient flow of probability densities. Furthermore, we analyse a structure preserving implicit finite-volume scheme and discuss its convergence and long-time behaviour.</description>

Abstract: The symmetrized Asymptotic Mean Value Laplacian $\tilde{\Delta}$, obtained as limit of approximating operators $\tilde{\Delta}_r$, is an extension of the classical Euclidean Laplace operator to the realm of metric measure spaces. We show that, as $r \downarrow 0$, the operators $\tilde{\Delta}_r$ eventually admit isolated eigenvalues defined via min-max procedure on any compact locally Ahlfors regular metric measure space. Then we prove $L^2$ and spectral convergence of $\tilde{\Delta}_r$ to the Laplace--Beltrami operator of a compact Riemannian manifold, imposing Neumann conditions when the manifold has a non-empty boundary.</description>

      <title>Semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit global existence and decay for small-data solutions of semilinear wave equations on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole backgrounds satisfying the classical null condition, a problem which was previously addressed by the first author in joint work with Aretakis and Gajic (Ann. of PDE, 2020). In this paper, we develop a new approach based on propagating a significantly weaker set of estimates, which allows for a simpler and more streamlined proof. Our proof does not require tracking sharp estimates for the solution in the near-horizon region, which means that it is compatible with, but does not imply, the non-decay and growth hierarchy of derivatives of the solution along the event horizon expected from the Aretakis instability. In particular, this approach is in principle compatible with other settings where stronger horizon instabilities are expected, such as nonlinear charged scalar fields on extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, or nonlinear waves on extremal Kerr. We also sketch how our proof applies to semilinear problems on spacetimes settling down to extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om, such as those constructed in our joint work with Kehle (arXiv:2410.16234, 2024).</description>

Abstract: We provide a general non-uniqueness result for normalized ground states of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with pure power nonlinearity on bounded domains with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions, defined as global minimizers of the associated energy functional among functions with prescribed mass. Precisely, for nonlinearity powers slightly smaller than the $L^2$-critical exponent, we prove that there always exists at least one value of the mass for which normalized ground states are not unique.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an $L_{p}$ Christoffel-Minkowski-type problem that prescribes a class of $L_p$ geometric measures, which are mixtures of the $k$-th area measure and the $q$-th dual curvature measure. By establishing a gradient estimate, we obtain the existence of an even, smooth, strictly convex solution to this problem for $1 &lt; p &lt; q \leq k + 1$, where $1 \leq k \leq n$ and $n \geq 1$.</description>

Abstract: We consider an elliptic system of Schr\"odinger-Bopp-Podolsky type in a bounded and smooth domain of R3 with a non constant coupling factor. This kind of system has been introduced in the mathematical literature in [14] and in the last years many contributions appeared. In particular here we present the results in [2] and [34] which show existence of solutions by means of the Ljusternik-Schnirelmann theory under different boundary conditions on the electrostatic potential.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we are devoted to studying the global regularity for the skew mean curvature flow with small initial data in $\mathbb{R}^d\, (d\ge 5)$. By using a new div-curl lemma which was first introduced by the third author to establish a bilinear estimate, and also the interaction Morawetz estimate, the global well-posedness for the skew mean curvature flow in the critical Besov space is established, and hence the corresponding result obtained by Huang, Li and Tataru (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, no. 5, 3748-3798) in $\mathbb{R}^d\, (d\ge 5)$ is substantially improved.</description>

      <title>The motion of a rigid body in a viscous fluid: new results for strong solutions, uniqueness and integrability properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we show two results in the setting of Galdi-Silvestre strong solutions for the rigid body-viscous fluid interaction. The former, under an additional integrability assumption on the gradient of the initial data, proves that the time derivative of the solution belongs to $L^2(0,T;L^2({\Omega}))$. The latter, thanks to a further assumption only on one solution, proves that the uniqueness holds in the quoted setting. However, our extra assumption for the uniqueness is certainly verified under the integrability assumption on the gradient of the initial data. Hence, the set of solutions enjoying the uniqueness is not empty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical framework for studying the newly discovered solar inertial oscillations, offering promising new avenues for exploring the Sun's dynamics. Under the assumption of purely toroidal motions, the stream function of the flow satisfies a fourth-order scalar equation governing inertial waves on the rotating Sun. We prove well-posedness of wave solutions under explicit conditions on differential rotation. Moreover, we study the inverse problem of simultaneously reconstructing viscosity and differential rotation parameters from either complete or partial surface observations. To this end, we verify the tangential cone condition, ensuring the convergence of iterative regularization methods, furthermore the local unique identifiability of the unknown parameters. Numerical experiments employing the Nesterov-Landweber iteration confirm robustness of the reconstruction across different observation schemes and noise levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a concept of dissipative measure valued martingale solutions for stochastic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. These solutions are weak from a probabilistic perspective, since they include both the driving Wiener process and the probability space as an integral part of the solution. Then, for the stochastic compressible Navier-Stokes system, we establish the relative energy inequality, and as a result, we demonstrate the path-wise weak-strong uniqueness principle. We also look at the inviscid-incompressible limit of the underlying system of equations using the relative energy inequality.</description>
