      <title>Solute mixing in porous media with dispersion and buoyancy</title>

Abstract: We analyse the process of convective mixing in homogeneous and isotropic porous media with dispersion. We considered a Rayleigh-Taylor instability in which the presence of a solute produces density differences driving the flow. The effect of dispersion is modelled using an anisotropic Fickian dispersion tensor (Bear, J. Geophys. Res. 1961). In addition to molecular diffusion ($D_m^*$), the solute is redistributed by an additional spreading, in longitudinal and transverse flow directions, which is quantified by the coefficients $D_l^*$ and $D_t^*$, respectively, and it is produced by the presence of the pores. The flow is controlled by three dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh-Darcy number $Ra$, defining the relative strength of convection and diffusion, and the dispersion parameters $r=D_l^*/D_t^*$ and $\Delta=D_m^*/D_t^*$. With the aid of numerical Darcy simulations, we investigate the mixing dynamics without and with dispersion. We find that in absence of dispersion ($\Delta\to\infty$) the dynamics is self-similar and independent of $Ra$, and the flow evolves following several regimes, which we analyse. Then we analyse the effect of dispersion on the flow evolution for a fixed value of the Rayleigh-Darcy number ($Ra=10^4$). A detailed analysis of the molecular and dispersive components of the mean scalar dissipation reveals a complex interplay between flow structures and solute mixing. The proposed theoretical framework, in combination with pore-scale simulations and bead packs experiments, can be used to validate and improve current dispersion models to obtain more reliable estimates of solute transport and spreading in buoyancy-driven subsurface flows.</description>

      <title>3-D Magnetotelluric Deep Learning Inversion Guided by Pseudo-Physical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetotelluric deep learning (DL) inversion methods based on joint data-driven and physics-driven have become a hot topic in recent years. When mapping observation data (or forward modeling data) to the resistivity model using neural networks (NNs), incorporating the error (loss) term of the inversion resistivity's forward modeling response--which introduces physical information about electromagnetic field propagation--can significantly enhance the inversion accuracy. To efficiently achieve data-physical dual-driven MT deep learning inversion for large-scale 3-D MT data, we propose using DL forward modeling networks to compute this portion of the loss. This approach introduces pseudo-physical information through the forward modeling of NN simulation, further guiding the inversion network fitting. Specifically, we first pre-train the forward modeling networks as fixed forward modeling operators, then transfer and integrate them into the inversion network training, and finally optimize the inversion network by minimizing the multinomial loss. Theoretical experimental results indicate that despite some simulation errors in DL forward modeling, the introduced pseudo-physical information still enhances inversion accuracy and significantly mitigates the overfitting problem during training. Additionally, we propose a new input mode that involves masking and adding noise to the data, simulating the field data environment of 3-D MT inversion, thereby making the method more flexible and effective for practical applications.</description>
