      <title>Non-uniqueness of H\"older continuous solutions for Inhomogeneous Incompressible Euler flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inhomogeneous (or density dependent) incompressible Euler equations in a three-dimensional periodic domain. We construct density $\varrho$ and velocity $u$ such that, for any $\alpha&lt;1/7$, both of them are $\alpha $-H\"older continuous and $(\varrho, u)$ is a weak solution to the underlying equations. The proof is based on typical convex integration techniques using Mikado flows as building blocks. As a main novelty with respect to the related literature, our result produces a H\"older continuous density.</description>

      <title>Local existence of classical solutions to the 3D isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations with degenerate viscosities and vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations with degenerate viscousities and vacuum in a three-dimensional torus. The local well-posedness of classical solution is established by introducing a "quasi-symmetric hyperbolic"-"degenerate elliptic" coupled structure to control the behavior of the velocity of the fluid near the vacuum and give some uniform estimates. In particular, the initial data allows vacuum in an open set and we do not need any initial compatibility conditions.</description>

Abstract: In this article we consider a large family of nonlinear nonlocal equations involving gradient nonlinearity and provide a unified approach, based on the Ishii-Lions type technique, to establish Liouville property of the solutions. We also answer an open problem raised by [19]. Some applications to regularity issues are also studied.</description>

      <title>Standing wave solutions of a quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation in the small frequency limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the quasilinear Schr\"odinger equation \[ \Delta u-\omega u+|u|^{p-1}u+\delta\Delta(|u|^2)u=0, \] where $\delta&gt;0$, $N=2$ and $p&gt;1$ or $N\ge3$ and $1&lt;p&lt;\frac{3N+2}{N-2}$. After proving uniqueness and non-degeneracy of the positive solution $u_\omega$ for all $\omega&gt;0$, our main results establish the asymptotic behavior of $u_\omega$ in the limit $\omega\to 0^+$. Three different regimes arise, termed 'subcritical', 'critical' and 'supercritical', corresponding respectively (when $N\ge3$) to $1&lt;p&lt;\frac{N+2}{N-2}$, $p=\frac{N+2}{N-2}$ and $\frac{N+2}{N-2}&lt;p&lt;\frac{3N+2}{N-2}$. In each case a limit equation is exhibited which governs, in a suitable scaling, the behavior of $u_\omega$ in the limit $\omega\to 0^+$. The critical case is the most challenging, technically speaking. In this case, the limit equation is the famous Lane-Emden-Fowler equation. A substantial part of our efforts is dedicated to the study of the function $\omega\mapsto M(\omega)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^N} u_\omega^2$. We find that, for small $\omega&gt;0$, $M(\omega)$ is increasing if $1&lt;p\le 1+\frac4N$ and decreasing if $1+\frac4N&lt; p\le\frac{N+2}{N-2}$. In the supercritical case, the monotonicity of $M(\omega)$ depends on the dimension, except in the regime $p\ge 3+\frac4N$, where $M(\omega)$ is always decreasing close to $\omega=0$. The crucial role played by $M(\omega)$ for the orbital stability of the standing wave $e^{i\omega t}u_\omega$, and for the uniqueness of normalized ground states, is discussed in the introduction.</description>

      <title>A linear inverse problem with semi-nonlocal boundary conditions for a three-dimensional equation of mixed type of the second kind of the fourth order in a parallelepiped</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article the correctness of al inear inverse problem with semi-nonlocal boundary conditions for a three-dimensional equation in a parallelepiped is considered. The equation itself is a fourth order mixed type equation of the second kind. The existence and uniqueness theorems for a generalized solution of the inverse problem in a certain class of integrable functions are~proved using the methods of Fourier, "$\varepsilon $-regularization", a priori estimates, approximating sequences and contracting mappings.</description>

      <title>On the free boundary for thin obstacle problems with Sobolev variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a quasi-monotonicity formula {for an intrinsic frequency function related to solutions to} thin obstacle problems with zero obstacle driven by quadratic energies with Sobolev $W^{1,p}$ coefficients, with $p$ bigger than the space dimension. From this we deduce several regularity and structural properties of the corresponding free boundaries at those distinguished points with finite order of contact with the obstacle. In particular, we prove the rectifiability {and the local finiteness of the Minkowski content} of the whole free boundary in the case of Lipschitz coefficients.</description>

      <title>On the study of $(p, Q)$-Laplace Choquard equations with critical Trudinger-Moser nonlinearity in $\mathbb{H}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the existence and multiplicity of nontrivial solutions for $(p, Q)$-Laplace equations with the Stein-Weiss reaction under critical exponential nonlinearity in the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^N$. In addition, a weight function and two positive parameters have also been included in the nonlinearity. The developed analysis is significantly influenced by these two parameters. Further, the mountain pass theorem, the Ekeland variational principle, the Trudinger-Moser inequality, the doubly weighted Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality and a completely new Br\'ezis-Lieb type lemma for Choquard nonlinearity play key roles in our proofs.</description>

      <title>Low Mach number Limit of Steady Thermally Driven Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of strong solutions to the steady non-isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes system with Dirichlet boundary conditions in bounded domains where the fluid is driven by the wall temperature, and justify its low Mach number limit, i.e., $\v\to 0$, in $L^{\infty}$ sense with a rate of convergence. Notably, for the limiting system \eqref{fge} obtained in the low Mach number limit, the variation of the wall temperature is allowed to be independent of the Mach number. It is also worth pointing out that the velocity field $u_{1}$ acts like a ghost since it appears at $\v$-order in the expansion, but still affects the density and temperature at $O(1)$-order. In the proof, we design a new expansion, in which the density, velocity and temperature have different expansion forms with respect to $\v$, so that the density at higher orders is well-defined under the Boussinesq relations and the constraint of zero average. We also introduce a new $\v$-dependent functional space, allowing us to obtain some uniform estimates for high-order normal derivatives near the boundary.</description>

      <title>Finite-time singularity formation for scalar stretching equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider equations of the type: \[\partial_t \omega = \omega R(\omega),\] for general linear operators $R$ in any spatial dimension. We prove that such equations almost always exhibit finite-time singularities for smooth and localized solutions. Singularities can even form in settings where solutions dissipate an energy. Such equations arise naturally as models in various physical settings such as inviscid and complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Periodic Solutions for the 1d Cubic Wave Equation with Dirichlet Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study time-periodic solutions for the cubic wave equation on an interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We begin by following the perturbative construction of Vernov and Khrustalev and provide a rigorous derivation of the fourth-order expansion in small amplitude, which we use to verify the Galerkin scheme. In the main part, we focus on exploring large solutions numerically. We find an intricate bifurcation structure of time-periodic solutions forming a fractal-like pattern and explore it for the first time. Our results suggest that time-periodic solutions exist for arbitrary frequencies, with appearance of fine bifurcation structure likely related to the Cantor set families of solutions described in previous rigorous works.</description>

      <title>Free boundary limits of coupled bulk-surface models for receptor-ligand interactions on evolving domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive various novel free boundary problems as limits of a coupled bulk-surface reaction-diffusion system modelling ligand-receptor dynamics on evolving domains. These limiting free boundary problems may be formulated as Stefan-type problems on an evolving hypersurface. Our results are new even in the setting where there is no domain evolution. The models are of particular relevance to a number of applications in cell biology. The analysis utilises $L^\infty$-estimates in the manner of De Giorgi iterations and other technical tools, all in an evolving setting. We also report on numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>On linear Schr\"odinger parabolic problems in Morrey spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider parabolic Schr\"odinger type equations associated to fractional powers of uniformly elliptic 2m-order operators with constant coefficients. Potentials and initial data are considered in suitable Morrey spaces. By means of perturbation techniques we prove that several properties of the problem with no potential are preserved. We also prove continuous dependence of solutions with respect to perturbations. To carry out the analysis a general abstract perturbation approach is developed, which broadens the results known in the literature.</description>

      <title>$2D$ vorticity Euler equations: Superposition solutions and nonlinear Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we contribute two results to the theory of the $2D$ Euler equations in vorticity form on the full plane. First, we establish a generalized Lagrangian representation of weak (in general measure-valued) solutions, which includes and extends classical results on the Lagrangianity of weak solutions. Second, we construct nonlinear Markov processes which are uniquely determined by a selection of weak solutions from initial data in $L^1\cap L^p$, $p \geq 2$, and related spaces such as the classical and uniformly localized Yudovich space. It is well-known that for $p &lt;\infty$ weak solutions are in general not unique, which renders a suitable selection nontrivial.</description>

      <title>Determination of the flux terms in a time fractional viscoelastic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the flux identification problem for a nonlinear time-fractional viscoelastic equation with a general source function based on the boundary measurements. We prove that the direct problem is well-posed, i.e., the solution exists, unique and depends continuously on the heat flux. Then the Fr\'echet differentiability of the cost functional is proved. The Conjugate Gradient Algorithm, based on the gradient formula for the cost functional, is proposed for numerical solution of the inverse flux problem. The numerical examples, both with noise-free and noisy data, provide a clear demonstration of the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Stokes problem under modified pressure Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that the Stokes problem is well-posed when both velocity and pressure vanish on the domain boundary. This result is achieved by extending Ne\v{c}as' inequality to square-integrable functions that vanish in a small band covering the boundary. It is found that the associated a priori pressure estimate depends inversely on the volume of the band. Numerical experiments confirm these findings. Based on these results, guidelines are provided for applying vanishing pressure boundary conditions in model coupling and domain decomposition methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time convergence behavior of underdamped Langevin dynamics, when the spatial equilibrium satisfies a weighted Poincar\'e inequality, with a general velocity distribution, which allows for fat-tail or subexponential potential energies, and provide constructive and fully explicit estimates in $\mathrm{L}^2$-norm with $\mathrm{L}^\infty$ initial conditions. A key ingredient is a space-time weighted Poincar\'e--Lions inequality, which in turn implies a weak Poincar\'e--Lions inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CR Paneitz operator is closely related to some important problems in CR geometry. In this paper, we consider this operator on a non-embeddable CR manifold. This operator is essentially self-adjoint and its spectrum is discrete except zero. Moreover, the eigenspace corresponding to each non-zero eigenvalue is a finite dimensional subspace of the space of smooth functions. Furthermore, we show that the CR Paneitz operator on the Rossi sphere, an example of non-embeddable CR manifolds, has infinitely many negative eigenvalues, which is significantly different from the embeddable case.</description>

      <title>A high-order accurate unconditionally stable bound-preserving numerical scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high-order numerical method is developed for solving the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations with the Flory-Huggins potential. The scheme is based on the $Q_k$ finite element with mass lumping on rectangular grids, the second-order convex splitting method, and the pressure correction method. The unique solvability, unconditional stability, and bound-preserving properties are rigorously established. The key to bound-preservation is the discrete $L^1$ estimate of the singular potential. Ample numerical experiments are performed to validate the desired properties of the proposed numerical scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a Hamiltonian with radial potential wells and an Aharonov-Bohm vector potential with two poles. Assuming that the potential wells are symmetric, we derive the semi-classical asymptotics of the splitting between the ground and second state energies. The flux effects due to the Aharonov-Bohm vector potential are of lower order compared to the contributions coming from the potential wells.</description>

Abstract: We study nonlinear energy transfer and the existence of stationary measures in a class of degenerately forced SDEs on $\mathbb R^d$ with a quadratic, conservative nonlinearity $B(x,x)$ constrained to possess various properties common to finite-dimensional fluid models and a linear damping term $-Ax$ that acts only on a proper subset of phase space in the sense that $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{ker}A) \gg 1$. Existence of a stationary measure is straightforward if $\mathrm{ker}A = \{0\}$, but when the kernel of $A$ is nontrivial a stationary measure can exist only if the nonlinearity transfers enough energy from the undamped modes to the damped modes. We develop a set of sufficient dynamical conditions on $B$ that guarantees the existence of a stationary measure and prove that they hold ``generically'' within our constraint class of nonlinearities provided that $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{ker}A) &lt; 2d/3$ and the stochastic forcing acts directly on at least two degrees of freedom. We also show that the restriction $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{ker}A) &lt; 2d/3$ can be removed if one allows the nonlinearity to change by a small amount at discrete times. In particular, for a Markov chain obtained by evolving our SDE on approximately unit random time intervals and slightly perturbing the nonlinearity within our constraint class at each timestep, we prove that there exists a stationary measure whenever just a single mode is damped.</description>

Abstract: We consider the advection of a passive scalar by a divergence free random Gaussian field, white in time and H\"older regular in space (rough Kraichnan's model), a well established synthetic model of passive scalar turbulence. By studying the evolution of negative Sobolev norms, we show an anomalous regularization effect induced by the dynamics: distributional initial conditions immediately become functions of positive Sobolev regularity.</description>

      <title>A Proof of Onsager's Conjecture</title>

Abstract: For any $\alpha &lt; 1/3$, we construct weak solutions to the $3D$ incompressible Euler equations in the class $C_tC_x^\alpha$ that have nonempty, compact support in time on ${\mathbb R} \times {\mathbb T}^3$ and therefore fail to conserve the total kinetic energy. This result, together with the proof of energy conservation for $\alpha &gt; 1/3$ due to [Eyink] and [Constantin, E, Titi], solves Onsager's conjecture that the exponent $\alpha = 1/3$ marks the threshold for conservation of energy for weak solutions in the class $L_t^\infty C_x^\alpha$. The previous best results were solutions in the class $C_tC_x^\alpha$ for $\alpha &lt; 1/5$, due to the author, and in the class $L_t^1 C_x^\alpha$ for $\alpha &lt; 1/3$ due to Buckmaster, De Lellis and Sz\'{e}kelyhidi, both based on the method of convex integration developed for the incompressible Euler equations by De Lellis and Sz\'ekelyhidi. The present proof combines the method of convex integration and a new "gluing approximation" technique. The convex integration part of the proof relies on the "Mikado flows" introduced by [Daneri, Sz\'ekelyhidi] and the framework of estimates developed in the author's previous work.</description>

      <title>Numerical Validation for a Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard System in a Porous Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Having a finite interfacial thickness, the phase-field models supply a way to model the fluid interfaces, which allows the calculations of the interface movements and deformations on the fixed grids. Such modeling is applied to the computation of two-phase incompressible Stokes flows in this paper, leading to a system of Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard equations. The Stokes equation is modified by adding the continuum force $ - c \nabla w $, where $ c $ is the order parameter and $ w $ is the chemical potential of $ c $. Similarly, the advection effects are modeled by addition of the term $ \vec{u} \cdot \nabla c $ in the Cahn-Hilliard equation. We hereby discuss how the solutions to the above equations approach the original sharp interface Stokes equation as the interfacial thickness $ \varepsilon$ tends to zero. We start with a microscopic model and then the homogenized or upscaled version to the same from author's previous work, cf. \cite{lakhmara2022}, where the analysis and homogenization of the system have been performed in detail. Further, we perform the numerical computations to compare the outcome of the effective model with the original heterogeneous microscale model.</description>

      <title>A micro-scale diffused interface model with Flory-Huggins logarithmic potential in a porous medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A diffused interface model describing the evolution of two conterminous incompressible fluids in a porous medium is discussed. The system consists of the Cahn-Hilliard equation with Flory-Huggins logarithmic potential, coupled via surface tension term with the evolutionary Stokes equation at the pore scale. An evolving diffused interface of finite thickness, depending on the scale parameter $\varepsilon$ separates the fluids. The model is studied in a bounded domain $\Omega$ with a sufficiently smooth boundary $\partial \Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $ d = 2 $, $3$. At first, we investigate the existence of the system at the micro-scale and derive the essential \textit{a-priori} estimates. Then, using the two-scale convergence approach and unfolding operator technique, we obtain the homogenized model for the microscopic one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study solitary traveling wave solutions to a damped shallow water system, which is in general quasilinear and of mixed type. We develop a small data well-posedness theory and prove that traveling wave solutions are a generic phenomenon that persist with and without viscosity or surface tension and for all nontrivial traveling wave speeds, even when the parameters dictate that the equations are hyperbolic and have a sound speed. This theory is developed by way of a Nash-Moser implicit function theorem, which allows us to prove strong norm continuity of solutions with respect to the data as well as the parameters, even in the vanishing limits of viscosity and surface tension.</description>

Abstract: The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are considered. We find that there exist infinite non-trivial solutions of static Euler equations. Moreover there exist random solutions of static Euler equations. Provided Reynolds number is large enough and time variable $t$ goes to infinity, these random solutions of static Euler equations are the path limits of corresponding Navier-Stokes flows. But the double limit of these Navier-Stokes flows do not exist. Therefore these solutions are called turbulent solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our Recent advancements in stochastic processes have illuminated a paradox associated with the Einstein model of Brownian motion. The model predicts an infinite propagation speed, conflicting with the second law of thermodynamics. The modified model successfully resolves the issue, establishing a finite propagation speed by introducing a concentration-dependent diffusion matrix. In this paper, we outline the necessary conditions for this property through a counter-example. The second part of the paper focuses on the stability analysis of the solution of the degenerate Einstein model. We introduce a functional dependence on the solution that satisfies a specific ordinary differential inequality. Our investigation explores the solution's dependence on the boundary and initial data of the original problem, demonstrating asymptotic stability under various conditions. These results have practical applications in understanding stochastic processes within bounded domains.</description>

Abstract: We study weak Harnack inequality and a priori H\"older regularity of harmonic functions for symmetric nonlocal Dirichlet forms on metric measure spaces with volume doubling condition. Our analysis relies on three main assumptions: the existence of a strongly local Dirichlet form with sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates, a tail estimate of the jump measure outside balls and a local energy comparability condition. We establish the robustness of our results, ensuring that the constants in our estimates remain bounded, provided that the order of the scale function appearing in the tail estimate and local energy comparability condition, maintains a certain distance from zero. Additionally, we establish a sufficient condition for the local energy comparability condition.</description>

Abstract: We consider a thin elastic sheet with a finite number of disclinations in a variational framework in the F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an approximation. Under the non-physical assumption that the out-of-plane displacement is a convex function, we prove that minimizers display ridges between the disclinations. We prove the associated energy scaling law with upper and lower bounds that match up to logarithmic factors in the thickness of the sheet. One of the key estimates in the proof that we consider of independent interest is a generalization of the monotonicity property of the Monge-Amp\`ere measure.</description>

      <title>Nearly self-similar blowup of generalized axisymmetric Navier-Stokes and Boussinesq equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform numerical investigation of nearly self-similar blowup of generalized axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations and Boussinesq system with a time-dependent fractional dimension. The dynamic change of the space dimension is proportional to the ratio R(t)/Z(t), where (R(t),Z(t)) is the position at which the maximum vorticity achieves its global maximum. This choice of space dimension is to ensure that the advection along the r-direction has the same scaling as that along the z-direction, thus preventing formation of two-scale solution structure. For the generalized axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations with solution dependent viscosity, we show that the solution develops a self-similar blowup with dimension equal to 3.188 and the self-similar profile satisfies the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations with constant viscosity. We also study the nearly self-similar blowup of the axisymmetric Boussinesq system with constant viscosity. The generalized axisymmetric Boussinesq system preserves almost all the known properties of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations except for the conservation of angular momentum. We present convincing numerical evidence that the generalized axisymmetric Boussinesq system develops a stable nearly self-similar blowup solution with maximum vorticity increased by O(10^{30}).</description>

Abstract: In the present article we study diffuse interface models for two-phase biomembranes. We will do so by starting off with a diffuse interface model on $\mathbb{R}^n$ defined by two coupled phase fields $u,v$. The first phase field $u$ is the diffuse approximation of the interior of the membrane; the second phase field $v$ is the diffuse approximation of the two phases of the membrane. We prove a compactness result and a lower bound in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence for pairs of phase functions $(u_\varepsilon,v_\varepsilon)$. As an application of this first result, we consider a diffuse approximation of a two-phase Willmore functional plus line tension energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show the existence of strictly monotone heteroclinic type solutions of semilinear elliptic equations in cylinders. The motivation of this construction is twofold: first, it implies the existence of an entire bounded solution of a semilinear equation without critical points which is not one-dimensional. Second, this gives an example of a bounded stationary solution for the 2D Euler equations without stagnation points which is not a shear flow, completing previous results of Hamel and Nadirashvili. The proof uses a minimization technique together with a truncation argument, and a limit procedure.</description>

Abstract: The critical CR GJMS operator on a strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold is a non-hypoelliptic CR invariant differential operator. We prove that, under the embeddability assumption, it is essentially self-adjoint and has closed range. Moreover, its spectrum is discrete, and the eigenspace corresponding to each non-zero eigenvalue is a finite-dimensional subspace of the space of smooth functions. As an application, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a contact form with zero CR $Q$-curvature.</description>

      <title>The energy landscape of the Kuramoto model in random geometric graphs in a circle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the energy function of the Kuramoto model in random geometric graphs defined in the unit circle as the number of nodes diverges. We prove the existence of at least one local minimum for each winding number $q \in \mathbb{Z}$ with high probability. Hence providing a large family of graphs that support patterns that are generic. These states are in correspondence with the explicit twisted states found in WSG and other highly symmetric networks, but in our situation there is no explicit formula due to the lack of symmetry. The method of proof is simple and robust. It allows other types of graphs like $k-$nn graphs or the boolean model and holds also for graphs defined in any simple closed curve or even a small neighborhood of the curve and for weighted graphs. It seems plausible that the method can be extended also to higher dimensions, but a more careful analysis is required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new optimization framework to design steady equilibrium solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system by means of external electric fields is presented. This optimization framework requires the minimization of an ensemble functional with Tikhonov regularization of the control field under the differential constraint of a nonlinear elliptic equation that models equilibrium solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system. Existence of optimal control fields and their characterization as solutions to first-order optimality conditions are discussed. Numerical approximations and optimization schemes are developed to validate the proposed framework.</description>
