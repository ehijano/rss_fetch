      <title>Interest rate derivatives in a CTMC setting: pricing, replication and Ross recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a financial market in which the short rate is modeled by a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) with a finite state space. In this setting, we show how to price any financial derivative whose payoff is a function of the state of the underlying CTMC at the maturity date. We also show how to replicate such claims by trading only a money market account and zero-coupon bonds. Finally, using an extension of Ross' Recovery Theorem due to Qin and Linetsky, we deduce the real-world dynamics of the CTMC.</description>

      <title>From Gini index as a Lyapunov functional to convergence in Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In several recent works on infinite-dimensional systems of ODEs \cite{cao_derivation_2021,cao_explicit_2021,cao_iterative_2024,cao_sticky_2024}, which arise from the mean-field limit of agent-based models in economics and social sciences and model the evolution of probability distributions (on the set of non-negative integers), it is often shown that the Gini index serves as a natural Lyapunov functional along the solution to a given system. Furthermore, the Gini index converges to that of the equilibrium distribution. However, it is not immediately clear whether this convergence at the level of the Gini index implies convergence in the sense of probability distributions or even stronger notions of convergence. In this paper, we prove several results in this direction, highlighting the interplay between the Gini index and other popular metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance and the usual $\ell^p$ distance, which are used to quantify the closeness of probability distributions.</description>

      <title>Consistent Estimation of the High-Dimensional Efficient Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the main characteristics of the mean-variance efficient frontier employing random matrix theory. Our particular interest covers the case when the dimension $p$ and the sample size $n$ tend to infinity simultaneously and their ratio $p/n$ tends to a positive constant $c\in(0,1)$. We neither impose any distributional nor structural assumptions on the asset returns. For the developed theoretical framework, some regularity conditions, like the existence of the $4$th moments, are needed.
  It is shown that two out of three quantities of interest are biased and overestimated by their sample counterparts under the high-dimensional asymptotic regime. This becomes evident based on the asymptotic deterministic equivalents of the sample plug-in estimators. Using them we construct consistent estimators of the three characteristics of the efficient frontier. It it shown that the additive and/or the multiplicative biases of the sample estimates are solely functions of the concentration ratio $c$. Furthermore, the asymptotic normality of the considered estimators of the parameters of the efficient frontier is proved. Verifying the theoretical results based on an extensive simulation study we show that the proposed estimator for the efficient frontier is a valuable alternative to the sample estimator for high dimensional data. Finally, we present an empirical application, where we estimate the efficient frontier based on the stocks included in S\&amp;P 500 index.</description>
