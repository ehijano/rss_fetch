      <title>Space-Time Wedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-time-modulated systems have attracted significant interest over the past decade due to their ability to manipulate electromagnetic waves in unprecedented ways. Here, we introduce a new type of space-time-modulated structure, the space-time wedge, consisting of two interfaces moving at different velocities, which results in either closing or opening wedges. Using moving boundary conditions, we derive closed-form solutions for the scattering of electromagnetic waves in such a wedge and leverage these solutions to unveil the underlying physics, including multiple space-time scattering and Doppler shifting. The space-time wedge holds potential for various optical and photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Output beam shaping of a multimode fiber amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimode fibers provide a promising platform for realizing high-power laser amplifiers with suppressed nonlinearities and instabilities. The potential degradation of optical beam quality has been a major concern for highly multimode fiber amplifiers. We show numerically that the beam propagation factor M2 of a single-frequency multimode fiber amplifier can be reduced to nearly unity by shaping the input or output beam profile with spatial phase-masks. Our method works for narrowband multimode fiber amplifiers with strong gain saturation, pump depletion, random mode coupling and polarization mixing. The numerical results validate our approach of utilizing highly multimode excitation to mitigate nonlinear effects in high-power fiber amplifiers and performing input wavefront shaping to control output beam profile and polarization state.</description>

      <title>229Th-doped nonlinear optical crystals for compact solid-state clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent laser excitation of the 229Th isomeric transition in a solid-state host opens the door for a portable solid-state nuclear optical clock. However, at present the vacuum-ultraviolet laser systems required for clock operation are not conducive to a fieldable form factor. Here, we propose a possible solution to this problem by using 229Th-doped nonlinear optical crystals, which would allow clock operation without a vacuum-ultraviolet laser system and without the need of maintaining the crystal under vacuum.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Mode Programming with Multi-Plane Light Conversion Using Computer-Generated Hologram Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable optical devices provide performance enhancement and flexibility to spatial multiplexing systems enabling transmission of tributaries in high-order eigenmodes of spatially-diverse transmission media, like multimode fiber (MMF). Wavefront shaping with spatial light modulators (SLMs) facilitates scalability of the transmission media by allowing for channel diagonalization and quasi-single-input single-output operation. Programmable mode multiplexing configurations like multi-plane light conversion (MPLC) utilise the SLM and offer the potential to simultaneously launch an arbitrary subset of spatial tributaries in any N-mode MMF. Such programmable optical processor would enable the throughput of space-division multiplexing (SDM) systems to be progressively increased by addressing a growing number of tributaries over one MMF and in this way meet a growing traffic demand - similarly to the wavelength-division multiplexing evolution path. Conventionally, MPLC phasemasks are calculated using the wavefront matching algorithm (WMA). However, this method does not exploit the full potential of programmable mode multiplexers. We show, that computer-generated hologram algorithms like direct search enable significant improvement compared to the traditional WMA-approach. Such gains are enabled by tailored cost functions with dynamic constraints concerning insertion loss as well as mode extinction ratio. We show that average mode extinction ratio can be greatly improved by as much as 15 dB at the expense of insertion loss deterioration of &lt; 3 dB. One particular feature of programmable mode multiplexers is the adaptability to optimised transmission functions. Besides conventional LP modes transmission, we employ our approach on Schmidt modes, which are spatial eigenchannels with minimum crosstalk derived from a measured transmission matrix.</description>

      <title>Mode-Selective Photonic Lanterns with Double-Clad Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and characterization of mode-selective photonic lanterns using double-clad fibers. Here, we exploited several custom-pulled double-clad fibers to achieve the symmetry break required to excite higher-order modes. The resulting components are short and exhibit high modal isolation and low excess loss. They address some of the limitations of existing photonic lanterns in terms of fragility and coupling efficiency. The fabrication process involves the use of lower-index capillary tubes to maintain fiber geometry during fusion and tapering. Through the use of varying first cladding diameters, mode selectivity is achieved without sacrificing single-mode compatibility. This in turn allows proper real-time characterization during the whole fabrication process. Results demonstrate that double-clad fibers stacked inside a fluoride-doped capillary tube feature high modal isolation (above 60dB) and low excess loss (lower than 0.49dB), over a broad wavelength range (more than 250nm) with steeper taper profiles, and more robust components. The use of less expensive synthetic fused silica capillary tubes achieves high modal isolation (above 20dB) and excess loss lower than 2dB over the same broad wavelength range.</description>

      <title>A kneading map of chaotic switching oscillations in a Kerr cavity with two interacting light fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical systems that combine nonlinearity with coupling between various subsystems offer a flexible platform for observing a diverse range of nonlinear dynamics. Furthermore, engineering tolerances are such that the subsystems can be identical to within a fraction of the wavelength of light; hence, such coupled systems inherently have a natural symmetry that can lead to either delocalization or symmetry breaking. We consider here an optical Kerr cavity that supports two interacting electric fields, generated by two symmetric input beams. Mathematically, this system is modeled by a four-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant vector field with the strength and detuning of the input light as control parameters. Previous research has shown that complex switching dynamics are observed both experimentally and numerically across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we show that particular switching patterns are created at specific global bifurcations through either delocalization or symmetry breaking of a chaotic attractor. We find that the system exhibits infinitely many of these global bifurcations, which are organized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant codimension-two Belyakov transitions. We investigate these switching dynamics by means of the continuation of global bifurcations in combination with the computation of kneading invariants and Lyapunov exponents. In this way, we provide a comprehensive picture of the interplay between different switching patterns of periodic orbits and chaotic attractors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing light-matter coupling with electric fields in polar semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the prevailing notion that spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization fields are inherently detrimental to light emission in polar semiconductor heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate that polarization can enhance light-matter coupling in quantum wells through the quantum-confined Stark effect, by enabling a reduction in well width without shifting the emission to shorter wavelengths. We illustrate this with the paradigmatic example of red-emitting (644 nm-698 nm) AlInGaN heterostructures, which are essential for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels. By systematically exploring their design space with machine learning, we uncover that the globally optimal designs feature extreme internal electric fields exceeding 8 MV/cm. Structural and compositional engineering of electric fields not only offers precise control over the emission wavelength but also boosts the light-emission probability by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>One-way heat transfer in deep-subwavelength thermophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal thermophotonics, by breaking Lorentz reciprocity, exceeds current theoretical efficiency limits, unlocking opportunities to energy devices and thermal management. However, energy transfer in current systems is highly defect-sensitive. This sensitivity is further amplified at deep subwavelength scales by inevitable multi-source interactions, interface wrinkles, and manufacturing tolerances, making precise control of thermal photons increasingly challenging. Here, we demonstrate a topological one-way heat transport in a deep-subwavelength thermophotonic lattice. This one-way heat flow, driven by global resonances, is strongly localized at the geometric boundaries and exhibits exceptional robustness against imperfections and disorder, achieving nearly five orders of radiative enhancement. Our findings offer a blueprint for developing robust thermal systems capable of withstanding strong perturbations.</description>

      <title>SUANPAN: Scalable Photonic Linear Vector Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic linear operation is a promising approach to handle the extensive vector multiplications in artificial intelligence techniques due to the natural bosonic parallelism and high-speed information transmission of photonics. Although it is believed that maximizing the interaction of the light beams is necessary to fully utilize the parallelism and tremendous efforts have been made in past decades, the achieved dimensionality of vector-matrix multiplication is very limited due to the difficulty of scaling up a tightly interconnected or highly coupled optical system. Additionally, there is still a lack of a universal photonic computing architecture that can be readily merged with existing computing system to meet the computing power demand of AI techniques. Here, we propose a programmable and reconfigurable photonic linear vector machine to perform only the inner product of two vectors, formed by a series of independent basic computing units, while each unit is just one pair of light-emitter and photodetector. Since there is no interaction among light beams inside, extreme scalability could be achieved by simply duplicating the independent basic computing unit while there is no requirement of large-scale analog-to-digital converter and digital-to-analog converter arrays. Our architecture is inspired by the traditional Chinese Suanpan or abacus and thus is denoted as photonic SUANPAN. As a proof of principle, SUANPAN architecture is implemented with an 8*8 vertical cavity surface emission laser array and an 8*8 MoTe2 two-dimensional material photodetector array. We believe that our proposed photonic SUANPAN is capable of serving as a fundamental linear vector machine that can be readily merged with existing electronic digital computing system and is potential to enhance the computing power for future various AI applications.</description>

      <title>Radiation forces and torques in optics and acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical action of various kinds of waves have been known for several centuries. The first tide of scientific interest in wave-induced forces and torques emerged at the end of the 19th / beginning of the 20th centuries, with the development of wave theories and the concepts of wave momentum and angular momentum. A second tide appeared in the past several decades, connected to technological breakthroughs: the creation of lasers and the controlled generation of structured wavefields. This resulted in several important discoveries: optical trapping and manipulation of small particles, from atomic to micro sizes, as well as acoustic and acoustofluidic manipulation and sorting of larger particles, including biological cells and samples. Here we provide a unifying review of optical and acoustic forces and torques on various particles, addressing both their theoretical fundamentals and the main applications. Our approach employs the universal connection between the local energy, momentum, and spin densities in the wave fields and the principal forces and torques on small Rayleigh particles. Moreover, we describe the most important cases of nontrivial forces and complex particles: lateral and pulling forces, chiral and anisotropic particles, etc. We also describe the main experimental achievements and applications related to optical and acoustic forces and torques in structured wave fields. Our goal is to illuminate the common fundamental origin and close interconnections between the mechanical actions of optical and acoustic fields, in order to facilitate their profound understanding and the further development of optomechanical and acoustomechanical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The idea of fractional derivatives has a long history that dates back centuries. Apart from their intriguing mathematical properties, fractional derivatives have been studied widely in physics, for example in quantum mechanics and generally in systems with nonlocal temporal or spatial interactions. However, systematic experiments have been rare due to challenges associated with the physical implementation. Here we report the observation and full characterization of a family of temporal optical solitons that are governed by a nonlinear wave equation with a fractional Laplacian. This equation has solutions with unique properties such as non-exponential tails and a very small time-bandwidth product.</description>

Abstract: The first-principles theory of lasing in a rectangular lattice of spherical metal nanoparticles is developed in a fully analytical form in the dipole approximation. The lasing conditions are obtained for different diffraction orders, both propagating and evanescent. Their analysis reveals that besides usual lasing there can be lasing without population inversion which is invisible in conventional experiments, but can be observed in total internal reflection.</description>

      <title>Birefringence in a Silicon Beamsplitter at 2um for Future Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of gravitational wave detectors will move to cryogenic operation in order to reduce thermal noise and thermal distortion. This necessitates a change in mirror substrate with silicon being a good candidate. Birefringence is an effect that will degrade the sensitivity of a detector and is of greater concern in silicon due to its crystalline nature. We measure the birefringence in a &lt;100&gt; float zone silicon beamsplitter since we expect there to be a large inherent birefringence due to the spatial dispersion effect. We observe that the birefringence varied between $3.44 \pm 0.12 \times 10^{-7}$ and $1.63 \pm 0.05 \times 10^{-7}$ and estimate the birefringence along the &lt;110&gt; axis to be $1.64 \pm 0.5 \times 10^{-6}$ at 2um. We demonstrate this effect and argue that it strengthens the case for 2um and &lt;100&gt; silicon.</description>

      <title>Understanding multi-layered transmission matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission matrices, mapping the propagation of light from one end of the tissue to the other, form an important mathematical tool in the analysis of tissue scattering and the design of wavefront shaping systems. To understand the relationship between their content and the volumetric structure of the tissue, we wish to fit them with multi-slice models, composed of a set of planar aberrations spaced throughout the volume. The number of layers used in such a model would largely affect the amount of information compression and the ease in which we can use such layered models in a wavefront-shaping system. This work offers a theoretical study of such multi-layered models. We attempt to understand how many layers are required for a good fit, and how does the approximation degrade when a smaller number of such layers is used. We show analytically that transmission matrices can be well fitted with very sparse layers. This leads to optimistic predictions on our ability to use them to design future wavefront shaping systems which can correct tissue aberration over a wide field-of-view.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a chip-integrated emission spectroscope capable of retrieving the temperature of the light sources. It consists of a single photon detector with low dark counts and a sweeping on-chip filter with 2 pm spectral resolution in the visible and near-infrared regimes. With wildfire sensing applications in mind, we test our system with a hollow cathode lamp to simulate the K-line emission, and show how the models of Doppler and collision broadening in the plasma can be used for temperature retrieval. With favorable device parameters, high spectral resolution, and a novel temperature retrieval capability, our technique may find broad applications in environmental monitoring, astrophysics, plasma physics, and so on.</description>

      <title>Hybrid approach to reconstruct nanoscale grating dimensions using scattering and fluorescence with soft X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scatterometry is a tested method for measuring periodic semiconductor structures. Since the sizes of modern semiconductor structures have reached the nanoscale regime, the challenge is to determine the shape of periodic nanostructures with sub-nanometer accuracy. To increase the resolution of scatterometry, short-wavelength radiation like soft X-rays can be used. But, scatterometry with soft X-rays is an inverse problem whose solutions can be ambiguous and its sensitivity should be further increased to determine the shape of even more complicated periodic nanostructures made up of different materials. To achieve unique solutions with smaller uncertainties, scatterometry can leverage the excitation of low-Z materials with soft X-rays. Additional information from soft X-ray fluorescence analysis in a hybrid measurement approach can mitigate the problem of ambiguous solutions from soft X-ray scattering and could further decrease uncertainty. In this work, the hybrid approach is utilized to perform a comparison of solutions from the inverse problem and determine the actual solution over ambiguous solutions.</description>

      <title>Physical mode analysis of multimode cascaded nonlinear processes in strongly-coupled waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate on-chip control and analysis of spatially multimode nonlinear interactions in silicon nitride waveguide circuits. Using widely different dispersion of transverse supermodes in a strongly coupled dual-core waveguide section, and using integrated pairs of input and output single-mode waveguides, we enable controlled excitation of nonlinear processes in multiple supermodes, while a basic physical mode decomposition aids the identification of parallel and cascaded processes. Pumping with ultrashort pulses at 1.5-$\mu$m wavelength (around 195-THz light frequency), we observe simultaneous dual-supermode, near-infrared supercontinuum generation having different spectral widths, in parallel with third-harmonic generation at around 515 nm (582 THz). Cascaded four-wave mixing with supercontinuum components upconverts the third-harmonic radiation toward a set of four shorter blue wavelengths emitted in the range between 485 and 450 nm (617 to 661 THz). The approach taken here, i.e., using chip-integrated spatial multiplexing and demultiplexing for excitation and analysis of broadband transverse nonlinear conversion, can be an advanced tool for better understanding and control in multimode nonlinear optics, such as for extending frequency conversion to wider spectral ranges via extra phase matching paths.</description>

      <title>Quantitative measure of topological protection in Floquet systems through the spectral localizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard understanding of topological protection from band theory is that a system's topology cannot change without first closing the bulk band gap. However, in Floquet systems, this typical definition of topological protection is one step removed from the experimentally accessible system parameters, as the relationship between the disorder in a system's instantaneous Hamiltonian and its Floquet Hamiltonian that defines its topology is not straightforward. Here, we demonstrate that the spectral localizer framework for classifying material topology can be applied to Floquet systems and prove that its associated measure of topological protection can be understood in terms of the integrated disorder across the system's instantaneous Hamiltonians. As such, we have derived a quantitative bound on a Floquet system's topological protection in terms of the instantaneous system. Moreover, we show the utility of these bounds in both ordinary an anomalous Floquet Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Skyrmions in general quantum channels: topological noise rejection and the discretization of quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topology of a pure state of two entangled photons is leveraged to provide a discretization of quantum information. Since discrete signals are inherently more resilient to the effects of perturbations, this discrete class of entanglement observables may offer an advantage against noise. Establishing this is the primary objective of this paper. We develop a noise model that exploits the specific form of such topological wave functions - an entangled state of two photons with one in an orbital angular momentum state and the other in a polarization state. We show that noise affecting both photons can be recast as a position-dependent perturbation affecting only the photon in the polarization state. This approach allows us to utilize both the language and concepts used in studying noisy qubits, as well as recent advances in quantum polarimetry. By adding noise to a finite-dimensional Hilbert space of polarization states, we can describe the noise using quantum operations expressed through appropriate Krauss operators, whose structure is determined by quantum polarimetry. For non-depolarizing noise, we provide an argument based on homotopic maps that demonstrates the topology's resilience to noise. For depolarizing noise, numerical studies using the quantum channel description show that the discrete entanglement signal remains completely resilient. Finally, we identify sources of local noise that can destabilize the topology. This foundational work establishes a framework for understanding how topology enhances the resilience of quantum information, directly impacting the distribution of information through entanglement in noisy environments, such as quantum computers and quantum networks.</description>

      <title>The non-Hermitian skin effect: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian (NH) skin effect is a truly NH feature, which manifests itself as an accumulation of states, known as skin states, on the boundaries of a system. In this perspective, we discuss several aspects of the NH skin effect focusing on the most interesting facets of this phenomenon. Non-normality and non-reciprocity are reviewed as necessary requirements to see the NH skin effect. We further discuss the NH skin effect as a topological effect that can be seen as a manifestation of a truly NH bulk-boundary correspondence, and show how topological boundary states can be distinguished from skin states. As most theoretical work has focused on studying the NH skin effect in the one-dimensional single-particle picture, recent developments of studying this effect in higher dimensions as well as in the many-body case are also highlighted. Lastly, experimental realizations and applications of the NH skin effect are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of quadrature interferometric metrology of translation and tilt: QUIMETT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observation in space will demand the improvement on the sensitivity of the local sensor for the drag-free control. This paper presents the proposal, design, and demonstration of a new laser interferometric sensor named Quadrature Interferometric Metrology of Translation and Tilt (QUIMETT) for the drag-free local sensor. QUIMETT enables simultaneous measurements of both translational displacement and tilts of an reflective object with a single interferometer package. QUIMETT offers the characteristic feature where the sensitivity to tilt is independent of the interference condition while maintaining the ability to measure the translational displacement for a range greater than the laser wavelength. The tilt-sensing function has been demonstrated in a prototype experiment. The tilt sensitivity remained unchanged in different interference conditions and stayed at 10 nrad/Hz$^{1/2}$ at 0.1 Hz.</description>

      <title>HoloChrome: Polychromatic Illumination for Speckle Reduction in Holographic Near-Eye Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic displays hold the promise of providing authentic depth cues, resulting in enhanced immersive visual experiences for near-eye applications. However, current holographic displays are hindered by speckle noise, which limits accurate reproduction of color and texture in displayed images. We present HoloChrome, a polychromatic holographic display framework designed to mitigate these limitations. HoloChrome utilizes an ultrafast, wavelength-adjustable laser and a dual-Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) architecture, enabling the multiplexing of a large set of discrete wavelengths across the visible spectrum. By leveraging spatial separation in our dual-SLM setup, we independently manipulate speckle patterns across multiple wavelengths. This novel approach effectively reduces speckle noise through incoherent averaging achieved by wavelength multiplexing. Our method is complementary to existing speckle reduction techniques, offering a new pathway to address this challenge. Furthermore, the use of polychromatic illumination broadens the achievable color gamut compared to traditional three-color primary holographic displays.
  Our simulations and tabletop experiments validate that HoloChrome significantly reduces speckle noise and expands the color gamut. These advancements enhance the performance of holographic near-eye displays, moving us closer to practical, immersive next-generation visual experiences.</description>

      <title>From broadband biphotons to frequency combs via spectral compression with time-varying cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biphoton frequency combs are promising resources for quantum networking due in large part to their compatibility with the telecommunication infrastructure. In this work, we propose a method to periodically compress broadband frequency-entangled photons into biphoton frequency combs by utilizing time-varying linear cavities. Our approach hinges on rapid modulation of the input cavity coupling, yielding high spectral purity in each output comb line similar to that achieved with narrowband filters, but without the associated loss in flux. We examine the dependence of spectral purity and compression on coupling strength, cavity loss, and switching speed, finding realistic regimes supporting purities in excess of 0.999 and peak enhancement factors of 100 and beyond.</description>

      <title>Diffuse laser illumination for Maxwellian view Doppler holography of the retina</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the benefits of using diffuse illumination in laser holography for ophthalmic applications. Integrating a diffusing element introduces angular diversity in the optical radiation and reduces spatial coherence, effectively distributing the illumination beam's energy across the focal plane of the eyepiece. This configuration allows for an expanded field of view in digitally computed retinal images, as the eyepiece can be positioned closer to the cornea to achieve a Maxwellian view of the retina without compromising ocular safety. By avoiding the formation of a laser hot spot near the cornea, diffuse illumination facilitates easier compliance with American and European safety standards for ophthalmic devices. Importantly, this approach does not introduce any adverse effects on digitally computed Doppler images.</description>

      <title>Optical Diffusion Models for Image Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models generate new samples by progressively decreasing the noise from the initially provided random distribution. This inference procedure generally utilizes a trained neural network numerous times to obtain the final output, creating significant latency and energy consumption on digital electronic hardware such as GPUs. In this study, we demonstrate that the propagation of a light beam through a semi-transparent medium can be programmed to implement a denoising diffusion model on image samples. This framework projects noisy image patterns through passive diffractive optical layers, which collectively only transmit the predicted noise term in the image. The optical transparent layers, which are trained with an online training approach, backpropagating the error to the analytical model of the system, are passive and kept the same across different steps of denoising. Hence this method enables high-speed image generation with minimal power consumption, benefiting from the bandwidth and energy efficiency of optical information processing.</description>

      <title>Multi-Wavelength DFB Laser Based on Sidewall Third Order Four Phase-Shifted Sampled Bragg Grating with Uniform Wavelength Spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first demonstration of a 1550 nm multi-wavelength distributed feedback (MW-DFB) laser employing a third-order, four-phase-shifted sampled sidewall grating. By utilizing linearly chirped sampled gratings and incorporating multiple true {\pi}-phase shifts within the cavity, we achieved and experimentally validated a four-wavelength laser with a channel spacing of 0.4 nm. The device operates stably and uniformly across a wide range of injection currents from 280 mA to 350 mA. The average wavelength spacing was measured at 0.401 nm with a standard deviation of 0.0081 nm. Additionally, we demonstrated a 0.3 nm MW-DFB laser with a seven-channel output, achieving a wavelength spacing of 0.274 nm and a standard deviation of 0.0055 nm. This MW-DFB laser features a ridge waveguide with sidewall gratings, requiring only one metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) step and a single III-V material etching process. This streamlined fabrication approach simplifies device manufacturing and is well-suited for dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems.</description>

      <title>Thouless pumping in a driven-dissipative Kerr resonator array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thouless pumping is an emblematic manifestation of topology in physics, referring to the ability to induce a quantized transport of charge across a system by simply varying one of its parameters periodically in time. The original concept of Thouless pumping involves a non-interacting system, and has been implemented in several platforms. One current challenge in the field is to extend this concept to interacting systems. In this article, we propose a Thouless pump that solely relies on nonlinear physics, within a chain of coupled Kerr resonators. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the system, we modulate in space and time the onsite Kerr interaction energies, and generate 1+1-dimensional topological bands in the Bogoliubov spectrum of excitations. These bands present the same topology as the ones obtained within the Harper-Hofstadter framework, and the Wannier states associated to each band experience a net displacement and show quantized transport according to the bands Chern numbers. Remarkably, we find driving configurations leading to band inversion, revealing an interaction-induced topological transition. Our numerical simulations are performed using realistic parameters inspired from exciton polaritons, which form a platform of choice for investigating driven topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Search for QCD Axions in light of String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion stands as one of the most promising candidates for resolving the strong CP problem. However, the value of the axion's decay constant $f_a$ and, by extension, its mass $m_a$, remain uncertain within the framework of effective field theory, posing a challenge for experimental detection. Fortunately, fields such as cosmology and astrophysics can offer crucial clues about potential mass ranges. Additionally, string theory and the more recent swampland principles might shed some light on the subject. The most straightforward string theory compactifications suggest that $f_a$ is around the GUT scale, leading to a quantum abundance of dark matter. We found that this range can be detected through hydrogen atomic transitions. The recent concept of the dark dimension scenario introduces an alternative possibility. If axions are confined to the four-dimensional Standard Model brane, their decay constant $f_a$ would be on the order of $10^{10}$ GeV. In this scenario, where axions constitute only a minor portion of dark matter, we show that a laser-interferometry setup would be an effective detection method.</description>
