      <title>Broadband Dielectric Analysis of Clays: Impact of Cation, Exchange Capacity, Water Content, and Porosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clay-rich soils and sediments are key components of near-surface systems, influencing water retention, ion exchange, and structural stability. Their complex dielectric behavior under moist conditions arises from electrostatic interactions between charged mineral surfaces and exchangeable cations, forming diffuse double layers that govern transport and retention processes. This study investigates the broadband dielectric relaxation of four water-saturated clay minerals (kaolin, illite, and two sodium-activated bentonites) in the 1 MHz to 5 GHz frequency range using coaxial probe measurements.
  The dielectric spectra were parameterized using two phenomenological models - the Generalized Dielectric Relaxation Model (GDR) and the Combined Permittivity and Conductivity Model (CPCM) - alongside two theoretical mixture models: the Augmented Broadband Complex Dielectric Mixture Model (ABC-M) and the Complex Refractive Index Model (CRIM). These approaches were evaluated for their ability to link dielectric relaxation behavior to petrophysical parameters such as cation exchange capacity (CEC), volumetric water content (VWC), and porosity.
  The results show distinct spectral signatures correlating with clay mineralogy, particularly in the low-frequency range. Relaxation parameters, including relaxation strength and apparent DC conductivity, exhibit strong relationships with CEC, emphasizing the influence of clay-specific surface properties. Expansive clays like bentonites showed enhanced relaxation due to ion exchange dynamics, while deviations in a soda-activated bentonite highlighted the impact of chemical treatments on dielectric behavior.
  This study provides a framework for linking clay mineral physics with electromagnetic methods, with implications for soil characterization, hydrological modeling, geotechnical assessment, and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous plane waves in attenuative anisotropic porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of inhomogeneous plane waves in poro-viscoelastic media, explicitly incorporating both velocity and attenuation anisotropy. Starting from classical Biot theory, we present a fractional differential equation describing wave propagation in attenuative anisotropic porous media that accommodates arbitrary anisotropy in both velocity and attenuation. Then, instead of relying on the traditional complex wave vector approach, we derive new Christoffel and energy balance equations for general inhomogeneous waves by employing an alternative formulation based on the complex slowness vector. The phase velocities and complex slownesses of inhomogeneous fast and slow quasi-compressional (qP1 and qP2) and quasi-shear (qS1 and qS2) waves are determined by solving an eighth-degree algebraic equation. By invoking the derived energy balance equation along with the computed complex slowness, we present explicit and concise expressions for energy velocities. Additionally, we analyze dissipation factors defined by two alternative measures: the ratio of average dissipated energy density to either average strain energy density or average stored energy density. We clarify and discuss the implications of these definitional differences in the context of general poro-viscoelastic anisotropic media. Finally, our expressions are degenerated to give their counterparts of the homogeneous waves as a special case, and the reduced forms are identical to those presented by the existing poro-viscoelastic theory. Several examples are provided to illustrate the propagation characteristics of inhomogeneous plane waves in unbounded attenuative vertical transversely isotropic porous media.</description>

      <title>Fast ground penetrating radar dual-parameter full waveform inversion method accelerated by hybrid compilation of CUDA kernel function and PyTorch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a high-performance dual-parameter full waveform inversion framework (FWI) for ground-penetrating radar (GPR), accelerated through the hybrid compilation of CUDA kernel functions and PyTorch. The method leverages the computational efficiency of GPU programming while preserving the flexibility and usability of Python-based deep learning frameworks. By integrating customized CUDA kernels into PyTorch's automatic differentiation mechanism, the framework enables accurate and efficient inversion of both dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity. Experimental evaluations on synthetic data and real wavefield data demonstrate that the proposed method achieves dual-parameter FWI for GPR data while maintaining high accuracy. Moreover, the framework is flexible and extensible, supporting optional regularization strategies such as total variation and multi-scale inversion. These features make the proposed approach a practical and scalable framework for rapid GPR-based subsurface imaging in applications including civil engineering, environmental monitoring, and geophysical exploration.</description>

      <title>SPP location with spherical ray tracing by refractive index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric layer structure is a primary factor affecting the precision of single-point satellite positioning. The assumption of electromagnetic wave rectilinear propagation hinders the accurate implementation of ionospheric and tropospheric corrections, whereas curvilinear positioning methods fully account for ray deflection. This study aims to derive partial derivative formulas for theoretical travel time with respect to latitude, longitude, elevation, and velocity models by formulating electromagnetic wave travel time equations under a coordinate-based one-dimensional layered velocity model. Subsequently, a linearized LSQR method is employed to invert station coordinates, receiver clock biases, and electromagnetic wave velocities at the bottom of the ionosphere and troposphere using over six sets of observations. This replaces conventional ionospheric/tropospheric pseudorange corrections in single-point positioning, establishing a novel spherical coordinate refraction travel time positioning method. The classical straight-line pseudorange positioning is reformulated into a time-of-flight positioning approach, and the positioning accuracy differences between straight-line and spherical coordinate refraction travel time methods are compared. By integrating classical ionospheric and tropospheric models to construct corresponding refractive index models and combining them with curvilinear ray tracing methods, the inherent theoretical limitations of positioning can be effectively mitigated.</description>

      <title>Earth's Infrared Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Like Johnson noise, where the thermal fluctuations of charge carriers in a resistor lead to current fluctuations, the internal variability of Earth's atmosphere leads to fluctuations in the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) emitted to space, creating "Earth's Infrared Background" (EIB). We identify the background with spatially isotropic, random variability consistent with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. It allows one to distinguish it from atmospheric variability on preferred spatiotemporal scales, including the annual/seasonal/daily cycles, waves, storms, and other coherent modes. Thus, like the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), where anisotropies in the microwave radiation represent features of interest in the Universe, anisotropies in the OLR represent features of interest in Earth's atmosphere. Unlike the CMB, which represents a snapshot of the early Universe, the EIB represents Earth's climate in (quasi-) steady state and is therefore described by its spatiotemporal variability. By fitting the OLR from satellite observations to a stochastically forced $\varepsilon$nergy balance climate model, we find that the EIB consists of random fluctuations with a standard deviation of 26.5 W m$^{-2}$, compared to the mean 240 W m$^{-2}$ flux emitted to space. These fluctuations have a red spectrum in both space and time with an upper bound of 400 km and 2.5 days on their spatiotemporal decorrelation, between meso-scale and synoptic-scale weather.</description>
