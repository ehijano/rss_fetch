      <title>Counting the Number of Domatic Partition of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset of vertices $S$ of a graph $G$ is a dominating set if every vertex in $V \setminus S$ has at least one neighbor in $S$. A domatic partition is a partition of the vertices of a graph $G$ into disjoint dominating sets. The domatic number $d(G)$ is the maximum size of a domatic partition. Suppose that $dp(G,i)$ is the number of distinct domatic partition of $G$ with cardinality $i$. In this paper, we consider the generating function of $dp(G,i)$, i.e., $DP(G,x)=\sum_{i=1}^{d(G)}dp(G,i)x^i$ which we call it the domatic partition polynomial. We explore the domatic polynomial for trees, providing a quadratic time algorithm for its computation based on weak 2-coloring numbers. Our results include specific findings for paths and certain graph products, demonstrating practical applications of our theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>The Honeymoon Oberwolfach Problem: small cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Honeymoon Oberwolfach Problem HOP$(2m_1,2m_2,\ldots,2m_t)$ asks the following question. Given $n=m_1+m_2+\ldots +m_t$ newlywed couples at a conference and $t$ round tables of sizes $2m_1,2m_2,\ldots,2m_t$, is it possible to arrange the $2n$ participants at these tables for $2n-2$ meals so that each participant sits next to their spouse at every meal, and sits next to every other participant exactly once? A solution to HOP$(2m_1,2m_2,\ldots,2m_t)$ is a decomposition of $K_{2n}+(2n-3)I$, the complete graph $K_{2n}$ with $2n-3$ additional copies of a fixed 1-factor $I$, into 2-factors, each consisting of disjoint $I$-alternating cycles of lengths $2m_1,2m_2,\ldots,2m_t$.
  The Honeymoon Oberwolfach Problem was introduced in a 2019 paper by Lepine and \v{S}ajna. The authors conjectured that HOP$(2m_1,2m_2,\ldots,$ $2m_t)$ has a solution whenever the obvious necessary conditions are satisfied, and proved the conjecture for several large cases, including the uniform cycle length case $m_1=\ldots=m_t$, and the small cases with $n \le 9$. In the present paper, we extend the latter result to all cases with $n \le 20$ using a computer search.</description>

      <title>On the boundedness of degenerate hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a high-degree vertex in Tur\'{a}n problems for degenerate hypergraphs (including graphs). We say an $r$-graph $F$ is bounded if there exist constants $\alpha, \beta&gt;0$ such that for large $n$, every $n$-vertex $F$-free $r$-graph with a vertex of degree at least $\alpha \binom{n-1}{r-1}$ has fewer than $(1-\beta) \cdot \mathrm{ex}(n,F)$ edges. The boundedness property is crucial for recent works~\cite{HHLLYZ23a,DHLY24} that aim to extend the classical Hajnal--Szemer\'{e}di Theorem and the anti-Ramsey theorems of Erd\H{o}s--Simonovits--S\'{o}s.
  We show that many well-studied degenerate hypergraphs, such as all even cycles, most complete bipartite graphs, and the expansion of most complete bipartite graphs, are bounded. In addition, to prove the boundedness of the expansion of complete bipartite graphs, we introduce and solve a Zarankiewicz-type problem for $3$-graphs, strengthening a theorem by Kostochka--Mubayi--Verstra\"{e}te~\cite{KMV15}.</description>

      <title>The $S_3$-symmetric tridiagonal algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tridiagonal algebra is defined by two generators and two relations, called the tridiagonal relations. Special cases of the tridiagonal algebra include the $q$-Onsager algebra, the positive part of the $q$-deformed enveloping algebra $U_q({\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}}_2)$, and the enveloping algebra of the Onsager Lie algebra.
  In this paper, we introduce the $S_3$-symmetric tridiagonal algebra. This algebra has six generators. The generators can be identified with the vertices of a regular hexagon, such that nonadjacent generators commute and adjacent generators satisfy a pair of tridiagonal relations. For a $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graph $\Gamma$ we turn the tensor power $V^{\otimes 3}$ of the standard module $V$ into a module for an $S_3$-symmetric tridiagonal algebra.
  We investigate in detail the case in which $\Gamma$ is a Hamming graph. We give some conjectures and open problems.</description>

      <title>A further $q$-analogue of a formula due to Guillera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hou, Krattenthaler, and Sun have introduced two $q$-analogues of a remarkable series for $\pi^2$ due to Guillera, and these $q$-identities were, respectively, proved with the use of a $q$-analogue of a Wilf-Zeilberger pair provided by Guillera and with the use of ${}_{3}\phi_{2}$-transforms. We prove a $q$-analogue of Guillera's formula for $\pi^2$ that is inequivalent to previously known $q$-analogues of the same formula due to Guillera, including the Hou-Krattenthaler-Sun $q$-identities and a subsequent $q$-identity due to Wei. In contrast to previously known $q$-analogues of Guillera's formula, our new $q$-analogue involves another free parameter apart from the $q$-parameter. Our derivation of this new result relies on the $q$-analogue of Zeilberger's algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Lov\'{a}sz conjectured that every connected vertex-transitive graph contains a hamilton path in 1970. First we reveal the structure of connected vertex-transitive graphs with an odd number of vertices. Then we prove that every connected vertex-transitive graph with an odd number of vertices is hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of minimal transversals of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating all minimal transversals (also called minimal hitting sets) of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$. An equivalent formulation of this problem known as the \emph{transversal hypergraph} problem (or \emph{hypergraph dualization} problem) is to decide, given two hypergraphs, whether one corresponds to the set of minimal transversals of the other. The existence of a polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem is a long standing open question. In \cite{fredman_complexity_1996}, the authors present the first sub-exponential algorithm to solve the transversal hypergraph problem which runs in quasi-polynomial time, making it unlikely that the problem is (co)NP-complete.
  In this paper, we show that when one of the two hypergraphs is of bounded VC-dimension, the transversal hypergraph problem can be solved in polynomial time, or equivalently that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a hypergraph of bounded VC-dimension, then there exists an incremental polynomial time algorithm to enumerate its minimal transversals. This result generalizes most of the previously known polynomial cases in the literature since they almost all consider classes of hypergraphs of bouded VC-dimension. As a consequence, the hypergraph transversal problem is solvable in polynomial time for any class of hypergraphs closed under partial subhypergraphs. We also show that the proposed algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time in general hypergraphs and runs in polynomial time if the conformality of the hypergraph is bounded, which is one of the few known polynomial cases where the VC-dimension is unbounded.</description>

      <title>On $Q$-Polynomial distance-regular graphs with a linear dependency involving a $3$-clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ denote a distance-regular graph with diameter $D \geq 2$. Let $E$ denote a primitive idempotent of $\Gamma$ with respect to which $\Gamma$ is $Q$-polynomial. Assume that there exists a $3$-clique $x,y,z$ such that $E\hat{x},E\hat{y},E\hat{z}$ are linearly dependent. In this paper, we classify all the $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graphs $\Gamma$ with the above property. We describe these graphs from multiple points of view.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two players play a game by alternately splitting a surface of a compact $2$-manifold along a simple closed curve that is not null-homotopic and attaching disks to the resulting boundary; the last player who can move wins. Starting from an orientable surface, the $G$-series is $01\dot{2}\dot{0}$ according to increasing genus. Starting from a nonorientable surface, the $G$-series is $012\dot{4}60\dot{3}$ according to increasing genus. Nim addition determines the $G$-values of the remaining compact $2$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Multicolor Star-Critical Ramsey Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star-critical Ramsey number is a refinement of the concept of a Ramsey number. In this paper, we give equivalent criteria for which the star-critical Ramsey number vanishes. Next, we provide a new general lower bound for multicolor star-critical Ramsey numbers whenever it does not vanish. As an application, we evaluate $r_*(P_k, P_3, P_3)$, where $P_n$ is a path of order $n$. In the process of proving these results, we also show that $r_*(C_5, P_3)=3$, where $C_5$ is a cycle of order $5$.</description>

      <title>Chromatic polynomials of signed graphs and dominating-vertex deletion formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit non-switching-isomorphic signed graphs that share a common underlying graph and common chromatic polynomials, thereby answering a question posed by Zaslavsky. For various joins of all-positive or all-negative signed complete graphs, we derive a closed-form expression for their chromatic polynomials. As a generalisation of the chromatic polynomials for a signed graph, we introduce a new pair of bivariate chromatic polynomials. We establish recursive dominating-vertex deletion formulae for these bivariate chromatic polynomials. Finally, we show that for certain families of signed threshold graphs, isomorphism is equivalent to the equality of bivariate chromatic polynomials.</description>

      <title>Packing density of sets with only two non-mixed gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite set of integers such that the first few gaps between its consecutive elements equal $a$, while the remaining gaps equal $b$, we study dense packings of its translates on the line. We obtain an explicit lower bound on the corresponding optimal density, conjecture its tightness, and prove it in case one of the gap lengths, $a$ or $b$, appears only once. This is equivalent to a Motzkin problem on the independence ratio of certain integer distance graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is well-(edge-)dominated if every minimal (edge) dominating set is minimum. A graph is equimatchable if every maximal matching is maximum. We study these concepts on strong product graphs. We fully characterize well-edge-dominated and equimatchable strong product graphs of nontrivial graphs, and identify a large family of graphs whose strong products with any well-dominated graph are well-dominated.</description>

      <title>Duality for the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ weight system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ weight system, corresponding to the colored Jones polynomial of knots, is one of the the simplest weight system for chord diagrams. Recent works have led to explicit computations of this weight system on chord diagrams with complete and complete bipartite intersection graphs using $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ weight systems on shares, i.e., on chord diagrams on two strands.
  In this paper, we continue our study of shares. We prove a conjecture by Lando about a duality of values of the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ weight system on chord diagrams whose intersection graphs are joins of complementary graphs with discrete ones. To achieve this, we introduce the two-colored intersection graph of shares, define the inner product of shares, and use chord-adding operators.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture related to the Davenport constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite group $G,$ $D(G)$ is defined as the least positive integer $k$ such that for every sequence $S=g_1 g_2\cdots g_k$ of length $k$ over $G$, there exist $1 \le i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt;\cdots &lt; i_m \le k $ such that $\prod_{j=1}^{m} g_{i_{\sigma(j)}}=1$ holds for $\sigma = id,$ identity element of $S_m.$ For a finite abelian group, this group invariant, known as the Davenport constant, is crucial in the theory of non-unique factorization domains. The precise value of this invariant, even for a finite abelian group of rank greater than $2$, is not known yet. In 1977, Olson and White first worked with this invariant for finite non-abelian groups. After that in 2004, Dimitrov dealt with it, where he proved that $D(G)\leq L(G)$ for a finite $p$-group $G$, where $p$ is a prime and $L(G)$ is the Loewy length of $\mathbb{F}_pG.$ He conjectured that equality holds for all finite $p$-groups. In this article, we compute $D(G)$ for a certain subclass of $2$-generated finite $p$-groups of nilpotency class two and show that the conjecture is true by determining the precise value of the Loewy length of $\mathbb{F}_pG.$ We also evaluate $D(G)$ for finite dicyclic, semi-dihedral and some other groups.</description>

We provide an affirmative answer to this question, showing that there exists a set of $n$ points such that $\lfloor \frac{n}{4}\rfloor$ distances occur more than $n$ times. We also present a generalized version, finding a set of $n$ points where $c_m \cdot n$ distances occurring more than $n+m$ times.</description>

      <title>The cyclicity rank of empty lattice simplices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in algebraic properties of empty lattice simplices $\Delta$, that is, $d$-dimensional lattice polytopes containing exactly $d+1$ points of the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The cyclicity rank of $\Delta$ is the minimal number of cyclic subgroups that the quotient group of $\Delta$ splits into. It is known that up to dimension $d \leq 4$, every empty lattice $d$-simplex is cyclic, meaning that its cyclicity rank is at most $1$. We determine the maximal possible cyclicity rank of an empty lattice $d$-simplex for dimensions $d \leq 8$, and determine the asymptotics of this number up to a logarithmic term.</description>

      <title>Cycles of weight divisible by $k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A weighted (directed) graph is a (directed) graph with integer weights assigned to its vertices and edges. The weight of a subgraph is the sum of weights of vertices and edges in the subgraph. The problem of determining the largest order $f(k)$ of a weighted complete directed graph that does not contain a directed cycle of weight divisible by $k$, for an integer $k \ge 2$, was raised by Alon and Krivelevich [J. Graph Theory 98 (2021) 623-629]. They showed that $f(k)$ is $O(k\log k)$ and $f(k) \le 2k-2$ if $k$ is prime. The best bounds known to us are $f(k) \le 2k-2$ for all $k$ and $f(k) &lt; (3k-1)/2$ for prime $k$. It is also known that $f(k) \ge k$ and this is believed to be the correct value. We prove that $f(k) &lt; k+2\Omega(k)$, where $\Omega(k)$ is the number of prime factors, not necessarily distinct, in the prime factorization of $k$.
  We also show that any weighted undirected graph of minimum degree $2k-1$ contains a cycle of weight divisible by $k$. This result is proved in the more general setting in which the weights are from a finite abelian group of order $k$, and the cycle has weight equal to the group identity. We conjecture that this holds for undirected graphs with minimum degree $k+1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first combinatorial proof of the Graham-Pollak Formula for the determinant of the distance matrix of a tree, via sign-reversing involutions and the Lindstr\"om-Gessel-Viennot Lemma. Our approach provides a cohesive and unified framework for the understanding of the existing generalizations and $q$-analogues of the Graham-Pollak Formula, and facilitates the derivation of a natural simultaneous generalizations for them.</description>

      <title>Knockout tournaments admitting all candidates as winners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of $2^n$ candidates is presented to a commission. At every round, each member of the commission votes by pairwise comparison, and one-half of the candidates is deleted from the tournament, the remaining candidates proceeding to the next round until the $n$-th round (the final one) in which a winner is declared. The candidates are arranged on a blackboard in a given order, with the relative order among the candidates maintained at all rounds. In the case of $2^n$ candidates, with $n \geq 3$, we identify a voting profile for which any candidate could win just by choosing a proper initial order of the candidates. A study on the size of the commission is carried out in order to obtain the desired result of any candidate being a possible winner. We construct such a commission with $4n -3$ voters for $2^n$ candidates. Moreover, in the setting of a random number of voters, we obtain the same results, with high probability, when the expected number of voters is large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise an explicit method for computing combinatorial formulae for Hadamard products of certain rational generating functions. The latter arise naturally when studying so-called ask zeta functions of direct sums of modules of matrices or class- and orbit-counting zeta functions of direct products of nilpotent groups. Our method relies on shuffle compatibility of coloured permutation statistics and coloured quasisymmetric functions, extending recent work of Gessel and Zhuang.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a short proof of a recent result of Claesson, Dukes, Frankl\'in and Stef\'ansson, that connects tournament score sequences and the Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv numbers from additive number theory. We show that this connection is, in fact, an instance of the L\'evy-Khintchine formula from probability theory, and highlight how such formulas can be useful in enumerative combinatorics. Our proof combines renewal theory with the representation of score sequences as lattice paths, due to Erd\H{o}s and Moser in the 1960s. These probabilistic and geometric points of view lead to a simpler proof. A key idea in the original proof and ours is to consider cyclic shifts of score sequences. We observe, however, that this idea is already present in Kleitman's remarks added to one of Moser's final articles in 1968, and in subsequent works by Kleitman. In the same article, Moser conjectured that there are asymptotically $C4^n/n^{5/2}$ many score sequences of length $n$. Combining the arguments in the current work with those in a recent work by the third author, we demonstrate the utility of the L\'evy-Khintchine method, by giving a short proof of Moser's conjecture.</description>

Abstract: A cubic partition is an integer partition wherein the even parts can appear in two colors. In this paper, we introduce the notion of generalized cubic partitions and prove a number of new congruences akin to the classical Ramanujan-type. We emphasize two methods of proofs, one elementary (relying significantly on functional equations) and the other based on modular forms. We close by proving analogous results for generalized overcubic partitions.</description>

Abstract: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states are quantum states involving at least three entangled particles. They are of fundamental interest in quantum information theory, and the construction of such states of high dimension has various applications in quantum communication and cryptography. They are of fundamental interest in quantum information theory, and the construction of such states of high dimension has various applications in quantum communication and cryptography. Krenn, Gu and Zeilinger discovered a correspondence between a large class of quantum optical experiments which produce GHZ states and edge-weighted edge-coloured multi-graphs with some special properties called the \emph{GHZ graphs}. On such GHZ graphs, a graph parameter called \emph{dimension} can be defined, which is the same as the dimension of the GHZ state produced by the corresponding experiment. Krenn and Gu conjectured that the dimension of any GHZ graph with more than $4$ vertices is at most $2$. An affirmative resolution of the Krenn-Gu conjecture has implications for quantum resource theory. On the other hand, the construction of a GHZ graph on a large number of vertices with a high dimension would lead to breakthrough results.
  In this paper, we study the existence of GHZ graphs from the perspective of the Krenn-Gu conjecture and show that the conjecture is true for graphs of vertex connectivity at most 2 and for cubic graphs. We also show that the minimal counterexample to the conjecture should be $4$-connected. Such information could be of great help in the search for GHZ graphs using existing tools like PyTheus. While the impact of the work is in quantum physics, the techniques in this paper are purely combinatorial, and no background in quantum physics is required to understand them.</description>

      <title>A Parameterized Algorithm for Vertex and Edge Connectivity of Embedded Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of computing vertex and edge connectivity of a graph are classical problems in algorithmic graph theory. The focus of this paper is on computing these parameters on embedded graphs. A typical example of an embedded graph is a planar graph which can be drawn with no edge crossings. It has long been known that vertex and edge connectivity of planar embedded graphs can be computed in linear time. Very recently, Biedl and Murali extended the techniques from planar graphs to 1-plane graphs without $\times$-crossings, i.e., crossings whose endpoints induce a matching. While the tools used were novel, they were highly tailored to 1-plane graphs, and do not provide much leeway for further extension. In this paper, we develop alternate techniques that are simpler, have wider applications to near-planar graphs, and can be used to test both vertex and edge connectivity. Our technique works for all those embedded graphs where any pair of crossing edges are connected by a path that, roughly speaking, can be covered with few cells of the drawing. Important examples of such graphs include optimal 2-planar and optimal 3-planar graphs, $d$-map graphs, $d$-framed graphs, graphs with bounded crossing number, and $k$-plane graphs with bounded number of $\times$-crossings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to extend the quiver Grassmannian description of certain degenerations of Grassmann varieties to the symplectic case. We introduce a symplectic version of quiver Grassmannians studied in our previous papers and prove a number of results on these projective algebraic varieties. First, we construct a cellular decomposition of the symplectic quiver Grassmannians in question and develop combinatorics needed to compute Euler characteristics and Poincar\'e polynomials. Second, we show that the number of irreducible components of our varieties coincides with the Euler characteristic of the classical symplectic Grassmannians. Third, we describe the automorphism groups of the underlying symplectic quiver representations and show that the cells are the orbits of this group. Lastly, we provide an embedding into the affine flag varieties for the affine symplectic group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the triply-graded Khovanov-Rozansky homology of the $(m,n)$ torus knot can be recovered from the finite-dimensional representation $\mathrm{L}_{m/n}$ of the rational Cherednik algebra at slope $m/n$, endowed with the Hodge filtration coming from the cuspidal character D-module. Our approach involves expressing the associated graded of the cuspidal character D-module in terms of a dg module closely related to the action of the shuffle algebra on the equivariant K-theory of the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane, thereby proving the rational master conjecture. As a corollary, we identify the Hodge filtration with the inductive and algebraic filtrations on $\mathrm{L}_{m/n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1706.03322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $g$-theorem is a momentous result in combinatorics that gives a complete numerical characterization of the face numbers of simplicial convex polytopes. The $g$-conjecture asserts that the same numerical conditions given in the $g$-theorem also characterizes the face numbers of all simplicial spheres, or even more generally, all simplicial homology spheres.
  In this paper, we prove the $g$-conjecture for simplicial $\mathbb{R}$-homology spheres. A key idea in our proof is a new algebra structure for polytopal complexes. Given a polytopal $d$-complex $\Delta$, we use ideas from rigidity theory to construct a graded Artinian $\mathbb{R}$-algebra $\Psi(\Delta,\nu)$ of stresses on a PL realization $\nu$ of $\Delta$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where overlapping realized $d$-faces are allowed. In particular, we prove that if $\Delta$ is a simplicial $\mathbb{R}$-homology sphere, then for generic PL realizations $\nu$, the stress algebra $\Psi(\Delta,\nu)$ is Gorenstein and has the weak Lefschetz property.</description>

      <title>On adjacency operators of locally finite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $\Gamma$ is called locally finite if, for each vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, the set $\Gamma(v)$ of all neighbors of $v$ in $\Gamma$ is finite. For any locally finite graph $\Gamma$ with vertex set $V(\Gamma)$ and for any field $F$, let $F^{V(\Gamma)}$ be the vector space over $F$ of all functions $V(\Gamma) \to F$ (with natural componentwise operations) and let $A^{({\rm alg})}_{\Gamma,F}$ be the linear operator $F^{V(\Gamma)} \to F^{V(\Gamma)}$ defined by $(A^{({\rm alg})}_{\Gamma,F}(f))(v) = \sum_{u \in \Gamma(v)}f(u)$ for all $f \in F^{V(\Gamma)}$, $v \in V(\Gamma)$. In the case of finite graph $\Gamma$ the mapping $A^{({\rm alg})}_{\Gamma,F}$ is the well known operator defined by the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma$ (over $F$), and the theory of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of such operator is a well-developed (at least in the case $F = \mathbb{C}$) part of the theory of finite graphs. In this paper we develope a theory of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $A^{({\rm alg})}_{\Gamma,F}$ for arbitrary infinite locally finite graphs $\Gamma$ (although a few results may be of interest for finite graphs) and fields $F$ with a special emphasis on the case when $\Gamma$ is connected with uniformly bounded vertex degrees and $F = \mathbb{C}$. By the author opinion, previous attempts in this direction were not quite satisfactory since were limited by consideration of rather special eigenfunctions and corresponding eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Inductive Freeness of Ziegler's Canonical Multiderivations for Restrictions of Reflection Arrangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal A$ be a free hyperplane arrangement. In 1989, Ziegler showed that the restriction $\mathcal A"$ of $\mathcal A$ to any hyperplane endowed with the natural multiplicity $\kappa$ is then a free multiarrangement. In 2024, the first two authors proved an analogue of Ziegler's theorem for the stronger notion of inductive freeness: if $\mathcal A$ is inductively free, then so is the free multiarrangement $(\mathcal A'',\kappa)$. In 2018, all reflection arrangements which admit inductively free Ziegler restrictions were classified by the first two authors. The aim of this paper is an extension of this classification to all restrictions of reflection arrangements utilizing the aforementioned fundamental result from the 2024 paper of the first two authors.</description>

Abstract: If your socks come out of the laundry all mixed up, how should you sort them? We introduce and study a novel foot-sorting algorithm that uses feet to attempt to sort a sock ordering; one can view this algorithm as an analogue of Knuth's stack-sorting algorithm for set partitions. The sock orderings that can be sorted using a fixed number of feet are characterized by Klazar's notion of set partition pattern containment. We give an enumeration involving Fibonacci numbers for the $1$-foot-sortable sock orderings within a naturally-arising class. We also prove that if you have socks of $n$ different colors, then you can always sort them using at most $\left\lceil\log_2(n)\right\rceil$ feet, and we use a Ramsey-theoretic argument to show that this bound is tight.</description>

Abstract: Finding the maximum size of a Sidon set in $\mathbb{F}_2^t$ is of research interest for more than 40 years. In order to tackle this problem we recall a one-to-one correspondence between sum-free Sidon sets and linear codes with minimum distance greater or equal 5. Our main contribution about codes is a new non-existence result for linear codes with minimum distance 5 based on a sharpening of the Johnson bound. This gives, on the Sidon set side, an improvement of the general upper bound for the maximum size of a Sidon set. Additionally, we characterise maximal Sidon sets, that are those Sidon sets which can not be extended by adding elements without loosing the Sidon property, up to dimension 6 and give all possible sizes for dimension 7 and 8 determined by computer calculations.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for all $r\in \mathbb{N}\cup \{0\}$ and $s,t\in \mathbb{N}$, there exists $\Omega=\Omega(r,s,t)\in \mathbb{N}$ with the following property. Let $G$ be a graph and let $H$ be a subgraph of $G$ isomorphic to a $(\leq r)$-subdivision of $K_{\Omega}$. Then either $G$ contains $K_t$ or $K_{t,t}$ as an induced subgraph, or there is an induced subgraph $J$ of $G$ isomorphic to a proper $(\leq r)$-subdivision of $K_s$ such that every branch vertex of $J$ is a branch vertex of $H$. This answers in the affirmative a question of Lozin and Razgon. In fact, we show that both the branch vertices and the paths corresponding to the subdivided edges between them can be preserved.</description>

Abstract: We study decompositions of words into subwords that are in some sense similar, which means that one subword may be obtained from the other by a relatively simple transformation. Our main inspiration are shuffle squares, an intriguing class of words arising in various contexts, from purely combinatorial to more applied, like modeling concurrent processes or DNA sequencing. These words can be split into two parts that are just identical. For example, $ACTACATAGG$ is a shuffle square consisting of two copies of the word $ACTAG$. Of course, each letter must appear any even number of times in each shuffle square. We call words with that property even.
  We mainly discuss new problems concerning generalized shuffle squares. We propose a number of conjectures and provide some initial results towards them. We prove that every binary word is a cyclic shuffle square, meaning that it splits into two subwords, one of which is a~cyclic permutation of the other. The same statement is no longer true over larger alphabets, but it seems plausible that a similar property should hold with slightly less restricted permutation classes. For instance, we conjecture that every even ternary word is a dihedral shuffle square, which means that it splits into two subwords, one of which can be obtained from the other by a permutation corresponding to the~symmetry of a~regular polygon. We propose a general conjecture stating that a linear number of permutations is sufficient to express all even $k$-ary words as generalized shuffle squares.
  Our discussion is complemented by some enumerative and computational experiments. In particular, we disprove our former conjecture stating that every even binary word can be turned into a shuffle square by a cyclic permutation. The smallest counterexample has length $24$. We call words of this type shuffle anti-squares. We determined all of them up to the length $28$.</description>

      <title>The extremals of the Kahn-Saks inequality</title>

Abstract: A classical result of Kahn and Saks states that given any partially ordered set with two distinguished elements, the number of linear extensions in which the ranks of the distinguished elements differ by $k$ is log-concave as a function of $k$. The log-concave sequences that can arise in this manner prove to exhibit a much richer structure, however, than is evident from log-concavity alone. The main result of this paper is a complete characterization of the extremals of the Kahn-Saks inequality: we obtain a detailed combinatorial understanding of where and what kind of geometric progressions can appear in these log-concave sequences. This settles a partial conjecture of Chan-Pak-Panova, while the analysis uncovers new extremals that were not previously conjectured. The proof relies on a much more general geometric mechanism -- a hard Lefschetz theorem for nef classes that was obtained in the setting of convex polytopes by Shenfeld and Van Handel -- which forms a model for the investigation of such structures in other combinatorial problems.</description>

      <title>Complete characterization of graphs with local total antimagic chromatic number 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14653v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A total labeling of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is said to be local total antimagic if it is a bijection $f: V\cup E \to\{1,\ldots ,|V|+|E|\}$ such that adjacent vertices, adjacent edges, and incident vertex and edge have distinct induced weights where the induced weight of a vertex $v$, $w_f(v) = \sum f(e)$ with $e$ ranging over all the edges incident to $v$, and the induced weight of an edge $uv$ is $w_f(uv) = f(u) + f(v)$. The local total antimagic chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_{lt}(G)$, is the minimum number of distinct induced vertex and edge weights over all local total antimagic labelings of $G$. In this paper, we first obtained general lower and upper bounds for $\chi_{lt}(G)$ and sufficient conditions to construct a graph $H$ with $k$ pendant edges and $\chi_{lt}(H) \in\{\Delta(H)+1, k+1\}$. We then completely characterized graphs $G$ with $\chi_{lt}(G)=3$. Many families of (disconnected) graphs $H$ with $k$ pendant edges and $\chi_{lt}(H) \in\{\Delta(H)+1, k+1\}$ are also obtained.</description>

Abstract: We show that the sets of $d$-dimensional Latin hypercubes over a non-empty set $X$, with $d$ running over the positive integers, determine an operad which is isomorphic to a sub-operad of the endomorphism operad of $X$. We generalise this to categories with finite products, and then further to internal versions for certain Cartesian closed monoidal categories with pullbacks.</description>

      <title>The Strong Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture is True for $d \leq 2(k+1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arboricity $\Gamma(G)$ of an undirected graph $G =(V,E)$ is the minimal number $k$ such that $E$ can be partitioned into $k$ forests on $V$. Nash-Williams' formula states that $k = \lceil \gamma(G) \rceil$, where $\gamma(G)$ is the maximum of $\frac{|E_{H}|}{|V_{H}|-1}$ over all subgraphs $(V_H , E_H )$ of $G$ with $|V_H | \geq 2$. The Strong Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture states that if $\gamma(G) \leq k + \frac{d}{d+k+1}$ for $k, d \in \mathbb{N}$, then there is a partition of the edge set of $G$ into $k + 1$ forests on $V$ such that one forest has at most $d$ edges in each connected component. Here we prove the Strong Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture when $d \leq 2(k +1)$, which is a new result for all $(k, d)$ such that $d &gt; k + 1$. In fact, we prove a stronger theorem. We prove that a weaker sparsity notion, called $(k, d)$-sparseness, suffices to give the decomposition, under the assumption that the graph decomposes into $k+1$ forests. This is a new result for all $(k, d)$ where $d &gt; 1$, and improves upon the recent resolution of the Overfull Nine Dragon Tree Theorem for all $(k, d)$ when $d \leq 2(k +1)$. As a corollary, we obtain that planar graphs of girth five decompose into a forest and a forest where every component has at most four edges, and by duality, we obtain that $5$-edge-connected planar graphs have a $\frac{4}{5}$-thin tree, improving a result of the authors that $5$-edge-connected planar graphs have a $\frac{5}{6}$-thin tree</description>

      <title>Some new Bollob\'as-type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family of disjoint pairs of finite sets $\mathcal{P}=\{(A_i,B_i)\mid i\in[m]\}$ is called a Bollob\'as system if $A_i\cap B_j\neq\emptyset$ for every $i\neq j$, and a skew Bollob\'as system if $A_i\cap B_j\neq\emptyset$ for every $i&lt;j$. Bollob\'as proved that for a Bollob\'as system, the inequality \begin{equation*} \sum_{i=1}^m\binom{|A_i|+|B_i|}{|A_i|}^{-1}\leq 1 \end{equation*} holds. Heged\"{u}s and Frankl generalized this theorem to skew Bollob\'as systems with the inequality \begin{equation*} \sum_{i=1}^m\binom{|A_i|+|B_i|}{|A_i|}^{-1}\leq 1+n, \end{equation*} provided $A_i,B_i\subseteq [n]$. In this paper, we improve this inequality to \begin{equation*} \sum_{i=1}^m \left((1+|A_i|+|B_i|) \binom{|A_i|+|B_i|}{|A_i|}\right)^{-1} \leq 1 \end{equation*} with probabilistic method. We also generalize this result to partitions of sets on both symmetric and skew cases.</description>

      <title>Constructions, bounds, and algorithms for peaceable queens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The peaceable queens problem asks to determine the maximum number $a(n)$ such that there is a placement of $a(n)$ white queens and $a(n)$ black queens on an $n \times n$ chessboard so that no queen can capture any queen of the opposite color. In this paper, we consider the peaceable queens problem and its variant on the toroidal board. For the regular board, we show that $a(n) \leq 0.1716n^2$, for all sufficiently large $n$. This improves on the bound $a(n) \leq 0.25n^2$ of van Bommel and MacEachern.
  For the toroidal board, we provide new upper and lower bounds. Somewhat surprisingly, our bounds show that there is a sharp contrast in behaviour between the odd torus and the even torus. Our lower bounds are given by explicit constructions. For the upper bounds, we formulate the problem as a non-linear optimization problem with at most $100$ variables, regardless of the size of the board. We solve our non-linear program exactly using modern optimization software.
  We also provide a local search algorithm and a software implementation which converges very rapidly to solutions which appear optimal. Our algorithm is sufficiently robust that it works on both the regular and toroidal boards. For example, for the regular board, the algorithm quickly finds the so-called Ainley construction. Thus, our work provides some further evidence that the Ainley construction is indeed optimal.</description>

If $S \subseteq G$ is a random set of size $k$, with $k \geq (\log n)^{1+\varepsilon}$ for some $\varepsilon &gt;0$, then the diameter of the corresponding Schreier graph is $O(\log_k n)$ with high probability. Except for the implicit constant, this result is the best possible.</description>

      <title>Sharp relations between volume growth, isoperimetry and escape probability in vertex-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.01467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove sharp bounds on the probability that the simple random walk on a vertex-transitive graph escapes the ball of radius $r$ before returning to its starting point. In particular, this shows that if the ball of radius $r$ has size slightly greater than quadratic in $r$ then this probability is bounded from below. On the other hand, we show that if the ball of radius $r$ has volume slightly less than cubic in $r$ then this probability decays logarithmically for all larger balls. These results represent a finitary refinement of Varopoulos's theorem that a random walk on a vertex-transitive graph is recurrent if and only if the graph has at most quadratic volume growth. They also imply the existence of a gap at $0$ for escape probabilities: there exists a universal constant $c&gt;0$ such that the random walk on an arbitrary vertex-transitive graph is either recurrent or has a probability of at least $c$ of escaping to infinity. We also prove versions of these results for finite graphs, in particular confirming and strengthening a conjecture of Benjamini and Kozma from 2002. Amongst other things, we also generalise our results to give a sharp finitary version of the characterisation of $p$-parabolic vertex-transitive graphs, prove a number of sharp isoperimetric inequalities for vertex-transitive graphs, and prove a locality result for the escape probability of the random walk on a vertex-transitive graph that can be seen as an analogue of Schramm's locality conjecture for the critical percolation probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a combinatorial structure of orthogeodesics on hyperbolic surfaces and presents several relations among them. As a primary application, we propose a recursive method for computing the trace (the hyperbolic cosine of the length) of orthogeodesics and establish the existence of surfaces where the trace of each orthogeodesic is an integer. These surfaces and their orthogeodesics are closely related to integral Apollonian circle packings. Notably, we found a new type of root-flipping that transitions between roots in different quadratic Diophantine equations of a certain type, with Vieta root-flipping as a special case. Finally, we provide a combinatorial proof of Basmajian's identity for hyperbolic surfaces, akin to Bowditch's combinatorial proof of the McShane identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finite graph and let $A(\Gamma)$ be the corresponding right-angled Artin group. From an arbitrary basis $\mathcal B$ of $H^1(A(\Gamma),\mathbb F)$ over an arbitrary field, we construct a natural graph $\Gamma_{\mathcal B}$ from the cup product, called the \emph{cohomology basis graph}. We show that $\Gamma_{\mathcal B}$ always contains $\Gamma$ as a subgraph. This provides an effective way to reconstruct the defining graph $\Gamma$ from the cohomology of $A(\Gamma)$, to characterize the planarity of the defining graph from the algebra of $A(\Gamma)$, and to recover many other natural graph-theoretic invariants. We also investigate the behavior of the cohomology basis graph under passage to elementary subminors, and show that it is not well-behaved under edge contraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we give a simple closed formula for an arbitrary product, landing in dimension 0, of boundary classes on the Deligne--Mumford moduli space M_0,n-bar. For any such boundary strata $X_{T_1}, \ldots, X_{T_\ell}$, we show the intersection product $\int \prod_{i=1}^\ell [X_{T_i}]$ is either a signed product of multinomial coefficients, or zero, and provide a simple criterion for determining when it is nonzero.
  We do not claim originality for our product formula, but to our knowledge it does not appear elsewhere in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Family of Low-Complexity Binary Codes with Constant Hamming Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the design of binary constant weight codes that admit low-complexity encoding and decoding algorithms, and that have a size $M=2^k$. For every integer $\ell \geq 3$, we construct a $(n=2^\ell, M=2^{k_{\ell}}, d=2)$ constant weight code ${\cal C}[\ell]$ of weight $\ell$ by encoding information in the gaps between successive $1$'s. The code is associated with an integer sequence of length $\ell$ with a constraint defined as {\em anchor-decodability} that ensures low complexity for encoding and decoding. The complexity of the encoding is linear in the input size $k$, and that of the decoding is poly-logarithmic in the input size $n$, discounting the linear time spent on parsing the input. Both the algorithms do not require expensive computation of binomial coefficients, unlike the case in many existing schemes. Among codes generated by all anchor-decodable sequences, we show that ${\cal C}[\ell]$ has the maximum size with $k_{\ell} \geq \ell^2-\ell\log_2\ell + \log_2\ell - 0.279\ell - 0.721$. As $k$ is upper bounded by $\ell^2-\ell\log_2\ell +O(\ell)$ information-theoretically, the code ${\cal C}[\ell]$ is optimal in its size with respect to two higher order terms of $\ell$. In particular, $k_\ell$ meets the upper bound for $\ell=3$ and one-bit away for $\ell=4$. On the other hand, we show that ${\cal C}[\ell]$ is not unique in attaining $k_{\ell}$ by constructing an alternate code ${\cal \hat{C}}[\ell]$ again parameterized by an integer $\ell \geq 3$ with a different low-complexity decoder, yet having the same size $2^{k_{\ell}}$ when $3 \leq \ell \leq 7$. Finally, we also derive new codes by modifying ${\cal C}[\ell]$ that offer a wider range on blocklength and weight while retaining low complexity for encoding and decoding. For certain selected values of parameters, these modified codes too have an optimal $k$.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative largeness of $\textit{de Polignac numbers}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A number $m$ is said to be a $\textit{de Polignac number}$, if infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes exist, such that $m$ can be written as the difference of those consecutive prime numbers. Recently in [ W. D. Banks: Consecutive primes and IP sets, arXiv:2403.10637.], using arguments from the Ramsey theory, W. D. Banks proved that the collection of $\textit{de Polignac number}$ is an $IP^\star$ set (Though his original statement is relatively weaker, an iterative application of pigeonhole principle/ theory of ultrafilters shows that this statement is sufficient to conclude the set is $IP^\star$). As a consequence, we have this collection as an additively syndetic set. In this article, we show that this collection is also a multiplicative syndetic set. In our proof, we use combinatorial arguments and the tools from the algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of discrete semigroups (for details see [N. Hindman, and D. Strauss: Algebra in the Stone-\v{C}ech Compactification: Theory and Applications, second edition, de Gruyter, Berlin,2012.]).</description>

      <title>CWR sequence of invariants of alternating links and its properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the $CWR$ invariant, a new invariant for alternating links, which builds upon and generalizes the $WRP$ invariant. The $CWR$ invariant is an array of two-variable polynomials that provides a stronger invariant compared to the $WRP$ invariant. We compare the strength of our invariant with the classical HOMFLYPT, Kauffman $3$-variable, and Kauffman $2$-variable polynomials on specific knot examples. Additionally, we derive general recursive "skein" relations, and also specific formulas for the initial components of the $CWR$ invariant using weighted adjacency matrices of modified Tait graphs.</description>

      <title>On Conjecture of Binomial Edge Ideals of Linear Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ideal $I$ of a commutative ring $R$ is said to be of linear type when its Rees algebra and symmetric algebra exhibit isomorphism. In this paper, we investigate the conjecture put forth by Jayanthan, Kumar, and Sarkar (2021) that if $G$ is a tree or a unicyclic graph, then the binomial edge ideal of $G$ is of linear type. Our investigation validates this conjecture for trees. However, our study reveals that not all unicyclic graphs adhere to this conjecture.</description>
