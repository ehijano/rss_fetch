      <title>Highly correlated optomechanical oscillations manifested by an anomalous stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by a sufficiently powerful pump laser, a cavity optomechanical system will stabilize in coupled oscillations of its cavity field and mechanical resonator. It was assumed that the oscillation will be continuously magnified upon enhancing the driving laser further. However, based on the nonlinear dynamics of the system, we find that the dynamical behaviors of the system are much more complex than this intuitive picture, especially when it is operated near the blue detuning point by the mechanical resonator's intrinsic frequency. There exists an anomalous stabilization: depending on its intrinsic damping rate and the pump power, the mechanical resonator will metastably stay on one orbit of oscillation after another until it completely stabilizes on the final orbit it can reach. These orbits are consistent with the locked ones with almost fixed oscillation amplitudes, which are realized after the pump power becomes still higher. The oscillatory cavity field is seen to adjust its sidebands following the mechanical frequency shift due to optical spring effect, so that it always drives the mechanical resonator to near those locked orbits once the pump power is over a threshold. In the regimes with such correlation between cavity field sidebands and mechanical oscillation, the system's dynamical attractors are confined on the locked orbits and chaotic motion is also excluded.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning and the Early Estimation of Single-Photon Source Quality using Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of single-photon sources (SPSs) is central to numerous systems and devices proposed amidst a modern surge in quantum technology. However, manufacturing schemes remain imperfect, and single-photon emission purity must often be experimentally verified via interferometry. Such a process is typically slow and costly, which has motivated growing research into whether SPS quality can be more rapidly inferred from incomplete emission statistics. Hence, this study is a sequel to previous work that demonstrated significant uncertainty in the standard method of quality estimation, i.e. the least-squares fitting of a physically motivated function, and asks: can machine learning (ML) do better? The study leverages eight datasets obtained from measurements involving an exemplary quantum emitter, i.e. a single InGaAs/GaAs epitaxial quantum dot; these eight contexts predominantly vary in the intensity of the exciting laser. Specifically, via a form of `transfer learning', five ML models, three linear and two ensemble-based, are trained on data from seven of the contexts and tested on the eighth. Validation metrics quickly reveal that even a linear regressor can outperform standard fitting when it is tested on the same contexts it was trained on, but the success of transfer learning is less assured, even though statistical analysis, made possible by data augmentation, suggests its superiority as an early estimator. Accordingly, the study concludes by discussing future strategies for grappling with the problem of SPS context dissimilarity, e.g. feature engineering and model adaptation.</description>

      <title>Optical and microstructural studies of femtosecond laser treated amorphous germanium thin coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the relaxation mechanism of amorphous germanium after femtosecond laser irradiation is presented in this work. In particular, a thin germanium coating was deposited onto a glass substrate through the electron beam vacuum coating method. The substrate was kept at room temperature during the coating process, which resulted in a deposited layer characterized by an amorphous microstructure, as observed from the X-ray diffraction. The germanium layer was then irradiated with a femtosecond laser at 1030 nm wavelength, while varying the net fluence from 15 J cm-2 to 90 J cm-2. Moreover, an extended two temperature model was used to extract the electronic and lattice temperature of the laser heated germanium coating, showing a 32% contribution from heating due to the thermal accumulation effect. The microstructural and morphological studies of the irradiated samples were carried out using X-ray diffraction and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. From the X-ray diffraction results, it was observed that at higher laser fluence there is an emergence of crystallinity on the germanium layer, with no evidence of oxidation. On the surface, the morphology was observed to evolve to granular sphere, attributed to melting of the material. Finally, an increase in absorbance with laser fluence was observed and the optical band gap of the coating was calculated.</description>

      <title>Perturbing scattering resonances in non-Hermitian systems: a generalized Wigner-Smith operator formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonances of open non-Hermitian systems are associated with the poles of the system scattering matrix. Perturbations of the system cause these poles to shift in the complex frequency plane. In this work, we introduce a novel method for calculating shifts in scattering matrix poles using generalized Wigner-Smith operators. We link our method to traditional cavity perturbation theory and validate its effectiveness through application to complex photonic networks. Our findings underscore the versatility of generalized Wigner-Smith operators for analyzing a broad spectrum of resonant systems and provides new insight into resonant properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Harnessing coupled nanolasers near exceptional points for directional emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11483v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailoring the losses of optical systems within the frame of non-Hermitian physics has appeared very fruitful in the last few years. In particular, the description of exceptional points (EPs) with coupled resonators have become widespread. The on-chip realization of these functionalities is highly significant for integrated nanophotonics, but requires fine control techniques of the nanodevice properties. Here, we demonstrate pump-controlled directional emission of two coupled nanolasers that distantly interact via an integrated waveguide. This coupling scheme unusually enables both frequency- and loss-couplings between two cavities, which can be advantageously exploited to reach EPs by either detuning the cavities or controlling the gain of nanolasers. The system can be readily reconfigured from bidirectional to unidirectional emission by adjusting the pump power.</description>

      <title>Double tips for in-plane polarized near-field microscopy and spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field optical microscopy and spectroscopy provide high-resolution imaging below the diffraction limit, crucial in physics, chemistry, and biology for studying molecules, nanoparticles, and viruses. These techniques use a sharp metallic tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) to enhance incoming and scattered light by excited near-fields at the tip apex leading to high sensitivity and a spatial resolution of a few nanometers. However, this restricts the near-field orientation to out-of-plane polarization, limiting optical polarization choices. We introduce double tips that offer in-plane polarization for enhanced imaging and spectroscopy. These double tips provide superior enhancement over single tips, although with a slightly lower spatial resolution (~30nm). They enable advanced studies of nanotubes, graphene defects, and transition metal dichalcogenides, benefiting from polarization control. The double tips allow varied polarization in tip-enhanced Raman scattering and selective excitation of transverse-electric and -magnetic polaritons, expanding the range of nanoscale samples that can be studied.</description>

      <title>Imaging transverse modes in a GHz surface acoustic wave cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full characterization of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices requires imaging the spatial distribution of the acoustic field, which is not possible with standard all-electrical measurements where an interdigital transducer (IDT) is used as a detector. Here we present a fiber-based scanning Michelson interferometer employing a strongly focused laser beam as a probe. Combined with a heterodyne circuit, this setup enables frequency- and spatially-resolved measurements of the amplitude and phase of the SAW displacement. We demonstrate this by investigating a 1 GHz SAW cavity, revealing the presence of frequency-overlapping transverse modes, which are not resolved with an all-electrical measurement. The frequency overlap of these transverse modes leads to mode superpositions, which we analyze by quadrature decomposition of the complex acoustic field.</description>

      <title>Topology of Far-field Signals for Photonic Crystal Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of band topology in photonic crystals was primarily focused on near-field effects, including edge states and high order corner states. However, this work investigated the polarization distribution of radiated fields for photonic crystal slabs to get their far-field properties of band topology. We introduced a new topological invariant: the winding number of far-field polarization around the Brillouin zone boundary and confirmed a robust correspondence between it and the Chern number of energy bands from the perspective of symmetry, which can be used to analyze the process of topological phase transition. It is found that changes in the winding number and Chern number, associated with the exchange of far-field polarization singularities, especially for bound states in the continuum(BIC), will emerge during phase transition. These findings offer new insights for further understanding the intriguing properties of topological materials.</description>

      <title>A diamond heater-thermometer microsensor for measuring localized thermal conductivity: a case study in gelatin hydrogel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the microscopic thermal effects of the hydrogel is important for its application in diverse fields, including thermal-related studies in tissue engineering and thermal management for flexible electronic devices. In recent decades, localized thermal properties, such as thermal conductivity, have often been overlooked due to technical limitations. To tackle this, we propose a new hybrid diamond microsensor that is capable of simultaneous temperature control and readout in a decoupled manner. Specifically, the sensor consists of a silicon pillar (heater) at about 10 microns in length, topped by a micron-sized diamond particle that contains silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers (thermometer) with 1.29 K*Hz^(-1/2) temperature measurement sensitivity. Combining this innovative, scalable sensor with a newly established simulation model that can transform heating-laser-induced temperature change into thermal conductivity, we introduced an all-optical decoupled method with about 0.05 W/(m* K) precision, which can reduce laser crosstalk. For the first time, we track the thermal conductivity change of hydrogels during the gelation process and demonstrate the existence of variation. We introduce a rapid, undisturbed technique for measuring microscale thermal conductivity, potentially serving as a valuable tool for cellular thermometry and highlight the idea that decoupling can reduce crosstalk from different lasers, which is helpful for quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Using slow light to enable laser frequency stabilization to a short, high-Q cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art laser frequency stabilization is limited by miniscule length changes caused by thermal noise. In this work, a cavity-length-insensitive frequency stabilization scheme is implemented using strong dispersion in a $21\,\mathrm{mm}$ long cavity with a europium-ion-doped spacer of yttrium orthosilicate. A number of limiting factors for slow light laser stabilization are evaluated, including the inhomogeneous and homogeneous linewidth of the ions, the deterioration of spectral windows, and the linewidth of the cavity modes. Using strong dispersion, the cavity modes were narrowed by a factor $1.6\cdot 10^5$, leading to a cavity linewidth of $3.0\,\mathrm{kHz}$ and a $Q$ factor of $1.7\cdot 10^{11}$. Frequency stabilization was demonstrated using a cavity mode in a spectral transparency region near the center of the inhomogeneous profile, showing an overlapping Allan deviation below $6\cdot 10^{-14}$ and a linear drift rate of $3.66\,\mathrm{Hz}/\mathrm{s}$. Considering improvements that could be implemented, this makes the europium-based slow light laser frequency reference a promising candidate for ultra-precise tabletop frequency stabilization.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear scintillation effects in the intrinsic luminescence from Sc$_{1.318}$Y$_{0.655}$Si$_{1.013}$O$_{4.987}$ crystal excited by electrons and gamma-quanta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral and kinetic properties of intrinsic luminescence from (Y$_2$Sc$_1$)$_{0.(3)}$(Sc)[Si]O$_5$ crystal are studied. The emission is excited by electrons and gamma-quanta. The composition (Y$_2$Sc$_1$)$_{0.(3)}$(Sc)[Si]O$_5$ is the congruent one for Sc$_2$SiO$_5$-Y$_2$SiO$_5$ solid solutions. It is found, that the crystal emits fairly bright intrinsic cathodololuminescence (CL) and radioluminescence (RL) at room temperature. In particular, the light yield of scintillation excited by -quanta with the energies of 661.7 keV is of 12000 photons/MeV. An increase in the beam flux by $\sim$20 times leads to the shift in the maximum CL energy spectral density from 315 to 340 nm and to the decrease in the CL decay time at 415 nm from 1377 +/- 3 ns to 1165 +/- 1 ns. Simultaneously, the decay time of RL excited by a photoelectron with the energy of 644.7 keV is of 1310 +/- 10 ns while a Compton electron with the energy of 477 keV excites RL with the decay time of 1050 +/- 10 ns. Also, we observed differences in the CL yield dependencies on the volume-averaged density of electronic excitations (EEs) at different wavelengths. An explanation of the results is given considering the nonlinear scintillation phenomena induced by an interaction between EEs. It is based on a conception that an increase in EE volume density leads to an increase in EEs nonradiative quenching due to these interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that swallowtail catastrophe consisting of various-order non-Hermitian and Hermitian degeneracies naturally exists in the dynamics of two-mode driven-dissipative quadrature squeezing systems that break pseudo-Hermiciticy by judiciously engineered losses. We reveal that the swallowtail degeneracy structure enables nontrivial braiding of complex eigenvalues by looping around an exceptional line in the parameter space. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the degeneracy geometry in two-mode driven-dissipative bosonic quadratic systems, opening new pathways toward topologically nontrivial control of Gaussian states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tilting planar samples for multi-zone-axes observation is a routine procedure in electron microscopy. However, this process invariably introduces optical path differences in the electron beam across different sample positions, significantly compromising image quality, particularly over large fields of view. To address this challenge, we developed path difference ptychography (PDP), a method capable of decoupling path differences from the four-dimensional data during reconstruction. This enables the acquisition of high-quality, large-scale images, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding and analysis of materials microstructure. Moreover, PDP has the potential to promote the widespread application of ptychographic tomography in the analysis of planar samples.</description>

      <title>How to use the dispersion in the $\chi^{(3)}$ tensor for broadband generation of polarization-entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization-entangled photon pairs are a widely used resource in quantum optics and technologies, and are often produced using a nonlinear process. Most sources based on spontaneous parametric downconversion have relatively narrow optical bandwidth because the pump, signal and idler frequencies must satisfy a phase-matching condition. Extending the bandwidth, for example to achieve spectral multiplexing, requires changing some experimental parameters such as temperature, crystal angle, poling period, etc. Here, we demonstrate broadband (tens of THz for each photon) generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs by spontaneous four-wave mixing in a diamond crystal, with a simple colinear geometry requiring no further optical engineering. Our approach leverages the quantum interference between electronic and vibrational contributions to the $\chi^{(3)}$ tensor. Entanglement is characterized in a single realization of a Bell test over the entire bandwidth using fiber dispersion spectroscopy and fast single-photon detectors. The results agree with the biphoton wavefunction predicted from the knowledge of the $\chi^{(3)}$ and Raman tensors and demonstrate the general applicability of our approach to other crystalline materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently [PRA 108, L051501 (2023)], it has been shown that in a centrosymmetric cubic system, two-photons from a broadband intense laser field can be converted into a pair of Stokes and anti-Stokes entangled photons. Here we properly explain, demonstrate, quantify (for diamond) and explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the four-wave mixing process, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring the non-Hermitian properties of semiconductor materials for optical applications is at the forefront of photonic research. However, the selection of appropriate systems to implement such photonic devices remains a topic of debate. In this work, we demonstrate that a perovskite crystal, characterized by its easy and low-cost manufacturing, when placed between two distributed Bragg reflectors with an air gap, can form a natural double microcavity. This construction shows promising properties for the realisation of novel, tunable non-Hermitian photonic devices through strong light-matter coupling. We reveal that such a system exhibits double-coupled polariton modes with dispersion including multiple inflection points. Owing to its non-Hermiticity, our system exhibits nonreciprocal properties and allows for the observation of exceptional points. Our experimental studies are in agreement with the theoretical analysis based on coupled mode theory and calculations based on transfer matrix method.</description>

      <title>Topological-Vacuum-Induced Strong Photon-Exciton Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic vacuum construction based on micro-nano photonic structures is able to engineer the photon-exciton interaction at the single quantum level. Here, through engineering the electromagnetic vacuum background formed by edge states, we demonstrate a strong photon-exciton coupling in topological photonic crystal containing a dielectric nanoantenna. By guiding the scattering photons into the edge states, the linewidth of nanoantenna with more than hundred nanometers in air can be reduced into only several nanometers due to topological robustness, so that both strong coupling condition and high photon collection efficiency can be achieved. Electromagnetic vacuum background under topological protection holds great promise for controlling the light-matter interaction in quantum optics and on-chip quantum information.</description>

      <title>Cascade enhancement and efficient collection of single photon emission under topological protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High emission rate, high collection efficiency, and immunity to the defects are the requirements of implementing on-chip single photon sources. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that both cascade enhancement and high collection efficiency of emitted photons from single emitter can be achieved simultaneously in topological photonic crystal containing a resonant dielectric nanodisk. The nanodisk excited by a magnetic emitter can be regarded as a large equivalent magnetic dipole. The near-field overlapping between this equivalent magnetic dipole and edge state enables to achieve a cascade enhancement of single photon emission with Purcell factor exceeding 4*10^3. These emitted photons are guided into edge states with collection efficiency of more than 90%, which is also corresponding to quantum yield due to topological anti-scattering and the absence of absorption. The proposed mechanism under topological protection has potential applications in on-chip light-matter interaction, quantum light sources, and nanolasers.</description>

      <title>Recognizing Beam Profiles from Silicon Photonics Gratings using Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decade, there has been extensive work in developing integrated silicon photonics (SiPh) gratings for the optical addressing of trapped ion qubits in the ion trap quantum computing community. However, when viewing beam profiles from infrared (IR) cameras, it is often difficult to determine the corresponding heights where the beam profiles are located. In this work, we developed transformer models to recognize the corresponding height categories of beam profiles of light from SiPh gratings. The model is trained using two techniques: (1) input patches, and (2) input sequence. For model trained with input patches, the model achieved recognition accuracy of 0.938. Meanwhile, model trained with input sequence shows lower accuracy of 0.895. However, when repeating the model-training 150 cycles, model trained with input patches shows inconsistent accuracy ranges between 0.445 to 0.959, while model trained with input sequence exhibit higher accuracy values between 0.789 to 0.936. The obtained outcomes can be expanded to various applications, including auto-focusing of light beam and auto-adjustment of z-axis stage to acquire desired beam profiles.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-agnostic Metasurface Design for Next Generation 2D Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a versatile technique for inverse designing 2D photonic crystal metasurfaces. These surfaces, known for their ability to manipulate light-matter interactions, can be precisely controlled to achieve specific functionalities. The key lies in efficiently optimizing the geometric patterns and dimensions of the metasurface. Through a composite method which exploits two well-established paradigms - Covariance Matrix Adaptation optimization and Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA), we demonstrate our ability to design and optimize resonances in metaelements to achieve desired optical performance such as near-perfect absorption at chosen wavelengths/optical modes, which otherwise proves to be challenging or even impossible with conventional inverse design implementations. We apply our method to design three-layered structures involving a monolayer absorber, transparent metasubstrate, and a back mirror to get near 100% absorption at one or two chosen wavelengths. For illustration, we choose black phosphorus and silicon metasurface to predict ~100% absorption in a monolayer at 1550 nm. The versatile technique can be applied to tailor reflectance and transmittance for any optical mode and wavelength. This computationally efficient design method paves the way for creating high-performance 2D metasurface-based devices with a variety of applications, including quantum technology components such as single photon sensors and biphoton sources, communication systems, and non-linear light conversion.</description>

Abstract: Classical mechanics and geometrical optics are deeply connected with each other. In this work, we generalize the analogy between these two disciplines to relativistic conditions. Using this analogy, we are able to make light follow the orbits of massive or massless particles in gravitational field, by designing a particular optical medium with a prescribed refractive index profile according to spacetime geometry. Furthermore, we build the dictionary that connects optical refractive index and spacetime metric, thus extending F = ma optics to the relativistic limit. The results shed light on the equivalence between the dielectric properties of optical media and the geometric structure of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Regarding the extension of metaplectic geometrical optics to modelling evanescent waves in ray-tracing codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metaplectic geometrical optics (MGO) is a recently developed ray-tracing framework to accurately compute the wavefield behavior near a caustic (turning point or focal point), where traditional ray-tracing breaks down. However, MGO has thus far been restricted to having real-valued wavevectors. This is disadvantageous because often upon crossing a caustic from the `illuminated' region to the `shadow' region, two real-valued rays coalesce into one complex-valued ray corresponding to the transition from propagating to evanescent behavior. One can distinguish caustics as having either `illuminated shadows' or `proper shadows' -- the former corresponds to when the shadow still contains real-valued rays (albeit in a fewer quantity than in the illuminated region), while the latter corresponds to when the shadow contains no real-valued rays. Here, by means of examples, we show how MGO can be used to model both types of shadows. First, for illuminated shadows we show that MGO can actually be used `as is', provided a corrected quadrature-angle bias is used compared to that proposed in the original references. This is then implemented and demonstrated in a recently developed MGO ray-tracing code. Second, we show that for proper shadows, the MGO formalism can still be used if the symplectic rotation matrix that removes caustics along rays is allowed to be complex-valued. In both cases, strong agreement is seen between the MGO and the exact solution, demonstrating the potential of MGO for improving the predictive capability of ray-tracing codes and laying the foundations for modeling more complicated evanescent phenomena such as tunnelling with MGO.</description>

      <title>Realization of a magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color dipole trap with sub-$\lambda/2$ spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the realization and characterization of a novel magic-wavelength nanofiber-based two-color optical dipole trap that allows us to generate a periodic one-dimensional array of trapping sites with a spacing significantly smaller than half of the resonant wavelength of the cesium D2-line. To this end, we launch a blue-detuned partial standing wave and two red-detuned light fields through the nanofiber. We demonstrate the trapping of atoms in the array and characterize the resulting trap configuration by measuring the trap frequencies in three directions and observe good agreement with theoretical predictions. The implementation of this nanofiber-based optical interface with magic trapping wavelengths and sub-$\lambda/2$ spacing is an important step towards the exploration of novel collective radiative effects such as selective radiance in 1D atomic arrays.</description>
