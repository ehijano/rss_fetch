      <title>Robust optimization and uncertainty quantification in the nonlinear mechanics of an elevator brake system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with nonlinear mechanics of an elevator brake system subjected to uncertainties. A deterministic model that relates the braking force with uncertain parameters is deduced from mechanical equilibrium conditions. In order to take into account parameters variabilities, a parametric probabilistic approach is employed. In this stochastic formalism, the uncertain parameters are modeled as random variables, with distributions specified by the maximum entropy principle. The uncertainties are propagated by the Monte Carlo method, which provides a detailed statistical characterization of the response. This work still considers the optimum design of the brake system, formulating and solving nonlinear optimization problems, with and without the uncertainties effects.</description>

      <title>KALE-LM: Unleash The Power Of AI For Science Via Knowledge And Logic Enhanced Large Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is gradually demonstrating its immense potential, and increasing attention is being given to how AI can be harnessed to advance scientific research. In this vision paper, we present our perspectives on how AI can better assist scientific inquiry and explore corresponding technical approach. We have proposed and open-sourced a large model of our KALE-LM model series, Llama3-KALE-LM-Chem-8B, which has achieved outstanding performance in tasks related to the field of chemistry. We hope that our work serves as a strong starting point, helping to realize more intelligent AI and promoting the advancement of human science and technology, as well as societal development.</description>

      <title>"Global is Good, Local is Bad?": Understanding Brand Bias in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many recent studies have investigated social biases in LLMs but brand bias has received little attention. This research examines the biases exhibited by LLMs towards different brands, a significant concern given the widespread use of LLMs in affected use cases such as product recommendation and market analysis. Biased models may perpetuate societal inequalities, unfairly favoring established global brands while marginalizing local ones. Using a curated dataset across four brand categories, we probe the behavior of LLMs in this space. We find a consistent pattern of bias in this space -- both in terms of disproportionately associating global brands with positive attributes and disproportionately recommending luxury gifts for individuals in high-income countries. We also find LLMs are subject to country-of-origin effects which may boost local brand preference in LLM outputs in specific contexts.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for parameter learning of wildfire spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wildland fires pose a terrifying natural hazard, underscoring the urgent need to develop data-driven and physics-informed digital twins for wildfire prevention, monitoring, intervention, and response. In this direction of research, this work introduces a physics-informed neural network (PiNN) designed to learn the unknown parameters of an interpretable wildfire spreading model. The considered modeling approach integrates fundamental physical laws articulated by key model parameters essential for capturing the complex behavior of wildfires. The proposed machine learning framework leverages the theory of artificial neural networks with the physical constraints governing wildfire dynamics, including the first principles of mass and energy conservation. Training of the PiNN for physics-informed parameter identification is realized using synthetic data on the spatiotemporal evolution of one- and two-dimensional firefronts, derived from a high-fidelity simulator, as well as empirical data (ground surface thermal images) from the Troy Fire that occurred on June 19, 2002, in California. The parameter learning results demonstrate the predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in uncovering the unknown coefficients of the wildfire model in one- and two-dimensional fire spreading scenarios as well as the Troy Fire. Additionally, this methodology exhibits robustness by identifying the same parameters even in the presence of noisy data. By integrating this PiNN approach into a comprehensive framework, the envisioned physics-informed digital twin will enhance intelligent wildfire management and risk assessment, providing a powerful tool for proactive and reactive strategies.</description>
