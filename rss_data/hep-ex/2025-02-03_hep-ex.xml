      <title>A compact frozen-spin trap for the search for the electric dipole moment of the muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric dipole moments~(EDM) of fundamental particles inherently violate parity~(P) and time-reversal~(T) symmetries. By virtue of the CPT theorem in quantum field theory, the latter also implies the violation of the combined charge-conjugation and parity~(CP) symmetry. We aim to measure the EDM of the muon using the frozen-spin technique within a compact storage trap. This method exploits the high effective electric field, \$E \approx 165\$ MV/m, experienced in the rest frame of the muon with a momentum of about 23 MeV/c when it passes through a solenoidal magnetic field of \$|\vec{B}|=2.5\$ T. In this paper, we outline the fundamental considerations for a muon EDM search and present a conceptual design for a demonstration experiment to be conducted at secondary muon beamlines of the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. In Phase~I, with an anticipated data acquisition period of 200 days, the expected sensitivity to a muon EDM is 4E-21 ecm. In a subsequent phase, Phase~II, we propose to improve the sensitivity to 6E-23 ecm using a dedicated instrument installed on a different beamline that produces muons of momentum 125 MeV/c}.</description>

      <title>DINAMO: Dynamic and INterpretable Anomaly MOnitoring for Large-Scale Particle Physics Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring reliable data collection in large-scale particle physics experiments demands Data Quality Monitoring (DQM) procedures to detect possible detector malfunctions and preserve data integrity. Traditionally, this resource-intensive task has been handled by human shifters that struggle with frequent changes in operational conditions. We present novel, interpretable, robust, and scalable DQM algorithms designed to automate anomaly detection in time-dependent settings. Our approach constructs evolving histogram templates with built-in uncertainties, featuring both a statistical variant - extending the classical Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) - and a machine learning (ML)-enhanced version that leverages a transformer encoder for improved adaptability. Experimental validations on synthetic datasets demonstrate the high accuracy, adaptability, and interpretability of these methods, with the statistical variant being commissioned in the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, underscoring its real-world impact. The code used in this study is available at https://github.com/ArseniiGav/DINAMO.</description>

      <title>Ion Transport on Phased Radiofrequency Carpets in Xenon Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and performance of a four-phased radiofrequency (RF) carpet system for ion transport in high-pressure xenon gas. The RF carpet, designed with a 160 $\mu$m pitch, is applied to the lateral collection of ions in xenon at pressures up to 600 mbar. We demonstrate transport efficiency of caesium ions across varying pressures, and compare with microscopic simulations made in the SIMION package. The novel use of an N-phased RF carpet at high pressure can achieve ion levitation and controlled lateral motion in a denser environment than is typical for RF ion transport in gases. This feature makes such carpets strong candidates for ion transport to single ion sensors envisaged for future neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments in xenon gas.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Two-Body $B\to P (K^+K^-, \pi^+\pi^-)$ Decays with $f_0(980)$ Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the $CP$-averaged branching fractions and direct $CP$ asymmetries in the quasi-two-body decays $B\to P (f_0(980) \to )(K^+K^-, \pi^+\pi^-)$ within the framework of perturbative QCD approach, where $P$ denotes light pseudoscalar mesons ($\pi$,$K$). The timelike form factor $F_{S}(\omega)$, characterizing final-state interactions between collinear particles in the resonant region, is modeled through the revised relativistic Breit-Wigner formalism for the $S$-wave $f_0(980)$ resonance. Within the Gegenbauer moments of the $S$-wave two-meson distribution amplitudes constrained by current data, we predict the branching fractions of $B\to P (f_0(980) \to )(K^+K^-, \pi^+\pi^-)$ to lie in the range of $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$. Our calculations reveal that our theoretical results for some decay modes exhibit satisfactory agreement with existing measurements from the BaBar and Belle collaborations. Furthermore, we extract the corresponding branching fractions of $B \to P f_0(980)$ decays from the quasi-two-body counterparts $B\to P (f_0(980) \to )\pi^+\pi^-$ rather than $B\to P (f_0(980) \to )K^+K^-$. All predictions are awaiting experimental verification in current and upcoming collider experiments.</description>

      <title>New compact ion source design and implementation for low current applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new compact electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source for low current applications, designed and built in-house at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) is presented. The source was designed to use as many commercially available components as possible for key tasks such as electromagnetic resonators, magnetic structure, RF power couplers and beam transport, to lower the cost and lessen reliance on specially made parts for spares. This leads to a cost-effective yet compact and fully functional design. The main design decisions are described and experiments on plasma generation and the proton beam extracted using the source are shown and discussed.</description>

      <title>Measurement of multidifferential cross sections for dijet production in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A measurement of the dijet production cross section is reported based on proton-proton collision data collected in 2016 at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of up to 36.3 fb$^{-1}$. Jets are reconstructed with the anti-$k_\mathrm{T}$ algorithm for distance parameters of $R$ = 0.4 and 0.8. Cross sections are measured double-differentially (2D) as a function of the largest absolute rapidity $\lvert y_\text{max}\rvert$ of the two jets with the highest transverse momenta $p_\mathrm{T}$ and their invariant mass $m_{1,2}$, and triple-differentially (3D) as a function of the rapidity separation $y^*$, the total boost $y_\mathrm{b}$, and either $m_{1,2}$ or the average $p_\mathrm{T}$ of the two jets. The cross sections are unfolded to correct for detector effects and are compared with fixed-order calculations derived at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. The impact of the measurements on the parton distribution functions and the strong coupling constant at the mass of the Z boson is investigated, yielding a value of $\alpha_\mathrm{S}(m_\mathrm{Z})$ = 0.1179 $\pm$ 0.0019.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the inclusive isolated-photon production cross section in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production cross section of inclusive isolated photons has been measured by the ALICE experiment at the CERN LHC in pp collisions at centre-of-momentum energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV collected during the LHC Run 2 data-taking period. The measurement is performed by combining the measurements of the electromagnetic calorimeter EMCal and the central tracking detectors ITS and TPC, covering a pseudorapidity range of $|\eta^{\gamma}|&lt;0.67$ and a transverse momentum range of $7&lt;p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}&lt;200$ GeV/$c$. The result extends to lower $p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}$ and $x_{\rm T}^{\gamma} = 2p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}/\sqrt{s}$ ranges, the lowest $x_{\rm T}^{\gamma}$ of any isolated photon measurements to date, extending significantly those measured by the ATLAS and CMS experiments towards lower $p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}$ at the same collision energy with a small overlap between the measurements. The measurement is compared with next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculations and the results from the ATLAS and CMS experiments as well as with measurements at other collision energies. The measurement and theory prediction are in agreement with each other within the experimental and theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Particle production as a function of charged-particle flattenicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports the first measurement of the transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) spectra of primary charged pions, kaons, (anti)protons, and unidentified particles as a function of the charged-particle flattenicity in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Flattenicity is a novel event shape observable that is measured in the pseudorapidity intervals covered by the V0 detector, $2.8&lt;\eta&lt;5.1$ and $-3.7&lt;\eta&lt;-1.7$. According to QCD-inspired phenomenological models, it shows sensitivity to multiparton interactions and is less affected by biases toward larger $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ due to local multiplicity fluctuations in the V0 acceptance than multiplicity. The analysis is performed in minimum-bias (MB) as well as in high-multiplicity events up to $p_{\mathrm{T}}=20$ GeV/$c$. The event selection requires at least one charged particle produced in the pseudorapidity interval $|\eta|&lt;1$. The measured $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ distributions, average $p_{\mathrm{T}}$, kaon-to-pion and proton-to-pion particle ratios, presented in this paper, are compared to model calculations using PYTHIA 8 based on color strings and EPOS LHC. The modification of the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-spectral shapes in low-flattenicity events that have large event activity with respect to those measured in MB events develops a pronounced peak at intermediate $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ ($2&lt;p_{\mathrm{T}}&lt;8$ GeV/$c$), and approaches the vicinity of unity at higher $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. The results are qualitatively described by PYTHIA, and they show different behavior than those measured as a function of charged-particle multiplicity based on the V0M estimator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-luminosity Super $\tau$-Charm Factory (STCF) will be a crucial facility for charm-physics research, particularly for the precise measurement of electroweak parameters, measuring $D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixing parameters, investigating Charge-Parity (CP) violation within the charm sector, searching for the rare and forbidden decays of charmed hadrons, and addressing other foundational questions related to charmed hadrons. With the world's largest charm-threshold data, the STCF aims to achieve high sensitivity in studying the strong phase of neutral $D$ mesons using quantum correlation, complementing studies at LHCb and Belle II, and contributing to the understanding of CP violations globally. The STCF will also enable world-leading precision in measuring the leptonic decays of charmed mesons and baryons, providing constraints on the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix and strong-force dynamics. Additionally, the STCF will explore charmed hadron spectroscopy. The advanced detector and clean experimental environment of the STCF will enable unprecedented precision, help address key challenges in the Standard Model, and facilitate the search for potential new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JSNS$^2$ (J-PARC Sterile Neutrino Search at J-PARC Spallation Neutron Source) is an experiment that is searching for sterile neutrinos via the observation of $\bar{\nu}_{\mu} \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_e$ appearance oscillations using neutrinos with muon decay-at-rest. For this search, rejecting cosmic-ray-induced neutron events by Pulse Shape Discrimination (PSD) is essential because the JSNS$^2$ detector is located above ground, on the third floor of the building. We have achieved 95$\%$ rejection of neutron events while keeping 90$\%$ of signal, electron-like events using a data driven likelihood method.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the production cross section of prompt $\Xi^0_{\rm c}$ baryons in p$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~5.02$ TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) differential production cross section of the promptly produced charm-strange baryon $\Xi_{\rm c}^{0}$ (and its charge conjugate $\overline{\Xi_{\rm c}^{0}}$) is measured at midrapidity via its hadronic decay into ${\rm \pi^{+}}\Xi^{-}$ in p$-$Pb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon$-$nucleon collision $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC. The $\Xi_{\rm c}^{0}$ nuclear modification factor ($R_{\rm pPb}$), calculated from the cross sections in pp and p$-$Pb collisions, is presented and compared with the $R_{\rm pPb}$ of $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ baryons. The ratios between the $p_{\rm T}$-differential production cross section of $\Xi_{\rm c}^{0}$ baryons and those of $\mathrm {D^0}$ mesons and $\Lambda_{\rm c}^{+}$ baryons are also reported and compared with results at forward and backward rapidity from the LHCb Collaboration. The measurements of the production cross section of prompt $\Xi^0_{\rm c}$ baryons are compared with a model based on perturbative QCD calculations of charm-quark production cross sections, which includes only cold nuclear matter effects in p$-$Pb collisions, and underestimates the measurement by a factor of about 50. This discrepancy is reduced when the data is compared with a model that includes string formation beyond leading-colour approximation or in which hadronisation is implemented via quark coalescence. The $p_{\rm T}$-integrated cross section of prompt $\Xi^0_{\rm c}$-baryon production at midrapidity extrapolated down to $p_{\rm T}$ = 0 is also reported. These measurements offer insights and constraints for theoretical calculations of the hadronisation process. Additionally, they provide inputs for the calculation of the charm production cross section in p$-$Pb collisions at midrapidity.</description>

      <title>Probing strangeness hadronization with event-by-event production of multistrange hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Letter presents the first measurement of event-by-event fluctuations of the net number (difference between the particle and antiparticle multiplicities) of multistrange hadrons $\Xi^-$ and $\overline{\Xi}^+$ and its correlation with the net-kaon number using the data collected by the ALICE Collaboration in pp, p$-$Pb, and Pb$-$Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02\ \mathrm{TeV}$. The statistical hadronization model with a correlation over three units of rapidity between hadrons having the same and opposite strangeness content successfully describes the results. On the other hand, string-fragmentation models that mainly correlate strange hadrons with opposite strange quark content over a small rapidity range fail to describe the data.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the impact of electroweak corrections and effective field theory operators on $W^+W^-$ production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Utilizing the Standard Model effective-field theory (SMEFT) framework, we extend the Standard Model by incorporating higher-dimensional operators to encapsulate potential new physics effects. These operators allow for a model-independent approach to data interpretation, essential for probing beyond the Standard Model physics. We generate pseudodata at the next-to-leading order in quantum chromodynamics and include approximate electroweak corrections. Our analysis focuses on the interplay between these corrections and SMEFT operators at leading order. The inclusion of electroweak corrections is crucial as they can counteract the effects predicted by SMEFT operators, necessitating precise theoretical and experimental handling. By examining $pp\to W^+ W^-$ production, a process sensitive to the electroweak symmetry-breaking mechanism, we demonstrate the importance of these corrections in isolating and interpreting new physics signatures. Our results highlight the significant role of electroweak corrections in enhancing the interpretative power of LHC data and in obtaining reliable constraints on new physics interactions.</description>
