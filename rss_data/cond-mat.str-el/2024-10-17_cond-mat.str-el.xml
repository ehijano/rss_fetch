      <title>Quantum metric driven transition between superfluid and incoherent fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between repulsive interaction and superfluidity in flat band system. We consider spatially indirect excitons in the Lieb lattice bilayer as an example. We show that due to the presence of repulsive interaction, the excitons may form an incoherent fluid. By increasing the quantum metric, the exciton fluid experiences a transition into the superfluid phase. Such transition may be captured by a model of Josephson junction array, which is beyond mean field description.</description>

      <title>Satisfaction and violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation in spin ice materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) in spin ice materials Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ by measuring both the magnetic noise and the out-of-phase part of the susceptibility and comparing their ratio. We show that it is satisfied at temperatures well into the non-ergodic region below 600 mK, indicating local equilibrium. In both materials, below 400 mK, low frequency violations develop, showing an excess of noise as in spin glasses, with a frequency threshold of 0.1 Hz. New relaxation pathways and aging properties are unveiled in this frequency range in the ac susceptibility. The FDR remains valid at higher frequencies down to 150 mK.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Instabilities from Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a newly identified type of collinear anti-ferromagnetism with vanishing net magnetic moment, characterized by lifted Kramers' degeneracy in parts of the Brillouin zone. Their time-reversal symmetry broken band structure has been observed experimentally and is theoretically well-understood. On the contrary, altermagnetic fluctuations and the formation of the corresponding instabilities remains largely unexplored. We establish a correspondence between the quantum metric of normal and the altermagnetic spin-splitting of ordered phases. We analytically derive a criterion for the formation of instabilities and show that the quantum metric favors altermagnetism. We recover the expression for conventional q=0 instabilities where the spin-splitting terms of the normal state model are locally absent. As an example, we construct an effective model of MnTe and illustrate the relationship between quantum geometry and altermagnetic fluctuations by explicitly computing the quantum metric and the generalized magnetic susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Operator algebra and algorithmic construction of boundaries and defects in (2+1)D topological Pauli stabilizer codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computational algorithm for constructing all boundaries and defects of topological generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two spatial dimensions. Utilizing the operator algebra formalism, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the topological data-such as anyon types, fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics-of (2+1)D bulk stabilizer codes and (1+1)D boundary anomalous subsystem codes. To make the operator algebra computationally accessible, we adapt Laurent polynomials and convert the tasks into matrix operations, e.g., the Hermite normal form for obtaining boundary anyons and the Smith normal form for determining fusion rules. This approach enables computers to automatically generate all possible gapped boundaries and defects for topological Pauli stabilizer codes through boundary anyon condensation and topological order completion. This streamlines the analysis of surface codes and associated logical operations for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our algorithm applies to $Z_d$ qudits, including both prime and nonprime $d$, thus enabling the exploration of topological quantum codes beyond toric codes. We have applied the algorithm and explicitly demonstrated the lattice constructions of 2 boundaries and 6 defects in the $Z_2$ toric code, 3 boundaries and 22 defects in the $Z_4$ toric code, 1 boundary and 2 defects in the double semion code, 1 boundary and 22 defects in the six-semion code, 6 boundaries and 270 defects in the color code, and 6 defects in the anomalous three-fermion code. In addition, we investigate the boundaries of two specific bivariate bicycle codes within a family of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. We demonstrate that their topological orders are equivalent to 8 and 10 copies of $Z_2$ toric codes, with anyons restricted to move by 12 and 1023 lattice sites in the square lattice, respectively.</description>

      <title>Photoemission Insights to Electronic Orders in Kagome Superconductor AV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs) have attracted considerable attention due to their intriguing combination of unique electron correlations and nontrivial band topology. The interplay of these fundamental aspects gives rise to a diverse array of exotic electronic phenomena, including superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW) states. In this review, we present recent advancements in the study of the electronic band structure of AV3Sb5 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), including the identification of the multiple van Hove singularities near the Fermi level and their close relationship with the CDW transition, spectroscopic features related to CDW-induced symmetry breakings, as well as direct observations of nodeless superconducting gaps and moderate electron-phonon couplings through ultrahigh-resolution ARPES, providing critical insights into the origins of CDW order and electron pairing symmetry. By synthesizing these key ARPES findings, this review aims to deepen our understanding of kagome-related physics.</description>

      <title>Electronic glasses from a broken gauge symmetry in disorder-free systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glass phases can be stabilized by quenched disorders, as in most spin-glass materials, or self-generated through kinetic freezing in disorder-free systems. A canonical example of the latter is structural glasses, which have been extensively studied for many decades. Yet, how the rugged energy landscape of a glass phase is spontaneously generated in disorder-free systems remains one of the key questions in glass physics. Here we present a general electronic mechanism for the emergence of glassy phase using the example of itinerant electrons coupled to XY spins on a lattice. This model can also be be viewed as the mean-field theory of a superconducting system with attractive density-density interactions. Intriguingly, the electron gauge symmetry in the strong pairing limit gives rise to a macroscopic degeneracy of XY spins. In the presence of electron hopping that breaks the gauge symmetry, the lifting of the extensive degeneracy leads to a glass phase with disordered pairings. Our findings highlight a novel scenario in which a glassy state originates from the breaking of quantum gauge symmetry without quenched disorders.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Transition as a Promising Route to Enhance the Critical Current in Kagome Superconductor CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing strategies to systematically increase the critical current, the threshold current below which the superconductivity exists, is an important goal of materials science. Here, the concept of quantum phase transition is employed to enhance the critical current of a kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, which exhibits a charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity that are both affected by hydrostatic pressure. As the CDW phase is rapidly suppressed under pressure, a large enhancement in the self-field critical current ($I_{\rm c,sf}$) is recorded. The observation of a peak-like enhancement of $I_{\rm c,sf}$ at the zero-temperature limit ($I_{\rm c,sf}(0)$) centred at $p^*\approx 20$~kbar, the same pressure where the CDW phase transition vanishes, further provides strong evidence of a zero-temperature quantum anomaly in this class of pressure-tuned superconductor. Such a peak in $I_{\rm c,sf}(0)$ resembles the findings in other well-established quantum-critical superconductors, hinting at the presence of enhanced quantum fluctuations associated with the CDW phase in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Regularities and features in the behavior of electrical and magnetic properties of Co$_2$FeZ (Z = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, Sn, Sb) half-metallic ferromagnetic Heusler alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrical resistivity, magnetization, and Hall effect in Co$_2$FeZ (Z = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, Sn, Sb) ferromagnetic Heusler alloys are studied. A number of correlations between the electronic and magnetic characteristics of the studied alloys are revealed while the atomic number of the Z-component changes. For the Co$_2$FeAl and Co$_2$FeSi half-metallic ferromagnets, the magnitude of magnetization is consistent with the Slater-Pauling rule. For the Co$_2$FeAl, Co$_2$FeSi, and Co$_2$FeGe compounds, a quadratic temperature dependence of electrical resistivity at temperatures below 30 K and above 65 K is found. At the same time, in the region of intermediate temperatures (from 40 K to 65 K), a power-law dependence of $T^b$ with an exponent of 3.5 &lt; b &lt; 4 is observed, which may be due to two-magnon scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Embedding of Non-local Quantum Many-body Interactions in Prototypal Anti-tumor Vaccine Metalloprotein on Near Term Quantum Computing Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real world obeys quantum physics and quantum computing presents an alternative way to map physical problems to systems that follow the same laws. Such computation fundamentally constitutes a better way to understand the most challenging quantum problems. One such problem is the accurate simulation of highly correlated quantum systems. Due to the high dimensionality of the problem classical computers require considerable computer power to accurately predict material properties, especially when strong electron interactions are present. Still, modern day quantum hardware has many limitations and only allows for modeling of very simple systems. Here we present for the first time a quantum computer model simulation of a complex hemocyanin molecule, which is an important respiratory protein involved in various physiological processes such as oxygen transport and immune defence, and is also used as a key component in therapeutic vaccines for cancer. To better characterise the mechanism by which hemocyanin transports oxygen, variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on fermionic excitations and quantum embedding methods is used in the context of dynamic mean field theory to solve Anderson impurity model (AIM). Finally, it is concluded that the magnetic structure of hemocyanin is largely influenced by the many-body correction and that the computational effort for solving correlated electron systems could be substantially reduced with the introduction of quantum computing algorithms. We encourage the use of the Hamiltonian systems presented in this paper as a benchmark for testing quantum computing algorithms efficiency for chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Fractional matter coupled to the emergent gauge field in a quantum spin ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05452v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic spins can form long-range entangled phases of condensed matter named quantum spin liquids. Their existence is conceptualized in models of two- or three-dimensional frustrated magnets that evade symmetry-breaking order down to zero temperature. Quantum spin ice (QSI) is a theoretically well-established example described by an emergent quantum electrodynamics, with excitations behaving like photon and matter quasiparticles. The latter are fractionally charged and equivalent to the `spinons' emerging from coherent phases of singlets in one dimension, where clear experimental proofs of fractionalization exist. However, in frustrated magnets it remains difficult to establish consensual evidence for quantum spin liquid ground states and their fractional excitations. Here, we use backscattering neutron spectroscopy to achieve extremely high resolution of the time-dependent magnetic response of the candidate QSI material Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. We find a gapped spectrum featuring a threshold and peaks that match theories for pair production and propagation of fractional matter excitations (spinons) strongly coupled to a background gauge field. The multiple peaks are a specific signature of the $\pi$-flux phase of QSI, providing spectroscopic evidence for fractionalization in a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <title>The PointGroupNRG code for numerical renormalization group calculations with discrete point-group symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical renormalization group (NRG) has been widely used as a magnetic impurity solver since the pioneering works by Wilson. Over the past decades, a significant attention has been focused on the application of symmetries in order to reduce the computational cost of the calculations and to improve their accuracy. In particular, a notable progress has been made in implementing continuous symmetries such as $SO(3)$, useful for studying impurities in an isotropic medium, or $SU(N)$, which is applicable to a wide range of systems. In this work, we focus on the application of discrete point group symmetries, which are particularly relevant for impurity systems in metals where crystal field effects are important. With this aim, we have developed an original NRG code written in the Julia language, PointGroupNRG, where we have implemented crystal point-group symmetries for the Anderson impurity model, as well as the continuous spin and charge symmetries. Among other results, we demonstrate the advantage of our procedure by applying the code to a two-impurity model with RKKY interaction and an impurity system with two orbitals of $E_g$ symmetry and two channels. We also provide benchmarks to show the performance improvements obtained by exploiting the orbital symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental studies of local magnetic moments interacting with a metallic quasicrystal, we study the low-temperature fate of spins placed in two-dimensional tilings. In the diluted local moment limit, we calculate the spin relaxation rate $1/T_{1}$, as measured by electron spin resonance, and show that it displays a marked dependence on the system size $N$ and the filing $n$ of the electronic bath. For a finite concentration of spins, we integrate out the conduction electrons and generate an effective magnetic coupling between the local moments, which we treat as Ising spins. Despite the strongly frustrating nature of the magnetic couplings and the lack of periodicity in the problem, we find long-range orders for finite $N$ in our large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. However, the resulting magnetically state is fragile, as clusters of essentially free spins fluctuate down to very low temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin pumping into a quantum easy-plane ferromagnetic spin chain system. This quantum spin chain is effectively described by the Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid despite the ferromagnetic exchange interaction because of the easy-plane magnetic anisotropy. This TL liquid state has an extremely strong interaction that is hardly realized in other quantum antiferromagnetic chain systems or weakly interacting electron systems. We show how the strongly interacting TL liquid affects the ferromagnetic resonance that occurs in the ferromagnetic insulator. In particular, we discuss the dependence of the Gilbert damping on the temperature and the junction length. The Gilbert damping allows us to extract information about the above-mentioned strong interaction within the quantum ferromagnetic spin chain. We also point out that a well-known compound CsCuCl$_3$ will be suitable for the realization of our setup.</description>

      <title>Theoretical model for multi-orbital Kondo screening in strongly correlated molecules with several unpaired electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanism of Kondo screening in strongly correlated molecules with several unpaired electrons on a metal surface is still under debate. Here, we provide a theoretical framework that rationalizes the emergence of Kondo screening involving several extended molecular orbitals with unpaired electrons. We introduce a perturbative model, which provides simple rules to identify the presence of antiferromagnetic spin-flip channels involving charged molecular multiplets responsible for Kondo screening. The Kondo regime is confirmed by numerical renormalization group calculations. In addition, we introduce the concept of Kondo orbitals as molecular orbitals associated with the Kondo screening process, which provide a direct interpretation of experimental $dI/dV$ maps of Kondo resonances. We demonstrate that this theoretical framework can be applied to different strongly correlated open-shell molecules on metal surfaces, obtaining good agreement with previously published experimental data.</description>

      <title>Topological bound on structure factor</title>

Abstract: We show that the static structure factor of general many-body systems with $U(1)$ symmetry has a lower bound determined only by the ground state Chern number. Our bound relies only on causality and non-negative energy dissipation, and holds for a wide range of systems. We apply our theory to (fractional) Chern insulators, (fractional) quantum spin Hall insulators, topological superconductors, and chiral spin liquids. Our results uncover a universal feature of topological phases beyond the quantized response.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise on quantum circuit realization of non-Hermitian time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum dynamics lie in an intermediate regime between unitary Hamiltonian dynamics and trace-preserving non-unitary open quantum system dynamics. Given differences in the noise tolerance of unitary and non-unitary dynamics, it is interesting to consider implementing non-Hermitian dynamics on a noisy quantum computer. In this paper, we do so for a non-Hermitian Ising Floquet model whose many-body dynamics gives rise to persistent temporal oscillations, a form of time crystallinity. In the simplest two qubit case that we consider, there is an infinitely long-lived periodic steady state at certain fine-tuned points. These oscillations remain reasonably long-lived over a range of parameters in the ideal non-Hermitean dynamics and for the levels of noise and imperfection expected of modern day quantum devices. Using a generalized Floquet analysis, we show that infinitely long-lived oscillations are generically lost for arbitrarily weak values of common types of noise and compute corresponding damping rate. We perform simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform to confirm our findings; however, experiments on a real device (ibmq-lima) do not show remnants of these oscillations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in BF theory I: Essential topological entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06158v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of Abelian topological order described by $p$-form BF theory in arbitrary dimensions. We do so directly in the low-energy topological quantum field theory by considering the algebra of topological surface operators. We define two appropriate notions of subregion operator algebras which are related by a form of electric-magnetic duality. To each subregion algebra we assign an entanglement entropy which we coin essential topological entanglement. This is a refinement to the traditional topological entanglement entropy. It is intrinsic to the theory, inherently finite, positive, and sensitive to more intricate topological features of the state and the entangling region. This paper is the first in a series of papers investigating entanglement and topological order in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Exact Dynamics and Shortcuts to Adiabaticity in the Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling many-body quantum systems is a highly challenging task required to advance quantum technologies. Here, we report progress in controlling gapless many-body quantum systems described by the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL). To do so, we investigate the exact dynamics of the TLL induced by an interaction quench, making use of the $SU(1,1)$ dynamical symmetry group and the Schr\"odinger picture. First, we demonstrate that this approach is useful to perform a shortcut to adiabaticity, that cancels the final non-adiabatic residual energy of the driven TLL and is experimentally implementable in the semiclassical limit of the sine-Gordon model. Second, we apply this framework to analyze various driving schemes in finite time, including linear ramps and smooth protocols.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping frustrated magnets: the fate of the chiral ${\rm O}(N)\times {\rm O}(2)$ universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d &lt; 4$. Our results show that $N_c&gt; 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.</description>

      <title>Non-Universality from Conserved Superoperators in Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important result in the theory of quantum control is the "universality" of $2$-local unitary gates, i.e. the fact that any global unitary evolution of a system of $L$ qudits can be implemented by composition of $2$-local unitary gates. Surprisingly, recent results have shown that universality can break down in the presence of symmetries: in general, not all globally symmetric unitaries can be constructed using $k$-local symmetric unitary gates. This also restricts the dynamics that can be implemented by symmetric local Hamiltonians. In this paper, we show that obstructions to universality in such settings can in general be understood in terms of superoperator symmetries associated with unitary evolution by restricted sets of gates. These superoperator symmetries lead to block decompositions of the operator Hilbert space, which dictate the connectivity of operator space, and hence the structure of the dynamical Lie algebra. We demonstrate this explicitly in several examples by systematically deriving the superoperator symmetries from the gate structure using the framework of commutant algebras, which has been used to systematically derive symmetries in other quantum many-body systems. We clearly delineate two different types of non-universality, which stem from different structures of the superoperator symmetries, and discuss its signatures in physical observables. In all, our work establishes a comprehensive framework to explore the universality of unitary circuits and derive physical consequences of its absence.</description>

      <title>Theory of the Spin Seebeck effect induced by crystal-field excitations in Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is a phenomenon of thermoelectric generation that occurs within a device consisting of a bilayer of a metal and a ferromagnet. When Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (TbIG) is substituted for the ferromagnet, the effect goes to zero at low temperatures, yet it increases to positive values with the application of a magnetic field. This is opposite to the expectation that the SSE should be suppressed by a magnetic field due to the increase in the magnon gap. In this paper, the crystal-field excitations (CFE) in TbIG are calculated within a mean field theory exploiting the parameters of Terbium Gallium Garnet Tb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (TGG) from the neutron-scattering experimental literature. Like TGG, the primitive cell of TbIG hosts twelve Tb sites with six inequivalent magnetic sublattices, but due to the net $[111]$-molecular field from the tetrahedral and octahedral Fe ions, these can be classified into two distinct groups, the $\mathbf{C}$ and the $\mathbf{C'}$ sites, which account for the `double umbrella' magnetic structure. We show that when an external magnetic field is applied along the [111] direction of the crystal, the lowest CFE of the $\mathbf{C}$ sublattices decreases. As a consequence of the magnetic field dependence of the lowest CFE, we find that at low temperatures the SSE in TbIG can result enhanced by an applied magnetic field.</description>
