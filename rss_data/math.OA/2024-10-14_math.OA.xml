      <title>Conjugating trivial automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)/\mathrm{Fin}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A trivial automorphism of the Boolean algebra $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ is an automorphism induced by the action of some function $\mathbb N \rightarrow \mathbb N$. In models of forcing axioms all automorphisms are trivial, and therefore two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if they have the same (modulo finite) cycle structure. We show that the Continuum Hypothesis implies that two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if there are neither first-order obstructions nor index obstructions for their conjugacy. This is equivalent to given trivial automorphisms being conugate in some forcing extension of the universe.
  To each automorphism $\alpha$ of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ we associate the first-order structure $\mathfrak{A}_\alpha=(\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin},\alpha)$ and compute the existential theories of these structures.
  These results are applied to resolve a question of Braga, Farah, and Vignati and prove that there are coarse metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that the isomorphism between their uniform Roe coronas is independent from $\mathsf{ZFC}$.</description>

      <title>On the limiting Horn inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Horn inequalities characterise the possible spectra of triples of $n$-by-$n$ Hermitian matrices $A+B=C$. We study integral inequalities that arise as limits of Horn inequalities as $n \to \infty$. These inequalities are parametrised by the points of an infinite-dimensional convex body, the asymptotic Horn system $\mathscr{H}$, which can be regarded as a topological closure of the countable set of Horn inequalities for all finite $n$.
  We prove three main results. The first shows that arbitrary points of $\mathscr{H}$ can be well approximated by specific sets of finite-dimensional Horn inequalities. The second is a quantitative result on the redundancy of the Horn inequalities in an infinite-dimensional setting. Concretely, the Horn inequalities for finite $n$ are indexed by certain sets $T^n_r$ with $1 \le r \le n-1$; we show that if $(n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ and $(r_k)_{k \ge 1}$ are any sequences such that $(r_k / n_k)_{k \ge 1}$ is a dense subset of $(0,1)$, then the Horn inequalities indexed by the sets $T^{n_k}_{r_k}$ are sufficient to imply all of the others.
  Our third main result shows that $\mathscr{H}$ has a remarkable self-characterisation property. Namely, membership in $\mathscr{H}$ is determined by the very inequalities corresponding to the points of $\mathscr{H}$ itself. To illuminate this phenomenon, we sketch a general theory of sets that characterise themselves in the sense that they parametrise their own membership criteria, and we consider the question of what further information would be needed in order for this self-characterisation property to determine the Horn inequalities uniquely.</description>

      <title>Inclusions of simple C$^*$-algebras arising from compact group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inclusions of operator algebras have long been studied. In particular, inclusions arising from actions of compact groups on factors were studied by Izumi-Longo-Popa and others. The correspondence between intermediate subfactors and subgroups is called the Galois correspondence. Analogues for actions on C$^*$-algebras have been studied by Izumi, Cameron-Smith, Peligrad, and others. In this article, we show the Galois correspondence for quasi-product actions of compact groups on C*-algebras. The notion of a quasi-product action was introduced by Bratteli-Elliott-Kishimoto. Recently, Izumi proved that every minimal action with a simple fixed-point algebra is a quasi-product action. According to these results, we get the Galois correspondence for minimal actions of compact groups with separable simple fixed point algebras. In addition, this paper provides another proof of the Galois correspondence for isometrically shift-absorbing actions and free product actions.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of all notions of generalized derivations whose domain is a C$^{\ast}$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a Banach bimodule over an associative Banach algebra $\mathcal{A}$, and let $F: \mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{M}$ be a linear mapping. Three main uses of the term \emph{generalized derivation} are identified in the available literature, namely,
  ($\checkmark$) $F$ is a generalized derivation of the first type if there exists a derivation $ d : \mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{M}^{**}$ satisfying $F(a b ) = F(a) b + a d(b),$ for all $a,b\in \mathcal{A}$.
  ($\checkmark$) $F$ is a generalized derivation of the second type if there exists an element $\xi\in \mathcal{M}^{**}$ satisfying $F(a b ) = F(a) b + a F(b) - a \xi b,$ for all $a,b\in \mathcal{A}$.
  ($\checkmark$) $F$ is a generalized derivation of the third type if there exist two (non-necessarily linear) mappings $G,H : \mathcal{A}\to \mathcal{M}$ satisfying $F(a b ) = G(a) b + a H(b),$ for all $a,b\in \mathcal{A}$.
  These three types of maps are not, in general, equivalent. Although the first two notions are well studied when $\mathcal{A}$ is a C$^*$-algebra, their connections with the third one have not yet been explored. In this note we prove that every generalized derivation of the third type from a C$^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ to a Banach $\mathcal{A}$-bimodule $\mathcal{M}$ is automatically continuous. We also show that every (continuous) generalized derivation of the third type from $\mathcal{A}$ to $\mathcal{M}$ is a generalized derivation of the first and second type. Consequently, the three notions coincide in this case. We also explore some concepts of generalized Jordan derivations on a C$^*$-algebra and establish some continuity properties for them.</description>

      <title>Operator-Valued Kernels, Machine Learning, and Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of kernel optimization, we prove a result that yields new factorizations and realizations. Our initial context is that of general positive operator-valued kernels. We further present implications for Hilbert space-valued Gaussian processes, as they arise in applications to dynamics and to machine learning. Further applications are given in non-commutative probability theory, including a new non-commutative Radon--Nikodym theorem.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Takai and Treumann Dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a comparison result between two duality statements - Takai duality, which is implemented by the crossed product functor $- \rtimes G: KK^{G} \to KK^{\hat G}$ on equivariant Kasparov categories; and Treumann duality, which asserts the existence of an exotic equivalence of stable $\infty$-categories $\text{Mod}(KU_p[G])^{ft} \simeq \text{Mod}(KU_p[\hat G])^{ft}$ given by tensoring with a particular $(G,\hat G)$-bimodule $M_E$ and $p$-completing.</description>
