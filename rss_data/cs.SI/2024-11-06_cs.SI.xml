      <title>A Persuasion-Based Prompt Learning Approach to Improve Smishing Detection through Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smishing, which aims to illicitly obtain personal information from unsuspecting victims, holds significance due to its negative impacts on our society. In prior studies, as a tool to counteract smishing, machine learning (ML) has been widely adopted, which filters and blocks smishing messages before they reach potential victims. However, a number of challenges remain in ML-based smishing detection, with the scarcity of annotated datasets being one major hurdle. Specifically, given the sensitive nature of smishing-related data, there is a lack of publicly accessible data that can be used for training and evaluating ML models. Additionally, the nuanced similarities between smishing messages and other types of social engineering attacks such as spam messages exacerbate the challenge of smishing classification with limited resources. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel data augmentation method utilizing a few-shot prompt learning approach. What sets our approach apart from extant methods is the use of the principles of persuasion, a psychology theory which explains the underlying mechanisms of smishing. By designing prompts grounded in the persuasion principles, our augmented dataset could effectively capture various, important aspects of smishing messages, enabling ML models to be effectively trained. Our evaluation within a real-world context demonstrates that our augmentation approach produces more diverse and higher-quality smishing data instances compared to other cutting-edging approaches, leading to substantial improvements in the ability of ML models to detect the subtle characteristics of smishing messages. Moreover, our additional analyses reveal that the performance improvement provided by our approach is more pronounced when used with ML models that have a larger number of parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness in training large-scale ML models.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the inference of ratings and rankings on Higher Order Networks with complex topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inference of rankings plays a central role in the theory of social choice, which seeks to establish preferences from collectively generated data, such as pairwise comparisons. Examples include political elections, ranking athletes based on competition results, ordering web pages in search engines using hyperlink networks, and generating recommendations in online stores based on user behavior. Various methods have been developed to infer rankings from incomplete or conflicting data. One such method, HodgeRank, introduced by Jiang et al.~\cite{jiang2011statistical}, utilizes Hodge decomposition of cochains in Higher Order Networks to disentangle gradient and cyclical components contributing to rating scores, enabling a parsimonious inference of ratings and rankings for lists of items. This paper presents a systematic study of HodgeRank's performance under the influence of quenched disorder and across networks with complex topologies generated by four different network models. The results reveal a transition from a regime of perfect trieval of true rankings to one of imperfect trieval as the strength of the quenched disorder increases. A range of observables are analyzed, and their scaling behavior with respect to the network model parameters is characterized. This work advances the understanding of social choice theory and the inference of ratings and rankings within complex network structures.</description>

      <title>Double Whammy: Stealthy Data Manipulation aided Reconstruction Attack on Graph Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has constructed successful graph reconstruction attack (GRA) on GFL. But these attacks are still challenged in aspects of effectiveness and stealth. To address the issues, we propose the first Data Manipulation aided Reconstruction attack on GFL, dubbed as DMan4Rec. The malicious client is born to manipulate its locally collected data to enhance graph stealing privacy from benign ones, so as to construct double whammy on GFL. It differs from previous work in three terms: (1) effectiveness - to fully utilize the sparsity and feature smoothness of the graph, novel penalty terms are designed adaptive to diverse similarity functions for connected and unconnected node pairs, as well as incorporation label smoothing on top of the original cross-entropy loss. (2) scalability - DMan4Rec is capable of both white-box and black-box attacks via training a supervised model to infer the posterior probabilities obtained from limited queries (3) stealthiness - by manipulating the malicious client's node features, it can maintain the overall graph structure's invariance and conceal the attack. Comprehensive experiments on four real datasets and three GNN models demonstrate that DMan4Rec achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack performance, e.g., the attack AUC and precision improved by 9.2% and 10.5% respectively compared with the SOTA baselines. Particularly, DMan4Rec achieves an AUC score and a precision score of up to 99.59% and 99.56%, respectively in black-box setting. Nevertheless, the complete overlap of the distribution graphs supports the stealthiness of the attack. Besides, DMan4Rec still beats the defensive GFL, which alarms a new threat to GFL.</description>

      <title>DeMod: A Holistic Tool with Explainable Detection and Personalized Modification for Toxicity Censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although there have been automated approaches and tools supporting toxicity censorship for social posts, most of them focus on detection. Toxicity censorship is a complex process, wherein detection is just an initial task and a user can have further needs such as rationale understanding and content modification. For this problem, we conduct a needfinding study to investigate people's diverse needs in toxicity censorship and then build a ChatGPT-based censorship tool named DeMod accordingly. DeMod is equipped with the features of explainable Detection and personalized Modification, providing fine-grained detection results, detailed explanations, and personalized modification suggestions. We also implemented the tool and recruited 35 Weibo users for evaluation. The results suggest DeMod's multiple strengths like the richness of functionality, the accuracy of censorship, and ease of use. Based on the findings, we further propose several insights into the design of content censorship systems.</description>

      <title>Accuracy nudges are not effective against non-harmful deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I conducted a preregistered survey experiment (n=525) to assess the effectiveness of "accuracy nudges" against deepfakes (osf.io/69x17). The results, based on a sample of Colombian participants, replicated previous findings showing that prompting participants to assess the accuracy of a headline at the beginning of the survey significantly decreased their intention to share fake news. However, this effect was not significant when applied to a non-harmful AI-generated video.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph Neural Networks in Large-scale Traffic Incident Analysis with Concurrency Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite recent progress in reducing road fatalities, the persistently high rate of traffic-related deaths highlights the necessity for improved safety interventions. Leveraging large-scale graph-based nationwide road network data across 49 states in the USA, our study first posits the Concurrency Hypothesis from intuitive observations, suggesting a significant likelihood of incidents occurring at neighboring nodes within the road network. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce two novel metrics, Average Neighbor Crash Density (ANCD) and Average Neighbor Crash Continuity (ANCC), and subsequently employ them in statistical tests to validate the hypothesis rigorously. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Concurrency Prior (CP) method, a powerful approach designed to enhance the predictive capabilities of general Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in semi-supervised traffic incident prediction tasks. Our method allows GNNs to incorporate concurrent incident information, as mentioned in the hypothesis, via tokenization with negligible extra parameters.
  The extensive experiments, utilizing real-world data across states and cities in the USA, demonstrate that integrating CP into 12 state-of-the-art GNN architectures leads to significant improvements, with gains ranging from 3% to 13% in F1 score and 1.3% to 9% in AUC metrics. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/xiwenc1/Incident-GNN-CP.</description>

      <title>Taming the Long Tail in Human Mobility Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the popularity of location-based services, human mobility prediction plays a key role in enhancing personalized navigation, optimizing recommendation systems, and facilitating urban mobility and planning. This involves predicting a user's next POI (point-of-interest) visit using their past visit history. However, the uneven distribution of visitations over time and space, namely the long-tail problem in spatial distribution, makes it difficult for AI models to predict those POIs that are less visited by humans. In light of this issue, we propose the Long-Tail Adjusted Next POI Prediction (LoTNext) framework for mobility prediction, combining a Long-Tailed Graph Adjustment module to reduce the impact of the long-tailed nodes in the user-POI interaction graph and a novel Long-Tailed Loss Adjustment module to adjust loss by logit score and sample weight adjustment strategy. Also, we employ the auxiliary prediction task to enhance generalization and accuracy. Our experiments with two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that LoTNext significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art works. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yukayo/LoTNext.</description>

      <title>Steering cooperation: Adversarial attacks on prisoner's dilemma in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the application of adversarial attack concepts to control the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma game in complex networks. Specifically, it proposes a simple adversarial attack method that drives players' strategies towards a target state by adding small perturbations to social networks. The proposed method is evaluated on both model and real-world networks. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively promote cooperation with significantly smaller perturbations compared to other techniques. Additionally, this study shows that adversarial attacks can also be useful in inhibiting cooperation (promoting defection). The findings reveal that adversarial attacks on social networks can be potent tools for both promoting and inhibiting cooperation, opening new possibilities for controlling cooperative behavior in social systems while also highlighting potential risks.</description>
