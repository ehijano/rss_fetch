      <title>The Complexity of (P3, H)-Arrowing and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Often regarded as the study of how order emerges from randomness, Ramsey theory has played an important role in mathematics and computer science, giving rise to applications in numerous domains such as logic, parallel processing, and number theory. The core of graph Ramsey theory is arrowing: For fixed graphs $F$ and $H$, the $(F, H)$-Arrowing problem asks whether a given graph, $G$, has a red/blue coloring of the edges of $G$ such that there are no red copies of $F$ and no blue copies of $H$. For some cases, the problem has been shown to be coNP-complete, or solvable in polynomial time. However, a more systematic approach is needed to categorize the complexity of all cases.
  We focus on $(P_3, H)$-Arrowing as $F = P_3$ is the simplest meaningful case for which the complexity question remains open, and the hardness for this case likely extends to general $(F, H)$-Arrowing for nontrivial $F$. In this pursuit, we also gain insight into the complexity of a class of matching removal problems, since $(P_3, H)$-Arrowing is equivalent to $H$-free Matching Removal. We show that $(P_3, H)$-Arrowing is coNP-complete for all $2$-connected $H$ except when $H = K_3$, in which case the problem is in P. We introduce a new graph invariant to help us carefully combine graphs when constructing the gadgets for our reductions. Moreover, we show how $(P_3,H)$-Arrowing hardness results can be extended to other $(F,H)$-Arrowing problems. This allows for more intuitive and palatable hardness proofs instead of ad-hoc constructions of SAT gadgets, bringing us closer to categorizing the complexity of all $(F, H)$-Arrowing problems.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Approximation of Constrained Forest Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained Forest Problems (CFPs) as introduced by Goemans and Williamson in 1995 capture a wide range of network design problems with edge subsets as solutions, such as Minimum Spanning Tree, Steiner Forest, and Point-to-Point Connection. While individual CFPs have been studied extensively in individual computational models, a unified approach to solving general CFPs in multiple computational models has been lacking. Against this background, we present the shell-decomposition algorithm, a model-agnostic meta-algorithm that efficiently computes a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation to CFPs for a broad class of forest functions. To demonstrate the power and flexibility of this result, we instantiate our algorithm for 3 fundamental, NP-hard CFPs in 3 different computational models. For example, for constant $\epsilon$, we obtain the following $(2+\epsilon)$-approximations in the Congest model:
  1. For Steiner Forest specified via input components, where each node knows the identifier of one of $k$ disjoint subsets of $V$, we achieve a deterministic $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(\sqrt{n}+D+k)$ rounds, where $D$ is the hop diameter of the graph.
  2. For Steiner Forest specified via symmetric connection requests, where connection requests are issued to pairs of nodes, we leverage randomized equality testing to reduce the running time to $O(\sqrt{n}+D)$, succeeding with high probability.
  3. For Point-to-Point Connection, we provide a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(\sqrt{n}+D)$ rounds.
  4. For Facility Placement and Connection, a relative of non-metric Facility Location, we obtain a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(\sqrt{n}+D)$ rounds.
  We further show how to replace the $\sqrt{n}+D$ term by the complexity of solving Partwise Aggregation, achieving (near-)universal optimality in any setting in which a solution to Partwise Aggregation in near-shortcut-quality time is known.</description>

      <title>Explaining Decisions in ML Models: a Parameterized Complexity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation into the parameterized complexity of explanation problems in various machine learning (ML) models. Contrary to the prevalent black-box perception, our study focuses on models with transparent internal mechanisms. We address two principal types of explanation problems: abductive and contrastive, both in their local and global variants. Our analysis encompasses diverse ML models, including Decision Trees, Decision Sets, Decision Lists, Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams, Random Forests, and Boolean Circuits, and ensembles thereof, each offering unique explanatory challenges. This research fills a significant gap in explainable AI (XAI) by providing a foundational understanding of the complexities of generating explanations for these models. This work provides insights vital for further research in the domain of XAI, contributing to the broader discourse on the necessity of transparency and accountability in AI systems.</description>
