      <title>Probabilities of causation and post-infection outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilities of causation provide explanatory information on the observed occurrence (causal necessity) and non-occurrence (causal sufficiency) of events. Here, we adapt these probabilities (probability of necessity, probability of sufficiency, and probability of necessity and sufficiency) to an important class of epidemiologic outcomes, post-infection outcomes. A defining feature of studies on these outcomes is that they account for the post-treatment variable, infection acquisition, which means that, for individuals who remain uninfected, the outcome is not defined. Following previous work by Hudgens and Halloran, we describe analyses of post-infection outcomes using the principal stratification framework, and then derive expressions for the probabilities of causation in terms of principal strata-related parameters. Finally, we show that these expressions provide insights into the contributions of different processes (absence or occurrence of infection, and disease severity), implicitly encoded in the definition of the outcome, to causation.</description>

      <title>Modular integration of neural connectomics, dynamics and biomechanics for identification of behavioral sensorimotor pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational approaches which emulate in-vivo nervous system are needed to investigate mechanisms of the brain to orchestrate behavior. Such approaches must integrate a series of biophysical models encompassing the nervous system, muscles, biomechanics to allow observing the system in its entirety while supporting model variations. Here we develop modWorm: a modular modeling framework for the nematode C. elegans. modWorm allows for construction of a model as an integrated series of configurable, exchangeable modules each describing specific biophysical processes across different modalities. Utilizing modWorm, we propose a base neuro-mechanical model for C. elegans built upon the complete connectome. The model integrates a series of 7 modules: i) intra-cellular dynamics, ii) electrical and iii) chemical extra-cellular neural dynamics, iv) translation of neural activity to muscle calcium dynamics, v) muscle calcium dynamics to muscle forces, vi) muscle forces to body postures and vii) proprioceptive feedback. We validate the base model by in-silico injection of constant currents into neurons known to be associated with locomotion behaviors and by applying external forces to the body. Applications of in-silico neural stimuli experimentally known to modulate locomotion show that the model can recapitulate natural behavioral responses such as forward and backward locomotion as well as mid-locomotion responses such as avoidance and turns. Furthermore, through in-silico ablation surveys, the model can infer novel neural circuits involved in sensorimotor behaviors. To further dissect mechanisms of locomotion, we utilize modWorm to introduce empirical based model variations and model optimizations to elucidate their effects on simulated locomotion. Our results show that modWorm can be utilized to identify neural circuits which control, mediate and generate natural behavior.</description>

      <title>3plex Web: An Interactive Platform for RNA:DNA Triplex Prediction and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summary: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exert their functions by cooperating with other molecules including proteins and DNA. Triplexes, formed through the interaction between a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), have been consistently described as a mechanism that allows lncRNAs to target specific genomic sequences in vivo. Building on the computational tool 3plex, we developed 3plex Web, an accessible platform that enhances RNA:DNA triplex prediction by integrating interactive visualization, statistical evaluation, and user-friendly downstream analysis workflows. 3plex Web implements new features such as input randomization for statistical assessments, interactive profile plotting for triplex stability, and customizable DNA Binding Domain (DBD) selection. This platform enables rapid analysis through PATO, substantially reducing processing times compared to previous methods, while offering Snakemake workflows to integrate gene expression data and explore lncRNA regulatory mechanisms.
  Availability and implementation: 3plex Web is freely available at https://3plex.unito.it as an online web service. The source code for 3plex is available at https://github.com/molinerisLab/3plex, paired with a definition file to set up the application into a Singularity image.

      <title>Quantum machine learning framework for longitudinal biomedical studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longitudinal biomedical studies play a vital role in tracking disease progression, treatment response, and the emergence of resistance mechanisms, particularly in complex disorders such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the high dimensionality of biological data, combined with the limited size of longitudinal cohorts, presents significant challenges for traditional machine learning approaches. In this work, we explore the potential of quantum machine learning (QML) for longitudinal biomarker discovery. We propose a novel modification to the instantaneous quantum polynomial time (IQP) feature map, designed to encode temporal dependencies across multiple time points in biomedical datasets. Through numerical simulations on both synthetic and real-world datasets - including studies on follicular lymphoma and Alzheimer's disease - we demonstrate that our longitudinal IQP feature map improves the ability of quantum kernels to capture intra-subject temporal patterns, offering a promising direction for QML in clinical research.</description>

      <title>TopSpace: spatial topic modeling for unsupervised discovery of multicellular spatial tissue structures in multiplex imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Understanding the spatial architecture of tissues is essential for decoding the complex interactions within cellular ecosystems and their implications for disease pathology and clinical outcomes. Recent advances in multiplex imaging technologies have enabled high-resolution profiling of cellular phenotypes and their spatial distributions, revealing critical roles of tissue structures such as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in shaping immune responses and influencing disease progression. However, existing methods for analyzing spatial tissue structures often rely on hard clustering or adjacency-based spatial models, which are limited in capturing the nuanced and overlapping nature of cellular communities. To address these challenges, we develop a novel spatial topic modeling framework for the unsupervised discovery of spatial tissue structures in multiplex imaging data.
  Results: We propose TopSpace, a novel Bayesian spatial topic model that integrates Gaussian processes into latent Dirichlet allocation to flexibly model spatial dependencies in tissue microenvironments. By leveraging the Bayesian framework, TopSpace supports multicellular mixed-membership clustering and offers key inferential advantages, including robust uncertainty quantification and data-driven determination of the number of multicellular microenvironments. We demonstrate the utility of TopSpace through simulations and a case study on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) data. Simulations show that TopSpace accurately recovers latent tissue microenvironments and spatial clustering patterns, outperforming existing methods in scenarios with varying spatial dependencies. Applied to NSCLC data, TopSpace successfully identifies TLS and captures their spatial probability distribution, which strongly correlates with patient survival outcomes.</description>

      <title>Identifying Chemicals Through Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Civilizations have tried to make drinking water safe to consume for thousands of years. The process of determining water contaminants has evolved with the complexity of the contaminants due to pesticides and heavy metals. The routine procedure to determine water safety is to use targeted analysis which searches for specific substances from some known list; however, we do not explicitly know which substances should be on this list. Before experimentally determining which substances are contaminants, how do we answer the sampling problem of identifying all the substances in the water? Here, we present an approach that builds on the work of Jaanus Liigand et al., which used non-targeted analysis that conducts a broader search on the sample to develop a random-forest regression model, to predict the names of all the substances in a sample, as well as their respective concentrations[1]. This work utilizes techniques from dimensionality reduction and linear decompositions to present a more accurate model using data from the European Massbank Metabolome Library to produce a global list of chemicals that researchers can then identify and test for when purifying water.</description>

      <title>Deformable Registration of MRA and 4D Flow Images to Facilitate Accurate Estimation of Flow Properties within Blood Vessels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method is presented for the registration of MRA and 4D Flow images, with the goal of calculating blood flow properties using both modalities simultaneously. In particular, the method produces an alignment of segmentations of vessel networks, from MRA images, with the blood velocity field within those networks, from the corresponding 4D Flow images. The alignment procedure is driven by the registration of centerlines of vessels extracted from the two modalities. Our approach is robust to noise, small deformations, and partial omissions of vessel surfaces and/or blood velocities. The alignment procedure is tested on 7 patient data sets acquired at Texas Children's Hospital. The quality of the resulting alignment is assessed by (i) an illustration of the aligned and unaligned surface segmentations for a sample patient, (ii) histograms of distances between centerline networks, and (iii) graphs of estimated blood flow. For each of the 7 analyzed data sets, medians of the distance histograms decreased an average of 83.5%, and the estimated blood flow increased significantly as a result of the alignment procedure.</description>

      <title>Transforming Hyperspectral Images Into Chemical Maps: An End-to-End Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current approaches to chemical map generation from hyperspectral images are based on models such as partial least squares (PLS) regression, generating pixel-wise predictions that do not consider spatial context and suffer from a high degree of noise. This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified version of U-Net and a custom loss function to directly obtain chemical maps from hyperspectral images, skipping all intermediate steps required for traditional pixel-wise analysis. We compare the U-Net with the traditional PLS regression on a real dataset of pork belly samples with associated mean fat reference values. The U-Net obtains a test set root mean squared error of between 9% and 13% lower than that of PLS regression on the task of mean fat prediction. At the same time, U-Net generates fine detail chemical maps where 99.91% of the variance is spatially correlated. Conversely, only 2.53% of the variance in the PLS-generated chemical maps is spatially correlated, indicating that each pixel-wise prediction is largely independent of neighboring pixels. Additionally, while the PLS-generated chemical maps contain predictions far beyond the physically possible range of 0-100%, U-Net learns to stay inside this range. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that U-Net is superior to PLS for chemical map generation.</description>
