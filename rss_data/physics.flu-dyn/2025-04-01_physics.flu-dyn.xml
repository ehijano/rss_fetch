      <title>Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off in the Simulation of Realistic Arterial Blood Flow: Effects of Geometric Simplifications and Non-Newtonian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates various aspects of blood flow in realistic arteries obtained from Computed Tomography (CT) scan data and its geometrically simplified variants. The study uses realistic inflow and outlet boundary conditions with Newtonian and non-Newtonian blood viscosity models, including the one recently developed by Apostolidis and Beris [28]. Similar studies exist to predict the progression of atherosclerosis, clots, and thrombus formation in arteries. However, these assume smooth flow geometries. In contrast, realistic arteries possess significant amounts of roughness, perturbations, and undulations. To understand their impact, studies are performed with two levels of geometry simplifications. Our results indicate that flow field predictions on these simplified geometries are visibly affected. The first level of simplification loses the local asymmetry but is able to reasonably approximate various parameters, capturing patterns with the correct magnitude. However, further simplification to a smooth one does not show vortex structures in the flow field. The flow recirculation zones near wall perturbations progressively weaken as the geometry is smoothed. On the other hand, no significant differences are observed between Newtonian and non-Newtonian models in this study. Our analysis also enables a speed-accuracy trade-off for future applications. The number of iterations to convergence becomes progressively lower as geometry is simplified, with nearly four times the difference obtained even with the first level of simplification. Further, the computational time for the Newtonian model is nearly 10 times smaller than the non-Newtonian counterpart.</description>

      <title>Structural Boundary State Transitions in Turbulent Pipe Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive optical measurements of canonical turbulent pipe flows have revealed the existence of structural boundary states (SBSs) -- near-wall low-speed streaks strongly correlated with pairs of counter-rotating quasi-streamwise vortices. In this study, we investigate the number fluctuations of these structures within the framework of statistical mechanics. Specifically, we introduce reduced degrees of freedom to model the low-speed streaks as a dilute lattice gas of hard-core particles. The Metropolis stochastic evolution provides, furthermore, a simple yet effective two-parameter model for describing SBS transitions. The lattice gas approach enables us to derive both the probability of SBS occurrence and the peculiar self-similar correlations that these structures exhibit along the streamwise direction. Our findings give additional support to the idea that the statistically stationary regimes of wall-bounded turbulent flows can be understood as Markov chains of coherent dynamical states in reduced-dimensional phase spaces.</description>

      <title>Maximum spreading of impacting shear-thinning and shear-thickening drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum spreading of an impacting liquid drop is a key metric for characterizing the fundamental fluid process of drop impact. While extensively studied for Newtonian liquids, how far a non-Newtonian drop can spread upon impacting a solid substrate remains an open question. Here, by combining simulations, experiments, and scaling analyses, we establish a general framework for predicting the maximum spreading of drops of generalized Newtonian liquids, encompassing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening behaviors. Through an analysis of the energy budget at maximum spreading, we identify a characteristic shear rate that governs the viscous dissipation during drop impact. The finding allows us to map the spreading of non-Newtonian drops onto that of Newtonian drops, revealing the quantitative dependence of the maximum spreading diameter on various impact parameters and rheological properties of liquids. Our study addresses the long-standing challenge of understanding the impact dynamics of non-Newtonian drops, and provides valuable guidance for designing non-Newtonian liquids to achieve desired impact outcomes.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Intelligence in Propulsion via Flexible Caudal Fins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fish swim with flexible fins that stand in stark contrast to the rigid propulsors of engineered vehicles, though it is unclear whether this flexibility endows animals with a performance advantage. Using numerical simulations of the mechanics of flow-structure interaction (FSI), we found that flexible fins are up to 70\% more efficient than rigid fins. By comparing the dynamics of FSI, we find that the power requirements of rigid fins can be largely attributed to their propensity to generate high-magnitude lateral forces. In contrast, flexible fins achieve high efficiency by a mechanism known as local-force redirection where deformations orient fluid forces in fore-aft and dorso-ventral directions to reduce the power demand of generating lateral forces. These deformations occur at moments in the tail-beat cycle when large velocities and pressure differentials are generated due to the mechanics of the fin and surrounding flow.</description>

      <title>A PINN Methodology for Temperature Field Reconstruction in the PIV Measurement Plane: Case of Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to infer temperature fields from stereo particle-image velocimetry (PIV) data in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) using Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The physical setup is a cubic RBC cell with Rayleigh number $\text{Ra}=10^7$ and Prandtl number $\text{Pr}=0.7$. With data only available in a vertical plane $A:x=x_0$, the residuals of the governing partial differential equations are minimised in an enclosing 3D domain around $A$ with thickness $\delta_x$. Dynamic collocation point sampling strategies are used to overcome the lack of 3D labelled information and to optimize the overall convergence of the PINN. In particular, in the out-of-plane direction $x$, the collocation points are distributed according to a normal distribution, in order to emphasize the region where data is provided. Along the vertical direction, we leverage meshing information and sample points from a distribution designed based on the grid of a direct numerical simulation (DNS). This approach points greater attention to critical regions, particularly the areas with high temperature gradients within the thermal boundary layers. Using planar three-component velocity data from a DNS, we successfully validate the reconstruction of the temperature fields in the PIV plane. We evaluate the robustness of our method with respect to characteristics of the labelled data used for training: the data time span, the sampling frequency, some noisy data and boundary data omission, aiming to better accommodate the challenges associated with experimental data. Developing PINNs on controlled simulation data is a crucial step toward their effective deployment on experimental data. The key is to systematically introduce noise, gaps, and uncertainties in simulated data to mimic real-world conditions and ensure robust generalization.</description>

      <title>Droplet breakup morphologies and the resultant size distribution in an opposed-flow airstream at different Weber numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23910v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the morphology and breakup dynamics of a freely falling drop in a vertical airstream using shadowgraphy and in-line holography. The in-line holography provides the temporal evolution of the volumetric size distribution of child droplets formed during various fragmentation processes at different Weber numbers (We). The droplet undergoes different fragmentation processes at significantly lower Weber numbers in opposed-flow configurations compared to cross-flow configurations. Our findings reveal distinct fragmentation modes, namely bag, bag-stamen, and dual-bag breakup, observed at We=9.38, 16.9, and 18.9, respectively. At We = 9.38, the combined effects of bag rupture, rim breakup, and node fragmentation generate child droplets of varying sizes, driven by the interplay of the Rayleigh-Plateau and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. At We = 16.9, the interaction of aerodynamic and shear forces leads to bag-stamen fragmentation, characterized by forming a stamen-like structure along with the bag. Both bag and bag-stamen breakups result in tri-modal size distributions. However, at We = 16.9, fewer tiny droplets are produced compared to the bag breakup observed at lower Weber numbers. In contrast, at We = 18.9, a dual-bag breakup occurs, where both bags inflate and burst simultaneously. This process generates tiny child droplets in the early stages, while larger child droplets form later due to the fragmentation of the rim and nodes, resulting in a bi-modal size distribution. We have performed a theoretical analysis using a two-parameter gamma distribution, which satisfactorily predicts the size distributions observed experimentally at different Weber numbers.</description>

      <title>A low cost singular value decomposition based data assimilation technique for analysis of heterogeneous combustion data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article applies low-cost singular value decomposition (lcSVD) for the first time, to the authors knowledge, on combustion reactive flow databases. The lcSVD algorithm is a novel approach to SVD, suitable for calculating high-resolution 2D or 3D proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes and temporal coefficients using data from sensors. Consequently, the computational cost associated with this technique is much lower compared to standard SVD. Additionally, for the analysis of full n-dimensional datasets, the method reduces data dimensionality by selecting a strategically reduced number of points from the original dataset through optimal sensor placement or uniform sampling before performing SVD. Moreover, the properties of data assimilation of heterogeneous databases of this method are illustrated using two distinct reactive flow test cases: a numerical database modeling an axisymmetric, time-varying laminar coflow flame with a fuel mixture of 65% methane and 35% nitrogen, using air as the oxidizer, and experimental data generated from a turbulent bluff-body-stabilized hydrogen flame. The computational speed-up and memory gains associated with the lcSVD algorithm compared to SVD can reach values larger than 10, with compression factors greater than 2000. Applying lcSVD for data assimilation to reconstruct the flow dynamics combining data from sensors with simulation measurements, we found errors smaller than 1% in the most relevant species modelling the flow.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for hidden boundary detection and flow field reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneously detecting hidden solid boundaries and reconstructing flow fields from sparse observations poses a significant inverse challenge in fluid mechanics. This study presents a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework designed to infer the presence, shape, and motion of static or moving solid boundaries within a flow field. By integrating a body fraction parameter into the governing equations, the model enforces no-slip/no-penetration boundary conditions in solid regions while preserving conservation laws of fluid dynamics. Using partial flow field data, the method simultaneously reconstructs the unknown flow field and infers the body fraction distribution, thereby revealing solid boundaries. The framework is validated across diverse scenarios, including incompressible Navier-Stokes and compressible Euler flows, such as steady flow past a fixed cylinder, an inline oscillating cylinder, and subsonic flow over an airfoil. The results demonstrate accurate detection of hidden boundaries, reconstruction of missing flow data, and estimation of trajectories and velocities of a moving body. Further analysis examines the effects of data sparsity, velocity-only measurements, and noise on inference accuracy. The proposed method exhibits robustness and versatility, highlighting its potential for applications when only limited experimental or numerical data are available.</description>

      <title>Moving mesh FSI approach for VIV simulation based on DG method with AMR technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24134v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) remains a fundamental yet computationally
  challenging problem in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This study develops a moving mesh Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) algorithm within a Runge-Kutta
  Discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework. The viscous term in the compressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations is discretized using
  the high-order Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG)
  method. In addition to the above, key numerical advancements encompass
  the rigorous derivation of the Lax-Friedrichs (L-F) numerical flux formulation
  tailored for moving meshes, an enhanced AMR-driven nodal correction
  methodology designed for curved surface geometries,
  and the implementation of a ghost-node boundary condition treatment scheme
  to address dynamic mesh motion. Numerical validation proceeds through three phases:
  First, Couette flow simulations confirm the IPDG method's spatial
  convergence order. Subsequent analysis of unsteady flow past a cylinder
  demonstrate the AMR framework's efficacy in resolving vortex-dominated flow.
  Finally, six VIV benchmark cases are simulated using third-order IPDG discretization,
  establishing the proposed FSI algorithm's accuracy. Furthermore, synthetic jets (SJs) flow control is investigated through
  four frequency-variant SJs configurations. The results reveal that SJs can achieve completely
  VIV suppression at a low actuation frequency, while higher actuation
  frequencies reduce suppression efficiency due
  to the energy of the SJs is more in the form of acoustic wave.</description>

Abstract: Fluid mixture models are essential for describing a wide range of physical phenomena, including wave dynamics and spinodal decomposition. However, there is a lack of consensus in the modeling of compressible mixtures, with limited connections between different classes of models. On the one hand, existing compressible two-phase flow models accurately describe wave dynamics, but do not incorporate phase separation mechanisms. On the other hand, phase-field technology in fluid dynamics consists of models incorporating spinodal decomposition, however, a general phase-field theory for compressible mixtures remains largely undeveloped.
  In this paper, we take an initial step toward bridging the gap between compressible two-phase flow models and phase-field models by developing a theory for compressible, isothermal N-phase mixtures. Our theory establishes a system of reduced complexity by formulating N mass balance laws alongside a single momentum balance law, thereby naturally extending the Navier-Stokes Korteweg model to N-phases and providing the Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn model for compressible mixtures. Key aspects of the framework include its grounding in continuum mixture theory and its preservation of thermodynamic consistency despite its reduced complexity.</description>

      <title>Tunable effective diffusion of CO2 in aqueous foam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aqueous foams are solid materials composed of gases and liquids, exhibiting a large gas/liquid surface area and enabling dynamic exchanges between their fluid components. The structure of binary-gas foams, whose bubbles consist of a mixture of two gases having different affinities with the liquid, thus offers real potential for the dynamic separation of these gases at low cost. In single-gas foams, the foam structure evolves under the effect of gas flow induced by Laplace pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble size. This leads to the well-documented Ostwald ripening. In addition to these capillary effects, the structure of binary-gas foams can evolve under the effect of gas flow induced by partial (or osmotic) pressure differences, arising from heterogeneities in bubble composition. We experimentally investigate the shrinking of CO$_2$-laden 2D foams exposed to air, observing a crust of tiny bubbles at the front. We derive a non-linear diffusion model for the gas in the foam and propose a description of the whole foam as an effective, homogeneous medium, the key parameter being the gas permeability ratio across the foam's soap films ($\neq 1$ for CO$_2/$air). The effective diffusivity of the gas in the foam emerges from the coupling between foam structure and gas transport across soap films. We extrapolate it for various permeability ratios and show that it can vary continuously between the diffusivity of the gas in the liquid and that of the gas in the atmosphere, enabling tunable gas retention and release by controlling the composition of the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Invariant Control Strategies for Active Flow Control using Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gained traction for active flow control tasks, with initial applications exploring drag mitigation via flow field augmentation around a two-dimensional cylinder. RL has since been extended to more complex turbulent flows and has shown significant potential in learning complex control strategies. However, such applications remain computationally challenging due to its sample inefficiency and associated simulation costs. This fact is worsened by the lack of generalization capabilities of these trained policy networks, often being implicitly tied to the input configurations of their training conditions. In this work, we propose the use of graph neural networks to address this particular limitation, effectively increasing the range of applicability and getting more value out of the upfront RL training cost. GNNs can naturally process unstructured, threedimensional flow data, preserving spatial relationships without the constraints of a Cartesian grid. Additionally, they incorporate rotational, reflectional, and permutation invariance into the learned control policies, thus improving generalization and thereby removing the shortcomings of commonly used CNN or MLP architectures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we revisit the well-established two-dimensional cylinder benchmark problem for active flow control. The RL training is implemented using Relexi, a high-performance RL framework, with flow simulations conducted in parallel using the high-order discontinuous Galerkin framework FLEXI. Our results show that GNN-based control policies achieve comparable performance to existing methods while benefiting from improved generalization properties. This work establishes GNNs as a promising architecture for RL-based flow control and highlights the capabilities of Relexi and FLEXI for large-scale RL applications in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>UP-ROM : Uncertainty-Aware and Parametrised dynamic Reduced-Order Model, application to unsteady flows</title>

Abstract: Reduced order models (ROMs) play a critical role in fluid mechanics by providing low-cost predictions, making them an attractive tool for engineering applications. However, for ROMs to be widely applicable, they must not only generalise well across different regimes, but also provide a measure of confidence in their predictions. While recent data-driven approaches have begun to address nonlinear reduction techniques to improve predictions in transient environments, challenges remain in terms of robustness and parametrisation. In this work, we present a nonlinear reduction strategy specifically designed for transient flows that incorporates parametrisation and uncertainty quantification. Our reduction strategy features a variational auto-encoder (VAE) that uses variational inference for confidence measurement. We use a latent space transformer that incorporates recent advances in attention mechanisms to predict dynamical systems. Attention's versatility in learning sequences and capturing their dependence on external parameters enhances generalisation across a wide range of dynamics. Prediction, coupled with confidence, enables more informed decision making and addresses the need for more robust models. In addition, this confidence is used to cost-effectively sample the parameter space, improving model performance a priori across the entire parameter space without requiring evaluation data for the entire domain.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-Time Projection (STP) is introduced as a data-driven forecasting approach for high-dimensional and time-resolved data. The method computes extended space-time proper orthogonal modes from training data spanning a prediction horizon comprising both hindcast and forecast intervals. Forecasts are then generated by projecting the hindcast portion of these modes onto new data, simultaneously leveraging their orthogonality and optimal correlation with the forecast extension. Rooted in Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) theory, dimensionality reduction and time-delay embedding are intrinsic to the approach. For a given ensemble and fixed prediction horizon, the only tunable parameter is the truncation rank--no additional hyperparameters are required. The hindcast accuracy serves as a reliable indicator for short-term forecast accuracy and establishes a lower bound on forecast errors. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated using two datasets: transient, highly anisotropic simulations of supernova explosions in a turbulent interstellar medium, and experimental velocity fields of a turbulent high-subsonic engineering flow. In a comparative study with standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks--acknowledging that alternative architectures or training strategies may yield different outcomes--the method consistently provided more accurate forecasts. Considering its simplicity and robust performance, STP offers an interpretable and competitive benchmark for forecasting high-dimensional transient and chaotic processes, relying purely on spatiotemporal correlation information.</description>

      <title>Vapor-mediated wetting and imbibition control on micropatterned surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wetting of micropatterned surfaces is ubiquitous in nature and key to many technological applications like spray cooling, inkjet printing, and semiconductor processing. Overcoming the intrinsic, chemistry- and topography-governed wetting behaviors often requires specific materials which limits applicability. Here, we show that spreading and wicking of water droplets on hydrophilic surface patterns can be controlled by the presence of the vapor of another liquid with lower surface tension. We show that delayed wicking arises from Marangoni forces due to vapor condensation, competing with the capillary wicking force of the surface topography. Thereby, macroscopic droplets can be brought into an effective apparent wetting behavior, decoupled from the surface topography, but coexisting with a wicking film, cloaking the pattern. We demonstrate how modulating the vapor concentration in space and time may guide droplets across patterns and even extract imbibed liquids, devising new strategies for coating, cleaning and drying of functional surface designs.</description>

      <title>Theory of hydrodynamic forces in electric double layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of the hydrodynamic forces in the drainage flow of an electrolyte between a sphere and a plane with charged surfaces. Our theory considers a thin electrolyte film which is at all times in local equilibrium across its thickness. In addition to the usual lubrication force, we explicit the electro-kinetic force due to the transport of the diffuse electrical charges as well as the diffusio-kinetic force due to the transport of the excess ion concentration in the Electrostatic Double Layers (EDLs). Our general formalism covers both the case of non-overlapping EDLs and of overlapping EDLs. We study more specifically the mechanical impedance induced by an oscillatory motion of small amplitude of the surfaces. Among our main results, we show that the increase in damping due to the electro-kinetic effect is not monotonic with the surface charge, and we predict a diffusio-kinetic stiffness with a long-range decay in power minus four of the sphere-plane gap susceptible to overcoming the stiffness of the equilibrium Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek force. The comparison of our results with experiments could allow one to confront the theories of electrolyte transport in the Electrostatic Double Layers without adjustable parameters.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Airfoil Design Using Neural Network Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, prediction of airfoil shape from targeted pressure distribution (suction and pressure sides) and vice versa is demonstrated using both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) techniques. The dataset is generated for 1600 airfoil shapes, with simulations carried out at Reynolds numbers (Re) ranging from 10,000 and 90,00,000 and angles of attack (AoA) ranging from 0 to 15 degrees, ensuring the dataset captured diverse aerodynamic conditions. Five different CNN and DNN models are developed depending on the input/output parameters. Results demonstrate that the refined models exhibit improved efficiency, with the DNN model achieving a multi-fold reduction in training time compared to the CNN model for complex datasets consisting of varying airfoil, Re, and AoA. The predicted airfoil shapes/pressure distribution closely match the targeted values, validating the effectiveness of deep learning frameworks. However, the performance of CNN models is found to be better compared to DNN models. Lastly, a flying wing aircraft model of wingspan &gt;10 m is considered for the prediction of pressure distribution along the chordwise. The proposed CNN and DNN models show promising results. This research underscores the potential of deep learning models accelerating aerodynamic optimization and advancing the design of high-performance airfoils.</description>

      <title>Micro-swimmer collective dynamics in Brinkman flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suspensions of swimming micro-organisms are known to undergo intricate collective dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic and collision interactions. Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective dynamics.The entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Improved pressure-gradient sensor for the prediction of separation onset in RANS models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve upon two key aspects of the Menter shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model: (1) We propose a more robust adverse pressure gradient sensor based on the strength of the pressure gradient in the direction of the local mean flow; (2) We propose two alternative eddy viscosity models to be used in the adverse pressure gradient regions identified by our sensor. Direct numerical simulations of the Boeing Gaussian bump are used to identify the terms in the baseline SST model that need correction, and a posteriori Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes calculations are used to calibrate coefficient values, leading to a model that is both physics driven and data informed. The two sensor-equipped models are applied to two thick airfoils representative of modern wind turbine applications, the FFA-W3-301 and the DU00-W-212. The proposed models improve the prediction of stall (onset of separation) with respect to the prediction of the baseline SST model.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for N-phase Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard Allen-Cahn mixture models with non-matching densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, numerous N-phase incompressible diffuse-interface flow models with non-matching densities have been proposed. Despite aiming to describe the same physics, these models are generally distinct, and an overarching modeling framework is absent. This paper provides a unified framework for N-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard Allen-Cahn mixture models with a single momentum equation. The framework naturally emerges from continuum mixture theory, exhibits an energy-dissipative structure, and is invariant to the choice of fundamental variables. This opens the door to exploring connections between existing N-phase models and facilitates the computation of N-phase flow models rooted in continuum mixture theory.</description>

      <title>An AMReX-based Compressible Reacting Flow Solver for High-speed Reacting Flows relevant to Hypersonic Propulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive framework for the efficient implementation of finite-volume-based reacting flow solvers, specifically tailored for high speed propulsion applications. Using the exascale computing project (ECP) based AMReX framework, a compressible flow solver for handling high-speed reacting flows is developed. This work is complementary to the existing PeleC solver, emphasizing specific applications that include confined shock-containing flows, stationary and moving shocks and detonations. The framework begins with a detailed exposition of the numerical methods employed, emphasizing their application to complex geometries and their effectiveness in ensuring accurate and stable numerical simulations. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis evaluates the solver's performance across canonical and practical geometries, with particular focus on computational cost and efficiency. The solver's scalability and robustness are demonstrated through practical test cases, including flow path simulations of scramjet engines and detailed analysis of various detonation phenomena.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincar\'e Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</description>

      <title>Frozen Cheerios effect: Particle-particle interaction induced by an advancing solidification front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09477v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particles at liquid interfaces have the tendency to cluster due to capillary forces competing with gravitational buoyancy (i.e., normal to the distorted free surface). This is known as the Cheerios effect. Here we experimentally and theoretically study the interaction between two submerged particles near an advancing water-ice interface during the freezing process. Particles that are thermally more conductive than water are observed to attract each other and form clusters once frozen. We call this feature the frozen Cheerios effect, where interactions are driven by alterations to the direction of the experienced repelling force (i.e., normal to the distorted isotherm). On the other hand, particles less conductive than water separate, highlighting the importance of thermal conduction during freezing. Based on existing models for single particle trapping in ice, we develop an understanding of multiple particle interaction. We find that the overall efficacy of the particle-particle interaction critically depends on the solidification front velocity. Our theory explains why the thermal conductivity mismatch between the particles and water dictates the attractive/repulsive nature of the particle-particle interaction.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Computing for Scale-up Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Computing is an application-agnostic outer loop framework to strategically deploy simulations and experiments to guide decision making for scale-up analysis. Resources are allocated over successive batches, which makes the allocation adaptive to some objective such as optimization or model training. The framework enables the characterization and management of uncertainties associated with predictive models of complex systems when scale-up questions lead to significant model extrapolation. A key advancement of this framework is its integration of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling, uncertainty management, and automated orchestration of various computing and experimentation resources into a single integrated software package. This enables efficient multi-fidelity modeling across multiple computing resources by incorporating real-world constraints such as relative queue times and throughput on individual machines into the multi-fidelity sampling decision. We discuss applications of this framework to problems in the renewable energy space, including biofuels production, material synthesis, perovskite crystal growth, and building electrical loads.</description>
