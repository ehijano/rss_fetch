      <title>Science mapping of the Revista General de Informacion y Documentacion (2005-2022)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of the Revista General de Informacion y Documentacion, from 2005 to 2022. The objective is aimed at qualifying the structure of the research field and assessing the trajectory of the thematic areas covered. Applying as methodology the analysis of co-words, the construction of bibliometric networks and the creation of scientific maps. 514 documents are extracted from the Web of Science (WoS) database. The keywords assigned by the authors of the documents are selected and divided into three subperiods: 2005-2010, 2011-2016 and 2017-2022. In the results, 1701 author keywords and 37 bibliometric networks are obtained. In the period 2005-2010, the structure of the research field is represented on the scientific map with very few central and specialized topics, considering an initial and underdeveloped organization. In the period 2011-2016, the structure of the research field is distributed on the scientific map with a more varied number of central and specialized topics, but still insufficient, considering an organization in the process of development. In the period 2017-2022, the structure of the research field is shown on the map with all kinds of family of topics (central, specialized, transversal, emerging or disappearing), being valued as a dynamic, complex and heterogeneous organization. Regarding the evolution of the thematic areas, the map shows solid progress between the last two periods. The morphology of the thematic field treated in RGID is outlined in three phases: foundation, process of development and consolidation.</description>

      <title>Citation proximus: the role of social and semantic ties in citing behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Citations are a key indicator of research impact but are shaped by factors beyond intrinsic research quality, including prestige, social networks, and thematic similarity. While the Matthew Effect explains how prestige accumulates and influences citation distributions, our study contextualizes this by showing that other mechanisms also play a crucial role. Analyzing a large dataset of disambiguated authors (N=43,467) and citation linkages (N=264,436) in U.S. economics, we find that close ties in the collaboration network are the strongest predictor of citation, closely followed by thematic similarity between papers. This reinforces the idea that citations are not only a matter of prestige but mostly of social networks and intellectual proximity. Prestige remains important for understanding highly cited papers, but for the majority of citations, proximity--both social and semantic--plays a more significant role. These findings shift attention from extreme cases of highly cited research toward the broader distribution of citations, which shapes career trajectories and the production of knowledge. Recognizing the diverse factors influencing citations is critical for science policy, as this work highlights inequalities that are not based on preferential attachment, but on the role of self-citations, collaborations, and mainstream versus no mainstream research subjects.</description>

      <title>The Gerontocratization of Science: How hypergrowth reshapes knowledge circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific literature has been growing exponentially for decades, with publications from the last twenty years now comprising 60% of all academic output. While the impact of information overload on news and social-media consumption is well-documented, its consequences on scientific progress remain understudied. Here, we investigate how this rapid expansion affects the circulation and exploitation of scientific ideas. Unlike other cultural domains, science is experiencing a decline in the proportion of highly influential papers and a slower turnover in its canons. This results in the disproportionate persistence of established works, a phenomenon we term the ``gerontocratization of science''. To test whether hypergrowth drives this trend, we develop a generative citation model that incorporates random discovery, cumulative advantage, and exponential growth of the scientific literature. Our findings reveal that as scientific output expands exponentially, gerontocratization emerges and intensifies, reducing the influence of new research. Recognizing and understanding this mechanism is crucial for developing targeted strategies to sustain intellectual dynamism and ensure a balanced and healthy renewal of scientific knowledge.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Dynamics of Harm Caused by Retracted Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite enormous efforts devoted to understand the characteristics and impacts of retracted papers, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of their harm and the dynamics of its propagation. Here, we propose a citation-based framework to quantify the harm caused by retracted papers, aiming to uncover why their harm persists and spreads so widely. We uncover an ''attention escape'' mechanism, wherein retracted papers postpone significant harm, more prominently affect indirectly citing papers, and inflict greater harm on citations in journals with an impact factor less than 10. This mechanism allows retracted papers to inflict harm outside the attention of authors and publishers, thereby evading their intervention. This study deepens understanding of the harm caused by retracted papers, emphasizes the need to activate and enhance the attention of authors and publishers, and offers new insights and a foundation for strategies to mitigate their harm and prevent its spread.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Peer Review in Astronomy: A Machine Learning and Optimization Approach to Reviewer Assignments for ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing volume of papers and proposals that undergo peer review emphasizes the pressing need for greater automation to effectively manage the growing scale. In this study, we present the deployment and evaluation of machine learning and optimization techniques to assign proposals to reviewers that were developed for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) during the Cycle 10 Call for Proposals issued in 2023. Using topic modeling algorithms, we identify the proposal topics and assess reviewers' expertise based on their previous ALMA proposal submissions. We then apply an adapted version of the assignment optimization algorithm from PeerReview4All (Stelmakh et al. 2021) to maximize the alignment between proposal topics and reviewer expertise. Our evaluation shows a significant improvement in matching reviewer expertise: the median similarity score between the proposal topic and reviewer expertise increased by 51 percentage points compared to the previous cycle, and the percentage of reviewers reporting expertise in their assigned proposals rose by 20 percentage points. Furthermore, the assignment process proved highly effective in that no proposals required reassignment due to significant mismatches, resulting in a savings of 3 to 5 days of manual effort.</description>

      <title>From Code to Canvas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The web-based dynamic geometry software CindyJS is a versatile tool to create interactive applications for mathematics and other topics. In this workshop, we will look at a code package that makes the creation of animations in CindyJS easier and more streamlined. Animations, which can then be embedded into presentations or be used in (lecture) videos. The focus lies on the creation of the animations themselves and some of the technical and artistic fundamentals to do so.</description>
