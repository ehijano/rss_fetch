      <title>The Interplay Between Liquid-Liquid Phase Equilibria, Sequence, and Tg in Copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copolymerization is a powerful tool to tune polymers' glass formation behavior in order to improve properties such as ion conductivity, thermal stability, and mechanical response. Classically, mixing rules such as the Fox equation and its variants have been employed to predict and explain glass transition temperature (Tg) variations with copolymer composition. However, a large number of copolymers exhibit significant excursions from these mixing rules. Increasingly, it also appears that these excursions can be tuned by copolymer sequence - an effect that is not predicted by classical mixing rules and thus far remains poorly understood. Here, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to probe the interplay between copolymer sequence, liquid-liquid phase equilibria, and Tg. We find that the direction of Tg shifts, and their dependence on sequence, are predicted by the type of liquid-liquid phase boundary towards which the comonomers tend. Monomers tending towards Upper Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit Tg reductions that become stronger with increasing monomer alternation; monomers tending towards Lower Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit Tg enhancements that become stronger with increasing monomer alternation. This behavior fundamentally emerges from a forced mixing phenomenon wherein monomer alternation induces close contact between monomer types that would otherwise tend towards phase separation. These results point towards strategies for rationally varying copolymer Tg, at fixed chemical composition, via judicious design of polymer chain sequence.</description>

      <title>Phase fluctuations in a confined fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid phase equilibrium depends on the external constraints imposed on a system. In a closed system with fixed volume, depending on the average density, a vapor bubble may be stable, metastable, or unstable, with respect to the homogeneous liquid phase. In the case where the bubble is metastable, we study its lifetime, i.e. the average waiting time needed to observe bubble collapse, and the corresponding lifetime of the homogeneous liquid. For the smallest systems, we predict the possibility to observe phase flipping, when the fluid oscillates between states with and without bubble. We provide an example of phase flipping in a simulation of a Lennard-Jones fluid.</description>

      <title>How Phase Coexistence affects the mechanical properties of heterogeneous 2D suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although numerical simulations of rheological measurements typically focus on homogeneous systems, heterogeneity can profoundly impact material properties. We report on the rheological properties of a suspension of two-dimensional Lennard-Jones particles across the gas/liquid and the gas/solid coexistence lines of the system. We show how the presence of multiple coexisting states has a significant impact on the mechanical properties of these systems when compared with their homogeneous reference counterparts. Our results establish an extended map to navigate a landscape where not only density and temperature, but also phase coexistence, dictate the transition from viscous to elastic-dominated behavior under shear. These results provides a benchmark for future research into heterogeneous fluids where the coexistence of complex dynamic states is frequently observed.</description>

      <title>Three-slab model for the dielectric permittivity of a lipid bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model for the tensorial dielectric permittivity of phospholipid membranes is presented here. The four-nanometer-thick membrane is treated as a composite made up of three dielectric slabs: one for each of the two phospholipid head-group regions, and one for the entire domain spanned by the lipid tails. Equal and opposite bound surface charge densities surround each head-group slab, and account for the membrane dipole potential. Three-slab model parameters are obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, and capture both the zero-field electric potential and the membrane response to applied electric fields. The tail region is well-approximated as having vacuum permittivity, while the head-group region is highly anisotropic due to the configurations of molecular dipoles. For the bilayers studied, the out-of-plane permittivity of the head-group region is 10--15 times that of the vacuum, while the in-plane permittivity is an order of magnitude larger. Membrane responses to applied electric fields up to 30 millivolts per nanometer are found to be in the linear regime. The model overcomes a fundamental limitation of microscopic theories -- where the out-of-plane permittivity is ill-posed in the head-group region due to large gradients in the local electric field -- by averaging over slab widths, thereby introducing new length scales. Our approach can be extended to characterize general interfacial systems with similarly ill-defined permittivities.</description>

      <title>Geometric Limits of Mitotic Pressure Under Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells often divide under mechanical confinement, where surrounding structures restrict shape changes during cytokinesis. Although forces generated during confined division have been measured experimentally, it remains unclear how confinement geometry and mechanics determine the transmitted force. Here we develop a minimal mechanical theory of cell division under confinement. Modeling the cell as an incompressible volume bounded by an interface with effective isotropic tension, we show that confinement restricts the set of mechanically admissible furrow shapes. As the furrow radius decreases, it reaches it reaches a confinement-induced minimum. Beyond this point, further ingression does not alter the interface shape, and both pressure and axial force saturate. We analyze force and pressure in rigid, soft, and strong three-dimensional confinement and demonstrate that a single geometric mechanism underlies these distinct cases. After rescaling force and length by the appropriate geometric scale, cells of different size and surface tension collapse onto a single universal curve. The relevant length scale is the cell size for rigid and soft confinement, and the confinement size in fully enclosing three-dimensional confinement. In soft confinement, environmental stiffness and spindle-generated axial forces determine the operating force and pressure, while the geometric constraint fixes the maximal attainable levels. In summary, our results show that mitotic force transmission and mitotic pressure during cytokinesis are bounded by confinement geometry, with material properties and active forces selecting the operating point within these geometry-imposed limits.</description>

      <title>Training overdamped dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In regimes where inertia is negligible, the temporal evolution is governed by overdamped dynamics. This limit is particularly relevant in soft-matter contexts, such as polymers, colloidal suspensions, and processes occurring at the cellular scale. Being able to manipulate the dynamics of such many-particle systems would enable control over rate-dependent elastic responses, time-dependent material properties, relaxation processes, and perhaps the hydrodynamics of suspensions. In this work, we develop a framework for manipulating overdamped dynamics through local, physically motivated update rules. Our approach is inspired by ideas from physical learning and directed aging, in which microscopic parameters adapt autonomously to endow a material with a desired function. Using the Rayleighian formulation, whose minimization reproduces the overdamped equations of motion, we derive approximate directed-aging and equilibrium-propagation rules tailored to dissipative systems. To demonstrate these ideas, we study a disordered Maxwell material that behaves elastically at short times but flows at long times. By locally modifying the viscous damping, we show that one can tune the viscous Poisson's ratio and shape local mechanical responses. These results illustrate how materials can be trained to exhibit targeted rate-dependent elastic and viscous behaviors.</description>

      <title>Microgel Translocation Through Narrow Capillaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport of soft viscoelastic gels through confined geometries underlies critical processes in biomedical, biological, and industrial systems. Here, we examine the translocation of a spherical microgel through a narrow capillary whose diameter is smaller than the equilibrium gel size. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in tandem with mean-field theory and mechanical analysis, we uncover a critical threshold diameter $d_c$ below which the microgel cannot enter, regardless of the applied pressure. This geometric limit emerges from the interplay between gel elasticity and its internal network connectivity, captured quantitatively by a graph-theoretic model. We construct a phase diagram in the parameter space of tube diameter $d$, applied force $f_g$, and gel stiffness $Y$ (Young's modulus), which delineates the regimes of successful translocation and mechanical arrest. Under negligible wall friction, gel mobility scales with the applied force; however, beyond a cutoff set by the network topology, progressive densification in the constriction stalls the microgel. Our results reveal the mechanical and topological determinants of soft-gel transport in confinement and provide predictive guidelines for engineering gel-based systems in microfluidics, drug delivery, and tissue-level filtration.</description>

      <title>On the Statistical Mechanics of Active Membranes: Some Selected Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological membranes and vesicles play a central role in living systems, forming dynamic interfaces that regulate cellular organization and function. Classical descriptions of membrane mechanics that are rooted in equilibrium statistical mechanics and linear elasticity have yielded deep insights into membrane morphology and the role of thermal fluctuations on cellular function. However, real biological membranes operate far from equilibrium, continuously driven by active processes powered by energy consuming proteins. In this work, we employ a nonequilibrium statistical mechanics framework to model active membranes and derive analytical expressions for four fundamental properties that characterize their mechanical behavior: (a) the tension area relation, (b) the mean square amplitude of fluctuations, (c) correlation of normal vectors, and (d) the persistence length. These results collectively highlight the utility of fluctuation spectra as a starting point for elucidating membrane mechanics in both passive and active settings. Moreover, these results provide a theoretical basis for analyzing and interpreting fluctuation based assays of active membrane behavior.</description>

      <title>On the anomalous elasticity in the mechanical response of amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of amorphous solids to a mechanical perturbation consists in an elastic and a plastic deformation. The latter is mediated by localized irreversible rearrangements associated with Eshelby-like quadrupolar singularities in the displacement field. It has recently been argued that a density of such singularities leads to an anomalous elastic behavior taking the form of screening effects, which goes beyond classical elastic predictions. Here, we reexamine this scenario using general theoretical arguments and a description in terms of an elasto-plastic model, which we compare with atomistic simulations of the canonical Eshelby inclusion geometry. We discuss the conditions under which a finite, i.e., nonvanishing, density of quadrupolar events is created by an imposed perturbation. We argue that, except when the perturbation is macroscopic, there are many situations in which the density of quadrupolar defects is zero in the thermodynamic limit. In these cases, we find that plastically active quadrupoles emerge in a region whose size generically scales as the spatial extent $\ell$ of the mechanical perturbation. This mechanism leads to anomalous elasticity on a scale $\ell$ close to the perturbation and to conventional elasticity beyond. The simulations of the elasto-plastic model reproduce the emergence of plastic quadrupoles in a region set by $\ell$ and the associated renormalization of the effective shear modulus, but they do not exhibit the dipole-screening signatures reported in atomistic and experimental studies. Our analysis delineates the scale-dependent breakdown of long-wavelength elasticity in amorphous materials and suggests directions for incorporating anomalous screening into mesoscopic modeling frameworks.</description>

      <title>A label-free method to quantify early-stage amyloid aggregation under flow via intrinsic phenylalanine fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aggregation of amyloid-forming peptides is a dynamic, complex process that underlies their diverse biological activities, from physiological functions to disease-associated dysfunctions. While the structure of fibrillar end-products is well-characterized for most amyloids, the heterogeneous and often transient oligomers, likely key in cytotoxicity, remain poorly investigated, especially for peptides with low-yield aromatic residues. Here, by exploiting and developing flow induced dispersion analysis in both peak and front modes, we demonstrate that intrinsic phenylalanine fluorescence can be harnessed to quantify the conversion of diffusing monomers into non-diffusing oligomers and fibrils. We further characterize low-molecular-weight oligomers, and their size evolution from 2 to 10 nm over time. Importantly, we validate the robustness of our approach using two tryptophan-free and fast-fibrillating amyloid peptides, PSM$\alpha$3 and hIAPP, known for their key roles in S. aureus virulence and type 2 diabetes respectively. Our results overcome the limitations of traditional biochemical and biophysical amyloid assays by extending analysis from large oligomers and fibrils to small heterogeneous oligomers, under near-physiological conditions. This study thus offers a new analytical framework, thereby filling a critical gap in amyloid research, to probe the early stages of aggregation, key in the design of alternative therapeutics for amyloid-diseases.</description>

      <title>Suppressed Rupture of Thin Metal Films via van der Waals Epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrathin metal films exhibit liquid-like instabilities, rupturing via surface diffusion far below their melting points. This behavior constrains thermal budgets for advanced integrated circuits and emerging 2D-crystal devices. Here, we demonstrate that these instabilities can be fundamentally suppressed using graphene as a van der Waals (vdW) template. While conventional 20-nm-thick gold films break up into islands below 300 {\textdegree}C, templated films not only remain stable but also become structurally refined after annealing above 600 {\textdegree}C. This exceptional stability stems from a vdW-mediated crystallographic texture that reorganizes grain boundaries into a mechanically robust network. This mechanism significantly widens the processing window for nanoscale interconnects and enables high-temperature integration of metals with 2D-crystal technologies.</description>

      <title>Linearised Identification of Mechanical and Structural Anisotropy of Granular Materials from Hollow-Cylinder Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropy in granular materials arises from both the internal fabric and the directionality of the stress state, yet separating these effects experimentally remains challenging. This study develops a first-order linearisation of the incremental stress-strain response that isolates mechanical anisotropy from structural anisotropy using two independent orientation measures. The formulation enables both contributions to be quantified directly from macroscopic laboratory data. The method is applied to hollow-cylinder tests with systematically varied loading directions. Results show that both anisotropy components intensify as the stress state becomes more deviatoric; mechanical anisotropy is consistently stronger; and its relative dominance decreases with increasing deviatoric stress. Comparison with an isotropic hypoplastic model confirms that mechanically induced directional effects are captured even without fabric anisotropy. The framework offers a practical and physically transparent means for quantifying and comparing anisotropy mechanisms in granular materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to characterize the distribution of length-scales of finite, disordered patterns with, on average, radial symmetry. This method makes it possible to quantify the distribution of characteristic length scales in cases where the conventional "linear" chord method does not work. We show that the method can clearly distinguish regular patterns, patterns that are formed by diffusion-limited aggregation, and patterns that form during the slow drying of confined, colloid-laden droplets, explained by Beechey-Newman et al.1 We also introduce a method to find the centre-point of these finite patterns, without assuming a full connectivity in the pattern. The method should be widely applicable to other, finite quasi-two-dimensional patterns.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxis of cell aggregates: morphology and dynamics of migrating active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological tissues have been observed to display emergent fluid-like properties, owing to physical interactions between cells. However, it remains unclear in general how these fluid-like properties affect tissue structure and function. Here, we are motivated by recent experiments in which cell aggregates were observed to behave as active droplets during collective migration along chemical gradients, or chemotaxis. To understand this process, we develop a minimal model of a growing thin active droplet driven by a self-generated chemical gradient. In broad agreement with the experiments, dynamic simulations reveal that chemotacting droplets exhibit proliferation-driven morphological transitions. To fully characterise these transitions, we perform a multiple scales analysis to show that the droplet dynamics follow a sequence of travelling wave solutions defined by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem parametrised by the slowly increasing droplet volume. Our analysis reveals that morphological transitions can occur continuously or through a discontinuous bifurcation. Further asymptotic analysis of the travelling wave problem reveals that these morphological transitions arise from exponentially small ("beyond-all-orders") asymptotic terms that originate from the rear and front contact lines. Moreover, we show that the nature of the transitions is fully determined by two key dimensionless parameters, which quantify the internal stress balance within the droplet and the strength of the coupling between the droplet migration dynamics and the external chemical field. Overall, our results provide a complete characterisation of the morphodynamics of a class of migrating active thin droplets, with implications in a range of biological systems where cell aggregates exhibit fluid-like behaviour.</description>

Abstract: We consider arbitrary-shaped microswimmers of spherical topology and propose a framework for expressing their slip velocity in terms of tangential basis functions defined on the boundary of the swimmer using the Helmholtz decomposition. Given a time-independent slip velocity profile, we show that the trajectory followed by the microswimmer is a circular helix. We derive analytical expressions for the translational and rotational velocities of a prolate spheroid swimmer in terms of its Helmholtz decomposition modes and explore the effect of aspect ratio on these rigid body velocities. Then, for a given arbitrary swimmer shape of spherical topology, we investigate which slip profile minimizes the total power loss. A partial minimization is performed in which the direction of net motion of the swimmer is prescribed, followed by a global optimization procedure in which the best net motion direction is determined. The optimization results suggest that the competition between linear and rotational optimal motion is linked to symmetries in the shape of the microswimmer.</description>

      <title>Dielectric response in proteins: The proteotronics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dielectric properties of proteins, particularly in their hydrated state, have been extensively studied. Numerous theoretical and experimental investigations have reported values of both the permittivity and the intrinsic dipole moments of specific proteins under well-defined hydration conditions. Since even approximate estimates of these properties are relevant from both fundamental and applied perspectives, we propose a user-friendly method to calculate the relative permittivity that can be readily integrated into proteotronics workflows. To validate the proposed approach, we compare the results with those obtained using a classical macroscopic method. The outcomes are consistent and contribute further insight into this long-debated issue.</description>

      <title>Follow the curvature of viscoelastic stress: Insights into the steady arrowhead structure</title>

Abstract: Focusing on simulated dilute polymer solutions, this letter investigates the interactions between flow structures and organized polymer stress sheets for the steady arrowhead coherent structure in a two-dimensional periodic channel flow. Formulating the problem in a frame of reference moving with the arrowhead velocity, streamlines, which are also pathlines in this frame, enables the identification of two distinct topological regions linked to two stagnation points. The streamlines help connecting the spatial distribution of polymer stress within the sheets and the dynamics of polymers transported by the flow. Using stresslines, lines parallel to the eigenvectors of polymer stress, a novel formulation of the viscoelastic stress term in the momentum transport equation proposes a more intuitive interpretation of the relation between the curvature of the stresslines, and the variation of stress along these lines, with the local flow topology. An approximation of this formulation is shown to explain the pressure jump observed in the arrowhead structure as a function of the local curvature of the polymer stress sheet.</description>

      <title>Ion Permeation in Nanoscale Films: Fundamental Limitation and Evaluation of Dielectric Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanoscale films play a central role in biology and osmotic separations. Their water/salt selectivity is often regarded as intrinsic property, favoring thinner membranes for faster permeation. Here we highlight and quantify a fundamental limitation arising from the dependence of ion self-energy on film thickness, governed by its ratio to Bjerrum length. The resulting relation factors out this dependence from intrinsic ion permeability, which agrees well with available data and enables evaluation of dielectric properties of ultrathin films, advancing understanding of ion transport in membranes.</description>

      <title>Osmotic forces modify lipid membrane fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In hydrodynamic descriptions of lipid bilayers, the membrane is often approximated as being impermeable to the surrounding, solute-containing fluid. However, biological and in vitro lipid membranes are influenced by their permeability and the resultant osmotic forces -- whose effects remain poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of a fluctuating, planar lipid membrane that is ideally selective: fluid can pass through it, while the electrically-neutral solutes cannot. We find that the canonical membrane relaxation mode, in which internal membrane forces are balanced by fluid drag, no longer exists over all wavenumbers. Rather, this mode only exists when it is slower than solute diffusion -- corresponding to a finite range of wavenumbers. The well-known equipartition result quantifying the size of membrane undulations due to thermal perturbations is consequently limited in its validity to the aforementioned range. Moreover, this range shrinks as the membrane surface tension is increased, and above a critical tension the membrane mode vanishes. Our findings are relevant when interpreting experimental measurements of membrane fluctuations, especially in vesicles at moderate to high tensions.</description>

      <title>Attractive and repulsive terms in multi-filament dispersion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00419v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filamentary objects such as nano-wires, nanotubes and DNA are of current interest in physics, nanoscience, chemistry, biology and medicine. They can interact via strong, exceptionally long-ranged many-object van der Waals (vdW, dispersion) forces, causing them to cluster into multi-object bundles. We analyse their vdW interactions perturbatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. Our findings are confirmed here via the first detailed analysis of a 4-cylinder vdW model. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening. Our results suggest that a non-perturbative calculation will be required for reliable prediction of dispersion interactions in these ubiquitous systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Non-reciprocally Interacting Particles and Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Droplet Breakup Against an Isolated Obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe combined experiments and simulations of droplet breakup during flow-driven interactions with a circular obstacle in a quasi-two-dimensional microfluidic chamber. Due to a lack of in-plane confinement, the droplets can also slip past the obstacle without breaking. Droplets are more likely to break when they have a higher flow velocity, larger size (relative to the obstacle radius R), smaller surface tension, and for head-on collisions with the obstacle. We also observe that droplet-obstacle collisions are more likely to result in breakup when the height of the sample chamber is increased. We define a nondimensional breakup number Bk ~ Ca, where Ca is the Capillary number, that accounts for changes in the likelihood of droplet break up with variations in these parameters. As Bk increases, we find in both experiments and discrete element method (DEM) simulations of the deformable particle model that the behavior changes from droplets never breaking (Bk &lt;&lt; 1) to always breaking for Bk &gt;&gt; 1, with a rapid change in the probability of droplet breakup near Bk = 1. We also find that Bk ~ S^(4/3), where S characterizes the symmetry of the collision, which implies that the minimum symmetry required for breakup is controlled by a characteristic distance h ~ R.</description>
