      <title>Augment or Not? A Comparative Study of Pure and Augmented Large Language Model Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new paradigms for recommender systems by enabling richer semantic understanding and incorporating implicit world knowledge. In this study, we propose a systematic taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into two categories: (1) Pure LLM Recommenders, which rely solely on LLMs, and (2) Augmented LLM Recommenders, which integrate additional non-LLM techniques to enhance performance. This taxonomy provides a novel lens through which to examine the evolving landscape of LLM-based recommendation. To support fair comparison, we introduce a unified evaluation platform that benchmarks representative models under consistent experimental settings, highlighting key design choices that impact effectiveness. We conclude by discussing open challenges and outlining promising directions for future research. This work offers both a comprehensive overview and practical guidance for advancing next-generation LLM-powered recommender.</description>

      <title>From Token to Action: State Machine Reasoning to Mitigate Overthinking in Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs), including applications in information retrieval (IR). However, it often leads to overthinking, where models produce excessively long and semantically redundant traces with little or no benefit. We identify two key challenges in IR: redundant trajectories that revisit similar states and misguided reasoning that diverges from user intent. To address these, we propose State Machine Reasoning (SMR), a transition-based reasoning framework composed of discrete actions (Refine, Rerank, Stop) that support early stopping and fine-grained control. Experiments on the BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks show that SMR improves retrieval performance (nDCG@10) by 3.4% while reducing token usage by 74.4%. It generalizes across LLMs and retrievers without requiring task-specific tuning, offering a practical alternative to conventional CoT reasoning. The code and details are available at https://github.com/ldilab/SMR.</description>

      <title>Deep Retrieval at CheckThat! 2025: Identifying Scientific Papers from Implicit Social Media Mentions via Hybrid Retrieval and Re-Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the methodology and results of the Deep Retrieval team for subtask 4b of the CLEF CheckThat! 2025 competition, which focuses on retrieving relevant scientific literature for given social media posts. To address this task, we propose a hybrid retrieval pipeline that combines lexical precision, semantic generalization, and deep contextual re-ranking, enabling robust retrieval that bridges the informal-to-formal language gap. Specifically, we combine BM25-based keyword matching with a FAISS vector store using a fine-tuned INF-Retriever-v1 model for dense semantic retrieval. BM25 returns the top 30 candidates, and semantic search yields 100 candidates, which are then merged and re-ranked via a large language model (LLM)-based cross-encoder.
  Our approach achieves a mean reciprocal rank at 5 (MRR@5) of 76.46% on the development set and 66.43% on the hidden test set, securing the 1st position on the development leaderboard and ranking 3rd on the test leaderboard (out of 31 teams), with a relative performance gap of only 2 percentage points compared to the top-ranked system. We achieve this strong performance by running open-source models locally and without external training data, highlighting the effectiveness of a carefully designed and fine-tuned retrieval pipeline.</description>

      <title>Engineering Serendipity through Recommendations of Items with Atypical Aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A restaurant dinner or a hotel stay may lead to memorable experiences when guests encounter unexpected aspects that also match their interests. For example, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be both surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper crafts. Similarly, an exhibit of 18th century harpsichords would be atypical for a hotel lobby and likely pique the interest of a guest who has a passion for Baroque music. Motivated by this insight, in this paper we introduce the new task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with atypical aspects. We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts atypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their user-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to rerank a list of items recommended to the user. To facilitate system development and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are manually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially generated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect utility values. Furthermore, we introduce a custom procedure for dynamic selection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based judgments of atypicality and utility. Experimental evaluations show that serendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with ground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual annotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility. Overall, we hope that the new recommendation task and the associated system presented in this paper catalyze further research into recommendation approaches that go beyond accuracy in their pursuit of enhanced user satisfaction.

      <title>Verify-in-the-Graph: Entity Disambiguation Enhancement for Complex Claim Verification with Interactive Graph Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Claim verification is a long-standing and challenging task that demands not only high accuracy but also explainability of the verification process. This task becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models (LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic structures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address this by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to resolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective disambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire verification process. To address these challenges, we propose Verify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and comprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1) Graph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets, forming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and unstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively interacts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the graph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining triplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using Meta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive performance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively addressing claim verification challenges. Our source code and data are available for further exploitation.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Semantic and User Preference Spaces for Multi-modal Music Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works of music representation learning mainly focus on learning acoustic music representations with unlabeled audios or further attempt to acquire multi-modal music representations with scarce annotated audio-text pairs. They either ignore the language semantics or rely on labeled audio datasets that are difficult and expensive to create. Moreover, merely modeling semantic space usually fails to achieve satisfactory performance on music recommendation tasks since the user preference space is ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Two-stage Contrastive Learning (HTCL) method that models similarity from the semantic perspective to the user perspective hierarchically to learn a comprehensive music representation bridging the gap between semantic and user preference spaces. We devise a scalable audio encoder and leverage a pre-trained BERT model as the text encoder to learn audio-text semantics via large-scale contrastive pre-training. Further, we explore a simple yet effective way to exploit interaction data from our online music platform to adapt the semantic space to user preference space via contrastive fine-tuning, which differs from previous works that follow the idea of collaborative filtering. As a result, we obtain a powerful audio encoder that not only distills language semantics from the text encoder but also models similarity in user preference space with the integrity of semantic space preserved. Experimental results on both music semantic and recommendation tasks confirm the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Abstention Pairwise Learning to Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ranking systems influence decision-making in high-stakes domains like health, education, and employment, where they can have substantial economic and social impacts. This makes the integration of safety mechanisms essential. One such mechanism is $\textit{abstention}$, which enables algorithmic decision-making system to defer uncertain or low-confidence decisions to human experts. While abstention have been predominantly explored in the context of classification tasks, its application to other machine learning paradigms remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for abstention in pairwise learning-to-rank tasks. Our approach is based on thresholding the ranker's conditional risk: the system abstains from making a decision when the estimated risk exceeds a predefined threshold. Our contributions are threefold: a theoretical characterization of the optimal abstention strategy, a model-agnostic, plug-in algorithm for constructing abstaining ranking models, and a comprehensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Ensuring User-side Fairness in Dynamic Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User-side group fairness is crucial for modern recommender systems, aiming to alleviate performance disparities among user groups defined by sensitive attributes like gender, race, or age. In the ever-evolving landscape of user-item interactions, continual adaptation to newly collected data is crucial for recommender systems to stay aligned with the latest user preferences. However, we observe that such continual adaptation often exacerbates performance disparities. This necessitates a thorough investigation into user-side fairness in dynamic recommender systems, an area that has been unexplored in the literature. This problem is challenging due to distribution shifts, frequent model updates, and non-differentiability of ranking metrics. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first principled study on ensuring user-side fairness in dynamic recommender systems. We start with theoretical analyses on fine-tuning v.s. retraining, showing that the best practice is incremental fine-tuning with restart. Guided by our theoretical analyses, we propose FAir Dynamic rEcommender (FADE), an end-to-end fine-tuning framework to dynamically ensure user-side fairness over time. To overcome the non-differentiability of recommendation metrics in the fairness loss, we further introduce Differentiable Hit (DH) as an improvement over the recent NeuralNDCG method, not only alleviating its gradient vanishing issue but also achieving higher efficiency. Besides that, we also address the instability issue of the fairness loss by leveraging the competing nature between the recommendation loss and the fairness loss. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FADE effectively and efficiently reduces performance disparities with little sacrifice in the overall recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>ExpandR: Teaching Dense Retrievers Beyond Queries with LLM Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing dense retrieval through query augmentation. However, most existing methods treat the LLM and the retriever as separate modules, overlooking the alignment between generation and ranking objectives. In this work, we propose ExpandR, a unified LLM-augmented dense retrieval framework that jointly optimizes both the LLM and the retriever. ExpandR employs the LLM to generate semantically rich query expansions, which are leveraged to enhance the retriever's training. Simultaneously, the LLM is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), guided by a carefully designed reward function that balances retrieval effectiveness and generation consistency. This joint optimization paradigm enables mutual adaptation between the LLM and the retriever, resulting in query expansions that are both informative and well-suited for retrieval. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that ExpandR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving more than a 5% improvement in retrieval performance. All codes are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/ExpandR.</description>

      <title>Learning Cascade Ranking as One Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cascade Ranking is a prevalent architecture in large-scale top-k selection systems like recommendation and advertising platforms. Traditional training methods focus on single-stage optimization, neglecting interactions between stages. Recent advances have introduced interaction-aware training paradigms, but still struggle to 1) align training objectives with the goal of the entire cascade ranking (i.e., end-to-end recall of ground-truth items) and 2) learn effective collaboration patterns for different stages. To address these challenges, we propose LCRON, which introduces a novel surrogate loss function derived from the lower bound probability that ground truth items are selected by cascade ranking, ensuring alignment with the overall objective of the system. According to the properties of the derived bound, we further design an auxiliary loss for each stage to drive the reduction of this bound, leading to a more robust and effective top-k selection. LCRON enables end-to-end training of the entire cascade ranking system as a unified network. Experimental results demonstrate that LCRON achieves significant improvement over existing methods on public benchmarks and industrial applications, addressing key limitations in cascade ranking training and significantly enhancing system performance.</description>

      <title>To Judge or not to Judge: Using LLM Judgements for Advertiser Keyphrase Relevance at eBay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E-commerce sellers are recommended keyphrases based on their inventory on which they advertise to increase buyer engagement (clicks/sales). The relevance of advertiser keyphrases plays an important role in preventing the inundation of search systems with numerous irrelevant items that compete for attention in auctions, in addition to maintaining a healthy seller perception. In this work, we describe the shortcomings of training Advertiser keyphrase relevance filter models on click/sales/search relevance signals and the importance of aligning with human judgment, as sellers have the power to adopt or reject said keyphrase recommendations. In this study, we frame Advertiser keyphrase relevance as a complex interaction between 3 dynamical systems -- seller judgment, which influences seller adoption of our product, Advertising, which provides the keyphrases to bid on, and Search, who holds the auctions for the same keyphrases. This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.</description>

      <title>BroadGen: A Framework for Generating Effective and Efficient Advertiser Broad Match Keyphrase Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the domain of sponsored search advertising, the focus of Keyphrase recommendation has largely been on exact match types, which pose issues such as high management expenses, limited targeting scope, and evolving search query patterns. Alternatives like Broad match types can alleviate certain drawbacks of exact matches but present challenges like poor targeting accuracy and minimal supervisory signals owing to limited advertiser usage. This research defines the criteria for an ideal broad match, emphasizing on both efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that a significant portion of matched queries are relevant. We propose BroadGen, an innovative framework that recommends efficient and effective broad match keyphrases by utilizing historical search query data. Additionally, we demonstrate that BroadGen, through token correspondence modeling, maintains better query stability over time. BroadGen's capabilities allow it to serve daily, millions of sellers at eBay with over 2.3 billion items.</description>

      <title>DocMMIR: A Framework for Document Multi-modal Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of unsupervised representation learning and large-scale pre-trained vision-language models has significantly improved cross-modal retrieval tasks. However, existing multi-modal information retrieval (MMIR) studies lack a comprehensive exploration of document-level retrieval and suffer from the absence of cross-domain datasets at this granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce DocMMIR, a novel multi-modal document retrieval framework designed explicitly to unify diverse document formats and domains, including Wikipedia articles, scientific papers (arXiv), and presentation slides, within a comprehensive retrieval scenario. We construct a large-scale cross-domain multimodal benchmark, comprising 450K samples, which systematically integrates textual and visual information. Our comprehensive experimental analysis reveals substantial limitations in current state-of-the-art MLLMs (CLIP, BLIP2, SigLIP-2, ALIGN) when applied to our tasks, with only CLIP demonstrating reasonable zero-shot performance. Furthermore, we conduct a systematic investigation of training strategies, including cross-modal fusion methods and loss functions, and develop a tailored approach to train CLIP on our benchmark. This results in a +31% improvement in MRR@10 compared to the zero-shot baseline. All our data and code are released in https://github.com/J1mL1/DocMMIR.</description>

Abstract: Chunking is a crucial preprocessing step in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, significantly impacting retrieval effectiveness across diverse datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluate fixed-size chunking strategies and their influence on retrieval performance using multiple embedding models. Our experiments, conducted on both short-form and long-form datasets, reveal that chunk size plays a critical role in retrieval effectiveness -- smaller chunks (64-128 tokens) are optimal for datasets with concise, fact-based answers, whereas larger chunks (512-1024 tokens) improve retrieval in datasets requiring broader contextual understanding. We also analyze the impact of chunking on different embedding models, finding that they exhibit distinct chunking sensitivities. While models like Stella benefit from larger chunks, leveraging global context for long-range retrieval, Snowflake performs better with smaller chunks, excelling at fine-grained, entity-based matching. Our results underscore the trade-offs between chunk size, embedding models, and dataset characteristics, emphasizing the need for improved chunk quality measures, and more comprehensive datasets to advance chunk-based retrieval in long-document Information Retrieval (IR).</description>

      <title>Logical Consistency is Vital: Neural-Symbolic Information Retrieval for Negative-Constraint Queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information retrieval plays a crucial role in resource localization. Current dense retrievers retrieve the relevant documents within a corpus via embedding similarities, which compute similarities between dense vectors mainly depending on word co-occurrence between queries and documents, but overlook the real query intents.
  Thus, they often retrieve numerous irrelevant documents. Particularly in the scenarios of complex queries such as \emph{negative-constraint queries}, their retrieval performance could be catastrophic. To address the issue, we propose a neuro-symbolic information retrieval method, namely \textbf{NS-IR}, that leverages first-order logic (FOL) to optimize the embeddings of naive natural language by considering the \emph{logical consistency} between queries and documents. Specifically, we introduce two novel techniques, \emph{logic alignment} and \emph{connective constraint}, to rerank candidate documents, thereby enhancing retrieval relevance.
  Furthermore, we construct a new dataset \textbf{NegConstraint} including negative-constraint queries to evaluate our NS-IR's performance on such complex IR scenarios.
  Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NS-IR not only achieves superior zero-shot retrieval performance on web search and low-resource retrieval tasks, but also performs better on negative-constraint queries. Our scource code and dataset are available at https://github.com/xgl-git/NS-IR-main.</description>

      <title>Pre-training for Recommendation Unlearning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern recommender systems powered by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling complex user-item interactions, yet increasingly face scenarios requiring selective forgetting of training data. Beyond user requests to remove specific interactions due to privacy concerns or preference changes, regulatory frameworks mandate recommender systems' ability to eliminate the influence of certain user data from models. This recommendation unlearning challenge presents unique difficulties as removing connections within interaction graphs creates ripple effects throughout the model, potentially impacting recommendations for numerous users. Traditional approaches suffer from significant drawbacks: fragmentation methods damage graph structure and diminish performance, while influence function techniques make assumptions that may not hold in complex GNNs, particularly with self-supervised or random architectures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model-agnostic pre-training paradigm UnlearnRec that prepares systems for efficient unlearning operations. Our Influence Encoder takes unlearning requests together with existing model parameters and directly produces updated parameters of unlearned model with little fine-tuning, avoiding complete retraining while preserving model performance characteristics. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks demonstrates that our method delivers exceptional unlearning effectiveness while providing more than 10x speedup compared to retraining approaches. We release our method implementation at: https://github.com/HKUDS/UnlearnRec.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Large Language Models for Relevance Judgments in Legal Case Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining which legal cases are relevant to a given query involves navigating lengthy texts and applying nuanced legal reasoning. Traditionally, this task has demanded significant time and domain expertise to identify key Legal Facts and reach sound juridical conclusions. In addition, existing data with legal case similarities often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand the rationale behind relevance judgments. With the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun investigating their potential in this domain. Nonetheless, the method of employing a general large language model for reliable relevance judgments in legal case retrieval remains largely unexplored. To address this gap in research, we propose a novel few-shot approach where LLMs assist in generating expert-aligned interpretable relevance judgments. The proposed approach decomposes the judgment process into several stages, mimicking the workflow of human annotators and allowing for the flexible incorporation of expert reasoning to improve the accuracy of relevance judgments. Importantly, it also ensures interpretable data labeling, providing transparency and clarity in the relevance assessment process. Through a comparison of relevance judgments made by LLMs and human experts, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield reliable and valid relevance assessments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that with minimal expert supervision, our approach enables a large language model to acquire case analysis expertise and subsequently transfers this ability to a smaller model via annotation-based knowledge distillation.</description>

      <title>Argumentative Experience: Reducing Confirmation Bias on Controversial Issues through LLM-Generated Multi-Persona Debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04629v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are enabling designers to give life to exciting new user experiences for information access. In this work, we present a system that generates LLM personas to debate a topic of interest from different perspectives. How might information seekers use and benefit from such a system? Can centering information access around diverse viewpoints help to mitigate thorny challenges like confirmation bias in which information seekers over-trust search results matching existing beliefs? How do potential biases and hallucinations in LLMs play out alongside human users who are also fallible and possibly biased?
  Our study exposes participants to multiple viewpoints on controversial issues via a mixed-methods, within-subjects study. We use eye-tracking metrics to quantitatively assess cognitive engagement alongside qualitative feedback. Compared to a baseline search system, we see more creative interactions and diverse information-seeking with our multi-persona debate system, which more effectively reduces user confirmation bias and conviction toward their initial beliefs. Overall, our study contributes to the emerging design space of LLM-based information access systems, specifically investigating the potential of simulated personas to promote greater exposure to information diversity, emulate collective intelligence, and mitigate bias in information seeking.</description>

      <title>EXIT: Context-Aware Extractive Compression for Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce EXIT, an extractive context compression framework that enhances both the effectiveness and efficiency of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (QA). Current RAG systems often struggle when retrieval models fail to rank the most relevant documents, leading to the inclusion of more context at the expense of latency and accuracy. While abstractive compression methods can drastically reduce token counts, their token-by-token generation process significantly increases end-to-end latency. Conversely, existing extractive methods reduce latency but rely on independent, non-adaptive sentence selection, failing to fully utilize contextual information. EXIT addresses these limitations by classifying sentences from retrieved documents - while preserving their contextual dependencies - enabling parallelizable, context-aware extraction that adapts to query complexity and retrieval quality. Our evaluations on both single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks show that EXIT consistently surpasses existing compression methods and even uncompressed baselines in QA accuracy, while also delivering substantial reductions in inference time and token count. By improving both effectiveness and efficiency, EXIT provides a promising direction for developing scalable, high-quality QA solutions in RAG pipelines.

      <title>SimGRAG: Leveraging Similar Subgraphs for Knowledge Graphs Driven Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive versatility across various tasks. To eliminate their hallucinations, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach, leveraging external knowledge sources like knowledge graphs (KGs). In this paper, we study the task of KG-driven RAG and propose a novel Similar Graph Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SimGRAG) method. It effectively addresses the challenge of aligning query texts and KG structures through a two-stage process: (1) query-to-pattern, which uses an LLM to transform queries into a desired graph pattern, and (2) pattern-to-subgraph, which quantifies the alignment between the pattern and candidate subgraphs using a graph semantic distance (GSD) metric. We also develop an optimized retrieval algorithm that efficiently identifies the top-k subgraphs within 1-second on a 10-million-scale KG. Extensive experiments show that SimGRAG outperforms state-of-the-art KG-driven RAG methods in both question answering and fact verification.

      <title>VideoRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation over Video Corpus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful strategy for improving the factual accuracy of models by retrieving external knowledge relevant to queries and incorporating it into the generation process. However, existing approaches primarily focus on text, with some recent advancements considering images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal knowledge capable of representing contextual details more effectively than any other modality. While very recent studies explore the use of videos in response generation, they either predefine query-associated videos without retrieval or convert videos into textual descriptions losing multimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a framework that not only dynamically retrieves videos based on their relevance with queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information. The operation of VideoRAG is powered by recent Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable the direct processing of video content to represent it for retrieval and the seamless integration of retrieved videos jointly with queries for response generation. Also, inspired by that the context size of LVLMs may not be sufficient to process all frames in extremely long videos and not all frames are equally important, we introduce a video frame selection mechanism to extract the most informative subset of frames, along with a strategy to extract textual information from videos (as it can aid the understanding of video content) when their subtitles are not available. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of VideoRAG, showcasing that it is superior to relevant baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/starsuzi/VideoRAG.</description>

      <title>Decomposed Opinion Summarization with Verified Aspect-Aware Modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Opinion summarization plays a key role in deriving meaningful insights from large-scale online reviews. To make the process more explainable and grounded, we propose a domain-agnostic modular approach guided by review aspects (e.g., cleanliness for hotel reviews) which separates the tasks of aspect identification, opinion consolidation, and meta-review synthesis to enable greater transparency and ease of inspection. We conduct extensive experiments across datasets representing scientific research, business, and product domains. Results show that our approach generates more grounded summaries compared to strong baseline models, as verified through automated and human evaluations. Additionally, our modular approach, which incorporates reasoning based on review aspects, produces more informative intermediate outputs than other knowledge-agnostic decomposition approaches. Lastly, we provide empirical results to show that these intermediate outputs can support humans in summarizing opinions from large volumes of reviews.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Inverse Attention Network with Intrinsic Discriminant Feature Exploitation for Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection has garnered significant attention due to its profound implications for social security. While existing approaches have contributed to understanding cross-modal consistency, they often fail to leverage modal-specific representations and explicit discrepant features. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Inverse Attention Network (MIAN), a novel framework that explores intrinsic discriminative features based on news content to advance fake news detection. Specifically, MIAN introduces a hierarchical learning module that captures diverse intra-modal relationships through local-to-global and local-to-local interactions, thereby generating enhanced unimodal representations to improve the identification of fake news at the intra-modal level. Additionally, a cross-modal interaction module employs a co-attention mechanism to establish and model dependencies between the refined unimodal representations, facilitating seamless semantic integration across modalities. To explicitly extract inconsistency features, we propose an inverse attention mechanism that effectively highlights the conflicting patterns and semantic deviations introduced by fake news in both intra- and inter-modality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MIAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its pivotal contribution to advancing social security through enhanced multimodal fake news detection.</description>

      <title>SciHorizon: Benchmarking AI-for-Science Readiness from Scientific Data to Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has revolutionized the paradigm of scientific discovery, establishing AI-for-Science (AI4Science) as a dynamic and evolving field. However, there is still a lack of an effective framework for the overall assessment of AI4Science, particularly from a holistic perspective on data quality and model capability. Therefore, in this study, we propose SciHorizon, a comprehensive assessment framework designed to benchmark the readiness of AI4Science from both scientific data and LLM perspectives. First, we introduce a generalizable framework for assessing AI-ready scientific data, encompassing four key dimensions: Quality, FAIRness, Explainability, and Compliance-which are subdivided into 15 sub-dimensions. Drawing on data resource papers published between 2018 and 2023 in peer-reviewed journals, we present recommendation lists of AI-ready datasets for Earth, Life, and Materials Sciences, making a novel and original contribution to the field. Concurrently, to assess the capabilities of LLMs across multiple scientific disciplines, we establish 16 assessment dimensions based on five core indicators Knowledge, Understanding, Reasoning, Multimodality, and Values spanning Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Life Sciences, and Earth and Space Sciences. Using the developed benchmark datasets, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of over 50 representative open-source and closed source LLMs. All the results are publicly available and can be accessed online at www.scihorizon.cn/en.</description>

      <title>Burger: Robust Graph Denoising-augmentation Fusion and Multi-semantic Modeling in Social Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of rapid development of social media, social recommendation systems as hybrid recommendation systems have been widely applied. Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation. To address these issues, we introduce a social \underline{r}ecommendation model with ro\underline{bu}st g\underline{r}aph denoisin\underline{g}-augmentation fusion and multi-s\underline{e}mantic Modeling(Burger). Specifically, we firstly propose to construct a social tensor in order to smooth the training process of the model. Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration. Extensive experiments on three real datasets show Burger has a superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Multi-span Evolutionary Network against Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), as an extension of static Knowledge Graphs (KGs), incorporate the temporal feature to express the transience of knowledge by describing when facts occur. TKG extrapolation aims to infer possible future facts based on known history, which has garnered significant attention in recent years. Some existing methods treat TKG as a sequence of independent subgraphs to model temporal evolution patterns, demonstrating impressive reasoning performance. However, they still have limitations: 1) In modeling subgraph semantic evolution, they usually neglect the internal structural interactions between subgraphs, which are actually crucial for encoding TKGs. 2) They overlook the potential smooth features that do not lead to semantic changes, which should be distinguished from the semantic evolution process. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Multi-span Evolutionary Network (DiMNet) for TKG reasoning. Specifically, we design a multi-span evolution strategy that captures local neighbor features while perceiving historical neighbor semantic information, thus enabling internal interactions between subgraphs during the evolution process. To maximize the capture of semantic change patterns, we design a disentangle component that adaptively separates nodes' active and stable features, used to dynamically control the influence of historical semantics on future evolution. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world TKG datasets show that DiMNet demonstrates substantial performance in TKG reasoning, and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 22.7% in MRR.</description>

      <title>Agent-UniRAG: A Trainable Open-Source LLM Agent Framework for Unified Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for unified retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems using the recent emerging large language model (LLM) agent concept. Specifically, Agent LLM, which utilizes LLM as fundamental controllers, has become a promising approach to enable the interpretability of RAG tasks, especially for complex reasoning question-answering systems (e.g., multi-hop queries). Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B).
