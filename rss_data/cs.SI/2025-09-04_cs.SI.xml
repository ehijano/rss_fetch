      <title>On the Optimization of Methods for Establishing Well-Connected Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection plays a central role in uncovering meso scale structures in networks. However, existing methods often suffer from disconnected or weakly connected clusters, undermining interpretability and robustness. Well-Connected Clusters (WCC) and Connectivity Modifier (CM) algorithms are post-processing techniques that improve the accuracy of many clustering methods. However, they are computationally prohibitive on massive graphs. In this work, we present optimized parallel implementations of WCC and CM using the HPE Chapel programming language. First, we design fast and efficient parallel algorithms that leverage Chapel's parallel constructs to achieve substantial performance improvements and scalability on modern multicore architectures. Second, we integrate this software into Arkouda/Arachne, an open-source, high-performance framework for large-scale graph analytics. Our implementations uniquely enable well-connected community detection on massive graphs with more than 2 billion edges, providing a practical solution for connectivity-preserving clustering at web scale. For example, our implementations of WCC and CM enable community detection of the over 2-billion edge Open-Alex dataset in minutes using 128 cores, a result infeasible to compute previously.</description>

      <title>Contrastive clustering based on regular equivalence for influential node identification in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a fundamental task in network analysis with wide-ranging applications across domains. While deep learning has advanced node influence detection, existing supervised approaches remain constrained by their reliance on labeled data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where labels are scarce or unavailable. While contrastive learning demonstrates significant potential for performance enhancement, existing approaches predominantly rely on multiple-embedding generation to construct positive/negative sample pairs. To overcome these limitations, we propose ReCC (\textit{r}egular \textit{e}quivalence-based \textit{c}ontrastive \textit{c}lustering), a novel deep unsupervised framework for influential node identification. We first reformalize influential node identification as a label-free deep clustering problem, then develop a contrastive learning mechanism that leverages regular equivalence-based similarity, which captures structural similarities between nodes beyond local neighborhoods, to generate positive and negative samples. This mechanism is integrated into a graph convolutional network to learn node embeddings that are used to differentiate influential from non-influential nodes. ReCC is pre-trained using network reconstruction loss and fine-tuned with a combined contrastive and clustering loss, with both phases being independent of labeled data. Additionally, ReCC enhances node representations by combining structural metrics with regular equivalence-based similarities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCC outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Synthetic generation of online social networks through homophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online social networks (OSNs) have become increasingly relevant for studying social behavior and information diffusion. Nevertheless, they are limited by restricted access to real OSN data due to privacy, legal, and platform-related constraints. In response, synthetic social networks serve as a viable approach to support controlled experimentation, but current generators reproduce only topology and overlook attribute-driven homophily and semantic realism.
  This work proposes a homophily-based algorithm that produces synthetic microblogging social networks such as X. The model creates a social graph for a given number of users, integrating semantic affinity among user attributes, stochastic variation in link formation, triadic closure to foster clustering, and long-range connections to ensure global reachability. A systematic grid search is used to calibrate five hyperparameters (affinity strength, noise, closure probability, distant link probability, and candidate pool size) for reaching five structural values observed in real social networks (density, clustering coefficient, LCC proportion, normalized shortest path, and modularity).
  The framework is validated by generating synthetic OSNs at four scales (10^3-10^6 nodes), and benchmarking them against a real-world Bluesky network comprising 4 million users. Comparative results show that the framework reliably reproduces the structural properties of the real network. Overall, the framework outperforms leading importance-sampling techniques applied to the same baseline. The generated graphs capture topological realism and yield attribute-driven communities that align with sociological expectations, providing a realistic, scalable testbed that liberates social researchers from relying on live digital platforms.</description>

      <title>Predicting Movie Success with Multi-Task Learning: A Hybrid Framework Combining GPT-Based Sentiment Analysis and SIR Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a hybrid framework for predicting movie success. The framework integrates multi-task learning (MTL), GPT-based sentiment analysis, and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) propagation modeling. The study examines limitations in existing approaches. It models static production attributes, information dissemination, and audience sentiment at the same time. The framework uses 5,840 films from 2004 to 2024 and approximate 300,000 user reviews. It shows predictive performance with classification accuracy of 0.964 and regression metrics of MAE 0.388. Ablation analysis indicates component interactions. Selective feature combinations perform better than the comprehensive model. This result questions assumptions about feature integration. The model shows virality patterns between successful and unsuccessful films. Innovations include epidemiological modeling for information diffusion, multidimensional sentiment features from GPT-based analysis, and a shared representation architecture that optimizes multiple success metrics. The framework provides applications in the film production lifecycle. It also contributes to understanding how audience engagement leads to commercial outcomes.</description>

      <title>Temporal social network modeling of mobile connectivity data with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art data-driven tool for modeling connectivity data of graph-structured complex networks and integrating information of their nodes and edges in space and time. However, as of yet, the analysis of social networks using the time series of people's mobile connectivity data has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we investigate four snapshot - based temporal GNNs in predicting the phone call and SMS activity between users of a mobile communication network. In addition, we develop a simple non - GNN baseline model using recently proposed EdgeBank method. Our analysis shows that the ROLAND temporal GNN outperforms the baseline model in most cases, whereas the other three GNNs perform on average worse than the baseline. The results show that GNN based approaches hold promise in the analysis of temporal social networks through mobile connectivity data. However, due to the relatively small performance margin between ROLAND and the baseline model, further research is required on specialized GNN architectures for temporal social network analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the VQualA 2025 Challenge on Engagement Prediction for Short Videos, held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. The challenge focuses on understanding and modeling the popularity of user-generated content (UGC) short videos on social media platforms. To support this goal, the challenge uses a new short-form UGC dataset featuring engagement metrics derived from real-world user interactions. This objective of the Challenge is to promote robust modeling strategies that capture the complex factors influencing user engagement. Participants explored a variety of multi-modal features, including visual content, audio, and metadata provided by creators. The challenge attracted 97 participants and received 15 valid test submissions, contributing significantly to progress in short-form UGC video engagement prediction.</description>

      <title>Population-Scale Network Embeddings Expose Educational Divides in Network Structure Related to Right-Wing Populist Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Administrative registry data can be used to construct population-scale networks whose ties reflect shared social contexts between persons. With machine learning, such networks can be encoded into numerical representations -- embeddings -- that automatically capture individuals' position within the network. We created embeddings for all persons in the Dutch population from a population-scale network that represents five shared contexts: neighborhood, work, family, household, and school. To assess the informativeness of these embeddings, we used them to predict right-wing populist voting. Embeddings alone predicted right-wing populist voting above chance-level but performed worse than individual characteristics. Combining the best subset of embeddings with individual characteristics only slightly improved predictions. After transforming the embeddings to make their dimensions more sparse and orthogonal, we found that one embedding dimension was strongly associated with the outcome. Mapping this dimension back to the population network revealed differences in network structure related to right-wing populist voting between different school ties and achieved education levels. Our study contributes methodologically by demonstrating how population-scale network embeddings can be made interpretable, and substantively by linking structural network differences in education to right-wing populist voting.</description>

      <title>Predict, Cluster, Refine: A Joint Embedding Predictive Self-Supervised Framework for Graph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01684v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph representation learning has emerged as a cornerstone for tasks like node classification and link prediction, yet prevailing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods face challenges such as computational inefficiency, reliance on contrastive objectives, and representation collapse. Existing approaches often depend on feature reconstruction, negative sampling, or complex decoders, which introduce training overhead and hinder generalization. Further, current techniques which address such limitations fail to account for the contribution of node embeddings to a certain prediction in the absence of labeled nodes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel joint embedding predictive framework for graph SSL that eliminates contrastive objectives and negative sampling while preserving semantic and structural information. Additionally, we introduce a semantic-aware objective term that incorporates pseudo-labels derived from Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), enhancing node discriminability by evaluating latent feature contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art graph SSL methods across benchmarks, achieving superior performance without contrastive loss or complex decoders. Key innovations include (1) a non-contrastive, view-invariant joint embedding predictive architecture, (2) Leveraging single context and multiple targets relationship between subgraphs, and (3) GMM-based pseudo-label scoring to capture semantic contributions. This work advances graph SSL by offering a computationally efficient, collapse-resistant paradigm that bridges spatial and semantic graph features for downstream tasks.

      <title>Unsupervised Learning of Local Updates for Maximum Independent Set in Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first unsupervised learning model for finding Maximum Independent Sets (MaxIS) in dynamic graphs where edges change over time. Our method combines structural learning from graph neural networks (GNNs) with a learned distributed update mechanism that, given an edge addition or deletion event, modifies nodes' internal memories and infers their MaxIS membership in a single, parallel step. We parameterize our model by the update mechanism's radius and investigate the resulting performance-runtime tradeoffs for various dynamic graph topologies. We evaluate our model against a mixed integer programming solver and the state-of-the-art learning-based methods for MaxIS on static graphs (ICML 2020; NeurIPS 2020, 2023). Across synthetic and empirical dynamic graphs of 50-1,000 nodes, our model achieves competitive approximation ratios with excellent scalability; on large graphs, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning methods in solution quality, runtime, and memory usage. When generalizing to graphs of 10,000 nodes (100x larger than the ones used for training), our model produces MaxIS solutions 1.05-1.18x larger than any other learning method, even while maintaining competitive runtimes.</description>
