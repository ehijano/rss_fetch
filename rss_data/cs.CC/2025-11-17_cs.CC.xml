      <title>On the Dynamics of Bounded-Degree Automata Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automata networks can be seen as bare finite dynamical systems, but their growing theory has shown the importance of the underlying communication graph of such networks. This paper tackles the question of what dynamics can be realized up to isomorphism if we suppose that the communication graph has bounded degree. We prove several negative results about parameters like the number of fixed points or the rank. We also show that we can realize with degree 2 a dynamics made of a single fixed point and a cycle gathering all other configurations. However, we leave open the embarrassingly simple question of whether a dynamics consisting of a single cycle can be realized with bounded degree, although we prove that it is impossible when the network become acyclic by suppressing one node, and that realizing precisely a Gray code map is impossible with bounded degree. Finally we give bounds on the complexity of the problem of recognizing such dynamics.</description>

      <title>Parameterized complexity of the f-Critical Set problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a function $f:V(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$, an $f$-reversible process on $G$ is a dynamical system such that, given an initial vertex labeling $c_0 : V(G) \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, every vertex $v$ changes its label if and only if it has at least $f(v)$ neighbors with the opposite label. The updates occur synchronously in discrete time steps $t=0,1,2,\ldots$. An $f$-critical set of $G$ is a subset of vertices of $G$ whose initial label is $1$ such that, in an $f$-reversible process on $G$, all vertices reach label $1$ within one time step and then remain unchanged. The critical set number $r^c_f(G)$ is the minimum size of an $f$-critical set of $G$. Given a graph $G$, a threshold function $f$, and an integer $k$, the $f$-Critical Set problem asks whether $r^c_f(G) \leq k$. We prove that this problem is NP-complete for planar subcubic bipartite graphs and $m(f) \leq 2$, where $m(f)$ is the largest value of $f(v)$ over all $v \in V(G)$, and is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the treewidth $tw(G)$ of $G$. Additionally, we show that the problem is in FPT when parameterized by $tw(G)+m(f)$, $tw(G)+\Delta(G)$, and $k$, where $\Delta(G)$ denotes the maximum degree of a vertex in $G$. Finally, we present two kernels of sizes $O(k \cdot m(f))$ and $O(k \cdot \Delta(G))$.</description>

      <title>Structure-Aware Encodings of Argumentation Properties for Clique-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.</description>

      <title>A number-theoretic conjecture implying faster algorithms for polynomial factorization and integer factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fastest known algorithm for factoring a degree $n$ univariate polynomial over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ runs in time $O(n^{3/2 + o(1)}\text{polylog } q)$, and there is a reason to believe that the $3/2$ exponent represents a ''barrier'' inherent in algorithms that employ a so-called baby-steps-giant-steps strategy. In this paper, we propose a new strategy with the potential to overcome the $3/2$ barrier. In doing so we are led to a number-theoretic conjecture, one form of which is that there are sets $S, T$ of cardinality $n^\beta$, consisting of positive integers of magnitude at most $\exp(n^\alpha)$, such that every integer $i \in [n]$ divides $s-t$ for some $s \in S, t \in T$. Achieving $\alpha + \beta \le 1 + o(1)$ is trivial; we show that achieving $\alpha, \beta &lt; 1/2$ (together with an assumption that $S, T$ are structured) implies an improvement to the exponent 3/2 for univariate polynomial factorization. Achieving $\alpha = \beta = 1/3$ is best-possible and would imply an exponent 4/3 algorithm for univariate polynomial factorization. Interestingly, a second consequence would be a reduction of the current-best exponent for deterministic (exponential) algorithms for factoring integers, from $1/5$ to $1/6$.</description>

      <title>Fast polynomial computations with space constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The works presented in this habilitation concern the algorithmics of polynomials. This is a central topic in computer algebra, with numerous applications both within and outside the field - cryptography, error-correcting codes, etc. For many problems, extremely efficient algorithms have been developed since the 1960s. Here, we are interested in how this efficiency is affected when space constraints are introduced.
  The first part focuses on the time-space complexity of fundamental polynomial computations - multiplication, division, interpolation, ... While naive algorithms typically have constant space complexity, fast algorithms generally require linear space. We develop algorithms that are both time- and space-efficient. This leads us to discuss and refine definitions of space complexity for function computation.
  In the second part, the space constraints are put on the inputs and outputs. Algorithms for polynomials assume in general a dense representation for the polynomials, that is storing the full list of coefficients. In contrast, we work with sparse polynomials, in which most coefficients vanish. In particular, we describe the first quasi-linear algorithm for sparse interpolation, which plays a role analogous to the Fast Fourier Transform in the sparse settings. We also explore computationally hard problems concerning divisibility and factorization of sparse polynomials.</description>

      <title>Arity hierarchies for quantifiers closed under partial polymorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the expressive power of generalized quantifiers closed under partial polymorphism conditions motivated by the study of constraint satisfaction problems. We answer a number of questions arising from the work of Dawar and Hella (CSL 2024) where such quantifiers were introduced. For quantifiers closed under partial near-unanimity polymorphisms, we establish hierarchy results clarifying the interplay between the arity of the polymorphisms and of the quantifiers: The expressive power of $(\ell+1)$-ary quantifiers closed under $\ell$-ary partial near-unanimity polymorphisms is strictly between the class of all quantifiers of arity $\ell-1$ and $\ell$. We also establish an infinite hierarchy based on the arity of quantifiers with a fixed arity of partial near-unanimity polymorphisms. Finally, we prove inexpressiveness results for quantifiers with a partial Maltsev polymorphism. The separation results are proved using novel algebraic constructions in the style of Cai-F\"urer-Immerman and the quantifier pebble games of Dawar and Hella (2024).</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{TIME}[t]\subseteq \mathrm{SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$ via Tree Height Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a square-root space simulation for deterministic multitape Turing machines, showing $\mathrm{TIME}[t]\subseteq \mathrm{SPACE}[O(\sqrt{t})]$ \emph{measured in tape cells over a fixed finite alphabet}. The key step is a Height Compression Theorem that uniformly (and in logspace) reshapes the canonical left-deep succinct computation tree for a block-respecting run into a binary tree whose evaluation-stack depth along any DFS path is $O(\log T)$ for $T=\lceil t/b\rceil$, while preserving $O(b)$ workspace at leaves and $O(1)$ at internal nodes. Edges have \emph{addressing/topology} checkable in $O(\log t)$ space, and \emph{semantic} correctness across merges is witnessed by an exact $O(b)$ bounded-window replay at the unique interface. Algorithmically, an Algebraic Replay Engine with constant-degree maps over a constant-size field, together with pointerless DFS, index-free streaming, and a \emph{rolling boundary buffer that prevents accumulation of leaf summaries}, ensures constant-size per-level tokens and eliminates wide counters, yielding the additive tradeoff $S(b)=O(b+t/b)$. Choosing $b=\Theta(\sqrt{t})$ gives $O(\sqrt{t})$ space with no residual multiplicative polylog factors. The construction is uniform, relativizes, and is robust to standard model choices. Consequences include branching-program upper bounds $2^{O(\sqrt{s})}$ for size-$s$ bounded-fan-in circuits, tightened quadratic-time lower bounds for $\mathrm{SPACE}[n]$-complete problems via the standard hierarchy argument, and $O(\sqrt{t})$-space certifying interpreters; under explicit locality assumptions, the framework extends to geometric $d$-dimensional models. Conceptually, the work isolates path bookkeeping as the chief obstruction to $O(\sqrt{t})$ and removes it via structural height compression with per-path analysis rather than barrier-prone techniques.</description>
