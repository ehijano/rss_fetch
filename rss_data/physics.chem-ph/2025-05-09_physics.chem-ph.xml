      <title>Enhanced Biogas Production via Anaerobic Co-Digestion of Slaughterhouse and Food Waste Using Ferric Oxide as a Sustainable Conductive Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anaerobic co-digestion of slaughterhouse wastewater and food waste offers a sustainable approach to waste treatment and biogas production. However, limited literature was found on the study of ferric oxide as conductive material in co-digestion of the two substrates. This study evaluates the effect of ferric oxide on biogas yield, organic matter removal, and kinetics of anaerobic co-digestion. Five batch tests were performed: four with varying ferric oxide doses and one control. Results showed that ferric oxide significantly enhanced total solids (TS) and volatile solids (VS) reduction. The reactor with 0.5 g ferric oxide per 800 mL working volume achieved the highest TS and VS reduction, corresponding to the maximum methane yield of 9878.95 L methane per kg volatile solid. At this optimal dosage, biogas production increased by 81 percent compared to the control. However, further increases in ferric oxide above the optimal dosage concentration decreases biogas yield, indicating a threshold beyond which inhibitory effects occur. In addition, at this optimal dosage, reduction in BOD and COD was observed due to enhanced microbial activity. Furthermore, ferric oxide stabilizes anaerobic digestion by mitigating inhibitory compounds and promoting direct interspecies electron transfer, leading to improved methane yield. Kinetic modeling using the Logistic Function accurately predicted methane production trends, demonstrating its potential for industrial-scale application. Overall, the study confirms that ferric oxide at an optimal dose significantly enhance biogas yield and system performance during the anaerobic co-digestion.</description>

      <title>Elucidating Ion Capture and Transport Mechanisms of Preyssler Anions in Aqueous Solutions Using Biased MACE-Accelerated MD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium and biased MACE accelerated MD simulations in aqueous solutions are performed to investigate the ion capture and transport mechanisms of the {P5W30} Preyssler anion (PA) as the smallest representative member of the extended polyoxometalate (POM) family with an internal cavity. The unique interatomic interactions present in the internal cavity vs. exterior of PA are carefully investigated using equilibrium MACE MD simulations for two representative Na(H2O)@PA and Na@PA complexes. Our careful analyses of radial distribution functions and coordination numbers show that the presence of confined water in Na(H2O)@PA has profound modulating effects on the nature of the interactions of the encapsulated ion with the oxygens of the PA cavity. Using well-converged MACE-accelerated multiple walker well-tempered metadynamics simulations, two different associative and dissociative ion transport mechanisms were carefully investigated for Na+ as one of the most abundant and representative ions present in seawater and saline solutions. By comparing systems with and without confined water, it was found that the presence of only one pre-encapsulated confined water in Na(H2O)@PA dramatically changes the free energy landscape of ion transport processes. It was also found that the contraction and dilation of the two windows present in PA directly influence the Na+ and H2O transport. Results from this work are helpful as they show a viable path toward tuning the ion exchange and transport phenomena in aqueous solutions of POM molecular clusters and frameworks.</description>

      <title>Depth profiling the elemental composition with negative muons: Monte Carlo based tools for improved data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gildings, patinas and alteration crusts are common features of many heritage artefacts, especially for metals. Their size depends on many factors, like the manufacturing method for gildings or the conservation state for alteration crusts: in some cases, it can be in the scale of the tens of microns. Such thickness would be difficult to investigate with classical non-destructive methods and would prevent getting information from the bulk of the sample. This work proposes an innovative approach for the study of multi-layered materials with the Muonic atom X-ray Emission Spectroscopy technique ({\mu}-XES). Based on the detection of the high-energy X-rays emitted after the muon capture by the atom, this method is characterised by a remarkable penetration depth (from microns to cm). From the surface to the bulk, this technique can evaluate the variation of the elemental composition as a function of depth. The paper focuses on providing an improved interpretation of {\mu}-XES data by coupling the analysis with the use of two Monte Carlo simulation software, GEANT4/ARBY and SRIM/TRIM. With these two software, it is possible to replicate the negative muon experiments and compare the experimental and simulated outputs to address the size of a given layer. To validate this approach, a set of standard gilded bronze and brass foils were measured at the ISIS Neutron and Muon source. From simulations, it was possible to evaluate the thickness of the superficial gold layer, with results in agreement with the preliminary SEM characterisation of the samples.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Coupled-Cluster Theory of Multireference Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a coupled-cluster theory for the propagation of multireference electronic systems initiating at general quantum mechanical states. Our formalism is based on the infinitesimal analysis of modified cluster operators, from which we extract a set of additional operators and their equations of motion. These cluster operators then can be used to compute electronic properties of interest in a size extensive manner. The equations derived herein are also studied for the free propagation of linear superpositions. In this regime, we derive asymmetric matrix elements for observables, and a resymmetrization factor so they become consistent with their quantum mechanical counterparts. Our formalism is applied to a four-electron/four-level model with a Hubbard-like Hamiltonian, where we show that it reproduces the numerically exact results for observables, populations, and coherences.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic ring-polymer instanton rate theory: a generalised dividing-surface approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing an accurate approximation to nonadiabatic rate theory which is valid for arbitrary values of the electronic coupling has been a long-standing challenge in theoretical chemistry. Ring-polymer instanton theories offer a very promising approach to solve this problem, since they can be rigorously derived using semiclassical approximations and can capture nuclear quantum effects such as tunnelling and zero-point energy at a cost similar to that of a classical calculation. A successful instanton rate theory already exists within the Born--Oppenheimer approximation, for which the optimal tunnelling pathway is located on a single adiabatic surface. A related instanton theory has also been developed for nonadiabatic reactions using two weakly-coupled diabatic surfaces within the framework of Fermi's golden rule. However, many chemical reactions do not satisfy the conditions of either limit. By employing a tunable dividing surface which measures the flux both along nuclear coordinates as well as between electronic states, we develop a generalised nonadiabatic instanton rate theory that bridges between these two limits. The resulting theory approximates the quantum-mechanically exact rates well for the systems studied and, in addition, offers a novel mechanistic perspective on nonadiabatic reactions.</description>

      <title>Electron attachment to nitric oxide (NO) controversy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report novel total electron scattering cross sections (TCS) from nitric oxide (NO) in the impact energy range from 1 to 15 eV by using a magnetically confined electron transmission apparatus. The accuracy of the data to within 5% and its consistency across the energy range investigated, shows significant discrepancies from previous works as to the major resonance features and magnitude of the TCS. Within the shape of the TCS, we have identified nine features which have been assigned to electron attachment resonances, most of them reported for the first time, while a comprehensive analysis of those peaking at 7.0, 7.8, and 8.8 eV has led to solve the controversy about dissociative electron attachment (DEA) cross-section that persisted for more than 50 years.</description>

      <title>Simulating electronic coherences induced by conical intersections using MASH: Application to attosecond X-ray spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we employ trajectory-based simulations to predict the electronic coherences created by nonadiabatic dynamics near conical intersections. The mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH) is compared with standard fewest-switches surface hopping on three model systems, for which the full quantum-mechanical results are available. Electronic populations and coherences in the adiabatic representation as well as nuclear densities are computed to assess the robustness of the different methods. The results show that standard surface hopping can fail to describe the electronic coherences, whereas they are accurately captured by MASH for the same computational cost. In this way, MASH appears to be an excellent simulation approach for novel X-ray spectroscopies such as the recently proposed Transient Redistribution of Ultrafast Electronic Coherences in Attosecond Raman Signals (TRUECARS).</description>

      <title>Representing spherical tensors with scalar-based machine-learning models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotational symmetry plays a central role in physics, providing an elegant framework to describe how the properties of 3D objects -- from atoms to the macroscopic scale -- transform under the action of rigid rotations. Equivariant models of 3D point clouds are able to approximate structure-property relations in a way that is fully consistent with the structure of the rotation group, by combining intermediate representations that are themselves spherical tensors. The symmetry constraints however make this approach computationally demanding and cumbersome to implement, which motivates increasingly popular unconstrained architectures that learn approximate symmetries as part of the training process. In this work, we explore a third route to tackle this learning problem, where equivariant functions are expressed as the product of a scalar function of the point cloud coordinates and a small basis of tensors with the appropriate symmetry. We also propose approximations of the general expressions that, while lacking universal approximation properties, are fast, simple to implement, and accurate in practical settings.</description>

      <title>Frequency Synchronization Induced by Frequency Detuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely held that identical systems tend to behave similarly under comparable conditions. Yet, for systems that interact through a network, symmetry breaking can lead to scenarios in which this expectation does not hold. Prominent examples are chimera states in multistable phase-oscillator networks. Here, we show that for a broad class of such networks, asynchronous states can be converted into frequency-synchronized states when identical oscillators are detuned to have different intrinsic frequencies. Importantly, we show that frequency synchronization is achieved over a range of intrinsic frequency detuning and is thus a robust effect. These results, which are supported by theory, simulations, and electrochemical oscillator experiments, reveal a counterintuitive opportunity to use parameter heterogeneity to promote synchronization.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Variational Quantum Eigensolver Applied to Chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics has introduced a new theoretical framework for the study of molecules, enabling the prediction of properties and dynamics through the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation applied to these systems. However, solving this equation is computationally expensive, which has led to the development of various mathematical frameworks and computational methods designed to balance the available resources with the desired level of accuracy. In particular, quantum computers have emerged as a promising technology with the potential to address these problems more efficiently in the coming decades, whether through reductions in memory, time, and energy consumption, $\textit{i. e.}$, reductions in computational complexity or by enhancing precision. This research field is known as Quantum Simulation. Given the current technological limitations of quantum computers, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), especially the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), stand out as a feasible approach to demonstrating advantages over classical methods in the near term. This feasibility arises from their lower demand for quantum gates and the reduced depth of the circuits required for their implementation. In this work, we present the application of quantum mechanics to the study of molecules, provide an introduction to the fundamentals of quantum computing, and explore the integration of these fields by employing the VQE in molecular simulations. Finally, we discuss the spatial and temporal complexity associated with the algorithm, highlighting its implications and challenges.</description>

      <title>Peak Broadening in Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Amorphous Polymers: the Leading Role of the Electrostatic Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The broadening in photoelectron spectra of polymers can be attributed to several factors, such as light source spread, spectrometer resolution, finite lifetime of the hole state, and solid-state effects. Here, for the first time, we set up a computational protocol to assess the peak broadening induced for both core and valence levels by solid-state effects in four amorphous polymers by using a combination of density functional theory, many-body perturbation theory, and classical polarizable embedding. We show that intrinsic local inhomogeneities in the electrostatic environment induce a Gaussian broadening of $0.2$-$0.7$~eV in the binding energies of both core and semi-valence electrons, corresponding to a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $0.5$-$1.7$~eV for the investigated systems. The induced broadening is larger in acrylate- than in styrene- based polymers, revealing the crucial role of polar groups in controlling the roughness of the electrostatic landscape in the solid matrix.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Law of Polymer Chains into Flexible Polymer Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equilibrium partitioning of linear polymer chains into flexible polymer networks is governed by intricate entropic constraints arising from configurational degrees of freedom of both chains and network, yet a quantitative understanding remains elusive. Using model hydrogels with precisely defined network structures, we experimentally reveal a universal law governing linear polymer partitioning into flexible polymer networks. We establish a novel label-free, contactless method to measure partition ratio, based on the increase in osmotic pressure induced by external polymer chains partitioning into the network. Moreover, we find a universal law in which the partition constant is solely determined by the squared ratio $(R_g / l_\mathrm{cycle})^2$, where $R_g$ is the gyration radius of the polymer chain and $l_\mathrm{cycle}$ is the characteristic mesh size of the network, as defined by the cycle length.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI) methods (also known as Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD) have emerged as promising near-term approaches to solving the electronic Schr{\"o}dinger equation with quantum computers. In this work, we perform numerical analysis to show that QSCI methods face critical limitations that severely hinder their practical applicability in chemistry. Using the nitrogen molecule and the iron-sulfur cluster [2Fe-2S] as examples, we demonstrate that while QSCI can, in principle, yield high-quality CI expansions similar to classical SCI heuristics in some cases, the method struggles with inefficiencies in finding new determinants as sampling repeatedly selects already seen configurations. This inefficiency becomes especially pronounced when targeting high-accuracy results or sampling from an approximate ansatz. In cases where the sampling problem is not present, the resulting CI expansions are less compact than those generated from classical heuristics, rendering QSCI an overall more expensive method. Our findings suggest a significant drawback in QSCI methods when sampling from the ground-state distribution as the inescapable trade-off between finding sufficiently many determinants and generating compact, accurate CI expansions. This ultimately hinders utility in quantum chemistry applications, as QSCI falls behind more efficient classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16381v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP) generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300 atoms.</description>

Abstract: Commercially used carbonate-based electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries are susceptible to many challenges, including flammability, volatility, and lower thermal stability. Solvated ionic liquids of LiTFSI salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-amide) and glyme-based solvents are potential alternative candidates for commonly used electrolytes. We perform classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the effect of concentration and temperature on the translational and rotational dynamics. The radial distribution function shows stronger coordination of Li$^+$ ions with tetraglyme(G4), as shown in earlier studies, and forms a stable [Li(G4)]$^+$ cation complex. The self-diffusion coefficients are lower than the values experimentally observed but show better improvement over other classical force fields. An increase in the salt concentrations leads to a higher viscosity of the system and reduces the overall ionic mobility of Li$^{+}$ ions. Diluting the system with a larger number of glyme molecules leads to shorter rotational relaxation times for both TFSI and tetraglyme. Ion-residence times show that Li$^+$ ions form stable and long-lasting complexes with G4 molecules than TFSI anions. The residence time of [Li(G4)]$^+$ complex increases at higher salt concentrations due to the availability of fewer G4 molecules to coordinate with a Li$^+$ ion. G4 is also seen to form polydentate complexes with Li$^+$ without a shared coordination, allowing rotation without breaking coordination, unlike TFSI, which requires coordination disruption for rotation. This distinction explains the poor correlation between rotation and residence time for G4 and the strong correlation for TFSI.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Electrochemical Limits Preceding Dendrite Penetration in Ceramic Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state electrolytes have the potential to stabilize lithium metal anodes, which hold the promise to increase the energy density of lithium-ion batteries. However, lithium metal dendrites that occur locally at the solid-solid interface plague the solid-state lithium metal cells during charging, limiting the cycle life, and rendering high safety risks in practical applications. While multiple explanations have been proposed, understandings of the dynamics preceding and causing the metal penetration in solid electrolytes are still not conclusive. Here, by testing many highly consistent Ta-doped Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZTO) samples and utilizing an improved operando technique on symmetrical cells, we observed a consistent and statistically significant trend of current-dependent dendrite initiation time, which coincides with the Sand's time scaling in liquid electrolytes. This new understanding offers an electrochemical origin of dendritic initiation but also provides future insight into optimal all-solid-state battery design.</description>
