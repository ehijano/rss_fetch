      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting key information from documents represents a large portion of business workloads and therefore offers a high potential for efficiency improvements and process automation. With recent advances in deep learning, a plethora of deep learning-based approaches for Key Information Extraction have been proposed under the umbrella term Document Understanding that enable the processing of complex business documents. The goal of this systematic literature review is an in-depth analysis of existing approaches in this domain and the identification of opportunities for further research. To this end, 96 approaches published between 2017 and 2023 are analyzed in this study.</description>

      <title>Modality-Balanced Learning for Multimedia Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many recommender models have been proposed to investigate how to incorporate multimodal content information into traditional collaborative filtering framework effectively. The use of multimodal information is expected to provide more comprehensive information and lead to superior performance. However, the integration of multiple modalities often encounters the modal imbalance problem: since the information in different modalities is unbalanced, optimizing the same objective across all modalities leads to the under-optimization problem of the weak modalities with a slower convergence rate or lower performance. Even worse, we find that in multimodal recommendation models, all modalities suffer from the problem of insufficient optimization. To address these issues, we propose a Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation method that could solve the imbalance problem and make the best use of all modalities. Through modality-specific knowledge distillation, it could guide the multimodal model to learn modality-specific knowledge from uni-modal teachers. We also design a novel generic-and-specific distillation loss to guide the multimodal student to learn wider-and-deeper knowledge from teachers. Additionally, to adaptively recalibrate the focus of the multimodal model towards weaker modalities during training, we estimate the causal effect of each modality on the training objective using counterfactual inference techniques, through which we could determine the weak modalities, quantify the imbalance degree and re-weight the distillation loss accordingly. Our method could serve as a plug-and-play module for both late-fusion and early-fusion backbones. Extensive experiments on six backbones show that our proposed method can improve the performance by a large margin.

      <title>Prompt Tuning as User Inherent Profile Inference Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited significant promise in recommender systems by empowering user profiles with their extensive world knowledge and superior reasoning capabilities. However, LLMs face challenges like unstable instruction compliance, modality gaps, and high inference latency, leading to textual noise and limiting their effectiveness in recommender systems. To address these challenges, we propose UserIP-Tuning, which uses prompt-tuning to infer user profiles. It integrates the causal relationship between user profiles and behavior sequences into LLMs' prompts. And employs expectation maximization to infer the embedded latent profile, minimizing textual noise by fixing the prompt template. Furthermore, A profile quantization codebook bridges the modality gap by categorizing profile embeddings into collaborative IDs, which are pre-stored for online deployment. This improves time efficiency and reduces memory usage. Experiments on four public datasets show that UserIP-Tuning outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. Additional tests and case studies confirm its effectiveness, robustness, and transferability.</description>

      <title>BMX: Entropy-weighted Similarity and Semantic-enhanced Lexical Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BM25, a widely-used lexical search algorithm, remains crucial in information retrieval despite the rise of pre-trained and large language models (PLMs/LLMs). However, it neglects query-document similarity and lacks semantic understanding, limiting its performance. We revisit BM25 and introduce BMX, a novel extension of BM25 incorporating entropy-weighted similarity and semantic enhancement techniques. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BMX consistently outperforms traditional BM25 and surpasses PLM/LLM-based dense retrieval in long-context and real-world retrieval benchmarks. This study bridges the gap between classical lexical search and modern semantic approaches, offering a promising direction for future information retrieval research. The reference implementation of BMX can be found in Baguetter, which was created in the context of this work. The code can be found here: https://github.com/mixedbread-ai/baguetter.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Structured Neural Network for Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR) is a crucial component of the retrieval stage in (Ads) Recommendation System that utilizes Two Tower or Siamese Networks to learn embeddings for both users and items (ads). It then employs an Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANN) to efficiently retrieve the most relevant ads for a specific user. Despite the recent rise to popularity in the industry, they have a couple of limitations. Firstly, Two Tower model architecture uses a single dot product interaction which despite their efficiency fail to capture the data distribution in practice. Secondly, the centroid representation and cluster assignment, which are components of ANN, occur after the training process has been completed. As a result, they do not take into account the optimization criteria used for retrieval model. In this paper, we present Hierarchical Structured Neural Network (HSNN), a deployed jointly optimized hierarchical clustering and neural network model that can take advantage of sophisticated interactions and model architectures that are more common in the ranking stages while maintaining a sub-linear inference cost. We achieve 6.5% improvement in offline evaluation and also demonstrate 1.22% online gains through A/B experiments. HSNN has been successfully deployed into the Ads Recommendation system and is currently handling major portion of the traffic. The paper shares our experience in developing this system, dealing with challenges like freshness, volatility, cold start recommendations, cluster collapse and lessons deploying the model in a large scale retrieval production system.</description>

      <title>Reformulating Conversational Recommender Systems as Tri-Phase Offline Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) predominantly utilize user simulators for training and evaluating recommendation policies. These simulators often oversimplify the complexity of user interactions by focusing solely on static item attributes, neglecting the rich, evolving preferences that characterize real-world user behavior. This limitation frequently leads to models that perform well in simulated environments but falter in actual deployment. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces the Tri-Phase Offline Policy Learning-based Conversational Recommender System (TPCRS), which significantly reduces dependency on real-time interactions and mitigates overfitting issues prevalent in traditional approaches. TPCRS integrates a model-based offline learning strategy with a controllable user simulation that dynamically aligns with both personalized and evolving user preferences. Through comprehensive experiments, TPCRS demonstrates enhanced robustness, adaptability, and accuracy in recommendations, outperforming traditional CRS models in diverse user scenarios. This approach not only provides a more realistic evaluation environment but also facilitates a deeper understanding of user behavior dynamics, thereby refining the recommendation process.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model for Slate Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slate recommendation is a technique commonly used on streaming platforms and e-commerce sites to present multiple items together. A significant challenge with slate recommendation is managing the complex combinatorial choice space. Traditional methods often simplify this problem by assuming users engage with only one item at a time. However, this simplification does not reflect the reality, as users often interact with multiple items simultaneously. In this paper, we address the general slate recommendation problem, which accounts for simultaneous engagement with multiple items. We propose a generative approach using Diffusion Models, leveraging their ability to learn structures in high-dimensional data. Our model generates high-quality slates that maximize user satisfaction by overcoming the challenges of the combinatorial choice space. Furthermore, our approach enhances the diversity of recommendations. Extensive offline evaluations on applications such as music playlist generation and e-commerce bundle recommendations show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both relevance and diversity.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and Political Bias of News Source Credibility Ratings by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00228v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search engines increasingly leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate direct answers, and AI chatbots now access the Internet for fresh data. As information curators for billions of users, LLMs must assess the accuracy and reliability of different sources. This paper audits eight widely used LLMs from three major providers -- OpenAI, Google, and Meta -- to evaluate their ability to discern credible and high-quality information sources from low-credibility ones. We find that while LLMs can rate most tested news outlets, larger models more frequently refuse to provide ratings due to insufficient information, whereas smaller models are more prone to hallucination in their ratings. For sources where ratings are provided, LLMs exhibit a high level of agreement among themselves (average Spearman's $\rho = 0.81$), but their ratings align only moderately with human expert evaluations (average $\rho = 0.59$). Analyzing news sources with different political leanings in the US, we observe a liberal bias in credibility ratings yielded by all LLMs in default configurations. Additionally, assigning partisan identities to LLMs consistently results in strong politically congruent bias in the ratings. These findings have important implications for the use of LLMs in curating news and political information.</description>

      <title>Learned Ranking Function: From Short-term Behavior Predictions to Long-term User Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Learned Ranking Function (LRF), a system that takes short-term user-item behavior predictions as input and outputs a slate of recommendations that directly optimizes for long-term user satisfaction. Most previous work is based on optimizing the hyperparameters of a heuristic function. We propose to model the problem directly as a slate optimization problem with the objective of maximizing long-term user satisfaction. We also develop a novel constraint optimization algorithm that stabilizes objective trade-offs for multi-objective optimization. We evaluate our approach with live experiments and describe its deployment on YouTube.</description>

      <title>Generalized knowledge-enhanced framework for biomedical entity and relation extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been an increasing number of frameworks developed for biomedical entity and relation extraction. This research effort aims to address the accelerating growth in biomedical publications and the intricate nature of biomedical texts, which are written for mainly domain experts. To handle these challenges, we develop a novel framework that utilizes external knowledge to construct a task-independent and reusable background knowledge graph for biomedical entity and relation extraction. The design of our model is inspired by how humans learn domain-specific topics. In particular, humans often first acquire the most basic and common knowledge regarding a field to build the foundational knowledge and then use that as a basis for extending to various specialized topics. Our framework employs such common-knowledge-sharing mechanism to build a general neural-network knowledge graph that is learning transferable to different domain-specific biomedical texts effectively. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model, equipped with this generalized and cross-transferable knowledge base, achieves competitive performance benchmarks, including BioRelEx for binding interaction detection and ADE for Adverse Drug Effect identification.</description>

      <title>TableGuard -- Securing Structured &amp; Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for data sharing across platforms and organizations, ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive information has become a critical challenge. This paper introduces "TableGuard". An innovative approach to data obfuscation tailored for relational databases. Building on the principles and techniques developed in prior work on context-sensitive obfuscation, TableGuard applies these methods to ensure that API calls return only obfuscated data, thereby safeguarding privacy when sharing data with third parties. TableGuard leverages advanced context-sensitive obfuscation techniques to replace sensitive data elements with contextually appropriate alternatives. By maintaining the relational integrity and coherence of the data, our approach mitigates the risks of cognitive dissonance and data leakage. We demonstrate the implementation of TableGuard using a BERT based transformer model, which identifies and obfuscates sensitive entities within relational tables. Our evaluation shows that TableGuard effectively balances privacy protection with data utility, minimizing information loss while ensuring that the obfuscated data remains functionally useful for downstream applications. The results highlight the importance of domain-specific obfuscation strategies and the role of context length in preserving data integrity. The implications of this research are significant for organizations that need to share data securely with external parties. TableGuard offers a robust framework for implementing privacy-preserving data sharing mechanisms, thereby contributing to the broader field of data privacy and security.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study of Training ID-Agnostic Multi-modal Sequential Recommenders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SR) aims to predict future user-item interactions based on historical interactions. While many SR approaches concentrate on user IDs and item IDs, the human perception of the world through multi-modal signals, like text and images, has inspired researchers to delve into constructing SR from multi-modal information without using IDs. However, the complexity of multi-modal learning manifests in diverse feature extractors, fusion methods, and pre-trained models. Consequently, designing a simple and universal \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{S}equential \textbf{R}ecommendation (\textbf{MMSR}) framework remains a formidable challenge. We systematically summarize the existing multi-modal related SR methods and distill the essence into four core components: visual encoder, text encoder, multimodal fusion module, and sequential architecture. Along these dimensions, we dissect the model designs, and answer the following sub-questions: First, we explore how to construct MMSR from scratch, ensuring its performance either on par with or exceeds existing SR methods without complex techniques. Second, we examine if MMSR can benefit from existing multi-modal pre-training paradigms. Third, we assess MMSR's capability in tackling common challenges like cold start and domain transferring. Our experiment results across four real-world recommendation scenarios demonstrate the great potential ID-agnostic multi-modal sequential recommendation. Our framework can be found at: https://github.com/MMSR23/MMSR.</description>

      <title>CAPRI-FAIR: Integration of Multi-sided Fairness in Contextual POI Recommendation Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point-of-interest (POI) recommendation considers spatio-temporal constraints like distance, peak hours, and user check-ins. Given their influence on both consumer experience and POI business, it's crucial to consider fairness from multiple perspectives. Unfortunately, these systems often provide less accurate recommendations to inactive users and less exposure to unpopular POIs. This paper develops a post-filter methodology that integrates provider and consumer fairness into existing models, aiming to balance fairness metrics like item exposure with performance metrics such as precision and distance. Experiments show that a linear scoring model for provider fairness in re-scoring items offers the best tradeoff between performance and long-tail exposure, sometimes without significant precision loss. Addressing consumer fairness by recommending more popular POIs to inactive users increased precision in some models and datasets. However, combinations that reached the Pareto front of consumer and provider fairness yielded the lowest precision values, underscoring that tradeoffs depend heavily on the model and dataset.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Node Representations for Real-World Complex Networks with Topological Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph augmentation methods play a crucial role in improving the performance and enhancing generalisation capabilities in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Existing graph augmentation methods mainly perturb the graph structures, and are usually limited to pairwise node relations. These methods cannot fully address the complexities of real-world large-scale networks, which often involve higher-order node relations beyond only being pairwise. Meanwhile, real-world graph datasets are predominantly modelled as simple graphs, due to the scarcity of data that can be used to form higher-order edges. Therefore, reconfiguring the higher-order edges as an integration into graph augmentation strategies lights up a promising research path to address the aforementioned issues. In this paper, we present Topological Augmentation (TopoAug), a novel graph augmentation method that builds a combinatorial complex from the original graph by constructing virtual hyperedges directly from the raw data. TopoAug then produces auxiliary node features by extracting information from the combinatorial complex, which are used for enhancing GNN performances on downstream tasks. We design three diverse virtual hyperedge construction strategies to accompany the construction of combinatorial complexes: (1) via graph statistics, (2) from multiple data perspectives, and (3) utilising multi-modality. Furthermore, to facilitate TopoAug evaluation, we provide 23 novel real-world graph datasets across various domains including social media, biology, and e-commerce. Our empirical study shows that TopoAug consistently and significantly outperforms GNN baselines and other graph augmentation methods, across a variety of application contexts, which clearly indicates that it can effectively incorporate higher-order node relations into the graph augmentation for real-world complex networks.</description>
