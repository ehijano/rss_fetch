      <title>Electrical Response of Nanofluidic Systems Subjected to Viscosity Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is expected that the introduction of a viscosity gradient across a nanofluidic system will drastically vary its current-voltage response, $i-V$. However, to date, there is no self-consistent theoretical model that can be used to fully characterize such a system. This work provides an internally self-consistent model that details all the key characteristics of ion transport through a nanofluidic system for an arbitrary viscosity field. In particular, this work addresses three separate issues. First, we provide a new expression for the Ohmic conductance, $g_{Ohmic} = i/V$. Second, several previous theoretical studies have suggested that the introduction of a viscosity gradient can result in the shift of the $i-V$ such that it does not cross the origin. This work unequivocally shows that the $i-V$ is expected to always cross the origin. Third, we demonstrate that even without electroosmotic flows, the introduction of a viscosity gradient results in current rectification. Importantly, all theoretical results are verified by non-approximated numerical simulations. This work provides the appropriate framework to analyze and interpret experimental and numerical simulations of nanofluidic systems subject to a viscosity gradient.</description>

      <title>Role of magnetic doping in topological HgTe and application of the Gram-Schmidt method for computing impurity states in quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum spin Hall effect in non-magnetic and Mn-doped HgTe quantum well is strongly affected by Kondo scattering of edge electrons by holes localized on acceptors. A generalized eigenvalue method is usually employed for determining impurity binding energies from the multiband Kohn-Luttinger Hamiltonians in bulk samples and semiconductor quantum structures. Such an approach provides accurate values of the level positions but its applicability for determining the impurity localization radius can be questioned. As an alternative method we propose here the Gram-Schmidt ortogonalization procedure allowing to employ the standard eigenvalue algorithms and, thus, to determine both impurity level energies and the set of normalized eigenvectors. We apply this approach to singly-ionized acceptor states in HgTe quantum wells and obtain impurity level energies and localization radiuses even for states degenerate with the continuum of band states. Such information allows us to assess the energy of bound magnetic polarons in quantum wells doped with magnetic ions. We determine the polaron energies and discuss consequences of the resonant polaron formation on band transport in the bulk samples and quantum wells in the regimes of quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate spin transport in a junction system composed of a ferromagnetic insulator (FI) and a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with both Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. We briefly present our findings on spin pumping into the 2DEG under microwave irradiation and subsequent current generation via the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect. We highlight the crucial role of vertex corrections in the theoretical description of these effects.</description>

      <title>Identification by Inelastic X-Ray scattering of bulk alteration of solid dynamics due to Liquid Wetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the influence at room temperature of the deposit of a water layer on the phonon dynamics of a solid. It is shown that the water wetting at the surface of an Alumina monocrystal has deep effects on acoustic phonons, propagating over several hundred microns distance and taking place on a relatively long time scale. The effect of the wetting at the boundary is two-fold: a hardening of both transverse and longitudinal acoustic phonons is observed as well as a relaxation of internal stresses. These acoustic phonon energy changes were observed by inelastic X-ray scattering up to 40 meV energy loss, allowing us to probe the solid at different depths from the surface.</description>

      <title>Five-dimensional Floquet topological semimetals with emergent Yang monopoles and linked Weyl surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Floquet topological matter has attracted significant attention for its potential to reveal novel topological phases inaccessible in static systems. In this work, we investigate the effect of a time-periodic driving on the five-dimensional (5D) normal insulators. We show that the time-periodic driving can induce a topological phase transition from a TP (time reversal combined with space inversion) symmetry-preserving normal insulator to a 5D Floquet topological semimetal with emergent Yang monopoles characterized by the second Chern number. Additionally, we show that this time-periodic driving can also lead to a topological phase transition from a TP symmetry-breaking normal insulator to a 5D Floquet topological semimetal with a Hopf link formed by Weyl surfaces. Besides, further increasing the strength of the time-periodic driving, the two 5D Floquet topological semimetal phases transition into the 5D Floquet Chern insulators. Our work is helpful for future studies in higher dimensional Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Spin Textures Enabling Quantum Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spintronics is an emerging field focused on developing novel applications by utilizing the quantum coherence of magnetic systems. Robust information transmission is crucial for achieving fully scalable spintronic devices. However, despite its significance, reliable long-range quantum information transmission in magnetic systems remains a challenging frontier. Here, we introduce a long-distance quantum transmission scheme based on topological spin textures in a hybrid system of a magnetic racetrack and spin qubits. We demonstrate this principle by employing the domain wall (DW)-the most fundamental texture-to transport quantum signal between distant qubits. In particular, we propose and analyze an efficient measurement-free protocol that leverages the DW mobility to enable robust entanglement generation between distant qubits. Strikingly, we find that this remote entanglement generation is not only fast and of high fidelity, but also remarkably tunable, capable of being easily turned on and off on-demand by switching the DW initial state. Furthermore, we show that, interestingly, spin qubits can serve as quantum stations for the racetrack, facilitating state transfer among fast-moving DWs on the same track. Our study provides a hybrid quantum platform for scalable quantum computation and opens the door to future explorations of topological textures for quantum information processing in spintronics architectures.</description>

      <title>Preserving Coulomb blockade in transport spectroscopy of quantum dots, by dynamical tunnel-barrier compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-gated quantum dots (QDs) in semiconductor heterostructures represent a highly attractive platform for quantum computation and simulation. However, in this implementation, the barriers through which the QD is tunnel-coupled to source and drain reservoirs (or neighboring QDs) are usually non-rigid, and capacitively influenced by the plunger gate voltage (VP). In transport spectroscopy measurements, this leads to complete suppression of current and lifting of Coulomb blockade, for large negative and positive values of VP, respectively. Consequently, the charge-occupancy of the QD can be tuned over a rather small range of VP. By dynamically tuning the tunnel barriers to compensate for the capacitive effect of VP, here we demonstrate a protocol which allows the Coulomb blockade to be preserved over a remarkably large span of charge-occupancies, as demonstrated by clean Coulomb diamonds and well-resolved excited state features. The protocol will be highly beneficial for automated tuning and identification of the gatevoltage-space for optimal operation of QDs, in large arrays required for a scalable spin quantum computing architecture.</description>

      <title>Harnessing magnetic octupole Hall effect to induce torque in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: d-wave altermagnets have magnetic octupoles as their order parameters [Phys. Rev. X 14, 011019 (2024)]. We theoretically show that magnetic octupoles injected from outside generate torque on the d-wave altermagnets. The injection can be achieved by the magnetic octupole Hall effect in an adjacent layer. We calculate the magnetic octupole Hall conductivity of the heavy metal Pt and find a sizable value comparable to its spin Hall conductivity. Our work generalizes the spin Hall phenomenology (generation by heavy metals and detection by torque in ferromagnets) to the magnetic octupole Hall phenomenology (generation by heavy metals and detection by torque in altermagnets), which can be utilized to electrically control magnetic configurations of altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Quantum kinetic theory of quadratic responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has revealed a general procedure for incorporating disorder into the semiclassical model of carrier transport, whereby the predictions of quantum linear response theory can be recovered within a quantum kinetic approach based on a disorder-averaged density-matrix formalism. Here, we present a comprehensive generalization of this framework to the nonlinear response regime. In the presence of an electrostatic potential and random impurities, we solve the quantum Liouville equation to second order in an applied electric field and derive the carrier densities and equations of motion. In addition to the anomalous velocity arising from the Berry curvature and the Levi-Civita connection of the quantum metric tensor, a host of extrinsic velocities emerge in the equations of motion, reflecting the various possibilities for random interband walks of the carriers in this transport regime. Furthermore, several scattering and conduction channels arise, which can be classified in terms of distinct physical processes, revealing numerous mechanisms for generating nonlinear responses in disordered condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Linear response of a Chern insulator to finite-frequency electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the macroscopic charge and current densities of a Chern insulator initially occupying its electronic ground state as it responds to a finite-frequency electric field; we use a previously developed formalism based on microscopic polarization and magnetization fields in extended media. In a topologically trivial insulator, our result reduces to the familiar expression for the induced current density in linear response obtained from a Kubo analysis. But for a Chern insulator we find an extra "topological" term involving the (first) Chern number associated with the occupied bands, encoding the quantum anomalous Hall effect in the presence of a frequency-dependent electric field. While an analogous term has been introduced in the "modern theories of polarization and magnetization" for the linear response of finite-sized systems to static electric fields, our expression is valid for bulk Chern insulators in the presence of both static and finite-frequency electric fields, being derived analytically from a microscopic treatment of the electronic degrees of freedom therein, and can be generalized in a straightforward way to describe the response of a Chern insulator to electromagnetic fields that are both frequency-dependent and spatially inhomogeneous.</description>

      <title>Magnetoconductivity of Dirac semimetals and chiral magnetic effect from Keldysh technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetals is typically considered as a manifestation of chiral magnetic effect (CME). The relation between these two phenomena has the status of hypothesis and is based on the sequence of assumptions. We rely on the Keldysh technique of non-equilibrium theory. It allows us to investigate the accumulation of axial charge -- the process that involves both chiral anomaly and relaxation followed by the energy dissipation. We consider the case of strong magnetic field and calculate directly both axial charge density and electric conductivity taking into account both scattering on impurities and interaction with phonons. We obtain the same dependence of axial charge density on electric and magnetic fields, and the same dependence of electric current on axial charge density as the standard heuristic CME calculation. This confirms (in the limit of strong magnetic fields) the hypothesis that the origin of magnetoconductivity in Dirac semimetals is the CME.</description>

      <title>Electric imaging and dynamics of photo-charged graphene edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional side gate based on graphene edges shows a significant capability of reducing the channel length of field-effect transistors, further increasing the integration density of semiconductor devices. The nano-scale electric field distribution near the edge provides the physical limit of the effective channel length, however, its imaging under ambient conditions still lacks, which is a critical aspect for the practical deployment of semiconductor devices. Here, we used scanning nitrogen-vacancy microscopy to investigate the electric field distribution near edges of a single-layer-graphene. Real-space scanning maps of photo-charged floating graphene flakes were acquired with a spatial resolution of $\sim$ 10 nm, and the electric edge effect was quantitatively studied by analyzing the NV spin energy level shifts due to the electric Stark effect. Since the graphene flakes are isolated from external electric sources, we brought out a theory based on photo-thermionic effect to explain the charge transfer from graphene to oxygen-terminated diamond probe with a disordered distribution of charge traps. Real-time tracing of electric fields detected the photo-thermionic emission process and the recombination process of the emitted electrons. This study provides a new perspective for graphene-based one-dimensional gates and opto-electronics with nanoscale real-space imaging, and moreover, offers a novel method to tune the chemical environment of diamond surfaces based on optical charge transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg states of excitons in Cu$_2$O are known to interact strongly with other carriers in their surrounding such as other excitons, free charge carriers and static charged impurities. In cw-experiments, discriminating the individual processes is notoriously challenging. Here, we use a time-resolved two-color pump-probe setup and investigate the temporal evolution of Rydberg excitons with a resolution of 15 ns. The dynamic response of the Rydberg system to pump pulses with different energies is analyzed and the elementary processes that constitute the complex decay dynamics are compared among the different excitation scenarios. Our analysis reveals mainly four different timescales on which physical processes occur.</description>

      <title>On demand single photon generation and coherent control of excitons from resonantly driven nanowire quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent control of single photon sources is a key requirement for the advancement of photonic quantum technologies. Among them, nanowire-based quantum dot sources are popular due to their potential for on-chip hybrid integration. Here we demonstrate on-demand single-photon generation ($g^{(2)}(0)(X^{*}) =0.078$ and $g^{(2)}(0)(X)= 0.03$) from resonantly excited InAsP/InP nanowire quantum dots and observe Rabi oscillations in the dot emission, indicating successful coherent manipulation of the excitonic states in the nanowire. We also measure a low emission time jitter for resonant excitation as compared to above-band excitation. This work addresses the long-standing challenge of resonantly exciting nanowire-quantum dots. It paves the way for hybrid quantum photonic integration, enabling spin-photon entanglement and matter memories on-chip.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation instabilities via internal resonance in a multimode membrane as a mechanism for frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore self-induced parametric coupling, also called internal resonances (IRs), in a membrane nanoelectromechanical system. Specifically, we focus on the formation of a limit cycle manifesting as a phononic frequency comb. Utilizing a pump-noisy-probe technique and theoretical modeling, we reveal the behavior of mechanical excitations revealing themselves as sidebands of the stationary IR response. We find that when the energy-absorbing excitation of a lower mode is parametrically-upconverted to hybridize with a higher mode, significant squeezing and bimodality in the upper mode occurs. Instead, when the upconverted absorbing excitation hybridizes with an emitting sideband of the higher mode, a Hopf bifurcation occurs and a limit cycle forms, manifesting as a frequency comb. We thus reveal a unique mechanism to obtain frequency combs in parametrically-coupled modes. We furthermore demonstrate a rich variety of IR effects, the origin of which significantly extends beyond standard linear parametric coupling phenomena. Our findings enhance the understanding of energy transfer mechanisms with implications for advanced sensing technologies and novel phononic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Fast Virtual Gate Extraction For Silicon Quantum Dot Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon quantum dot devices stand as promising candidates for large-scale quantum computing due to their extended coherence times, compact size, and recent experimental demonstrations of sizable qubit arrays. Despite the great potential, controlling these arrays remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a new virtual gate extraction method to quickly establish orthogonal control on the potentials for individual quantum dots. Leveraging insights from the device physics, the proposed approach significantly reduces the experimental overhead by focusing on crucial regions around charge state transition. Furthermore, by employing an efficient voltage sweeping method, we can efficiently pinpoint these charge state transition lines and filter out erroneous points. Experimental evaluation using real quantum dot chip datasets demonstrates a substantial 5.84x to 19.34x speedup over conventional methods, thereby showcasing promising prospects for accelerating the scaling of silicon spin qubit devices.</description>

      <title>Origin and stability of generalized Wigner crystallinity in triangular moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Wigner crystals (GWC) on triangular moir\'e superlattices, formed from stacking two layers of transition metal chalcogenides, have been recently observed at multiple fractional fillings of the moir\'e unit cell [Nature 587, 214 - 218 (2020), Nat. Phys. 17, 715 - 719 (2021), Nature 597, 650 - 654 (2021)]. Motivated by these experiments, tied with the need for an accurate microscopic description of these materials, we explore the theoretical origins of GWC at $n=1/3$ and $2/3$ filling. We demonstrate the limitations of theoretical descriptions of these moir\'e GWCs relying on truncated (finite-range) electron-electron interactions instead of a long-range Coulomb interaction. We validate our findings by studying both classical and quantum mechanical effects at zero and finite temperatures. More generally, we discuss the role of charge frustration in the theoretical extended Hubbard-model phase diagram, identifying a "pinball" phase, a partially quantum melted generalized Wigner crystal with coexisting solid and liquid-like features, with no classical analog. Quantum effects also explain the small, but experimentally detectable, asymmetry in the transition temperatures of the $n=1/3$ and $2/3$ crystals. Our calculations reveal that the charge ordering temperature and the magnetic crossover temperature predicted using the long-range Coulomb interaction are correctly captured with appropriately renormalized nearest-neighbor interactions. The effective nearest-neighbor interaction strength is significantly weaker than previously reported, placing it close to a metal-insulator phase boundary. This observation has implications for future experiments that we discuss. We conclude by studying the dependence of melting temperatures on gate-to-sample separation and we also predict temperature scales at which magnetic crossovers should be observed.</description>

      <title>Chiral and topological superconductivity in isospin polarized multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A microscopic mechanism for chiral superconductivity from Coulomb repulsion is proposed for spin- and valley-polarized state of rhombohedral multilayer graphene. The superconducting state occurs at low density, has chiral $p$-wave pairing symmetry, and exhibits highest $T_c$ close to a Lifshitz transition from annular to simply-connected Fermi sea. This Lifshitz transition also marks a topological phase transition from a trivial to a topological superconducting phase hosting Majorana fermions. The chirality of the superconducting order parameter is selected by the chirality of the valley-polarized Bloch electrons. Our results are in reasonable agreement with observations in a recent experiment on tetralayer graphene [arXiv:2408.15233]</description>

      <title>Robust Single-Photon Generation for Quantum Information Enabled by Stimulated Adiabatic Rapid Passage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of single photons using solid-state quantum emitters is pivotal for advancing photonic quantum technologies, particularly in quantum communication. As the field continuously advances towards practical use cases and beyond shielded laboratory environments, specific demands are placed on the robustness of quantum light sources during operation. In this context, the robustness of the quantum light generation process against intrinsic and extrinsic effects is a major challenge. Here, we present a robust scheme for the coherent generation of indistinguishable single-photon states with very low photon number coherence (PNC) using a three-level system in a semiconductor quantum dot. Our novel approach combines the advantages of adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) and stimulated two-photon excitation (sTPE). We demonstrate robust quantum light generation while maintaining the prime quantum-optical quality of the emitted light state. Moreover, we highlight the immediate advantages for the implementation of various quantum cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Effect Based on Weyl Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect is a well-known demonstration of strongly correlated topological phases in two dimensions. However, the extension of this phenomenon into a three-dimensional context has yet to be achieved. Recently, the three-dimensional integer quantum Hall effect based on Weyl orbits has been experimentally observed in a topological semimetallic material under a magnetic field. This motivates us to ask whether the Weyl orbits can give rise to the fractional quantum Hall effect when their Landau level is partially filled in the presence of interactions. Here we theoretically demonstrate that the fractional quantum Hall states based on Weyl orbits can emerge in a Weyl semimetal when a Landau level is one-third filled. Using concrete models for Weyl semimetals in magnetic fields, we project the Coulomb interaction onto a single Landau level from the Weyl orbit and find that the ground state of the many-body Hamiltoian is triply degenerate. We further show that the ground states exhibit the many-body Chern number of $1/3$ and the uniform occupation of electrons in both momentum and real space, implying that they are the fractional quantum Hall states. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, the states are spatially localized on two surfaces hosting Fermi arcs. Additionally, our findings suggest that the excitation properties of these states resemble those of the Laughlin state in two dimensions, as inferred from the particle entanglement spectrum of the ground states.</description>

      <title>Capillary-size Flow of Human Blood Plasma: Revealing Hidden Elasticity and Scale Dependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamical mechanical analysis of blood generally uses models inspired by conventional flows, assuming scale-independent homogeneous flows and without considering fluid-surface boundary interactions. The present experimental study highlights the relevance of using an approach in line with physiological reality providing a strong interaction between the fluid and the boundary interface. New dynamic properties of human blood plasma are found: a finite shear elastic response (solid-like property) is identified in nearly static conditions, which also depends on the scale (being reinforced at small scales). The elastic behavior is confirmed by the induction of local hot and cold thermodynamic states evidencing a thermo-mechanical coupling in blood plasma so far known only in elastic materials. This finding opens new routes for medical diagnosis and device fabrication.</description>

      <title>Oscillating Magnetic Effect in BiFeO$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of electric vehicles has led to a growing need for more efficient and environmentally friendly batteries. As a result, there is significant interest in researching new materials and techniques to enhance battery efficiency. One such material being explored is bismuth ferrite (BiFeO$_3$ or BFO), a perovskite with versatile properties. Researchers are particularly intrigued by the potential to control its antiferromagnetic magnetization using magnetic or electric fields. Here, a comprehensive analysis of BFO was conducted, with a focus on its behavior when subjected to oscillating magnetic fields. The research revealed that BFO is sensitive to the frequency and shape of these magnetic fields, leading to the discovery of a new effect related to the transmission of electromagnetic signals on its surface. This effect resulted in a significant increase in the power of the electromagnetic signal, representing a major technological breakthrough. According to the findings, this gain in power has not been observed in any system of this kind before. The study also demonstrated that BFO has the ability to detect magnetic fields through electrical output signals and vice versa, which is crucial for assessing the state and efficiency of batteries, thus contributing to significant advancements in energy storage technology.</description>

      <title>Beyond-mean-field studies of Wigner crystal transitions in various interacting two-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically study Wigner crystal (WC) transitions in various interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) models, including both conventional 2DEG model and ``$n$-order" Dirac fermion models with energy-momentum dispersion $E_{\mathbf{k}} \sim k^n$, with $n$ being positive integer. A general ``$GW$+RPA" framework to treat single-particle spectra and ground-state energies in 2D systems has been developed. Within such a framework, we first calculate the single-particle excitation spectra of a conventional 2DEG system with $GW$ approximation for both Wigner-crystal state and Fermi-liquid (FL) state, in which the frequency dependent dielectric function is treated using a multiple-plasma-pole approach. Then, the correlation energy with random phase approximation (RPA) is further calculated based on the $GW$ single-particle spectra. By comparing the total energies of WC and FL states, our $GW$+RPA approach gives a critical Wigner-Seitz radius $r_s^*\sim 19.2$ for the WC transition in conventional 2DEG system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report experimental studies of coherent population trapping and spin relaxation in a temperature range between 4 K and 100 mK in a silicon vacancy (SiV) center subject to a transverse magnetic field. Near and below 1 K, phonon-induced spin dephasing becomes negligible compared with that induced by the spin bath of naturally abundant 13C atoms. The temperature dependence of the spin dephasing rates agrees with the theoretical expectation that phonon-induced spin dephasing arises primarily from orbital relaxation induced by first order electron-phonon interactions. A nearly 100-fold increase in spin lifetime is observed when the temperature is lowered from 4 K to slightly below 1 K, indicating that two-phonon spin-flip transitions play an essential role in the spin relaxation of SiV ground states.</description>

Abstract: At filling factor $\nu=0,\pm1$, the ground state of graphene is a particular SU(4) ferromagnet which hosts a rich phase diagram along with several spin, pseudospin or "entanglement" magnon modes. Motivated by recent experiments, we study a $\nu=-1|0|-1$ Fabry-P\'erot magnonic junction. If the ground state at $\nu=0$ is spin polarized, there exist two spin modes which interfere and create a beating pattern, while pseudospin modes are reflected. The same scenario occurs for pseudospin magnon if the $\nu=0$ ground state is pseudospin polarized. The observation of such an interference pattern would provide information on the low-energy anisotropies and thus on the ground state.</description>

Abstract: Controlling quantum materials with light is of fundamental and technological importance. By utilizing the strong coupling of light and matter in optical cavities (1-3), recent studies were able to modify some of their most defining features (4-6). In this work, we study the magneto-optical properties of a van der Waals magnet that supports strong coupling of photons and excitons even in the absence of external cavity mirrors. In this material - the layered magnetic semiconductor CrSBr - emergent light-matter hybrids called polaritons are shown to significantly increase the spectral bandwidth of correlations between the magnetic, electronic, and optical properties, enabling largely tunable optical responses to applied magnetic fields and magnons. Our results highlight the importance of exciton-photon self-hybridization in van der Waals magnets and motivate novel directions for the manipulation of quantum material properties by strong light-matter coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of random disorder in a metallic system accounts for the localization of extended states in general. On the contrary, the presence of disorder can induce topological phases hosting metallic boundary states out of a non-topological system, giving birth to the topological Anderson insulator phase. In this context, we theoretically investigate the generation of an out of equilibrium higher-order topological Anderson phase in the presence of disorder potential in a time-periodic dynamical background. In particular, the time-dependent drive and the disorder potential concomitantly render the generation of Floquet higher-order topological Anderson insulator~(FHOTAI) phase, while the clean, undriven system is topologically trivial. We showcase the generation of FHOTAI hosting both $0$- and $\pi$-modes. Most importantly, we develop the real space topological invariant -- a winding number based on chiral symmetry to characterize the Floquet $0$- and $\pi$-modes distinctly. This chiral winding number serves the purpose of the indicator for the topological phase transition in the presence of drive as well as disorder and appropriately characterizes the FHOTAI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider surface states in semiconductors with inverted-band structures, such as $\alpha$-Sn and HgTe. The main interest is the interplay of the effect of a strain of an arbitrary sign and that of the sample finite size. We consider, in particular, a model system comprised of a gapless semiconductor (e.g. HgTe or $\alpha$-Sn) of finite-width sandwiched between layers of a regular-band semiconductor (e.g. CdTe or InSb). We clarify the origin of various transitions that happen at a given strain with the change of the sample thickness, in particular the transition between the Dirac semimetal and quasi-3D (quantized) topological insulator. Our conclusion opposes those reached recently by the majority of researchers. We show that near the transition point the surface state cannot be treated as a truly topological one since the parameters of the problem are such that an appreciable overlap of the surface states' wave functions located at opposite boundaries occur. As a result, a spin-conserving, elastic impurity scattering between the states located at opposite boundaries will induce substantial backscattering and destroy the robustness of the surface state. For the k-p Kane model we derive hard-wall boundary conditions in the case when the regular-band materials form high barriers for the carriers of the inner inverted-band semiconductor (for example, CdTe/HgTe/CdTe and CdTe/$\alpha$-Sn/CdTe cases). We show that in this case the boundary conditions have universal and simple form and allow investigation of the realistic case of finite mass of the heavy-hole band, and comparison of the results obtained within the Kane and Luttinger models. In particular, a new type of surface states (wing states) developes with application of strain in the Kane model and is absent in the Luttinger model.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions are characterised by an integer topological charge $\mathcal Q =\mp 1$, describing the winding of the magnetic orientation. Half-integer winding numbers, $\mathcal Q=\pm \frac{1}{2}$, can be obtained for magnetic vortices (merons). Here, we discuss the physics of magnets with fractional topological charge which is neither integer nor half-integer. We argue that in ferromagnetic films with cubic anisotropy, textures with $\mathcal Q=\pm\frac{1}{6} $ or $\pm\frac{1}{8}$ arise naturally when three or more magnetic domains meet. We also show that a single magnetic skyrmion with $\mathcal Q =-1$ can explode into four fractional defects, each carrying charge $\mathcal Q=-\frac{1}{4}$. Additionally, we investigate a point defect with a non-quantised fractional charge ($\mathcal Q\neq \frac{n}{m}, n,m\in\mathbb{Z}$) which can move parallel to a magnetic domain wall. Only defects with fractional charge lead to an Aharonov-Bohm effect for magnons. We investigate the resulting forces on a fractional defect due to magnon currents.</description>

      <title>Neural network-based recognition of multiple nanobubbles in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a machine learning method for swiftly identifying nanobubbles in graphene, crucial for understanding electronic transport in graphene-based devices. Nanobubbles cause local strain, impacting graphene's transport properties. Traditional techniques like optical imaging are slow and limited for characterizing multiple nanobubbles. Our approach uses neural networks to analyze graphene's density of states, enabling rapid detection and characterization of nanobubbles from electronic transport data. This method swiftly enumerates nanobubbles and surpasses conventional imaging methods in efficiency and speed. It enhances quality assessment and optimization of graphene nanodevices, marking a significant advance in condensed matter physics and materials science. Our technique offers an efficient solution for probing the interplay between nanoscale features and electronic properties in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Gate tunable edge magnetoplasmon resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Hall systems are platforms of choice when it comes to study topological properties of condensed matter systems and anyonic exchange statistics. In this work we have developed a tunable radiofrequency edge magnetoplasmonic resonator meant to serve as a versatile platform for future interferometric devices. The resonance frequency of the system is controlled by both the magnetic field and a set of electrostatic gates. The gates allow us to change both the size of the resonant cavity and the electronic density of the two-dimensional electron gas. We show that we can continuously control the frequency response of our resonator, making it possible to develop an edge magnetoplasmon interferometer. As we reach smaller sizes of our resonator, finite size effects caused by the measurement probes manifest. We present a theoretical description of the system taking into account the spatial extension of the probing gates. In the future, such device will be a valuable tool to investigate the properties of non-abelian anyons in the fractional quantum Hall regime.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum phase transitions driven by a displacement field in the twisted MoTe2 bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ systems at fractional fillings of the lowest hole band under an applied out-of-plane displacement field. By employing exact diagonalization in finite-size systems, we systematically map out the ground state quantum phase diagram for two filling fractions, $\nu=1/3$ and $2/3$, and provide a detailed characterization of each phase. We identify the phase transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a layer-polarized charge density wave (CDW) at a filling fraction of $\nu=1/3$, denoted as CDW-$1$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the competition between the displacement field and twist angle leads to another phase transition from a layer-polarized CDW-$1$ to a layer-hybridized CDW-$2$, identified as a first-order phase transition. Furthermore, at $\nu=2/3$ filling of the lowest hole band, we observe that the FCI remains stable against the displacement field until it approaches proximity to a transition in single-particle band topology at a smaller twist angle.</description>

      <title>Plasmons in two-dimensional electron systems with infinite and semi-infinite metal gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically investigate the plasmons propagating in a homogeneous two-dimensional (2D) electron system, along the metal grating in the form of a periodic array of strip-shaped electrodes (gates) in the vicinity of the 2D system. We show that in the case of semi-infinite grating, the Tamm plasmon modes localized near and propagating along the grating edge can exist in the gaps of the plasmonic band structure provided that the last gate differs in width from the other gates. When the last gate is wider, the spectrum of the fundamental Tamm plasmon mode lies in the lowest frequency gap, below the first plasmonic band. Importantly, we find the mode to exist in this case only for finite values of the wave vector along the grating. Otherwise, if the width of the last gate is smaller, the Tamm plasmon modes occupy higher frequency gaps, and delocalized plasmons from the first frequency band become the lowest frequency excitations.</description>

      <title>The superconducting clock-circuit: Improving the coherence of Josephson radiation beyond the thermodynamic uncertainty relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of superconducting electronics, the on-chip generation of AC radiation is essential for further advancements. Although a Josephson junction can emit AC radiation from a purely DC voltage bias, the coherence of this radiation is significantly limited by Johnson-Nyquist noise. We relate this limitation to the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) in the field of stochastic thermodynamics. Recent findings indicate that the thermodynamic uncertainty relation can be broken by a classical pendulum clock. We demonstrate how the violation of the TUR can be used as a design principle for radiation sources by showing that a superconducting clock circuit emits coherent AC radiation from a DC bias.</description>

      <title>Current-driven mechanical motion of double stranded DNA results in structural instabilities and chiral-induced-spin-selectivity of electron transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral-induced-spin-selectivity of electron transport and its interplay with DNA's mechanical motion is explored in a double stranded DNA helix with spin-orbit-coupling. The mechanical degree of freedom is treated as a stochastic classical variable experiencing fluctuations and dissipation induced by the environment as well as force exerted by nonequilibrium, current-carrying electrons. Electronic degrees of freedom are described quantum mechanically using nonequilibrium Green's functions. Nonequilibrium Green's functions are computed along the trajectory for the classical variable taking into account dynamical, velocity dependent corrections. This mixed quantum-classical approach enables calculations of time-dependent spin-resolved currents. We showed that the electronic force may significantly modify the classical potential which, at sufficient voltage, creates a bistable potential with considerable effect on electronic transport. The DNA's mechanical motion has a profound effect on spin transport; it results in chiral-induced spin selectivity increasing spin polarisation of the current by 9% and also resulting in temperature-dependent current voltage characteristics. We demonstrate that the current noise measurement provides an accessible experimental means to monitor the emergence of mechanical instability in DNA motion. The spin resolved current noise also provides important dynamical information about the interplay between vibrational and spin degrees of freedom in DNA.</description>

      <title>Origin of Robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Phases in Stacked Hermitian Systems: Non-Hermitian Level Repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators, which possess a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase, have attracted great attention for two decades. It is generally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall insulators are stacked, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase becomes unstable due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nature. While the counterexamples of the instability were observed in several literates, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we provide a systematic understanding that the robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase in a Hermitian system with chiral symmetry against stacking. We clarify that the robustness generally originates from level repulsion in the corresponding non-Hermitian system derived from Hermitization. We demonstrate this by treating a class DIII superconductor in 1D with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and the corresponding non-Hermitian 1D system in class AII$^\dagger$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04104v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum processing units will be modules of larger information processing systems containing also digital and analog electronics modules. Silicon-based quantum computing offers the enticing opportunity to manufacture all the modules using the same technology platform. Here, we present a cryogenic multi-module assembly for multiplexed readout of silicon quantum devices where all modules have been fabricated using the same fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS process. The assembly is constituted by three chiplets: (i) a low-noise amplifier (LNA), (ii) a single-pole eight-throw switch (SP8T), and (iii) a silicon quantum dot (QD) array. We integrate the chiplets into modules and show respectively, (i) a peak gain over 35dB with a 3dB bandwidth from 709MHz to 827MHz and an average noise temperature of 6.2K (minimum 4.2K), (ii) an insertion loss smaller than 1.1dB and a noise temperature less than 1.1K over the 0-2GHz range, and (iii) single-electron box (SEB) charge sensors. Finally, we combine all modules into a single demonstration showing time-domain radio-frequency multiplexing of two SEBs paving the way to an all-silicon quantum computing system.</description>

      <title>The topological dynamics of continuum lattice grid structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuum lattice grid structures which consist of joined elastic beams subject to flexural deformations are ubiquitous. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework of the topological dynamics of continuum lattice grid structures, and discover the topological edge and corner modes in these structures. We rigorously identify the infinitely many topological edge states within the bandgaps via a theorem, with a clear criterion for the infinite number of topological phase transitions. Then, we obtain analytical expressions for the topological phases of bulk bands, and propose a topological index related to the topological phases that determines the existence of the edge states. The theoretical approach is directly applicable to a broad range of continuum lattice grid structures including bridge-like frames, square frames, kagome frames, continuous beams on elastic springs. The frequencies of the topological modes are precisely obtained, applicable to all the bands from low- to high-frequencies. Continuum lattice grid structures serve as excellent platforms for exploring various kinds of topological phases and demonstrating the topological modes at multiple frequencies on demand. Their topological dynamics has significant implications in safety assessment, structural health monitoring, and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in one-dimensional quantum wires connected to superconductors with mixed singlet-triplet pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), characterized by asymmetric critical currents in a Josephson junction, has drawn considerable attention in the field of condensed matter physics. We investigate the conditions under which JDE can manifest in a one-dimensional Josephson junction composed of a spin-orbit-coupled quantum wire with an applied Zeeman field, connected between two superconductors. Our study reveals that while spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and a Zeeman field in the quantum wire are not sufficient to induce JDE when the superconductors are purely singlet, the introduction of triplet pairing in the superconductors leads to the emergence of JDE. This finding highlights the potential of JDE as a probe for triplet superconductivity. We further demonstrate that even in absence of SOC in the quantum wire, JDE can arise when the directions of the triplet pairing and the Zeeman field are non-collinear, provided the superconductors exhibit mixed singlet-triplet pairing. Additionally, we identify specific conditions under which JDE is absent, namely, when the pairing is purely triplet and the directions of the SOC and the triplet pairing are perpendicular. Our findings indicate that JDE is always accompanied by the anomalous Josephson effect. The diode effect coefficient is found to oscillate with variations in the chemical potential of the quantum wire, driven by Fabry-P\'erot interference effects. Our results suggest that quantum wires in Josephson junctions could serve as effective platforms for probing triplet superconductivity through the observation of JDE.</description>
