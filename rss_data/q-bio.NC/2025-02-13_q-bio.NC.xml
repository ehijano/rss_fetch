      <title>Enhancing Olfactory Perception Through Large Language Models: Integrating Sensory Data for Advanced Odor Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of biological principles into artificial olfactory systems has led to significant advancements in odor detection and classification. Inspired by the intricate mechanisms of natural olfaction, researchers are developing sophisticated systems that mimic the functionality of biological olfactory pathways. These systems utilize high-density chemoresistive sensor arrays (HCSA) combined with advanced computational techniques, such as FPGA-accelerated glomerular convergence circuits (FGCC) and hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNN). This bioinspired approach enables real-time adaptive responses to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of odor identification. At the core of these innovations is the multiparametric sigmoidal sensor activation (MPSA), which quantifies VOCs by leveraging the diverse responses of sensor arrays. The implementation of lateral inhibition via programmable synaptic crossbars (LIPSC) further refines odor processing by mimicking neural interactions found in biological systems. Additionally, temporal self-organizing maps (TSOM) facilitate dynamic clustering of odor patterns, allowing for a nuanced understanding of complex odor environments. A novel aspect of this research lies in the Grassmannian manifold embedding (GME) of odor profiles, which provides a mathematical framework for representing and analyzing the multidimensional nature of odors. Coupled with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo-optimized feedback (HMC-FB), this system effectively compensates for drift in sensor readings, ensuring consistent performance over time. By bridging the gap between biological inspiration and technological innovation, these artificial olfactory systems are poised to revolutionize applications ranging from environmental monitoring to food safety and healthcare diagnostics.</description>

      <title>neuro2voc: Decoding Vocalizations from Neural Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate decoding of neural spike trains and relating them to motor output is a challenging task due to the inherent sparsity and length in neural spikes and the complexity of brain circuits. This master project investigates experimental methods for decoding zebra finch motor outputs (in both discrete syllables and continuous spectrograms), from invasive neural recordings obtained from Neuropixels.
  There are three major achievements: (1) XGBoost with SHAP analysis trained on spike rates revealed neuronal interaction patterns crucial for syllable classification. (2) Novel method (tokenizing neural data with GPT2) and architecture (Mamba2) demonstrated potential for decoding of syllables using spikes. (3) A combined contrastive learning-VAE framework successfully generated spectrograms from binned neural data.
  This work establishes a promising foundation for neural decoding of complex motor outputs and offers several novel methodological approaches for processing sparse neural data.</description>

      <title>Some things to know about achieving artificial general intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current and foreseeable GenAI models are not capable of achieving artificial general intelligence because they are burdened with anthropogenic debt. They depend heavily on human input to provide well-structured problems, architecture, and training data. They cast every problem as a language pattern learning problem and are thus not capable of the kind of autonomy needed to achieve artificial general intelligence. Current models succeed at their tasks because people solve most of the problems to which these models are directed, leaving only simple computations for the model to perform, such as gradient descent. Another barrier is the need to recognize that there are multiple kinds of problems, some of which cannot be solved by available computational methods (for example, "insight problems"). Current methods for evaluating models (benchmarks and tests) are not adequate to identify the generality of the solutions, because it is impossible to infer the means by which a problem was solved from the fact of its solution. A test could be passed, for example, by a test-specific or a test-general method. It is a logical fallacy (affirming the consequent) to infer a method of solution from the observation of success.</description>

      <title>Normative Cerebral Perfusion Across the Lifespan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cerebral perfusion plays a crucial role in maintaining brain function and is tightly coupled with neuronal activity. While previous studies have examined cerebral perfusion trajectories across development and aging, precise characterization of its lifespan dynamics has been limited by small sample sizes and methodological inconsistencies. In this study, we construct the first comprehensive normative model of cerebral perfusion across the human lifespan (birth to 85 years) using a large multi-site dataset of over 12,000 high-quality arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI scans. Leveraging generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS), we mapped nonlinear growth trajectories of cerebral perfusion at global, network, and regional levels. We observed a rapid postnatal increase in cerebral perfusion, peaking at approximately 7.1 years, followed by a gradual decline into adulthood. Sex differences were evident, with distinct regional maturation patterns rather than uniform differences across all brain regions. Beyond normative modeling, we quantified individual deviations from expected CBF patterns in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, identifying disease-specific perfusion abnormalities across four brain disorders. Using longitudinal data, we established typical and atypical cerebral perfusion trajectories, highlighting the prognostic value of perfusion-based biomarkers for detecting disease progression. Our findings provide a robust normative framework for cerebral perfusion, facilitating precise characterization of brain health across the lifespan and enhancing the early identification of neurovascular dysfunction in clinical populations.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Characterization of Similarity Judgments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing judgments of similarity within a perceptual or semantic domain, and making inferences about the underlying structure of this domain from these judgments, has an increasingly important role in cognitive and systems neuroscience. We present a new framework for this purpose that makes limited assumptions about how perceptual distances are converted into similarity judgments. The approach starts from a dataset of empirical judgments of relative similarities: the fraction of times that a subject chooses one of two comparison stimuli to be more similar to a reference stimulus. These empirical judgments provide Bayesian estimates of underling choice probabilities. From these estimates, we derive indices that characterize the set of judgments in three ways: compatibility with a symmetric dis-similarity, compatibility with an ultrametric space, and compatibility with an additive tree. Each of the indices is derived from rank-order relationships among the choice probabilities that, as we show, are necessary and sufficient for local consistency with the three respective characteristics. We illustrate this approach with simulations and example psychophysical datasets of dis-similarity judgments in several visual domains and provide code that implements the analyses at https://github.com/jvlab/simrank.</description>

      <title>Predicting Parkinson's disease trajectory using clinical and functional MRI features: a reproduction and replication study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with a poorly understood physiopathology and no established biomarkers for the diagnosis of early stages and for prediction of disease progression. Several neuroimaging biomarkers have been studied recently, but these are susceptible to several sources of variability related for instance to cohort selection or image analysis. In this context, an evaluation of the robustness of such biomarkers to variations in the data processing workflow is essential. This study is part of a larger project investigating the replicability of potential neuroimaging biomarkers of PD. Here, we attempt to reproduce (re-implementing the experiments with the same data, same method) and replicate (different data and/or method) the models described in [1] to predict individual's PD current state and progression using demographic, clinical and neuroimaging features (fALFF and ReHo extracted from resting-state fMRI). We use the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative dataset (PPMI, ppmi-info.org), as in [1] and aim to reproduce the original cohort, imaging features and machine learning models as closely as possible using the information available in the paper and the code. We also investigated methodological variations in cohort selection, feature extraction pipelines and sets of input features. Different criteria were used to evaluate the reproduction and compare the reproduced results with the original ones. Notably, we obtained significantly better than chance performance using the analysis pipeline closest to that in the original study (R2 \&amp;gt; 0), which is consistent with its findings. Moreover, using derived data provided by the authors of the original study, we were able to make an exact reproduction and managed to obtain results that were close to the original ones. The challenges encountered while reproducing and replicating the original work are likely explained by the complexity of neuroimaging studies, in particular in clinical settings. We provide recommendations to further facilitate the reproducibility of such studies in the future.</description>

      <title>The Integrated Information Theory needs Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Integrated Information Theory (IIT) might be our current best bet at a scientific explanation of phenomenal consciousness. IIT focuses on the distinctively subjective and phenomenological aspects of conscious experience. Currently, it offers the fundaments of a formal account, but future developments shall explain the qualitative structures of every possible conscious experience. But this ambitious project is hindered by one fundamental limitation. IIT fails to acknowledge the crucial roles of attention in generating phenomenally conscious experience and shaping its contents. Here, we argue that IIT urgently needs an account of attention. Without this account, IIT cannot explain important informational differences between different kinds of experiences. Furthermore, though some IIT proponents celebratedly endorse a double dissociation between consciousness and attention, close analysis reveals that such as dissociation is in fact incompatible with IIT. Notably, the issues we raise for IIT will likely arise for many internalist theories of conscious contents in philosophy, especially theories with primitivist inclinations. Our arguments also extend to the recently popularized structuralist approaches. Overall, our discussion highlights how considerations about attention are indispensable for scientific as well as philosophical theorizing about conscious experience.</description>

      <title>Strong, but not weak, noise correlations are beneficial for population coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural correlations play a critical role in sensory information coding. They are of two kinds: signal correlations, when neurons have overlapping sensitivities, and noise correlations from network effects and shared noise. It is commonly thought that stimulus and noise correlations should have opposite signs to improve coding. However, experiments from early sensory systems and cortex typically show the opposite effect, with many pairs of neurons showing both types of correlations to be positive and large. Here, we develop a theory of information coding by correlated neurons which resolves this paradox. We show that noise correlations are always beneficial if they are strong enough, unless neurons are perfectly correlated by the stimulus. Extensive tests on retinal recordings under different visual stimuli confirm our predictions. Finally, using neuronal recordings and modeling, we show that for high dimensional stimuli noise correlation benefits the encoding of fine-grained details of visual stimuli, at the expense of large-scale features, which are already well encoded.</description>

      <title>Turing Video-based Cognitive Tests to Handle Entangled Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have proved in both human-based and computer-based tests that natural concepts generally 'entangle' when they combine to form complex sentences, violating the rules of classical compositional semantics. In this article, we present the results of an innovative video-based cognitive test on a specific conceptual combination, which significantly violates the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt version of Bell's inequalities ('CHSH inequality'). We also show that collected data can be faithfully modeled within a quantum-theoretic framework elaborated by ourselves and a 'strong form of entanglement' occurs between the component concepts. While the video-based test confirms previous empirical results on entanglement in human cognition, our empirical approach surpasses language barriers and eliminates the need for prior knowledge, enabling universal accessibility. Finally, this transformative methodology allows one to unravel the underlying connections that drive our perception of reality. As a matter of fact, we provide a novel explanation for the appearance of entanglement in both physics and cognitive realms.</description>

      <title>A Relativistic Theory of Consciousness (shorten version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a shorten version of the full paper that was published in the journal Frontiers of Psychology in May 2022. In recent decades, the scientific study of consciousness has significantly increased our understanding of this elusive phenomenon. Yet, despite critical development in our understanding of the functional side of consciousness, we still lack a fundamental theory regarding its phenomenal aspect. The phenomenal aspect of consciousness is the first-person answer to what it is like question, and it has thus far proved recalcitrant to direct scientific investigation. The question of how the brain, or any cognitive system, can create conscious experience out of neural representations poses a great conundrum to science. Naturalistic dualists argue that it is composed of a primitive, private, nonreductive element of reality. Illusionists, on the other hand, argue that it is merely a cognitive illusion. We contend that both the dualist and illusionist positions are flawed because they tacitly assume consciousness to be an absolute property that does not depend on the observer. We developed a conceptual and a mathematical argument for a relativistic theory of consciousness in which a system either has or does not have phenomenal consciousness with respect to some observer. According to the theory, Phenomenal consciousness is neither private nor delusional, just relativistic. In the frame of reference of the cognitive system, it will be observable (first-person perspective) and in other frame of reference it will not (third-person perspective). These two cognitive frames of reference are both correct, just as in the case of an observer that claims to be at rest while another will claim that the observer has constant velocity. Neither observer position can be privileged, as they both describe the same underlying reality.</description>

      <title>Supervised Learning without Backpropagation using Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity for Image Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel supervised learning approach for spiking neural networks that does not rely on traditional backpropagation. Instead, it employs spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) within a supervised framework for image recognition tasks. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated using the MNIST dataset. The model achieves approximately 40\% learning accuracy with just 10 training stimuli, where each category is exposed to the model only once during training (one-shot learning). With larger training samples, the accuracy increases up to 87\%, maintaining negligible ambiguity. Notably, with only 10 hidden neurons, the model reaches 89\% accuracy with around 10\% ambiguity. This proposed method offers a robust and efficient alternative to traditional backpropagation-based supervised learning techniques.</description>
