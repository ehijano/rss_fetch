      <description>arXiv:2512.19760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1999, Long and Reid proposed a proper action of a surface group on a product of trees. In this note, we show that the action is not proper.</description>

      <title>On non-freeness of groups generated by two parabolic matrices with rational parameters: limit points and the orbit test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, let $$G_{\alpha}:= \left&lt; \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} , \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ \alpha &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \right&gt; &lt; \mathrm{SL}_2 (\mathbb{R}).$$
  K. Kim and the first author established the orbit test, which provides a sufficient condition for $G_{\alpha}$ not to be a rank-$2$ free group. In this article, we present two main applications of the orbit test. First, using the corresponding modulo homomorphism, we show that the converse of the orbit test does not hold. In particular, we construct explicit counterexamples, all of which are rational. As another application, we construct sequences of non-free rational numbers converging to $3$. These sequences are given by $$ 3 + \frac{3}{2 (9 n - 1)} \quad \text{and} \quad 3 + \frac{9 n + 5}{3 (2 n + 1) (9 n + 4)},$$ and their construction relies on the orbit test together with a modified Pell's equation.</description>

      <title>Elementwise conservative actions and new constructions of boomerang subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that countable non-abelian free groups admit uncountably many mutually singular elementwise conservative non-singular random subgroups, which are supported on infinite subgroups of infinite index and singular with respect to every invariant random subgroup. This complements recent rigidity results for elementwise-conservative random subgroups in higher rank lattices by the first- and third-named authors. Our proof is based on a study of representations of free groups into measurable full groups in which the action of the first generator of the free group is fixed. We show that elementwise conservativity is generic among such representations in the sense of Baire category.</description>

      <title>Finite subgroups of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(K)$ arising from configurations of skew lines in $\mathbb{P}^3_K$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite groups arising from configurations of skew lines in $\mathbb{P}^3_K$. Given a finite set ${L}$ of pairwise skew lines in $\mathbb{P}^3_K$ and the associated groupoid $C_{L}$, we consider the endomorphism group $G_{L} \subset \operatorname{Aut}(L_i) \cong \operatorname{PGL}_2(K)$ for any line $L_i \in {L}$, and we ask which finite subgroups of $\operatorname{PGL}_2(K)$ can occur in this way.
  Using a matrix description of skew lines, we express the generators of $G_{L}$ in terms of a family of matrices $M_i \in \operatorname{GL}_2(K)$ and analyze $G_{L}$ in the abelian and non-abelian cases. In the abelian situation we show that, after a change of basis, the matrices $M_i$ are simultaneously upper triangular and we obtain explicit families realizing cyclic groups and $p$-semi-elementary groups of the form $C_p^m \rtimes C_n$. In the non-abelian case we prove that no dihedral group $D_n$ with $n \ge 3$ can occur, while we construct configurations with $G_{L} \cong A_4, S_4, A_5$ and describe their orbit structure.
  Viewed through the lens of $(a,b)$-geproci sets, these results provide a group-theoretic description of collinearly complete point sets and yield new examples of half-grid geproci sets.</description>

      <title>A note on the triple product property for finite groups with abelian normal subgroups of prime index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16730v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three non-empty subsets $S,T,U$ of a group $G$ are said to satisfy the triple product property (TPP) if, for elements $s,s' \in S$, $t,t' \in T$, $u,u' \in U$, the equation $s's^{-1}t't^{-1}u'u^{-1}=1$ holds if and only if $s = s'$, $t = t'$, $u = u'$. In this case $(S,T,U)$ is called a TPP triple of $G$ and $|S||T||U|$ is called the size of the triple. If $G$ is a finite group the triple product ratio of $G$ can be defined as the quantity $\rho(G) := \frac{\beta(G)}{|G|}$, where $\beta(G)$ is the largest size of a TPP triple of $G$, and a special case of this, the subgroup triple product ratio, is the quantity $\rho_0(G) := \frac{\beta_0(G)}{|G|}$, where $\beta_0(G)$ is the largest size of a TPP triple of $G$ composed only of subgroups. There is a conjecture that $\rho(G) \leq \frac{4}{3}$ if $G$ contains a cyclic subgroup of index $2$ \citep[Conjecture 7.6]{HM}. This note proves a more general version of this conjecture for subgroups by showing that $\rho_0(G) \leq \frac{p^2}{2p-1}$ if $G$ is any finite group which contains an abelian normal subgroup of prime index $p$, and discusses its implications for $\rho$ for groups with cyclic normal subgroups of prime index, based on the known data for $\rho$ in such groups of small order.</description>

      <title>Peripheral subgroups of Kleinian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conformal boundary of a hyperbolic $3$-manifold $M$ is a union of Riemann surfaces. If any of these Riemann surfaces has a nontrivial Teichm\"uller space, then the hyperbolic metric of $M$ can be deformed quasi-isometrically. These deformations correspond to small pertubations in the matrices of the holonomy group $ \pi_1(M) \subset \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C}) $, which together give an island of discrete representations around the identity map in $ X=\operatorname{Hom}(\pi_1(M), \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})) $. Determining the extent of this island is a hard problem. If $M$ is geometrically finite and its convex core boundary is pleated only along simple closed curves, then we cut up its conformal boundary in a way governed by the pleating combinatorics to produce a fundamental domain for $ \pi_1(M) $ that is combinatorially stable under small deformations, even those which change the pleating structure. We give a computable region in $X$, cut out by polynomial inequalities over $\mathbb{R}$, within which this fundamental domain is valid: all the groups in the region have peripheral structures that look `coarsely similar', in that they come from real-algebraically deforming a fixed conformal polygon and its side-pairings. The union of all these regions for different pleating laminations gives a countable cover, with sets of controlled topology, of the entire quasi-isometric deformation space of $ \pi_1(M) $ -- which is known to be topologically wild.</description>

      <title>On the classification of quantum symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, in order to classify Hopf algebra (co)actions on a given finite dimensional algebra up to equivalence, one should start with the classification of the possible cosupports (i.e. the sets of linear operators by which $H^*$ is acting) of Hopf algebra coactions and then consider dual Hopf algebra actions. As an application, we classify quantum symmetries of the set of two points and the algebra of dual numbers. In addition, we show that the straight line does not admit an (ungraded) universal coacting Manin Hopf algebra. Moreover, we prove that for $n\geqslant 14$ the full matrix algebra $M_n(\mathbb k)$ admits a nontrivial Hopf algebra coaction such that all Hopf algebra actions with the same restriction on the cosupport are trivial, i.e. the cosupport may reduce under the dualization and a finite dimensional algebra may have less equivalence classes of actions than coactions. Simultaneously, for any $n\geqslant 14$, we define an elementary grading on $M_n(\mathbb k)$ by an infinite group that cannot be regraded by any finite group. (The previously known lower bound was $n\geqslant 349$.)</description>

      <title>Transfers on $\mathbb A^1$-connected components of quasi-split groups and the norm principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the sheaf of $\mathbb A^1$-connected components of a quasi-split group over a perfect field is a strictly $\mathbb A^1$-invariant sheaf with (Voevodsky) transfers. As a consequence, we show that the norm principle holds for any quasi-split group over a perfect field.</description>
