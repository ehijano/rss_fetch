      <title>Attosecond-timing millimeter waves via Kerr optical frequency division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave oscillators underpin key applications in communication, spectroscopy, radar, and astronomy, yet their achievable spectral purity remains limited. Approaches that directly generate millimeter-wave carriers are fundamentally limited by quantum and thermal phase-noise processes. Here we show that these limits can be overcome by combining Kerr-induced optical frequency division in a chip-scale microresonator with a large-spacing dual-wavelength Brillouin laser. This 3.3 THz optical reference injection-locks a Kerr soliton microcomb, with a repetition rate that becomes a coherently divided 300 GHz carrier with phase noise below the quantum limit of a corresponding 300 GHz dual-wavelength Brillouin laser and far below the thermo-refractive noise of a microring resonator. Cross-correlation phase-noise measurements were developed to show that the resulting oscillator reaches a phase-noise floor of -152 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz offset, consistent with photodetection shot noise. Integration of the measured spectrum yields an RMS timing jitter of 135 as from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. These results establish optical frequency division as a generic method for generation of sub-terahertz carriers with coherence no longer constrained by direct-generation limits.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Gaussian Mode Profile in Gigahertz Surface-Acoustic-Wave Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) resonators operating at gigahertz (GHz) frequencies are widely used in wireless telecommunication and quantum information processing. Successful implementation of such resonators calls for detailed microscopic understanding of their mode profiles, energy dissipation channels, and imperfections from microfabrication. In this work, we report on the visualization of acoustic waves in LiNbO3 SAW resonators by transmission-mode microwave impedance microscopy (TMIM). The Gaussian mode profile tightly confined by reflecting mirrors is vividly seen in the TMIM images, from which the linewidth of the resonator itself can be extracted. The spatially resolved acoustic profile also allows us to perform failure analysis on faulty devices. Our work establishes a pathway for further optimization of SAW resonators for classical and quantum acoustic applications.</description>

      <title>Optical Manipulation of Erythrocytes via Evanescent Waves: Assessing Glucose-Induced Mobility Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of red blood cells (RBCs) under the influence of evanescent waves generated by total internal reflection (TIR). Using a 1064 nm laser system and a dual-chamber prism setup, we quantified the mobility of erythrocytes in different glucose environments. Our methodology integrates automated tracking via TrackMate\c{opyright} to analyze over 60 trajectory sets. The results reveal a significant decrease in mean velocity, from 11.8 {\mu}m/s in 5 mM glucose to 8.8 {\mu}m/s in 50 mM glucose (p = 0.019). These findings suggest that evanescent waves can serve as a non-invasive tool to probe the mechanical properties of cell membranes influenced by biochemical changes.</description>

      <title>An ultrafast diamond nonlinear photonic sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of light and materials technology is key to the creation of innovative sensing technologies. Sensing of electric and magnetic fields, and temperature with high spatio-temporal resolution is a critical task for the development of the next-generation of nanometer-scale quantum devices. Color centers in diamonds are attractive for potential applications owing to their characteristic quantum states, although they require metallic contacts for the introduction of external microwaves. Here, we build an ultrafast diamond nonlinear photonic sensor to assess the surface electric field; an electro-optic sensor based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in a diamond nanotip breaks the spatial-limit of conventional pump-probe techniques. The 10-fs near-infrared optical pulse modulates the surface electric field of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide and we monitor the dynamics of the local electric field at nanometer-femtosecond spatio-temporal resolutions. Our nanoscopic technique will provide new horizons to the sensing of advanced nano materials.</description>

      <title>{\sigma}h-Broken Induced Topological quasi-BIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitions from bound states in the continuum (BICs) to quasi-BICs (qBICs) are typically realized by introducing in-plane asymmetry, including permittivity asymmetry ({\epsilon}-qBICs) and geometry asymmetry (g-qBICs). Here, we demonstrate that when the in-plane symmetry is rigorously kept, the transition can also be occurred, provided the out-of-plane asymmetry is designed, which is called {\sigma}h -qBICs in this work. When the {{\sigma}h symmetry is gradually broken, the system undergoes a topological phase transition characterized by a Zak phase inversion, leading to a band inversion between quadrupole and dipole modes. This process not only enables controlled radiation coupling of BICs but also introduces a defect-immune qBIC regime. Our findings establish a general mechanism for engineering high-Q resonances and topologically robust plasmonic cavities.</description>

      <title>Head-wearable Holographic Head-mounted Display with 6 Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A head-mounted display (HMD) using holography technology (holo-HMD) is expected to be the next generation of HMDs capable of reducing three-dimensional sickness. In HMDs, it is important to generate images that respond to head movement in real time. However, in holo-HMDs, generation of hologram data in real time is difficult due to the large computational resources required. This paper proposes a fast calculation algorithm for generating hologram data for holo-HMDs, which requires low computational power. A holo-HMD supporting six degrees of freedom was also developed using this algorithm and it was confirmed that it obtained reconstructed images with six degrees of freedom in real time (30 fps or more).</description>

      <title>Adaptive information-maximization encoding for ghost imaging--A general Bayesian framework under experimental physical constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) has demonstrated diverse imaging capabilities enabled by its encoding-decoding-based computational imaging mechanism. Accordingly, information-theoretic studies have emerged as a promising avenue for probing the fundamental performance bounds of of GI and related computational imaging paradigms. However, the design of information-theoretically optimal encoding strategies remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the intractability of the prior probability density function (PDF) of an unknown scene. Here, by leveraging the ability of recursively estimating the PDF of the object to be imaged via Bayesian filtering, we propose to establish an adaptive information-maximization encoding (AIME) design framework. Based on the adaptively estimated posterior PDF from previously acquired measurements, the expected information gain of subsequent detections is evaluated and maximized to design the corresponding encoding patterns in a closed-loop manner. Within this framework, the theoretical form of the information-optimal encoding under representative physical constraints is analytically derived. Corresponding experimental results show that, GI systems employing information-optimal encoding achieve markedly improved imaging performance compared with conventional fixed point-to-point imaging without relying on additional heuristic regularization schemes, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes. Moreover, the proposed strategy consistently enables significantly enhanced information acquisition capability compared with existing encoding strategies, leading to substantially improved imaging quality. These results establish a principled information-theoretic foundation for optimal encoding design in computational imaging paradigms,provided that the forward model can be accurately characterized.</description>

      <title>Burst Mode Ultrafast Laser Welding of Sapphire and Fe-36Ni Alloy with Non-optical Contact Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast laser welding provides a promising approach for high precision integration of transparent and metallic materials. However, its practical application remains constrained by the precise regulation of the interfacial gap. This study investigates the interfacial response and bonding mechanism of sapphire and Fe-36Ni alloy joints under controlled non-optical contact conditions using burst mode ultrafast laser irradiation. A polymer interlayer was introduced between naturally stacked samples to establish a variable interfacial gap, allowing systematic evaluation of gap-dependent morphology, melting behavior, and elemental transport. By redistributing the pulse energy into sequential sub-pulses, the burst mode reconstructs the temporal energy-deposition process, yielding enhanced plasma-material coupling and stable thermal accumulation. Compared with single pulse irradiation, burst mode sustains continuous bonding across gaps exceeding 10 um--far beyond the failure threshold of the single pulse mode--and forms a fusion zone 82% larger. Fracture surface and cross-sectional analyses of SEM and EDS results confirm that sequential sub-pulses promote extensive sapphire melting, droplet-driven gap bridging, and enhanced Al-Fe interdiffusion at the interface. These results provide a scientific basis for high-gap-tolerance ultrafast laser welding and scalable integration of transparent-metal hybrid components in advanced optoelectronic and precision engineering applications.</description>

      <title>An optical transistor of the nonlinear resonant structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An optical transistor capable of simultaneous amplification and switching is theoretically proposed via cascaded second-order nonlinear interactions in a resonant structure. Two distinct operational schemes are analyzed. A single frequency scheme employs cascaded second harmonic generation and inverse second harmonic generation (SHG/iSHG) using two Type-I SHG interactions, whereas a dual frequency scheme employs cascaded SHG and optical parametric amplification (SHG/OPA). Exact theoretical solutions and numerical calculations show cascadable amplification and digital on/off switching. A new optical phenomenon of nonlinear transparency is predicted by the theoretical solutions and confirmed by the numerical solutions in each scheme of the cascaded SHG/iSHG and SHG/OPA. The single and dual frequency configurations satisfy the cascadability and fan-out criteria with power transfer ratios of 4.838 and 52.26 and power amplification factors of 48.38 and 522.6, respectively. These results indicate transistor-like performance at input powers in the milliwatt range, readily supplied by laser diodes. The proposed structure establishes a physically feasible and practically scalable route to optical transistors operating at high speed and low power for integrated photonic circuits, with broad applications in all optical communication and computing.</description>

      <title>Blue to Near-IR Integrated PZT Silicon Nitride Modulators for Quantum and Atomic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulation and control of lasers and optical signals is necessary for trapped-ion and cold neutral atom quantum systems. Given the diversity of atomic species, experimental modalities, and architectures, integrated optical modulators designed to operate across the visible to near-infrared spectrum are a key step towards portable, robust, and compact quantum computers, clocks, and sensors. Integrated optical modulators that are wavelength-independent, CMOS-compatible, and capable of maintaining low waveguide losses and a high resonator quality factor, DC-coupled broadband frequency response, and low power consumption, are essential for scalable photonic integration. Yet progress towards these goals has remained limited. Here we demonstrate four types of integrated stress-optic lead zirconate titanate (PZT) silicon nitride modulators: a coil Mach-Zehnder modulator, a coil pure phase modulator, and bus-coupled and add-drop ring resonator modulators, with operation from 493 nm to 780 nm. The coil MZM operates at 532 nm with a V${\pi}$ of 2.8V, a 0.4 MHz 3-dB bandwidth, and an extinction ratio of 21.5dB. The coil phase modulator operates at 493 nm with a V${\pi}$ of 2.8V and low residual amplitude modulation of -34 dB at a 1kHz offset. The bus-coupled ring resonator modulator operates at 493 nm and the add-drop ring resonator modulator operates at 780 nm. The ring-based modulators have an intrinsic quality factor of 3.4 million and 1.9 million, a linear tuning strength of 0.9 GHz/V and 1 GHz/V, and a 3-dB bandwidth of 2.6 MHz and 10 MHz, respectively. All four modulator designs maintain the low optical waveguide loss of SiN, are DC coupled with broadband frequency response, operate independent of wavelength, and consume only tens of nW per actuator. Such solutions unlock the potential for further integration with other precision SiN components to realize chip-scale atomic and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Monolithic tantalum pentoxide microrings with intrinsic Q factors exceeding 4X10(6)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5), as a silicon-photonic-compatible material platform, has garnered significant attention for high-performance integrated photonics due to its exceptional properties: a broad transparency window spanning from 0.28 um to 8 um, a moderate refractive index of 2.05 at 1550 nm, and an impressive nonlinear refractive index of 7.2X10^(-19) m^2/W. Despite these advantages, achieving low-loss fabrication of monolithic microrings on the Ta2O5 platform remains challenging due to its inherent hardness and brittleness, which often result in rough sidewalls and significant scattering losses. In this work, we successfully demonstrated monolithic Ta2O5 microring resonators with exceptionally high intrinsic and loaded quality (Q) factors. This was accomplished through the innovative application of photolithography-assisted chemo-mechanical etching (PLACE) technology. By optimizing the coupling region between the microring and the bus waveguide, as well as meticulously controlling surface roughness during fabrication, we achieved near-critical coupling in the resulting microrings. The devices exhibited loaded Q factors of 2.74X10(6) in the telecom band without employing expensive electron-beam lithography, showing an intrinsic Q factor as high as 4.47X10(6) and a low propagation loss of only 0.0732 dB/cm - representing the highest results reported for strongly confined Ta2O5-based microring resonators to date. This work paves the way for the development of advanced photonic devices on the Ta2O5 platform with low manufacturing cost, including low-threshold microlasers, highly sensitive sensors, broad bandwidth supercontinuum sources, and optical frequency combs.</description>

      <title>Explainable deep-learning detection of microplastic fibers via polarization-resolved holographic microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable identification of microplastic fibers is crucial for environmental monitoring but remains analytically challenging. We report an explainable deep-learning framework for classifying microplastic and natural microfibers using polarization-resolved digital holographic microscopy. From multiplexed holograms, the complex Jones matrix of each fiber was reconstructed to extract polarization eigen-parameters describing optical anisotropy. Statistical descriptors of nine polarization characteristics formed a 72-dimensional feature vector for a total of 296 fibers spanning six material classes, including polyamide 6, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide 6.6, polypropylene, cotton and wool. The designed fully connected deep neural network achieved an accuracy of 96.7 % on the validation data, surpassing that of common machine-learning classifiers. Explainable artificial intelligence analysis with Shapley additive explanations identified eigenvalue-ratio quantities as dominant predictors, revealing the physical basis for classification. An additional reduced-feature model with the preserved architecture exploiting only these most significant eigenvalue-based characteristics retained high accuracy (93.3 %), thereby confirming their dominant role while still outperforming common machine-learning classifiers. These results establish polarization-based features as distinctive optical fingerprints and demonstrate the first explainable deep-learning approach for automated microplastic fiber identification.</description>

      <title>Coherent Mode Decoupling: A Versatile Framework for High-Throughput Partially Coherent Light Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient wave-optics simulation of partially coherent light transport systems is critical for the design of advanced optical systems, ranging from computational lithography to diffraction-limited storage rings (DLSR). However, traditional approaches based on Coherent Mode Decomposition suffer from high computational costs due to the propagating massive sets of two-dimensional modes. In this paper, we propose the Coherent Mode Decoupling (CMDC) algorithm, a high-throughput computational framework designed to accelerate these simulations by orders of magnitude without compromising physical fidelity. The method factorizes 2D modes into efficient one-dimensional (1D) components, while crucially incorporating a subspace compression strategy to capture non-separable coupling effects. We demonstrated the generality and robustness of this framework in applications ranging from computational lithography to coherent beamlines of DLSR.</description>

      <title>Photorefraction Management in Lithium Niobate Waveguides: High-Temperature vs. Cryogenic Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium niobate sees widespread use in nonlinear and quantum optical devices, such as for sum- and difference-frequency generation or spontaneous parametric down-conversion. In lithium niobate waveguides, nonlinear optical processes are often limited by the so-called photorefractive effect, which limits the maximum input or output powers and impacts the nonlinear spectral response. Therefore, strategies for the management of photorefractive damage are a key consideration in device design. Usually, the photorefractive damage threshold, i.e. the maximal permissible operating power, can be increased by high temperature operation of devices. This approach, however, is not applicable in cryogenic environments, which may be required for specialized applications. To better understand the impact of photorefraction in nonlinear optical applications, we study the impact of photorefraction on the phase-matching spectra of two nonlinear-optical sum-frequency generation experiments at 1) high temperatures and 2) cryogenic temperatures. Furthermore, we present an approach to reduce the impact of photorefraction which is compatible with cryogenic operation. This comprises an auxiliary light source, propagating in the same waveguide, which is used to restore phase-matching spectra impacted by photorefraction, as well as reduce pyroelectric effects. Our work provides an alternative route to photorefraction management applicable to cryogenic environments, as well as in situations with tight energy budgets like space applications.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent Dielectric Permittivity of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising building blocks for quantum photonic devices. Optical properties of PNCs can be enhanced by integration with optical cavities or nanoantennas. Designing such structures requires accurate size dependent dielectric permittivity of PNCs. However, current reports provide primarily ensemble averaged values with limited access to the intrinsic response of individual PNCs. Here we suggest a methodology to reconstruct the size dependent complex dielectric permittivity of CsPbBr3 PNCs from the measured absorbance spectrum of colloidal solution. The permittivity of PNCs is modeled as a sum of Voigt profile oscillators, with the size dependent transition energies governed by the exciton effective mass. Using a transmission electron microscopy derived size distribution of the PNCs, the solution permittivity is obtained via Maxwell Garnett effective medium approximation. This permittivity is used in a transfer matrix method to simulate and fit the absorbance spectrum, from which the permittivity of PNCs is reconstructed. The extracted spectral linewidth from the imaginary part of the permittivity (78.4 meV) is consistent with single nanocrystal emission linewidths at room temperature. Finite element simulations show enhanced absorption cross section of a single PNC coupled to a nanoantenna, demonstrating applicability of the extracted permittivity. More generally, these findings provide a route to extract intrinsic permittivity of individual nanocrystals from absorbance measurements of their ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brightfield microscopy is central to wide range of biology, engineering, and histopathology; but is inherently limited to two-dimensional qualitative imaging, systematically investigating three-dimensional (3D) volumetric architecture. Here we introduce quantitative absorption tomography (QAT), a computational approach that quantitatively reconstructs high-resolution volumetric absorption coefficient distributions from brightfield focal stacks. By modeling absorption image formation in logarithmic intensity space and applying deconvolution with an absorption optical transfer function, QAT enables quantitative, spectrally resolved 3D absorption imaging without interferometry, sample rotation, or specialized hardware. We validate QAT using spectrally selective phantoms and demonstrate absorption-specific contrast complementary to refractive index tomography in living melanocytes and intact plant tissue. QAT further scales to millimeter-scale volumes of H&amp;E-stained human tissue, revealing 3D histological microarchitecture without serial sectioning. This approach extends brightfield microscopy toward practical 3D histopathology.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared high-sensitive cavity-free in-situ CO gas sensing based on up-conversion detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon monoxide (CO) is a significant indicator gas with considerable application value in atmospheric monitoring, industrial production and medical diagnosis. Its fundamental vibrational band locates around 4.6 $\upmu$m and has larger absorption line strength than that of overtone band, which is more suitable for the precise identification and concentration detection of CO. In this paper, the up-conversion detection is employed to convert the mid-infrared absorption signal obtained by TDLAS to the visible light band, then a silicon-based detector is utilized for detection. By which, we can achieve the highest sensitivity of 79.6 ppb under the condition of cavity-free in-situ with an absorption range length of only 0.14 m. Furthermore, the single-photon level real-time detection of CO concentration after the diffuse reflection is realized by using SPAD. This work demonstrates the merits of the up-conversion detection in terms of its functionality at room temperature and capacity for sensitivity detection. Furthermore, it presents a design and optimization methodology that has the potential to underpin the advancement of the method towards more practical applications, like industrial process monitoring, medical diagnosis and so on.</description>

      <title>On-chip Multimode Opto-electronic Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opto-electronic computing combines the complementary strengths of photonics and electronics to deliver ultrahigh computational throughput with high energy efficiency. However, its practical deployment for real-world applications has been limited by architectures that rely on delicate wavelength management or phase-sensitive coherent detection. Here, we demonstrate the first multimode opto-electronic neural network (MOENN) on a silicon-on-insulator platform. By utilizing orthogonal waveguide eigenmodes as independent information carriers, our architecture achieves robust single-wavelength computation that is inherently immune to spectral crosstalk and phase noise. The fabricated MOENN chip monolithically integrates all functional components, including input encoders, programmable mode-division fan-in/-out units, and most importantly, the nonlinear multimode activation functions. We report the system's versatility through in-situ training via a genetic algorithm, successfully resolving the nonlinear decision boundaries of a two-class dataset and achieving 92.1% accuracy on the Iris classification benchmark. Furthermore, we reconfigure the MOENN into a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, attaining an accuracy of 90.7% on the electrocardiogram-based emotion recognition task. This work establishes a new opto-electronic computing paradigm of simple control and excellent robustness, providing a compelling path toward scalable, deployable photonic intelligence.</description>

      <title>Bright Pulsed Squeezed Light for Quantum-Enhanced Precision Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed states of light enable enhanced measurement precision by reducing noise below the standard quantum limit. A key application of squeezed light is nonlinear microscopy, where state-of-the-art performance is limited by photodamage and quantum-limited noise. Such microscopes require bright, pulsed light for optimal operation, yet generating and detecting bright pulsed squeezing at high levels remains challenging. In this work, we present an efficient technique to generate high levels of bright picosecond pulsed squeezed light using a $\chi^2$ optical parametric amplification process in a waveguide. We measure $-3.2~\mathrm{dB}$ of bright squeezing with optical power compatible with nonlinear microscopy, as well as $-3.6~\mathrm{dB}$ of vacuum squeezing. Corrected for losses, these squeezing levels correspond to $-15.4^{+2.7}_{-8.7}~\mathrm{dB}$ of squeezing generated in the waveguide. The measured level of bright amplitude pulsed squeezing is to our knowledge the highest reported to date, and will contribute to the broader adoption of quantum-enhanced nonlinear microscopy in biological studies.</description>

      <title>Anomalous valley Hall dynamics of exciton-polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The valley degree of freedom in atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides provides a natural binary index for information processing. Exciton-polaritons formed under strong light-matter coupling offer a promising route to overcome the limited lifetime and transport of bare valley excitons. Here we report an anomalous optical valley Hall effect in a monolayer WS2 exciton-polariton system. Using polarization- and time-resolved real-space imaging, we directly visualize a symmetry-breaking spatial separation of polaritons from opposite valleys under linearly polarized excitation, accompanied by an ultrafast Hall drift velocity on the order of 10^5 m/s. This behaviour cannot be accounted for by conventional cavity-induced mechanisms and instead points to a strain-induced synthetic pseudomagnetic field acting on the excitonic component of polaritons. Our results establish exciton-polaritons as a high-speed and optically accessible platform for valley transport, opening pathways towards tunable valleytronic and topological photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Size of Phase-Space States Containing Sub-Planck-Scale Structures via Non-Gaussian Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe a metrological advantage in phase-space sensitivity for photon-added cat and kitten states over their original forms, due to phase-space broadening from increased amplitude via photon addition, albeit with higher energy cost. Using accessible non-classical resources, weak squeezing and displacement, we construct a squeezed state and two superposed states: the squeezed cat state and the symmetrically squeezed state. Their photon-added variants are compared with parity-matched cat and KSs using quantum Fisher information and fidelity. The QFI isocontours reveal regimes where KS exhibit high fidelity and large amplitude, enabling their preparation via Gaussian operations and photon addition. Similar regimes are identified for cat states enhanced by squeezing and photon addition, demonstrating improved metrological performance. Moreover, increased amplitude and thus larger phase-space area reduces the size of interferometric fringes, enhancing the effectiveness of quantum error correction in cat codes.</description>

      <title>Distance-Independent Atmospheric Refraction Correction for Accurate Retrieval of Fireball Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of fireball direction is essential for retrieving trajectories and velocities. Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method. As a result of this work, we provide open, publicly accessible software for calculating the delta z correction.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Imaging System Combining Hyperspectral and Laser Speckle Imaging for In Vivo Hemodynamic and Metabolic Monitoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the development and validation of a novel multimodal optical imaging platform that integrates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) to enable real-time, non-invasive mapping of tissue oxygenation, perfusion and metabolism, via blood flowmetry and targeting of oxy- (HbO2), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), as well as oxidized cytochrome-c-oxidase (oxCCO). The system architecture features a single high-speed camera and dual optical path, with synchronized alternating illumination: a filtered, supercontinuum laser for HSI and a He-Ne laser for LSCI. The system performances were evaluated through in vivo experiments on rat spinal cord under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, revealing coherent physiological changes in hemodynamics, metabolism and relative blood flow index (rBFI). These results demonstrate the potential of the platform for functional tissue imaging and quantitative dynamic monitoring of both oxygen delivery and consumption.</description>

      <title>Reaching the intrinsic performance limits of superconducting strip photon detectors up to 0.1 mm wide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as the highest performing photon-counting detectors, making them a critical technology in quantum photonics and photon-starved optical sensing. However, the performance of SNSPDs is limited not by the intrinsic properties of the superconducting film, but by edge-induced current crowding. Despite extensive materials optimization and increasingly demanding fabrication strategies aimed at mitigating this edge-limited behavior, the device edges continue to limit the maximum device operating current, thereby degrading key performance metrics. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from an edge-limited to a bulk-limited regime, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting "rails" placed on either side of the detector to suppress current crowding at the edges. We show that activation of the rails reduces the dark count rate by nine orders of magnitude and extends the photon detection plateau at 1550 nm by more than 40%. These results are demonstrated on detectors up to 0.1 mm wide, establishing an entirely new class of ultra-wide strip detectors that we call superconducting strip photon detectors (SSPD). Moreover, the ability to suppress edge current crowding using the rails provides a pathway toward SSPDs with strip widths extending into the mm-scale. Such devices will enable large-area, high efficiency SSPD arrays with infrared sensitivity and open new opportunities in applications ranging from biomedical imaging to deep space optical communication.</description>

      <title>Critical speed of a binary superfuid of light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the critical speed for superfluid flow of a two-dimensional (2D) binary superfluid of light past a polarization-sensitive optical obstacle. This speed corresponds to the maximum mean flow velocity below which dissipation is absent. In the weak-obstacle regime, linear-response theory shows that the critical speed is set by Landau's criterion applied to the density and spin Bogoliubov modes, whose relative ordering can be inverted due to saturation of the optical nonlinearity. For obstacles of arbitrary strength and large spatial extent, we determine the critical speed from the conditions for strong ellipticity of the stationary hydrodynamic equations within the hydraulic and incompressible approximations. Numerical simulations in this regime reveal that the breakdown of superfluidity is initiated by the nucleation of vortex-antivortex pairs for an impenetrable obstacle, and of Jones-Roberts soliton-type structures for a penetrable obstacle. Beyond superfluids of light, our results provide a general framework for the critical speed of 2D binary nonlinear Schr\"odinger superflows, including Bose-Bose quantum mixtures.</description>

Abstract: Dual symmetry is an intrinsic property of Maxwell's equations, corresponding to a global U(1) symmetry in vacuum, with helicity as the associated conserved quantity. In this paper, we investigate light propagation in a spin-degenerate medium using a field-theoretical approach and introduce an effective gauge field A_s that emerges from the localization of dual symmetry. Within the geometric optics approximation, we show that the helical trajectory of light rays reveals this gauge field as a manifestation of spin-orbit coupling. Although orbital-orbit coupling also arises in such systems, the spin-orbit interaction possesses deeper physical significance, as it originates from the intrinsic dual symmetry embedded in Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maximum baseline, and therefore resolution, of optical astronomical interferometers is limited by attenuation and phase noise within the optical path between the apertures and beam combiner, as well as the practical challenges of constructing optical delay lines more than a few hundred meters in length. We implement off-band phase stabilization on two fiber optic links of 85~km, creating a total baseline of 170~km. We show that the system is able to effectively phase stabilize signals from an incoherent pseudo-thermal source with a bandwidth of 11.2~nm. We are able to reduce the phase noise by 4-5 orders of magnitude between 1 and 100~Hz such that we could resolve an applied phase difference of 0.16~cycles per second with continuous measurement. We show that, with phase stabilization active, the interferometer is able to recover both first-order and second-order photon correlations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of this technique for long-baseline optical and quantum astronomical interferometers. The present results are limited by chromatic dispersion within the fiber, which can be mitigated using dispersion compensating modules.</description>

      <title>Galvanometer-scanning transient phase microscopy with balanced detection and arbitrary pump polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient absorption microscopy measures excited-state kinetics based on the imaginary part of the pump-induced perturbation to the complex refractive index, i.e. $\Im \{\Delta\mathcal N\}$, with applications in both materials and biomedical sciences. Its complement, transient phase microscopy, enabled by stable inline birefringent interferometry, measures the real part $\Re\{\Delta \mathcal N\}$. The ability to switch between absorption and phase measurements may yield a stronger signal, depending on the sample and probe wavelength. To date, however, transient phase has not been coupled with galvanometer scanners, thus limiting it to materials science applications and non-imaging spectroscopy. Here, we extend transient phase microscopy to operate in a galvanometer-scanning microscope with balanced detection, comparing amplitude and phase measurements in graphene (in which amplitude detection has the advantage), hemoglobin and red blood cells (in which phase detection has the advantage). We examine the impacts and limitations introduced by galvanometer scanning, in addition to relocation of the pump-probe combining dichroic to permit arbitrary polarization of the pump.</description>

      <title>Gouy phase-assisted Zeno effect for protecting light structure in random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying physical mechanisms that protect the information carried by various forms of structured light is one of the cornerstones of today's classical and quantum communications. Here we show that the purity of orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes can be protected against degradation in random media by leveraging two fundamental features of their own Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian dynamics, namely, Zeno effect -- frequent observations slow down the evolution -- , and Gouy phase -- the back-action of the observation. Repeated, OAM-dependent Gouy phase kicks imparted along the disturbing path by simple imaging systems trigger the optical Zeno effect that protects the input OAM mode against mode cross-talk that would broaden the OAM spectrum. Given the universality of the mechanism, the Gouy phase-assisted Zeno effect would protect propagation modes other than those of OAM, and the diverse forms of structured light built with them.</description>

      <title>Enhanced posterior sampling via diffusion models for efficient metasurfaces inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse design of metasurfaces faces inherent challenges due to the nonlinear and highly complex relationship between geometric configurations and their electromagnetic behavior. Traditional optimization approaches often suffer from excessive computational demands and a tendency to converge to suboptimal solutions. This study presents a diffusion-based generative framework that incorporates a dedicated consistency constraint and advanced posterior sampling methods to ensure adherence to desired electromagnetic specifications. Through rigorous validation on small-scale metasurface configurations, the proposed approach demonstrates marked enhancements in both accuracy and reliability of the generated designs. Furthermore, we introduce a scalable methodology that extends inverse design capabilities to large-scale metasurfaces, validated for configurations of up to $98 \times 98$ nanopillars. Notably, this approach enables rapid design generation completed in minute by leveraging models trained on substantially smaller arrays ($23 \times 23$). These innovations establish a robust and efficient framework for high-precision metasurface inverse design.</description>

      <title>Light-induced, fictitious magnetic trapping of cold alkali atoms using an optical tweezers-nanofiber hybrid platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04809v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a magnetic trapping scheme for cold 87Rb atoms based on light-induced fictitious magnetic fields generated by the evanescent field of an optical nanofiber (ONF) integrated with an optical tweezers. We calculate and compare the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the tweezers beam, combined with a quasi-linearly polarized ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers and ONF modes, we analyze the trap depths and the positions of the potential minima from the nanofiber surface. We show that, by varying the optical powers in the two fields, the trap position can be tuned over several hundred nanometers, while simultaneously influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom-surface position is essential for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near a dielectric surface and optimizing atom-photon interfaces for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Picogram-Level Nanoplastic Analysis with Nanoelectromechanical System Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: NEMS-FTIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a photothermal infrared spectroscopy-based approach for the chemical characterization and quantification of nanoplastics. By combining the high sensitivity of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) with the wide spectral range and ubiquity of commercially available Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers, NEMS-FTIR offers a time-efficient and cryogen-free option for the rapid, routine analysis of nanoplastics in aqueous samples. Polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride nanoplastics with nominal diameters ranging from 54 to 262 nm were analyzed by NEMS-FTIR with limits of detection ranging from 101 pg to 353 pg, one order of magnitude lower than values reported for pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of nanoplastics. The absorptance measured by NEMS-FTIR could be further converted to absolute sample mass using the attenuation coefficient, as demonstrated for polystyrene. Thanks to the wide spectral range of NEMS-FTIR, nanoplastic particles from different polymers could be readily identified, even when present in a mixture. The potential of NEMS-FTIR for the analysis of real samples was demonstrated by identifying the presence of nanoplastics released in water during tea brewing. Polyamide leachates in the form of fragments and smaller oligomers could be identified in the brewing water without sample pre-concentration, even in the presence of an organic matrix. Accelerated aging of the nylon teabags under elevated temperature and UV radiation showed further release of polyamide over time.</description>

      <title>Precision Bounds for Characterising Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements, alongside quantum states and processes, form a cornerstone of quantum information processing. However, unlike states and processes, their efficient characterisation remains relatively unexplored. We resolve this asymmetry by introducing a comprehensive framework for efficient detector estimation that reveals the fundamental limits to extractable parameter information and errors arising in detector analysis - the detector quantum Fisher information. Our development eliminates the need to optimise for the best probe state, while highlighting aspects of detector analysis that fundamentally differ from quantum state estimation. Through proofs, examples and experimental validation, we demonstrate the relevance and robustness of our proposal for current quantum detector technologies. By formalising a dual perspective to state estimation, our framework completes and connects the triad of efficient state, process, and detector tomography, advancing quantum information theory with broader implications for emerging technologies reliant on precisely calibrated measurements.</description>
