      <title>Asymptotic expansions for solutions of differential equations having a coalescing turning point and double pole, with an application to Legendre functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24104v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic behavior of solutions to the second-order linear differential equation $d^{2}w/dz^{2}={u^{2}f(\alpha,z)+g(z)}w$ is analyzed for a large real parameter $u$ and $\alpha\in[0,\alpha_{0}]$, where $\alpha_{0}&gt;0$ is fixed. The independent variable $z$ ranges over a complex domain $Z$ (possibly unbounded) on which $f(\alpha,z)$ and $g(z)$ are analytic except at $z=0$, where the differential equation has a regular singular point. For $\alpha&gt;0$, the function $f(\alpha,z)$ has a double pole at $z=0$ and a simple zero in $Z$, and as $\alpha\to 0$ the turning point coalesces with the pole. Bessel-function approximations are constructed for large $u$ involving asymptotic expansions that are uniformly valid for $z\in Z$ and $\alpha\in[0,\alpha_{0}]$. The expansion coefficients are generated by simple recursions, and explicit error bounds are obtained that simplify earlier results. As an application, uniform asymptotic expansions are derived for associated Legendre functions with large degree $\nu$, valid for complex $z$ in an unbounded domain and for order $\mu\in[0,\nu(1-\delta)]$, where $\delta&gt;0$ is arbitrary.</description>

      <title>The $q$-Laplace Transforms compared: the basic confluent hypergeometric function ${}_2\phi_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solving $q$-difference equations, and in the definition of $q$-special functions, we encounter formal power series in which the $n$th coefficient is of size $q^{-\binom{n}{2}}$ with $q\in(0,1)$ fixed. To make sense of these formal series, a $q$-Borel-Laplace resummation is required. There are three candidates for the $q$-Laplace transform, resulting in three different resummations. Surprisingly, the differences between these resummations have not been discussed in the literature.
  Our main result provides explicit formulas for these $q$-exponentially small differences. We also give simple Mellin--Barnes integral representations for all the basic hypergeometric ${}_r\phi_s$ functions and derive a third (discrete) orthogonality condition for the Stieltjes--Wigert polynomials.
  As the main application, we introduce three resummations for the ${}_2\phi_0$ functions which can be seen as $q$ versions of the Kummer $U$ functions. We derive many of their properties, including interesting integral and sum representations, connection formulas, and error bounds.</description>

      <title>On quantum large sieve inequalities and operator recovery from incomplete information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain large sieve type inequalities for the Rayleigh quotient of the restriction of phase space representations of higher rank operators, via an operator analogue of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The resulting bounds are referred to as `quantum large sieve inequalities'. On the shoulders of Donoho and Stark, we demonstrate that these inequalities guarantee the recovery of an operator whose phase-space information is missing or unobservable over a 'measure-sparse' region $\Omega $, by solving an $L^{1}$-minimization program in the complementary region $\Omega^{c}$, when the argument runs over an operator analogue of Feichtinger's algebra of integrable STFTs. This is an operator version of what is commonly known as `Logan's phenomenon'. Moreover, our results can be viewed as a deterministic, continuous variable version, on phase space, of `low-rank' matrix recovery, which itself can be regarded as an operator version of compressive sensing. Our results depend on an abstract large sieve principle for operators with integrable STFT and on a non-commutative analogue of the local reproducing formula in rotationally invariant domains (first stated by Seip for the Fock space of entire functions). As an application, we obtain concentration estimates for Cohen's class distributions and the Husimi function. We motivate the paper by comparing with Nicola and Tilli's Faber-Krahn inequality for the STFT, illustrating that norm bounds on a domain $\Omega $, obtained by large sieve methods, introduce a trade-off between sparsity and concentration properties of $\Omega $: If $\Omega $ is sparse, the large sieve bound may significantly improve known operator norm bounds, while if $\Omega $ is concentrated, it produces worse bounds.</description>

      <title>A natural decomposition of the Jacobi equation for some classes of $N$-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider several $N$-body problems. The main result is a very simple and natural criterion for decoupling the Jacobi equation for some classes of them. If $E$ is a Euclidean space, and the potential function $U(x)$ for the $N$-body problem is a $C^2$ function defined in an open subset of $E^N$, then the Jacobi equation along a given motion $x(t)$ writes $\ddot J=HU_x(J)$, where the endomorphism $HU_x$ of $E^N$ represents the second derivative of the potential with respect to the mass inner product.
  Our splitting in particular applies to the case of homographic motions by central configurations. It allows then to deduce the well known Meyer-Schmidt decomposition for the linearization of the Euler-Lagrange flow in the phase space, formulated twenty years ago to study the relative equilibria of the planar $N$-body problem. However, our decomposition principle applies in many other classes of $N$-body problems, for instance to the case of isosceles three body problem, in which Sitnikov proved the existence of oscillatory motions.
  As a first concrete application, for the classical three-body problem we give a simple and short proof of a theorem of Y. Ou, ensuring that if the masses verify $\mu=(m_1+m_2+m_3)^2/(m_1m_2+m_2m_3+m_1m_3)&lt;27/8$ then the elliptic Lagrange solutions are linearly unstable for any value of the excentricity.</description>

      <title>Sharp commutator estimates of all order for Coulomb and Riesz modulated energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove functional inequalities in any dimension controlling the iterated derivatives along a transport of the Coulomb or super-Coulomb Riesz modulated energy in terms of the modulated energy itself. This modulated energy was introduced by the second author and collaborators in the study of mean-field limits and statistical mechanics of Coulomb/Riesz gases, where control of such derivatives by the energy itself is an essential ingredient. In this paper, we extend and improve such functional inequalities, proving estimates which are now sharp in their additive error term, in their density dependence, valid at arbitrary order of differentiation, and localizable to the support of the transport. Our method relies on the observation that these iterated derivatives are the quadratic form of a commutator. Taking advantage of the Riesz nature of the interaction, we identify these commutators as solutions to a degenerate elliptic equation with a right-hand side exhibiting a recursive structure in terms of lower-order commutators and develop a local regularity theory for the commutators, which may be of independent interest.
  These estimates have applications to obtaining sharp rates of convergence for mean-field limits, quasi-neutral limits, and in proving central limit theorems for the fluctuations of Coulomb/Riesz gases. In particular, we show here the expected $N^{\frac{\mathsf{s}}{\mathsf{d}}-1}$-rate in the modulated energy distance for the mean-field convergence of first-order Hamiltonian and gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Effective equidistribution of Galois orbits for mildly regular test functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a detailed study on effective versions of the celebrated Bilu's equidistribution theorem for Galois orbits of sequences of points of small height in the $N$-dimensional algebraic torus, identifying the qualitative dependence of the convergence in terms of the regularity of the test functions considered. We develop a general Fourier analysis framework that extends previous results obtained by Petsche (2005), and by D'Andrea, Narv\'aez-Clauss and Sombra (2017).</description>
