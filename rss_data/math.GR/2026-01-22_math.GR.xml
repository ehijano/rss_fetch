      <title>On topologization of the extended bicyclic semigroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-discrete semigroup $T_1$-topologies on the extended bicyclic semigroup $\mathscr{C}_\mathbb{Z}$ are constructed. Also, we present topological conditions, when a semigroup (shift-continuous) $T_1$-topology on $\mathscr{C}_\mathbb{Z}$ is discrete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $G$ is a finite solvable group and $V$ is a finite, faithful and completely reducible $G$-module. Let $N$ be a nilpotent subgroup of $G$, then there exits $v \in V$ such that $|\bC_N(v)| \leq (|N|/p)^{1/p}$, where $p$ is the smallest prime divisor of $|N|$.</description>

      <title>A classification of regular maps with Euler characteristic $-pq$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a classification of regular maps with Euler characteristic $-pq$ for distinct primes $q&gt;p\geq 5$. This together with previous classification of regular maps with Euler characteristic $-2p,-3p$ and $-p^2$ completes the classification of regular maps with Euler characteristic $-pq$ for two primes $p$ and $q$. An interesting consequence is that, for every pair of twin primes $p$ and $q$ greater than $5$, there exist three regular maps with solvable automorphism groups and Euler characteristic $-pq$, up to duality and isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometry Invariance of discrete Higher Filling functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that homological filling functions over a ring $R$ equipped with the discrete norm are quasi-isometry invariants for all groups of type $\mathrm{FP}_n$. This confirms a conjecture of Bader-Kropholler-Vankov in the case of discrete norms. The proof uses a technique of equipping free chain complexes with a geometric structure, allowing for analogues of cellular constructions in the purely algebraic setting. As a further application we prove quasi-isometry invariance for a weighted version of integral and discrete filling functions originally introduced in the study of the rapid decay property.</description>

      <title>The Zariski Topology on Homeomorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zariski topology on a group G is the coarsest topology such that all sets of the form $\{x \in G | 1_G \neq g_0 x^{k_0} g_1 ... g_{l-1} x^{k_{l-1}} g_l\}$ are open. Originally introduced by Bryant as the verbal topology, it serves as a fundamental tool for investigating the topological structure of infinite groups and is always a $T_1$ topology with continuous shifts and inversion. Since the Zariski topology is coarser than every Hausdorff group topology on G, it provides a natural starting point for topologizing groups; specifically, for countable or abelian groups, it is known that the Zariski topology coincides with the Markov topology-the intersection of all Hausdorff group topologies on G.
  In this paper, we analyze the Zariski topology on various homeomorphism groups. We demonstrate that for the Thompson groups F and T, the Zariski (and thus Markov) topology coincides with the standard compact-open topology derived from their respective actions on $[0,1]$ and $S^1$. In contrast, we show that the Zariski (and thus Markov) topology on Thompson's group V is irreducible, and therefore neither Hausdorff nor a group topology. As V acts highly transitively on each of its orbits, this result stands in notable opposition to a theorem by Banakh et al, which establishes that the Zariski topology on any permutation group containing all finitely supported elements is a Hausdorff group topology.
  We also extend these investigations to Homeo$([0,1])$, Homeo$(S^1)$, and Homeo$(2^\omega)$. We conclude by providing a classification of the topological manifolds $M$ for which the homeomorphism group Homeo$(M)$ admits a Hausdorff Zariski topology.</description>

      <title>Center-preserving irreducible representations of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given finite groups $H \leq G$, a representation $\sigma$ of $G$ is called center-preserving on $H$ if the only elements of $H$ that become central under $\sigma$ are those that were already central in $G$. We prove that if $H$ has a faithful irreducible representation $\rho$, then at least one of the irreducible components of the induction $\operatorname{Ind}_H^G(\rho)$ is center-preserving on $H$. In consequence, $H$ has a faithful irreducible representation if and only if every finite group $G$ containing $H$ as a subgroup has an irreducible representation whose restriction to $H$ is faithful, and which is center-preserving on $H$. In addition, we give examples illustrating the sharpness of the statement, and discuss the connection with projective representations.</description>

      <title>Computing higher limits over the fusion orbit category via amalgams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study higher limits over the centric orbit category of a fusion system realized by an amalgamated product. In so doing we provide a novel technique for studying the Diaz-Park sharpness conjecture and prove it (in the case of the cohomology Mackey functors) for all the Clelland-Parker and Parker-Stroth fusion systems. This complements previous work from Henke, Libmand and Lynd. We further use the developed technique to study the Benson-Solomon fusion systems thus relating higher limits over the centric fusion orbit category of these systems with the signalizer functors described by Aschbacher and Chermak. We believe that the proposed technique can, in future work, be used as a first step in an induction argument that can bring us closer to providing an answer to this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Computing Embeddings and Isomorphisms of Finite Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06204</link>
      <description>arXiv:1603.06204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semigroup theory is a branch of abstract algebra, and it provides mathematical tools for the theory of computation. Finite semigroups can describe state transition systems and thus they model physically realizable computers. Engineering questions like `What is the minimal number of states to realize a particular computation?' and `Which type of computation is more capable?' translate into the algebraic tasks of constructing isomorphisms and embeddings between semigroups of different representations. The underlying problem is (sub)graph isomorphism, which is computationally difficult in general. We describe variations of backtrack search algorithms that exploit the algebraic properties of semigroups, and we carry out computational experiments to extend our algebraic knowledge. In particular, we report new computational results on transformation semigroups and on the more general family of diagram semigroups. We study the minimal degree representation problem, count distinct embeddings and work on an open problem of embedding into 2-generated subsemigroups.</description>

      <title>On the universality of fluctuations for the cover time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider random walks on finite vertex-transitive graphs $\Gamma$ of bounded degree. We find a simple geometric condition which characterises the cover time fluctuations: the suitably normalised cover time converges to a standard Gumbel variable if and only if $\mathrm{Diam}(\Gamma)^2 = o(n/\log n)$, where $n = |\Gamma|$. We prove that this condition is furthermore equivalent to the decorrelation of the uncovered set. The arguments rely on recent breakthroughs by Tessera and Tointon on finitary versions of Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth, which we leverage into strong heat kernel bounds, and refined quantitative estimates on Aldous and Brown's exponential approximation of hitting times, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Group Order is in QCMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we show that verifying the order of a finite group given as a black-box is in the complexity class QCMA. This solves an open problem asked by Watrous in 2000 in his seminal paper on quantum proofs and directly implies that the Group Non-Membership problem is also in the class QCMA, which further proves a conjecture proposed by Aaronson and Kuperberg in 2006. Our techniques also give improved quantum upper bounds on the complexity of many other group-theoretical problems, such as group isomorphism in black-box groups.</description>

      <title>From affine algebraic racks to Leibniz algebras and Yang-Baxter operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce analogues of algebraic groups called algebraic racks, which are pointed rack objects in the category of schemes over a ground field. Addressing a problem of Loday, we construct functors assigning left and right Leibniz algebras to affine algebraic racks. These functors are compatible with closed subracks and ideals, and they recover the Lie algebras of linear algebraic groups (via conjugation quandles) and the Leibniz algebras of algebraic Lie racks. We also study properties of coordinate algebras and Leibniz algebras of affine algebraic racks. Finally, we use rack schemes to functorially construct (co-)nondegenerate Yang-Baxter operators in various categories.</description>
