      <title>NGPU-LM: GPU-Accelerated N-Gram Language Model for Context-Biasing in Greedy ASR Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical n-gram language models are widely used for context-biasing tasks in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, existing implementations lack computational efficiency due to poor parallelization, making context-biasing less appealing for industrial use. This work rethinks data structures for statistical n-gram language models to enable fast and parallel operations for GPU-optimized inference. Our approach, named NGPU-LM, introduces customizable greedy decoding for all major ASR model types - including transducers, attention encoder-decoder models, and CTC - with less than 7% computational overhead. The proposed approach can eliminate more than 50% of the accuracy gap between greedy and beam search for out-of-domain scenarios while avoiding significant slowdown caused by beam search. The implementation of the proposed NGPU-LM is open-sourced.</description>

      <title>LLM-Synth4KWS: Scalable Automatic Generation and Synthesis of Confusable Data for Custom Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Custom keyword spotting (KWS) allows detecting user-defined spoken keywords from streaming audio. This is achieved by comparing the embeddings from voice enrollments and input audio. State-of-the-art custom KWS models are typically trained contrastively using utterances whose keywords are randomly sampled from training dataset. These KWS models often struggle with confusing keywords, such as "blue" versus "glue". This paper introduces an effective way to augment the training with confusable utterances where keywords are generated and grouped from large language models (LLMs), and speech signals are synthesized with diverse speaking styles from text-to-speech (TTS) engines. To better measure user experience on confusable KWS, we define a new northstar metric using the average area under DET curve from confusable groups (c-AUC). Featuring high scalability and zero labor cost, the proposed method improves AUC by 3.7% and c-AUC by 11.3% on the Speech Commands testing set.</description>

      <title>Interspeech 2025 URGENT Speech Enhancement Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a growing effort to develop universal speech enhancement (SE) to handle inputs with various speech distortions and recording conditions. The URGENT Challenge series aims to foster such universal SE by embracing a broad range of distortion types, increasing data diversity, and incorporating extensive evaluation metrics. This work introduces the Interspeech 2025 URGENT Challenge, the second edition of the series, to explore several aspects that have received limited attention so far: language dependency, universality for more distortion types, data scalability, and the effectiveness of using noisy training data. We received 32 submissions, where the best system uses a discriminative model, while most other competitive ones are hybrid methods. Analysis reveals some key findings: (i) some generative or hybrid approaches are preferred in subjective evaluations over the top discriminative model, and (ii) purely generative SE models can exhibit language dependency.</description>

      <title>Spoken question answering for visual queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Question answering (QA) systems are designed to answer natural language questions. Visual QA (VQA) and Spoken QA (SQA) systems extend the textual QA system to accept visual and spoken input respectively.
  This work aims to create a system that enables user interaction through both speech and images. That is achieved through the fusion of text, speech, and image modalities to tackle the task of spoken VQA (SVQA). The resulting multi-modal model has textual, visual, and spoken inputs and can answer spoken questions on images.
  Training and evaluating SVQA models requires a dataset for all three modalities, but no such dataset currently exists. We address this problem by synthesizing VQA datasets using two zero-shot TTS models. Our initial findings indicate that a model trained only with synthesized speech nearly reaches the performance of the upper-bounding model trained on textual QAs. In addition, we show that the choice of the TTS model has a minor impact on accuracy.</description>

      <title>Vision-Integrated High-Quality Neural Speech Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel vision-integrated neural speech codec (VNSC), which aims to enhance speech coding quality by leveraging visual modality information. In VNSC, the image analysis-synthesis module extracts visual features from lip images, while the feature fusion module facilitates interaction between the image analysis-synthesis module and the speech coding module, transmitting visual information to assist the speech coding process. Depending on whether visual information is available during the inference stage, the feature fusion module integrates visual features into the speech coding module using either explicit integration or implicit distillation strategies. Experimental results confirm that integrating visual information effectively improves the quality of the decoded speech and enhances the noise robustness of the neural speech codec, without increasing the bitrate.</description>

      <title>DeepFilterGAN: A Full-band Real-time Speech Enhancement System with GAN-based Stochastic Regeneration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a full-band real-time speech enhancement system with GAN-based stochastic regeneration. Predictive models focus on estimating the mean of the target distribution, whereas generative models aim to learn the full distribution. This behavior of predictive models may lead to over-suppression, i.e. the removal of speech content. In the literature, it was shown that combining a predictive model with a generative one within the stochastic regeneration framework can reduce the distortion in the output. We use this framework to obtain a real-time speech enhancement system. With 3.58M parameters and a low latency, our system is designed for real-time streaming with a lightweight architecture. Experiments show that our system improves over the first stage in terms of NISQA-MOS metric. Finally, through an ablation study, we show the importance of noisy conditioning in our system. We participated in 2025 Urgent Challenge with our model and later made further improvements.</description>

      <title>StressTest: Can YOUR Speech LM Handle the Stress?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within a spoken utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated. Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by introducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic data generation pipeline, and create Stress17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model, StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress reasoning and detection tasks.

      <title>EmergentTTS-Eval: Evaluating TTS Models on Complex Prosodic, Expressiveness, and Linguistic Challenges Using Model-as-a-Judge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Speech (TTS) benchmarks often fail to capture how well models handle nuanced and semantically complex text. Building on $\textit{EmergentTTS}$, we introduce $\textit{EmergentTTS-Eval}$, a comprehensive benchmark covering six challenging TTS scenarios: emotions, paralinguistics, foreign words, syntactic complexity, complex pronunciation (e.g. URLs, formulas), and questions. Crucially, our framework automates both test-case generation and evaluation, making the benchmark easily extensible. Starting from a small set of human-written seed prompts, we iteratively extend them using LLMs to target specific structural, phonetic and prosodic challenges, resulting in 1,645 diverse test cases. Moreover, we employ a model-as-a-judge approach, using a Large Audio Language Model (LALM) to assess the speech across multiple dimensions such as expressed emotion, prosodic, intonational, and pronunciation accuracy. We evaluate state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary TTS systems, such as 11Labs, Deepgram, and OpenAI's 4o-mini-TTS, on EmergentTTS-Eval, demonstrating its ability to reveal fine-grained performance differences. Results show that the model-as-a-judge approach offers robust TTS assessment and a high correlation with human preferences. We open source the evaluation $\href{https://github.com/boson-ai/EmergentTTS-Eval-public}{code}$ and the $\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/bosonai/EmergentTTS-Eval}{dataset}$.</description>

      <title>Spoken Language Modeling with Duration-Penalized Self-Supervised Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) operate on acoustic units obtained by discretizing self-supervised speech representations. Although the characteristics of these units directly affect performance, the interaction between codebook size and unit coarseness (i.e., duration) remains unexplored. We investigate SLM performance as we vary codebook size and unit coarseness using the simple duration-penalized dynamic programming (DPDP) method. New analyses are performed across different linguistic levels. At the phone and word levels, coarseness provides little benefit, as long as the codebook size is chosen appropriately. However, when producing whole sentences in a resynthesis task, SLMs perform better with coarser units. In lexical and syntactic language modeling tasks, coarser units also give higher accuracies at lower bitrates. We therefore show that coarser units aren't always better, but that DPDP is a simple and efficient way to obtain coarser units for the tasks where they are beneficial.</description>

      <title>Spectrotemporal Modulation: Efficient and Interpretable Feature Representation for Classifying Speech, Music, and Environmental Sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio DNNs have demonstrated impressive performance on various machine listening tasks; however, most of their representations are computationally costly and uninterpretable, leaving room for optimization. Here, we propose a novel approach centered on spectrotemporal modulation (STM) features, a signal processing method that mimics the neurophysiological representation in the human auditory cortex. The classification performance of our STM-based model, without any pretraining, is comparable to that of pretrained audio DNNs across diverse naturalistic speech, music, and environmental sounds, which are essential categories for both human cognition and machine perception. These results show that STM is an efficient and interpretable feature representation for audio classification, advancing the development of machine listening and unlocking exciting new possibilities for basic understanding of speech and auditory sciences, as well as developing audio BCI and cognitive computing.</description>

      <title>Exploring Spatiotemporal Emotional Synchrony in Dyadic Interactions: The Role of Speech Conditions in Facial and Vocal Affective Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how humans express and synchronize emotions across multiple communication channels particularly facial expressions and speech has significant implications for emotion recognition systems and human computer interaction. Motivated by the notion that non-overlapping speech promotes clearer emotional coordination, while overlapping speech disrupts synchrony, this study examines how these conversational dynamics shape the spatial and temporal alignment of arousal and valence across facial and vocal modalities. Using dyadic interactions from the IEMOCAP dataset, we extracted continuous emotion estimates via EmoNet (facial video) and a Wav2Vec2-based model (speech audio). Segments were categorized based on speech overlap, and emotional alignment was assessed using Pearson correlation, lag adjusted analysis, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Across analyses, non overlapping speech was associated with more stable and predictable emotional synchrony than overlapping speech. While zero-lag correlations were low and not statistically different, non overlapping speech showed reduced variability, especially for arousal. Lag adjusted correlations and best-lag distributions revealed clearer, more consistent temporal alignment in these segments. In contrast, overlapping speech exhibited higher variability and flatter lag profiles, though DTW indicated unexpectedly tighter alignment suggesting distinct coordination strategies. Notably, directionality patterns showed that facial expressions more often preceded speech during turn-taking, while speech led during simultaneous vocalizations. These findings underscore the importance of conversational structure in regulating emotional communication and provide new insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of multimodal affective alignment in real world interaction.</description>

      <title>Articulatory Feature Prediction from Surface EMG during Speech Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model for predicting articulatory features from surface electromyography (EMG) signals during speech production. The proposed model integrates convolutional layers and a Transformer block, followed by separate predictors for articulatory features. Our approach achieves a high prediction correlation of approximately 0.9 for most articulatory features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these predicted articulatory features can be decoded into intelligible speech waveforms. To our knowledge, this is the first method to decode speech waveforms from surface EMG via articulatory features, offering a novel approach to EMG-based speech synthesis. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between EMG electrode placement and articulatory feature predictability, providing knowledge-driven insights for optimizing EMG electrode configurations. The source code and decoded speech samples are publicly available.</description>

      <title>VietASR: Achieving Industry-level Vietnamese ASR with 50-hour labeled data and Large-Scale Speech Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has made remarkable progress but heavily relies on large-scale labeled data, which is scarce for low-resource languages like Vietnamese. While existing systems such as Whisper, USM, and MMS achieve promising performance, their efficacy remains inadequate in terms of training costs, latency, and accessibility. To address these issues, we propose VietASR, a novel ASR training pipeline that leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data and a small set of labeled data. Through multi-iteration ASR-biased self-supervised learning on a large-scale unlabeled dataset, VietASR offers a cost-effective and practical solution for enhancing ASR performance. Experiments demonstrate that pre-training on 70,000-hour unlabeled data and fine-tuning on merely 50-hour labeled data yield a lightweight but powerful ASR model. It outperforms Whisper Large-v3 and commercial ASR systems on real-world data. Our code and models will be open-sourced to facilitate research in low-resource ASR.</description>

      <title>Can Audio Reveal Music Performance Difficulty? Insights from the Piano Syllabus Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatically estimating the performance difficulty of a music piece represents a key process in music education to create tailored curricula according to the individual needs of the students. Given its relevance, the Music Information Retrieval (MIR) field depicts some proof-of-concept works addressing this task that mainly focuses on high-level music abstractions such as machine-readable scores or music sheet images. In this regard, the potential of directly analyzing audio recordings has been generally neglected, which prevents students from exploring diverse music pieces that may not have a formal symbolic-level transcription. This work pioneers in the automatic estimation of performance difficulty of music pieces on audio recordings with two precise contributions: (i) the first audio-based difficulty estimation dataset -- namely, Piano Syllabus (PSyllabus) dataset -- featuring 7,901 piano pieces across 11 difficulty levels from 1,233 composers; and (ii) a recognition framework capable of managing different input representations -- both unimodal and multimodal manners -- directly derived from audio to perform the difficulty estimation task. The comprehensive experimentation comprising different pre-training schemes, input modalities, and multi-task scenarios prove the validity of the proposal and establishes PSyllabus as a reference dataset for audio-based difficulty estimation in the MIR field. The dataset as well as the developed code and trained models are publicly shared to promote further research in the field.</description>

Abstract: The rapid progress of foundation models and large language models (LLMs) has fueled significantly improvement in the capabilities of machine learning systems that benefit from mutlimodal input data. However, existing multimodal models are predominantly built on top of pre-trained LLMs, which can limit accurate modeling of temporal dependencies across other modalities and thus limit the model's ability to jointly process and leverage multimodal inputs. To specifically investigate the alignment of text, video, and speech modalities in LLM-style (decoder-only) models, we consider a simplified multimodal generation task, Video-Text to Speech (VTTS): speech generation conditioned on both its corresponding text and video of talking people. The ultimate goal is to generate speech that not only follows the text but also aligns temporally with the video and is consistent with the facial expressions. In this paper, we first introduce Visatronic, a unified multimodal decoder-only transformer model that adopts an LLM-style architecture to embed visual, textual, and speech inputs into a shared subspace, treating all modalities as temporally aligned token streams. Next, we carefully explore different token mixing strategies to understand the best way to propagate information from the steps where video and text conditioning is input to the steps where the audio is generated. We extensively evaluate Visatronic on the challenging VoxCeleb2 dataset and demonstrate zero-shot generalization to LRS3, where Visatronic, trained on VoxCeleb2, achieves a 4.5% WER, outperforming prior SOTA methods trained only on LRS3, which report a 21.4% WER. Additionally, we propose a new objective metric, TimeSync, specifically designed to measure phoneme-level temporal alignment between generated and reference speech, further ensuring synchronization quality.

      <title>Circumventing shortcuts in audio-visual deepfake detection datasets with unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Good datasets are essential for developing and benchmarking any machine learning system. Their importance is even more extreme for safety critical applications such as deepfake detection - the focus of this paper. Here we reveal that two of the most widely used audio-video deepfake datasets suffer from a previously unidentified spurious feature: the leading silence. Fake videos start with a very brief moment of silence and based on this feature alone, we can separate the real and fake samples almost perfectly. As such, previous audio-only and audio-video models exploit the presence of silence in the fake videos and consequently perform worse when the leading silence is removed. To circumvent latching on such unwanted artifact and possibly other unrevealed ones we propose a shift from supervised to unsupervised learning by training models exclusively on real data. We show that by aligning self-supervised audio-video representations we remove the risk of relying on dataset-specific biases and improve robustness in deepfake detection.</description>

      <title>Nexus: An Omni-Perceptive And -Interactive Model for Language, Audio, And Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01879v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes an industry-level omni-modal large language model (LLM) pipeline that integrates auditory, visual, and linguistic modalities to overcome challenges such as limited tri-modal datasets, high computational costs, and complex feature alignments. Our pipeline consists of three main components: First, a modular framework enabling flexible configuration of various encoder-LLM-decoder architectures. Second, a lightweight training strategy that pre-trains audio-language alignment on the state-of-the-art vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL, thus avoiding the costly pre-training of vision-specific modalities. Third, an audio synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality audio-text data from diverse real-world scenarios, supporting applications such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech-to-Speech chat. To this end, we introduce an industry-level omni-modal LLM, Nexus. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our pipeline, yielding the following key findings:(1) In the visual understanding task, Nexus exhibits superior performance compared with its backbone model - Qwen2.5-VL-7B, validating the efficiency of our training strategy. (2) Within the English Spoken Question-Answering task, the model achieves better accuracy than the same-period competitor (i.e, MiniCPM-o2.6-7B) in the LLaMA Q. benchmark. (3) In our real-world ASR testset, Nexus achieves outstanding performance, indicating its robustness in real scenarios. (4) In the Speech-to-Text Translation task, our model outperforms Qwen2-Audio-Instruct-7B. (5) In the Text-to-Speech task, based on pretrained vocoder (e.g., Fishspeech1.4 or CosyVoice2.0), Nexus is comparable to its backbone vocoder on Seed-TTS benchmark. (6) An in-depth analysis of tri-modal alignment reveals that incorporating the audio modality enhances representational alignment between vision and language.</description>

      <title>A Novel Deep Learning Framework for Efficient Multichannel Acoustic Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a deep-learning framework for controlling multichannel acoustic feedback in audio devices. Traditional digital signal processing methods struggle with convergence when dealing with highly correlated noise such as feedback. We introduce a Convolutional Recurrent Network that efficiently combines spatial and temporal processing, significantly enhancing speech enhancement capabilities with lower computational demands. Our approach utilizes three training methods: In-a-Loop Training, Teacher Forcing, and a Hybrid strategy with a Multichannel Wiener Filter, optimizing performance in complex acoustic environments. This scalable framework offers a robust solution for real-world applications, making significant advances in Acoustic Feedback Control technology.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model Hidden Representations for Heart Rate Estimation from Auscultation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auscultation, particularly heart sound, is a non-invasive technique that provides essential vital sign information. Recently, self-supervised acoustic representation foundation models (FMs) have been proposed to offer insights into acoustics-based vital signs. However, there has been little exploration of the extent to which auscultation is encoded in these pre-trained FM representations. In this work, using a publicly available phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and a heart rate (HR) estimation model, we conduct a layer-wise investigation of six acoustic representation FMs: HuBERT, wav2vec2, wavLM, Whisper, Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), and an in-house CLAP model. Additionally, we implement the baseline method from Nie et al., 2024 (which relies on acoustic features) and show that overall, representation vectors from pre-trained foundation models (FMs) offer comparable performance to the baseline. Notably, HR estimation using the representations from the audio encoder of the in-house CLAP model outperforms the results obtained from the baseline, achieving a lower mean absolute error (MAE) across various train/validation/test splits despite the domain mismatch.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Disagreement-Diversity Active Learning for Bioacoustic Sound Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bioacoustic sound event detection (BioSED) is crucial for biodiversity conservation but faces practical challenges during model development and training: limited amounts of annotated data, sparse events, species diversity, and class imbalance. To address these challenges efficiently with a limited labeling budget, we apply the mismatch-first farthest-traversal (MFFT), an active learning method integrating committee voting disagreement and diversity analysis. We also refine an existing BioSED dataset specifically for evaluating active learning algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that MFFT achieves a mAP of 68% when cold-starting and 71% when warm-starting (which is close to the fully-supervised mAP of 75%) while using only 2.3% of the annotations. Notably, MFFT excels in cold-start scenarios and with rare species, which are critical for monitoring endangered species, demonstrating its practical value.</description>
