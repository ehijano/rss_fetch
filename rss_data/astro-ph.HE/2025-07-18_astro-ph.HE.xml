      <title>Three-dimensional Dynamics of Strongly Magnetized Ion-Electron Relativistic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 3D simulations of semirelativistic collisionless magnetic reconnection, where upstream ions are subrelativistic while electrons are ultrarelativistic. We employ the realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio and explore a range of upstream ion magnetization spanning two orders of magnitude, with our highest-magnetization run achieving unprecedentedly large domain sizes. Through a parameter scan, we find that as the system transitions from mildly to trans- and ultrarelativistic regimes the qualitative behavior of reconnection becomes strongly influenced by 3D effects mediated by drift-kink and flux-rope kink dynamics. As a result, magnetic-energy dissipation at high magnetizations, and the subsequent nonthermal particle acceleration, can become less efficient, contrary to general expectations for 3D relativistic reconnection. Our results have important implications for understanding reconnection in magnetized astrophysical scenarios, such as the surroundings of black holes and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>MUSEing on the host galaxies of Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of twenty tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies observed with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph on ESO VLT. We investigate the presence of extended emission line regions (EELRs) and study stellar populations mostly at sub-kpc scale around the host nuclei. EELRs are detected in 5/20 hosts, including two unreported systems. All EELRs are found at z&lt;0.045, suggesting a distance bias and faint EELRs may be missed at higher redshift. EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at z&lt;0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong relation, and &gt;45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs. Furthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the central black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and BPASS stellar evolution models. The youngest nuclear populations have typical ages of 1 Gyr and stellar masses below 2.5MSun. The populations that can produce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass stars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light curves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass stars. The found distributions are in tension with the masses of the stars derived using light curve models. Mass segregation of the disrupted stars can enhance the rate of TDEs from supersolar-mass stars but our study implies that low-mass TDEs should still be abundant and even dominate the distribution, unless there is a mechanism that prohibits low-mass TDEs or their detection.</description>

      <title>Systematics from NICER Pulse Profiles Drive Uncertainty in Multi-Messenger Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EOS) and mass distribution using a unified Bayesian inference framework that incorporates latest NICER measurements, including PSR J0614$-$3329, alongside gravitational wave data, radio pulsar masses, and nuclear theory. By systematically comparing four inference scenarios--varying in the inclusion of PSR J0614$-$3329 and in the pulse profile model used for PSR J0030+0451--we quantify the impact of observational and modeling choices on dense matter inference. We find that pulse profile systematics dominate EOS uncertainties: the choice of hot spot geometry for PSR J0030+0451 leads to significant shifts in the inferred stiffness of the EOS and maximum neutron star mass. In contrast, PSR J0614$-$3329 mildly softens the EOS at low densities, reducing the radius at \(1.4\,M_\odot\) by \(\sim 100\)~m. A Bayesian model comparison yields a Bayes factor of $\log_{10} \mathrm{BF} \approx 1.58$ in favor of the ST+PDT model over PDT-U, providing strong evidence that multi-messenger EOS inference can statistically discriminate between competing NICER pulse profile models. These results highlight the critical role of NICER systematics in dense matter inference and the power of joint analyses in breaking modeling degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Fermi-GBM Observations of GRB 230307A: An Exceptionally Bright Long-Duration Gamma-ray Burst with an Associated Kilonova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On March 7th, 2023 the \textit{Fermi} Gamma-ray Burst Monitor observed the second highest fluence gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever, GRB~230307A. With a duration beyond 100~s, GRB~230307A contains a multitude of rapidly-varying peaks, and was so bright it caused instrumental effects in the GBM detectors. The high fluence of this burst, (6.02 $\pm$ 0.02)$\times$10$^{-3}$ erg cm$^{-2}$, prompted rapid follow-up across the electro magnetic spectrum including the discovery of an associated kilonova. GRB~230307A is one of a few long GRBs with an associated compact merger origin. Three main temporal regions of interest are identified for fine time-resolution spectral analysis: triggering pulse, main emission, and late emission, and the parameter evolution is traced across these regions. The high flux of the burst allowed for the statistical preference of a more complex, physically-motivated model, the Double Smoothly Broken Power Law, over typical spectral fitting functions for GRBs. From this model the evolution of the parameters was found to be in accordance with those expected for synchrotron radiation in the fast-cooling regime. Additionally, it was found that the flux experiences a steep decline in late time intervals, a feature which is often attributed to high-latitude emission, which follows the dissipation episodes. Furthermore, GRB~230307A was found to have one of the highest inferred bulk Lorentz factors of $\Gamma = 1600$. GRB~230307A is a noteworthy burst in terms of flux alone, but additionally provides a unique insight into the possible temporal and spectral characteristics of a new long merger class of GRBs.</description>

      <title>MESA-QUEST: Modeling Quasi-Stars in MESA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole formation remains an unsolved problem. Quasi-stars have been suggested as a viable heavy-seeding mechanism. In this work, we implement methods for modeling quasi-stars previously used with the Cambridge STARS code into the 1D stellar evolution code MESA. The computational capabilities of MESA allow for more detailed simulations of quasi-star evolution due to its modularity and the ease of implementing of new physical processes and controls. Our implementation, the MESA Quasi-star Evolutionary Simulation Toolkit (MESA-QUEST), is available in a publicly accessible repository.</description>

      <title>The Physical Origin and Time Lag of Multi-Frequency Flares from SgrA*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sagittarius~A$^*$, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, exhibits flares across various wavelengths, yet their origins remain elusive. We performed 3D two-temperature General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows initialized from multi-loop magnetic field configuration onto a rotating black hole and conducted General Relativistic Radiative Transfer (GRRT) calculations considering contributions from both thermal and non-thermal synchrotron emission processes. Our results indicate that the polarity inversion events from the multi-loop magnetic field configurations can generate $138\,\rm THz$ flares consistent with observations with the help of non-thermal emission. By tracing the intensity evolution of light rays in GRRT calculations, we identify the precise location of the flaring region and confirm that it originates from a large-scale polarity inversion event. We observe time delays between different frequencies, with lower-frequency radio flares lagging behind higher frequencies due to plasma self-absorption in the disk. The time delay between near-infrared and 43 GHz flares can reach up to $\sim 50$ min, during which the flaring region gradually shifts outward, becoming visible at lower frequencies. Our study confirms that large-scale polarity inversion in a Standard And Normal Evolution (SANE) accretion flow with a multi-loop initial magnetic configuration can be a potential mechanism driving flares from Sgr~A$^*$.</description>

      <title>Finding strangelets in cosmic rays from HESS J1731-347, a possible strange quark star using the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypothesis that supernova remnants are key sources of Galactic cosmic rays gains support from evidence that HESS J1731-347 one of the few Galactic objects capable of accelerating hadronic cosmic rays to TeV energies may harbor an exotic strange quark star rather than a conventional neutron star. This conclusion stems from its unusually low mass and compact radius, which challenge standard neutron star models. If confirmed, such a quark star could generate cosmic rays through the transition from the two-flavor color-superconducting (2SC) phase to the color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase, potentially releasing strangelets, hypothetical strange quark matter particles. Detecting these strangelets in cosmic rays would provide groundbreaking evidence for quark matter. The future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), with its unmatched sensitivity and spectral resolution in the very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime, is uniquely positioned to search for their annihilation or decay signatures. We analyze theoretical predictions for these gamma-ray signals and evaluate CTA's potential to detect or constrain them. Additionally, we present an in-depth assessment of CTA observations of HESS J1731-347, focusing on spectral features that could confirm strangelet production. A positive detection would not only validate the existence of strange quark stars but also establish a direct link between quark matter and cosmic-ray acceleration, reshaping our understanding of compact objects and high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Einstein Probe Discovery of EP J182730.0-095633: A New Black Hole X-ray Binary Candidate in Faint Outburst?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole X-ray binaries (candidates) currently identified in our galaxy are mainly transient sources, with the majority discovered through the detection of their X-ray outbursts. Among these, only four were found during faint outbursts exhibiting peak X-ray luminosities $L_{\rm X}\lesssim10^{36}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$, likely due to the previous lack of sensitive, wide-field monitoring instruments in the X-ray band. In this Letter, we present the discovery of an intriguing X-ray transient, EP J182730.0-095633, via the Einstein Probe (EP) and subsequent multi-wavelength follow-up studies. This transient, located on the Galactic plane, experienced a faint and brief X-ray outburst lasting about 20 days. Its X-ray spectrum is non-thermal and consistent with a power-law model with a nearly constant photon index of $\Gamma \sim2$ throughout the outburst. A long-lasting millihertz quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) signal was detected in its X-ray light curve, centered around a frequency of $\sim0.04$ Hz. A transient near-infrared source was identified as its counterpart, although no optical emission was detectable, likely due to significant extinction. A radio counterpart was also observed, displaying an inverted radio spectrum with $\alpha\sim0.45$. The X-ray spectral and temporal characteristics, along with the multi-wavelength properties, indicate that the source is a faint low-mass X-ray binary, with the compact object likely being a black hole. This work demonstrates the potential of the EP in discovering new X-ray binaries by capturing faint-level X-ray outbursts.</description>

      <title>Hadronic acceleration in the young star cluster NGC 6611 inside the M16 region unveiled by Fermi-LAT: constraints on the acceleration efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Young Massive Star Clusters, long considered as potentially important sources of galactic cosmic rays, have recently emerged as gamma-ray emitters up to very high energies. Aims. In order to quantify the contribution of this source class to the pool of Galactic CRs, we need to estimate the typical acceleration efficiency of these systems. Methods. We search for emission in the GeV band, as most of the energy is emitted in this band. We perform an analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards the M16 region, a star-forming region also known as the Eagle Nebula, which hosts the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We model the acceleration at the stellar wind termination shock and the propagation through the wind-blown bubble to derive the energetics of the process and interpret the GeV observations. Results. We find significant GeV emission in correspondence of a molecular cloud associated to the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We interpret this as hadronic emission associated to particle accelerated at the cluster wind termination shock and propagated through the low-density wind-excavated bubble to the cloud. Our modeling allows us to put firm constraints on the acceleration efficiency in NGC 6611, assessing it between $\sim$ 1 % and $\sim$ 4 %.</description>

      <title>ALMA discovery of Punctum -- a highly polarized mm source in nuclear starburst galaxy NGC 4945</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a highly polarized millimeter (mm) continuum source in the central region of NGC 4945, identified through ALMA Band 3 observations. This starburst Seyfert 2 galaxy contains numerous compact mm sources, yet only one - located approximately 3.4" (~60 pc) from the galactic center and unresolved with ~0.1" resolution - exhibits an unusually high polarization degree of 50% $\pm$ 14%, likely originating from non-thermal synchrotron radiation. The source is faint, yet clearly detected in two separate epochs of observation taken 14 days apart, with flux of 0.104 $\pm$ 0.018 and 0.125 $\pm$ 0.016 mJy, as well as in earlier ALMA observations, showing no variability at any timescale. The spectral index remains stable within large uncertainties, -1.8 $\pm$ 2.5 and -1.3 $\pm$ 2.5. The source, which we further refer to as Punctum due to its compactness, revealed no clear counterparts in existing X-ray or radio observations. Assuming association with the central region of NGC 4945, we estimate upper limits for its luminosity of ~1 $\times$ 10$^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 3-6 keV X-ray band (from archival Chandra data) and ~5 $\times$ 10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 23 GHz (from archival ATCA data). A comparison of the radio, mm (including polarization), and X-ray properties with known astrophysical sources emitting synchrotron radiation, such as accreting neutron stars, supernova remnants, and non-thermal galactic filaments, revealed no clear match in any of these scenarios. The exact nature of this highly polarized source remains undetermined.</description>

      <title>Revealing tensions in neutron star observations with pressure anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure isotropy, i.e., radial pressure equal to tangential pressure, is often assumed when studying neutron stars. However, multiple physical mechanisms, including pion/kaon condensation, magnetic fields, superfluidity, dark matter clustering, and violations of general relativity, can lead to a pressure anisotropy. This work presents a comprehensive measurement of pressure anisotropy in neutron stars. Our analysis incorporates both an extensive set of nuclear experimental constraints and multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational wave detections and electromagnetic observations. The Bayesian framework employed marginalizes over equation of state uncertainties and allows the anisotropy to vary between individual neutron stars. We find the Bayes factor for anisotropy against isotropy is $e^{0.46}=10^{0.20}=1.58\gtrsim 3:2$. Additionally, the posterior indicates a population-wide preference for negative pressure anisotropy, with GW170817 serving as the primary contributor. The individual variability suggests density-scale-independent anisotropy, potentially attributable to magnetic fields, dark matter clustering, or deviations from general relativity rather than phase transitions. While the evidence for pressure anisotropy remains inconclusive, these results demonstrate that pressure anisotropy can be utilized as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying missing physics in neutron star modeling or revealing tension among observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>First Evidence for a QPO Triplet and Its Relativistic Precession Origin in RE J1034+396</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide a powerful tool for probing the structure of the innermost accretion flow and corona around supermassive black holes. RE~J1034+396, the most prominent AGN known to host an X-ray QPO, exhibits both short-term and long-term QPO evolution, offering a unique opportunity to investigate accretion disk and corona physics through its temporal behavior. We report a possible long-term ($\sim 92.2$ days) cyclic evolution of the QPO in RE~J1034+396, joining the detected QPO ($\sim 3730$ s) and its short-term ($\sim 17$ ks) modulation to form a possible QPO triplet, which is potentially the first such structure identified in an AGN. By applying the relativistic precession model to the QPO triplet, we constrain the black hole mass to $1.7^{+0.9}_{-0.8} \times 10^{6}\ M_\odot$, consistent with independent estimates, and find a low dimensionless black hole spin of $0.017^{+0.028}_{-0.012}$. We propose an exploratory model that involves a quasiperiodic ultra-fast outflow (UFO) within the framework of the relativistic precession model, explaining the QPO lag reversal, the modulation of hard-band QPO amplitude by soft-band flux, and the long-term evolution of timing properties. Supporting evidence includes blueshifted emission and absorption lines indicating a strong UFO at $\sim 0.3c$. This work provides new insights into the inner regions of AGN accretion disks and motivates further efforts in both numerical modeling and high-cadence timing observations.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Air-Shower Observables using a Universality-Based Model at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on solutions of the cascade equations, the air-shower universality is a framework that for all air showers with the same energy, zenith angle, depth of shower maximum, and muon number predicts the same longitudinal, lateral, and energy distributions of electromagnetic shower particles. We employ a universality-based model of shower development that incorporates hadronic particle components to reconstruct observables from extensive air showers produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The model can estimate key parameters, such as the depth of the shower maximum and the number of muons at the event level. We discuss the performance of the reconstruction algorithm using both air-shower simulations, and preliminary results obtained from the Phase-I data of the Pierre Auger Observatory.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength study of the high Galactic latitude supernova remnant candidate \snr\ associated with the Calvera pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G118.4+37.0 (Calvera's SNR), discovered as a faint radio ring at high Galactic latitude and coincident with extended Fermi/LAT gamma-ray emission, is likely associated to the X-ray pulsar 1RXS J141256.0+792204 (Calvera). Previous XMM-Newton data hinted at soft diffuse X-ray emission inside the ring but lacked sufficient exposure for detailed characterisation. We obtained new XMM-Newton observations, and produced count-rate images, equivalent width and median photon energy maps to identify optimal regions for spectral analysis. We complemented these observations with a reanalysis of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data and new Telescopio Nazionale Galileo observations aimed to search for Halpha emission. The X-ray diffuse emission is well described by a model of shock-heated plasma with temperature kT \sim 0.15 keV, mildly under-solar N and o abundances and densities ne=0.1-0.7 cm-3. According to our estimates, Calvera's SNR is 10-20 kya old and lies at a distance of 4-5 kpc. A distinti "Clump" region shows hared emission equally well described by a thermal (kT\sim 1.7 keV) or a non thermal model (Gamma \sim 2.7). The brightest X-ray area is close to the gamma-ray peak and to an isolated Alpha filament. G118.4+37.0 is a middle-aged remnant which expands in a tenuous medium and encountered a denser phase, likely the relic of the wind activity of the massive progenitor star. The estimated SNR distance is consistent within the uncertainties with that estimated for Calvera, confirming that this peculiar pulsar was born in the explosion of a massive star high above the Galactic disk. Our measured ambient density, together with the patchy morphology of the gamma-ray emission and the detection of Halpha filaments indicates that a hadronic origin is compatible with the gamma-ray flux, though a mixed leptonic-hadronic cannot be excluded</description>

      <title>Effect of Dark matter and $\sigma$-cut potential on radial and non-radial oscillation modes in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mesonic nonlinear (NL) interaction equation of state (EoS) employing the relativistic mean-field model and investigate the effect of $\sigma$-cut potential (NL-$\sigma$ cut) and dark matter (NL DM) on the non-radial and radial oscillation modes of neutron stars. For NL-$\sigma$ cut, we include the $\sigma$-cut potential $U_{cut} (\sigma)$ to study its effect. For the dark matter, we use the neutron decay anomaly model. For each model, we investigate two extreme EoSs, stiff and soft, that cover the entire allowed parameter range from the given model, consistent with the current astrophysical constraints. The EoS and the stellar properties, such as mass and radius, are calculated, and the effect of $\sigma$-cut and DM is discussed. Both non-radial and radial oscillation modes are computed in the general relativistic framework. We study the non-radial $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequency, damping time, and some qusi-universal relations connecting the frequencies of the $f$-mode to the average density and compactness. The analysis showed that the $f$ and $p_1$ mode frequencies at both 1.4~$M_{\odot}$ and the maximum mass configuration are higher in the NL DM model compared to the NL and NL-$\sigma$ models. The consistent alignment between our prior parameterizations and current calculations strongly supports the existence of quasi-universal relations that hold true irrespective of the particular matter components involved. For the radial oscillations, we compute 10 lowest-order modes ($f$, $p$), study the radial perturbations as well as the large frequency separation with NL-$\sigma$ cut and NL DM EoS, showing that the microphysics involved in the NS EoS is imprinted on the frequency separation between different nodes.</description>

      <title>Detection of low-luminosity X-ray pulsations from the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17511-3057: an ever-thinning thread between bright accretion and sub-luminous states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After nearly a decade in quiescence, the accreting millisecond pulsar IGR J17511$-$3057 displayed a new outburst on 2025 February 11, its third since discovery, following previous activity in 2009 and 2015. We report on an XMM-Newton Target of Opportunity observation performed on 2025 March 4, more than twenty days after the outburst onset. From the X-ray spectrum - well described by an absorbed Comptonization model - we estimated an unabsorbed 0.5$-$10 keV luminosity of $L_X \sim 7 \times 10^{33} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ (assuming a source distance equal to the upper limit of $6.9$ kpc). To place this in context, we analyzed an archival Chandra observation performed in 2019, which yielded a quiescent luminosity of $L_\mathrm{X,q} \sim 2 \times 10^{32} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ in the same energy band. Although this comparison indicates that the source was still well above its quiescent level during the XMM-Newton observation, the estimated low luminosity during the late stage of the 2025 outburst would typically place the source in the propeller regime. Nevertheless, we unexpectedly detected coherent X-ray pulsations with an amplitude peaking at $\sim$42% in the 0.3$-$3 keV band. We also observed a spectral softening compared to the early stages of the outburst. Finally, we report a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 60 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ on the source flux density at 5.5 GHz from ATCA observations acquired on 2025 April 12, following a decline of the accretion activity, as indicated by our analysis of NICER data from 2025 March 15, which revealed no significant X-ray pulsations at a luminosity level of $L_X \sim 1 \times 10^{34} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$. We discuss our findings in the context of other accreting millisecond pulsars and draw comparisons with transitional systems in the sub-luminous disk state.</description>

      <title>A Torus Remnant Revealed by the Infrared Echo of TDE AT2019qiz: Implications for the Missing Energy and QPE Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AT2019qiz is the first standard optical tidal disruption event (TDE) with detection of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), providing strong evidence for TDE-QPE association. Moreover, it belongs to the rare subset of optical TDEs with prominent infrared (IR) echoes revealed by the multi-epoch photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The IR light curve shows an early bump, followed by a steady rise until the second-to-last epoch, after which it appears to enter a plateau phase. The dust temperature decreased until the fourth epoch and remains approximately constant for the subsequent five epochs. We have fitted the last five epochs using a convex dust ring model, resulting in an inner radius $&gt;1.2$ pc. Such a large radius greatly exceeds the inner radius of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus for a $10^6\,M_{\odot}$ black hole and thus could be a torus remnant with the inner part having vanished, further supporting the unified scenario of recently faded AGNs, TDEs, and QPEs. Consequently, a connection between QPEs and IR-bright TDEs is naturally expected. Moreover, the echo requires at least a peak bolometric luminosity of $(6.6, 9.5, 1.0)\times 44 \,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ assuming silicate, silicon carbide, and graphite dust grains, respectively, all of which are significantly higher than the peak optical blackbody luminosity. It adds to the accumulating evidence that the missing energy of TDEs may lie in the unobservable extreme UV. This work highlights the unique value of IR echoes in the study of TDEs and QPEs, and a promising prospect in the era of the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, the successor to WISE.</description>

      <title>The pulsar wind nebula around B1853+01 in X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the results of a comprehensive analysis of X-ray observations carried out with \textit{Chandra}, \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{NuSTAR} of the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR B1853+01, located inside the W44 supernova remnant (SNR). Previous X-ray observations unveiled the presence of a fast-moving pulsar, PSR B1853+01, located at the southern edge of the W44 thermal X-ray emission region, as well as an elongated tail structure trailing the pulsar. Our analysis reveals, in addition, the presence of an ``outflow'' feature ahead of the pulsar extending for about 1 \arcmin ($\sim$ 1.0 pc at the distance of 3.2 kpc). At larger scales, the entire PWN seems to be surrounded by a faint, diffuse X-ray emission structure. The southern part of this structure displays the same unusual morphology as the ``outflow'' feature ahead of the pulsar, and extends along $\sim 6$ \arcmin ($\sim$ 5 pc) in the direction of the pulsar proper motion. In this report, a spatially-resolved spectral analysis for the different extended regions around PSR B1853+01 is carried out. For an updated value of the column density of $0.65_{+0.46}^{-0.42} \times 10^{22} ~\textrm{cm}^{-2}$, a power-law fit to the ``outflow'' region yields a spectral index $\Gamma \approx 1.24_{+0.23}^{-0.24}$, which is significantly harder than that of the pulsar ($\Gamma \approx 1.87_{+0.48}^{-0.43}$) and the pulsar tail ($\Gamma \approx 2.01_{+0.39}^{-0.38}$). We argue that both the ``outflow'' structure and the surrounding halo-like X-ray emission might be produced by high-energy particles escaping the PWN around PSR B1853+01, a scenario recently suggested also for other Bow-shock PWNe with jet-like structures and/or TeV halos.</description>

      <title>BASS LIII: The Eddington Ratio as the Primary Regulator of the Fraction of X-ray Emission in Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) emit radiation via accretion across the entire energy spectrum. While the standard disk and corona model can somewhat describe this emission, it fails to predict specific features such as the soft X-ray excess, the short-term optical/UV variability, and the observed UV/X-ray correlation in AGN. In this context, the fraction of AGN emission in different bands (i.e., bolometric corrections) can be useful to better understand the accretion physics of AGN. Past studies have shown that the X-ray bolometric corrections are strongly dependent on the physical properties of AGN, such as their luminosities and Eddington ratios. However, since these two parameters depend on each other, it has been unclear which is the main driver of the X-ray bolometric corrections. We present here results from a large study of hard X-ray-selected (14-195 keV) nearby ($z&lt;0.1$) AGN. Based on our systematic analysis of the simultaneous optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions of 236 unobscured AGN, we found that the primary parameter controlling the X-ray bolometric corrections is the Eddington ratio. Our results show that while the X-ray bolometric correction increases with the bolometric luminosity for sources with intermediate Eddington ratios ($0.01-1$), this dependence vanishes for sources with lower Eddington ratios ($&lt;0.01$). This could be used as evidence for a change in the accretion physics of AGN at low Eddington ratios.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of HD 49798, a bright, hydrogen-deficient sdO-type donor star in an accreting X-ray binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: HD 49798 is a bright ($m_{\rm V} = 8.287$), hot (effective temperature $T_{\rm eff} = 45000$ K) subdwarf star of the spectral type O (sdO). It is the only confirmed sdO-type mass-donor star of an X-ray binary that has a high-mass (1.28 $M_\odot$) white-dwarf or neutron-star primary with a spin period of only 13.2 s. Aims: Since a high-quality spectrum of HD 49798, obtained with the T\"ubingen Ultraviolet Echelle Spectrometer (TUES), that has never been analyzed before is available in the database of the Orbiting and Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (ORFEUS), we performed a spectral analysis based on observations from the far ultraviolet (FUV) to the optical wavelength range. Methods: We used advanced non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model atmospheres of the Tuebingen Model-Atmosphere Package (TMAP) to determine the effective temperature, the surface gravity ($\log g$), and the abundances of those elements that exhibit lines in the available observed spectra. Results: We determined $T_{\rm eff} = 45000 \pm 1000$ K, log (g / cm/s$^2$) = $4.46 \pm 0.10$, and re-analyzed the previously determined photospheric abundances of H, He, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, Fe, and Ni. For the first time, we measured the abundances of C, Ne, P, S, Cr, and Mn. Conclusons: Our panchromatic spectral analysis of HD 49798 -- from the FUV to the optical -- allowed to reduce the error limits of the photospheric parameters and to precisely measure the metal abundances. HD 49798 is a stripped, intermediate-mass (zero-age main sequence mass of about 7.15 $M_\odot$) He star with a mass of 1.14(+0.30/-0.24) $M_\odot$. At its surface it exhibits abundances that are the result of CNO-cycle and 3 alpha burning nucleosynthesis as well as enhanced Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni abundances.</description>

      <title>Comparing astrophysical models to gravitational-wave data in the observable space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comparing population-synthesis models to the results of hierarchical Bayesian inference in gravitational-wave astronomy requires a careful understanding of the domain of validity of the models fitted to data. This comparison is usually done using the inferred astrophysical distribution: from the data that were collected, one deconvolves selection effects to reconstruct the generating population distribution. In this letter, we demonstrate the benefits of instead comparing observable populations directly. In this approach, the domain of validity of the models is trivially respected, such that only the relevant parameter space regions as predicted by the astrophysical models of interest contribute to the comparison. We clarify that unbiased inference of the observable compact-binary population is indeed possible. Crucially, this approach still requires incorporating selection effects, but in a manner that differs from the standard implementation. We apply our observable-space reconstruction to LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data from their third observing run and illustrate its potential by comparing the results to the predictions of a fiducial population-synthesis model.</description>

      <title>Where is the Supervirial Gas? III. Insights from X-ray Shadow Observations and a revised Model for the Soft Diffuse X-ray Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shadow observations provide a powerful tool to separate foreground components of the soft diffuse X-ray background (SDXB) from the background components. Such observations have now established that the ``local'' foreground is made of the solar wind charge exchange and the local bubble, and the background emission is from the extended circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way and from the unresolved extragalactic sources. New data and careful analyses of the SDXB led to two new discoveries in recent years: (1) excess emission near 0.5 keV that is identified as the NVII emission line, and (2) excess emission near 0.8-1.0 keV that is identified with an additional, super-virial temperature hot thermal component of the CGM. The goal of this paper is to use Suzaku shadow observations along six sightlines to determine whether either of these components is from the ``local'' sources. We eliminate the ambiguity regarding the origin of NVII emission, ruling out the local origin. We confirm that the Milky Way CGM contains nitrogen-rich plasma, with a super-solar average (N/O) of 2.6+-0.5, and suggest that nitrogen-enhanced plasma is widespread throughout the CGM. We find super-solar Ne abundance in two sighlines, also from the CGM. Similarly, we rule out the local origin of the hot thermal component and confirm that it is present beyond the shadowing clouds. Furthermore, we provide a revised model of the soft diffuse X-ray background, which is crucial for extragalactic astronomy.</description>

      <title>Probing neutrino emission at GeV energies from compact binary mergers with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.13160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of multi-messenger astronomy has allowed for new types of source searches by neutrino detectors. We present the results of the search for 0.5-100 GeV astrophysical neutrinos detected with IceCube and emitted from compact binary mergers detected by the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA interferometers from their first run of observation (O1) to the end of the first part of the fourth (O4a). An innovative approach is used to lower the energy threshold to 0.5 GeV and to search for an excess of GeV neutrinos in time coincidence with astrophysical transient events. Furthermore, we use a statistical combination of all observations, a binomial test, to search for a subpopulation of neutrino emitters. No significant excess was found from the studied mergers, with a best post-trial $p$-value of $40\%$, and there is currently no hint of a population of GeV neutrino emitters found in the IceCube data (post-trial $p$-value = $81\%$).</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray emission from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151: Multi-messenger implications for ultra-fast outflows</title>

Abstract: The nuclear activity typical of Seyfert galaxies can drive powerful winds where high-energy phenomena occur. In spite of their high power content, the number of such non-jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected in gamma rays is very limited. 4FGL J1210.3+ 3928, a source recently discovered by the Fermi-LAT telescope, is spatially consistent with the blazar 1E 1217.9+3945 and NGC 4151, a Seyfert galaxy located at about 15.8 Mpc known for hosting ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) in its innermost core. We show that the localization of 4FGL J1210.3+3928 might be affected by fluctuations due to a superposition of the two nearby sources.
  We explore the possibility of NGC 4151 to be a high-energy source and we conclude that particle acceleration at the UFO wind termination shock can explain the luminosity and spectral shape of the observed gamma-ray flux, whereas the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution of 1E 1217.9+3945 disfavors it as the dominant GeV gamma-ray counterpart. Interestingly, NGC 4151 is also spatially coincident with a weak excess of neutrino events identified by the IceCube neutrino observatory. We compute the contribution of the UFO to such a neutrino excess and we discuss other possible emission regions such as the AGN nearest neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Constraining the Neutron Star Equation of State and Mass Distribution through Multimessenger Observations and Nuclear Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With ongoing advancements in nuclear theory and experimentation, together with a growing body of neutron star (NS) observations, a wealth of information on the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities has become accessible. Here, we utilize a hybrid EOS formulation that combines an empirical parameterization centered around the nuclear saturation density with a generic three-segment piecewise polytrope model at higher densities. We incorporate data derived from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), and from experiments such as PREX-II and CREX. Furthermore, we examine the influence of a total of 129 NS mass measurements up to April 2023, as well as simultaneous mass and radius measurements derived from the X-ray emission from surface hot spots on NSs. Additionally, we consider constraints on tidal properties inferred from the gravitational waves emitted by coalescing NS binaries. To integrate this extensive and varied array of constraints, we utilize a hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework to simultaneously deduce the EOS and the distribution of NS masses. We find that incorporating data from $\chi$EFT significantly tightens the constraints on the EOS of NSs near or below the nuclear saturation density. However, constraints derived from pQCD computations and nuclear experiments such as PREX-II and CREX have minimal impact.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Radio Signals from Radio-Band Gravitational Waves Converted from the Neutron Star Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can convert into electromagnetic waves in the presence of a magnetic field via the Gertsenshtein-Zeldovich (GZ) effect. The characteristics of the magnetic field substantially affect this conversion probability. This paper confirms that strong magnetic fields in neutron stars significantly enhance the conversion probability, facilitating detectable radio signatures of very high-frequency (VHF, $\left(10^6-10^{11}\mathrm{~Hz}\right)$) gravitational waves. We theoretically identify two distinct signatures using single-dish telescopes (FAST, TMRT, QTT, GBT) and interferometers (SKA1/2-MID): transient signals from burst-like gravitational wave sources and persistent signals from cosmological background gravitational wave sources. These signatures are mapped to graviton spectral lines derived from quantum field theory by incorporating spin-2 and mass constraints, resulting in smooth, featureless profiles that are critical for distinguishing gravitational wave signals from astrophysical foregrounds. FAST attains a characteristic strain bound of $h_c&lt;10^{-23}$, approaching $10^{-24}$ in the frequency range of $1-3\mathrm{~GHz}$ with a 6-hour observation period. This performance exceeds the $5 \sigma$ detection thresholds for GWs originating from primordial black holes (PBHs) and nears the limits set by Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Additionally, projections for SKA2-MID indicate even greater sensitivity. Detecting such gravitational waves would improve our comprehension of cosmological models, refine the parameter spaces for primordial black holes, and function as a test for quantum field theory. This approach addresses significant deficiencies in VHF GW research, improving detection sensitivity and facilitating the advancement of next-generation radio telescopes such as FASTA and SKA, which feature larger fields of view and enhanced gain.</description>

      <title>Collisionless shocks having relativistic velocities in relativistically hot plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shocks in relativistically hot plasmas are thought to exist in various high-energy astrophysical phenomena, but it is not clear how relativistic collisionless shocks are formed, whether particles are accelerated by the shock as in the case of cold upstream. In this work, collisionless shocks with a relativistic shock velocity in relativistically hot unmagnetized electron-positron plasmas are investigated by two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. It is shown that the upstream flow is dissipated by the Weibel instability, so that the relativistic collisionless shock is formed as in the case of cold upstream. The density and magnetic field structures around the shock front are almost independent of the upstream temperature when the spatial scale is normalized by the inertial length scale which takes into account the relativistic temperature. This can be understood by considering the pressure anisotropy, which asymptotically approaches a finite value due to the relativistic beaming effect, even as the temperature becomes relativistically hotter and hotter. In addition, as long as the shock velocity is relativistic, some particles are accelerated, forming a power-law energy spectrum similar to that in the cold upstream.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Solutions for Geometrically Thin Accretion Disks with Magnetically Driven Winds: Application to Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically derive self-similar solutions for a time-dependent, one-dimensional, magnetically driven accretion-disk-wind model based on the magnetohydrodynamic equations. The model assumes a geometrically thin, gas-pressure-dominated accretion disk and incorporates both magnetic braking and turbulent viscosity through an extended $\alpha$-viscosity prescription in the vertical and radial directions, respectively. The $\alpha$ parameter for the vertical stress is assumed to vary with the disk aspect ratio. We confirm that in the absence of a wind, our self-similar solutions agree with the classical solution of Cannizzo et al. (1990), in which the mass accretion rate follows a power-law decay with time as $t^{-19/16}$. This scaling has been widely used as a key indicator of the mass accretion rate in tidal disruption event (TDE) disks. In contrast, when a wind is present, both the mass accretion and mass loss rates decay more steeply than $t^{-19/16}$. Furthermore, we verify that the power-law indices of these rates are consistent with those obtained from the numerical simulations of Tamilan et al. (2024) at late times. In particular, our analytical solution demonstrates that magnetic braking leads to a more rapid decay of the mass accretion rate, mass loss rate, and bolometric luminosity. In the presence of a strong poloidal magnetic field, all three quantities asymptote to $t^{-5/2}$. This steep decay index can serve as a potential observational signature of magnetocentrifugally driven winds with strong poloidal magnetic fields in TDE disks.</description>

      <title>X-ray Spectral Variability as Probe of Multimessenger Emission in Blazar 5BZB J0630-24064</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray observations are essential for understanding the multimessenger emission mechanisms of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Blazars, a subset of AGN whose X-ray emission predominantly originates from relativistic jets, have been proposed as promising high-energy neutrino sources. In this work, we study the candidate neutrino-emitting blazar 5BZB J0630-24064, which has been observed over multiple epochs with the XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, Neil Gehrels Swift-XRT, and eROSITA observatories. Analysis of the X-ray spectra in the 2.0-10.0 keV band shows significant variability, with high flux states adhering to a power-law model indicative of jet emission. However, during low-flux states, the spectrum reveals an additional component at hard-X-rays, indicating a transition from jet-dominated to multi-component X-ray emission, possibly associated with hadronic processes. To investigate this spectral evolution, we tested various models and found it to be consistent with corona emission or photoionised absorption processes typically observed in obscured AGN. The identification of the X-ray spectral variability in 5BZB J0630-24064, combined with its potential for neutrino production, opens new perspectives in multimessenger astrophysics of blazars highlighting the synergies between the mechanisms of the jet and the nuclear environment.</description>

      <title>Wobbling around the clock: magnetically-driven quasi-periodic oscillations in pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are X-ray binary systems containing an accreting neutron star (NS) or black hole emitting at luminosities above the Eddington limit of a $10M_{\odot}$ black hole. Approximately 1900 (either confirmed or candidate) ULXs have been identified to date. Three systems have been confirmed to exhibit coherent signals consistent with NS spin frequencies and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the mHz range. Several interpretations for generating such QPOs have been proposed, including general relativistic frame-dragging effects. In this work, we test if an alternative model in which magnetically-driven precession of the inner accretion flow can self-consistently reproduce the observed NS spin and QPO frequencies for reasonable values for accretion rates and NS magnetic field strengths. For a range of parameters, we recover family of solutions with accretion rates $\approx10^{-7}$--$10^{-5}$\,M$_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$ and surface magnetic fields $\gtrsim10^{12}$\,G, in agreement with previous estimates. If validated, this interpretation could reconcile several observed properties of pulsating ULXs, including QPO frequencies and the observed high luminosities of these systems, in a self-consistent framework without requiring general relativistic effects and/or strong beaming due to specific viewing angles. Although the predictive power of the model is currently limited by parameter degeneracies and uncertainties, searching for and discovering more pulsating ULX systems will allow to further test or refute the proposed model.</description>

      <title>X-ray reflection spectroscopy with improved calculations of the emission angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reflection spectrum produced by a cold medium illuminated by X-ray photons is not isotropic and its shape depends on the emission angle. In the reflection spectrum of an accretion disk of a black hole, the value of the emission angle changes over the disk and, in general, is different from the value of the inclination angle of the disk because of the light bending in the strong gravitational field of the black hole. Current reflection models make some approximations, as calculating a reflection spectrum taking the correct emission angle at every point of the disk into account would be too time-consuming and make the model too slow to analyze observations. In a recent paper, we showed that these approximations are unsuitable to fit high-quality black hole spectra expected from the next generation of X-ray missions. Here, we present a reflection model with improved calculations of the emission angle that solves this problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sub-GeV dark matter particles can annihilate or decay producing e^\pm pairs which upscatter the low-energy photon fields in the Galaxy and generate an X-ray emission (via the Inverse Compton effect). Using X-ray data from XMM-Newton, INTEGRAL, NuSTAR and Suzaku, we derive new constraints on this class of dark matter (DM). For annihilating DM, they are significant for m_DM &gt; 100 MeV, and dominant if DM is p-wave annihilating. For decaying DM, they are the most stringent to date in the range m_DM ~400 MeV - 3 GeV$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on neutrino-DM interactions from TXS 0506+056 neutrino outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We constrain the neutrino-dark matter cross-section using the $13 \pm 5$ neutrino event excess observed by IceCube in 2014-2015 from the direction of the blazar TXS 0506+056. Our analysis takes advantage of the dark matter overdensity spike surrounding the supermassive black hole at the center of the blazar. In our results, we take into account uncertainties related to the different types of neutrino emission models and the features of the dark matter spike, considering cross-sections that scale with energy as $\sigma \propto (E_{\nu} /E_0)^n$, for values of $n = 1, 0, -1, -2$. In our best-case scenario, we obtain limits competitive with those derived from other active galaxies, tidal disruption events (TDEs), and the IC-170922A event.</description>

      <title>A Novel View on the Inner Crusts of Neo-Neutron Stars: exotic light nuclei, diffusional and thermodynamical stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on an extended nuclear statistical equilibrium model, we investigate the properties of non-accreted crusts of young and warm neo-neutron stars, i.e., of finite-temperature inhomogeneous dense matter in beta equilibrium. The first new feature is the appearance, in the deep inner crust, of an extensive and almost pure layer of neutron-rich light nuclei that extends up to the density of the transition to homogeneous matter. This layer may challenge the idea of nuclear pasta phases, significantly impact the transport properties and the crust crystallization process. Then, we raise the question of the (in)stability of the inner crust with respect to diffusion of ions (buoyancy) and demonstrate that our crust is stable, in contrast with the predictions of some other models. Finally, we show that subsaturated clusterized stellar matter is thermodynamically stable.</description>

      <title>New {\em ab initio} constrained extended Skyrme equations of state for simulations of neutron stars, supernovae and binary mergers: I. Subsaturation density domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In numerical simulations of core-collapse supernova and binary neutron stars mergers, information about the energetics and composition of matter is implemented via external tables covering the huge ranges of thermodynamic conditions explored during the astrophysical evolution. More than 120 general-purpose equation of state (EOS) tables have been contributed so far. Unfortunately, not all of them comply with current constraints from theoretical and experimental nuclear physics and astrophysical observations of neutron stars. Systematic investigations of the role that dense matter properties play in the evolution of these astrophysical phenomena require that more EOS tables are provided. We build a set of general-purpose EOS tables. At zero temperature, they comply with all currently accepted constraints, including {\em ab initio} chiral effective field theory calculations of pure neutron matter. This set is designed to explore a wide variety of the behaviors of the effective masses as functions of density, which is reflected into a wide range of thermal behaviors. We employ Brussels extended Skyrme interactions generated by means of Bayesian inference techniques. An extended nuclear statistical equilibrium model is developed for modeling sub-saturated inhomogeneous nuclear matter (NM). Here, we study the properties of sub-saturated inhomogeneous NM over wide ranges of density, temperature, and proton fraction. We analyze in detail the mechanisms of transition to homogeneous matter and estimate the transition density. Our key results include a thick layer of neutron rich isotopes of He or H in the inner crusts of neo-neutron stars, significant abundance of exotic isotopes of H and He in warm and neutron-rich matter and a detailed study of the thermodynamic stability of cold stellar matter. The EOS tables are publicly available in the \textsc{CompOSE} online database.</description>

      <title>Disruptions of stars and binary systems on chaotic orbits in an axisymmetric Milky Way center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-spherical potentials allow a wide range of trajectories, both regular and chaotic, whose periapse distances can vary orbit to orbit. In particular chaotic trajectories can bring a system arbitrarily close to the central massive black hole leading to a disruption. In this paper, we work with an observationally benchmarked model of the innermost 200 pc of the Milky Way and show that low z-angular momentum trajectories are commonly chaotic. We compute the timescales and properties of close pericenter passages, and compare the implied collisionless disruption rate to the well-studied collisional rate from 2-body scatterings. We find that the relative collisionless rate can dominate by orders of magnitude. Our calculations are relevant for a wide range of disruption phenomena, including the production of hypervelocity stars (HVSs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs). Most of these disruptions involve stars come from the Nuclear Stellar Cluster, with a pericenter distribution that strongly favours shallow encounters, and a preference for high inclination interactions. The latter implies that unbound disrupted material - whether ejected stars or stellar debris - would be preferentially directed towards the galactic poles. Many of our conclusions apply generally to any galaxy with a non-spherical galactic centre potential and central massive black hole.</description>

      <title>Spherical Orbital Dynamics and Relativistic Precession in Kerr-MOG Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and relativistic precessions of massive particles on spherical orbits around Kerr-MOG black holes in scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG). By employing the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we derive conserved quantities and analyze how the MOG parameter $\alpha$ and orbital tilt angle $\zeta$ influence the innermost stable spherical orbits (ISSOs) and orbital stability. We compute the nodal and periastron precession frequencies, finding that nodal precession increases monotonically with both black hole spin and MOG parameter, while periastron precession exhibits a more complex behavior: MOG amplifies curvature-induced effects, which can be partially counteracted by spin. Furthermore, to complement the orbital analysis, we examine the Lense-Thirring spin precession of a gyroscope and demonstrate its sensitivity to the MOG parameter, spin, and orbital tilt angle. These results reveal distinctive signatures of modified gravity in orbital dynamics and provide a potential observational probe to test deviations from general relativity near rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Simulation-based Inference for Gravitational Wave Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses. Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.</description>
