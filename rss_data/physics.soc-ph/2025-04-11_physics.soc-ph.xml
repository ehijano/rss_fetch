      <title>Reinforcement Learning Dynamics of Network Vaccination and Hysteresis: A Double-Edged Sword for Addressing Vaccine Hesitancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass vaccination remains a long-lasting challenge for disease control and prevention with upticks in vaccine hesitancy worldwide. Here, we introduce an experience-based learning (Q-learning) dynamics model of vaccination behavior in social networks, where agents choose whether or not to vaccinate given environmental feedbacks from their local neighborhood. We focus on how bounded rationality of individuals impacts decision-making of irrational agents in networks. Additionally, we observe hysteresis behavior and bistability with respect to vaccination cost and the Q-learning hyperparameters such as discount rate. Our results offer insight into the complexities of Q-learning and particularly how foresightedness of individuals will help mitigate - or conversely deteriorate, therefore acting as a double-edged sword - collective action problems in important contexts like vaccination. We also find a diversification of uptake choices, with individuals evolving into complete opt-in vs. complete opt-out. Our results have real-world implications for targeting the persistence of vaccine hesitancy using an interdisciplinary computational social science approach integrating social networks, game theory, and learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>Structural predictability of large-scale aircraft interaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex network theory has recently been proposed as a promising tool for characterising interactions between aircraft, and their downstream effects. We here explore the problem of networks' topological predictability, i.e. the dependence of their structure on the traffic level, but the apparent absence of significant inter-day variability. By considering smaller spatial scales, we show that the sub-networks corresponding to individual FIRs are highly heterogeneous and of low predictability; this is nevertheless modulated by the structure of airways, and specifically by the complexity in airspace usage. We further discuss initial results of the evolution of such properties across multiple spatial scales; and draw conclusions on the operational implications, specifically on efforts to limit downstream effects.</description>

      <title>Functional Understanding Of Quantum Technology Is Essential To The Ethical Debate About Its Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the innovative potential of quantum technologies comes into focus, so too does the urgent need to address their ethical implications. While many voices highlight the importance of ethical engagement, less attention has been paid to the conditions that make such engagement possible. In this article, I argue that technological understanding is a foundational capacity for meaningful ethical reflection on emerging technology like quantum technologies. Drawing on De Jong &amp; De Haro's account of technological understanding (2025a; 2025b), I clarify what such understanding entails and how it enables ethical enquiry. I contend that ethical assessment, first and foremost, requires an understanding of what quantum technologies can do - their functional capacities and, by extension, their potential applications. Current efforts to build engagement capacities among broader audiences - within and beyond academic contexts - tend, however, to focus on explaining the underlying quantum mechanics. Instead, I advocate a shift from a physics-first to a functions-first approach: fostering an understanding of quantum technologies' capabilities as the basis for ethical reflection. Presenting technological understanding as an epistemic requirement for meaningful ethical engagement may appear to raise the bar for participation. However, by decoupling functional understanding from technical expertise, this condition becomes attainable for a broader group, contributing not only to a well-informed but also to a more inclusive ethical debate.</description>

      <title>In itinere infections covertly undermine localized epidemic control in metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metapopulation models have traditionally assessed epidemic dynamics by emphasizing local in situ interactions within defined subpopulations, often neglecting transmission occurring during mobility phases in itinere. Here, we extend the Movement-Interaction-Return (MIR) metapopulation framework to explicitly include contagions acquired during transit, considering agents traveling along shared transportation networks. We reveal that incorporating in itinere contagion entails a notable reduction of the epidemic threshold and a pronounced delocalization of the epidemic trajectory, particularly significant in early-stage outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Echoes of Disagreement: Measuring Disparity in Social Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public discourse and opinions stem from multiple social groups. Each group has beliefs about a topic (such as vaccination, abortion, gay marriage, etc.), and opinions are exchanged and blended to produce consensus. A particular measure of interest corresponds to measuring the influence of each group on the consensus and the disparity between groups on the extent to which they influence the consensus. In this paper, we study and give provable algorithms for optimizing the disparity under the DeGroot or the Friedkin-Johnsen models of opinion dynamics. Our findings provide simple poly-time algorithms to optimize disparity for most cases, fully characterize the instances that optimize disparity, and show how simple interventions such as contracting vertices or adding links affect disparity. Finally, we test our developed algorithms in a variety of real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics and the unpredictability of opinion trajectories in an adaptive social network model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding opinion dynamics in social networks is critical for predicting social behavior and detecting polarization. Traditional approaches often rely on static snapshots of network states, which can obscure the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. In this study, we introduce a dynamic framework that quantifies the unpredictability of opinion trajectories using the normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. Our approach leverages an adaptive social network model where each node is characterized by three behavioral parameters - homophily, neophily, and social conformity - and where opinions evolve continuously according to a system of ordinary differential equations. The results reveal distinct nLZ complexity signatures for each node type: homophilic nodes exhibit consistently rising complexity, reflecting increasingly unpredictable opinion shifts that are counterintuitive given their tendency for similarity; neophilic nodes maintain low and stable complexity, suggesting that openness to novelty can, surprisingly, lead to stable opinion dynamics; and conformic nodes display a U-shaped complexity trend, transitioning from early opinion stagnation to later unpredictability. In fully heterogeneous networks, modest interaction effects emerge, with slight shifts in the unpredictability of each faction's trajectories. These findings underscore the importance of temporal analysis in uncovering hidden dynamical patterns, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying social adaptation and polarization.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Function Diversity and Specialization Across Socioeconomic and Biological Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Function diversity, or the range of tasks that individuals perform, is essential for productive organizations. In the absence of overarching principles, the characteristics of function diversity are seemingly unique to each domain. Here, we introduce an empirical framework and a mathematical model for the diversification of functions in a wide range of systems, such as bacteria, federal agencies, universities, corporations, and cities. Our findings reveal that the number of functions within these entities grows sublinearly with system size, with exponents ranging from 0.35 to 0.57, confirming Heaps' Law. In contrast, cities exhibit logarithmic growth in the occupation types. We generalize the Yule-Simon model to quantify a wide range of these empirical observations by introducing two new key attributes: a diversification parameter that characterizes the tendency for more populated functions to inhibit new function creation, and a specialization parameter that describes how a function's attractiveness depends on its abundance. These parameters allow us to position diverse systems, from microorganisms to metropolitan areas, within a two-dimensional abstract space. This mapping suggests underlying commonalities and differences in the foundational mechanisms that drive the growth of these systems.</description>

      <title>Destabilizing a Social Network Model via Intrinsic Feedback Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10868v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social influence plays a significant role in shaping individual sentiments and actions, particularly in a world of ubiquitous digital interconnection. The rapid development of generative AI has engendered well-founded concerns regarding the potential scalable implementation of radicalization techniques in social media. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamical Structure Function (DSF)), to identify perturbations that qualitatively alter the system's behavior while remaining as unobtrusive as possible. We examine two such scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations that introduce a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations of minimal norm and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that small but targeted alterations to network structure may lead to the radicalization of all agents, exhibiting the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by comparatively minuscule adjustments in social influence. Given that this method of identifying perturbations that are innocuous yet destabilizing applies to any suitable dynamical system, our findings emphasize a need for similar analyses to be carried out on real systems (e.g., real social networks), to identify the places where such dynamics may already exist.</description>
