      <title>Damping wings in the Lyman-{\alpha} forest: a model-independent measurement of the neutral fraction at 5.4&lt;z&lt;6.1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have positioned the endpoint of the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) at redshift $z \sim 5.3$. However, observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest have not yet been able to discern whether reionisation occurred slowly and late, with substantial neutral hydrogen persisting at redshift $\sim 6$, or rapidly and earlier, with the apparent late end driven by the fluctuating UV background. Gunn-Peterson (GP) absorption troughs are solid indicators that reionisation is not complete until $z=5.3$, but whether they contain significantly neutral gas has not yet been proven. We aim to answer this question by directly measuring, for the first time, the neutral hydrogen fraction ($x_\mathrm{HI}$) at the end of the EoR ($5 \lesssim z \lesssim 6$) in high-redshift quasars spectra. For high neutral fractions $x_\mathrm{HI}\gtrsim0.1$, GP troughs exhibit damping wing (DW) absorption extending over $1000$ km s$^{-1}$ beyond the troughs. While conclusively detected in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission lines of quasars at $z\geq7$, DWs are challenging to observe in the general Lyman-$\alpha$ forest due to absorption complexities and small-scale stochastic transmission features. We report the first successful identification of the stochastic DW signal adjacent to GP troughs at redshifts $z=5.6$ through careful stacking of the dark gaps in Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We use the signal to present a measurement of the corresponding global $x_\mathrm{HI}=0.19\pm0.07$ $(_{-0.16}^{+0.11})$ at $1\sigma$ $(2\sigma)$ at $z=5.6$ and a limit $x_\mathrm{HI}&lt;0.44$ at $z=5.9$. The detection of this signal demonstrates the existence of substantially neutral islands near the conclusion of the EoR, unequivocally signaling a late-and-slow reionization scenario.</description>

      <title>Damping Wing-Like Features in the Stacked Ly$\alpha$ Forest: Potential Neutral Hydrogen Islands at $z&lt;6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent quasar absorption line observations suggest that reionization may end as late as $z \approx 5.3$. As a means to search for large neutral hydrogen islands at $z&lt;6$, we revisit long dark gaps in the Ly$\beta$ forest in VLT/X-Shooter and Keck/ESI quasar spectra. We stack the Ly$\alpha$ forest corresponding to the edges of these Ly$\beta$ dark gaps and identify a damping wing-like extended absorption profile. The average redshift of the stacked forest is $z=5.8$. By comparing these observations with reionization simulations, we infer that such a damping wing-like feature can be naturally explained if these gaps are at least partially created by neutral islands. Conversely, simulated dark gaps lacking neutral hydrogen struggle to replicate the observed damping wing features. Furthermore, this damping wing-like profile implies that the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction must be $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle \geq 6.1 \pm 3.9\%$ at $z = 5.8$. Our results offer robust evidence that reionization extends below $z=6$.</description>

      <title>DESI Dark Energy Time Evolution is Recovered by Cosmologically Coupled Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from baryon acoustic oscillation measurements by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have found preliminary evidence that dark energy (DE) evolves with time, as parameterized by a $w_0 w_a$ equation of state. In this study, we point out that the DESI-preferred $w_0w_a$ models are recovered when a $w_0w_a$ model is fit to DE produced by baryon conversion in cosmologically coupled black holes (BHs). This recovery does not require any \emph{ad hoc} parameter adjustments; it solely depends on the independently measured cosmic star formation rate density. We discuss our result in the context of the missing baryon problem and the anomalously low sum of neutrino masses preferred by DESI. The global evolution of DE is an orthogonal probe of cosmological coupling, complementing constraints on BH mass growth from elliptical galaxies, stellar binaries, globular clusters, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA merging population, and X-ray binaries. A DE density that correlates with star formation is a natural outcome of cosmological coupling in BH populations.</description>

      <title>Improved model of the Supernova Refsdal cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 thanks to VLT/MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new VLT/MUSE observations of the Hubble Frontier Field (HFF) galaxy cluster MACS J1149.5+2223, lensing the well-known supernova "Refsdal" into multiple images, which enabled the first cosmological applications with a strongly lensed supernova. Thanks to these data, targeting a northern region of the cluster and thus complementing our previous MUSE program on the cluster core, we release a new catalog containing 162 secure spectroscopic redshifts. We confirm 22 cluster members, which were previously only photometrically selected, and detect ten additional ones, resulting in a total of 308 secure members, of which 63% are spectroscopically confirmed. We further identify 17 new spectroscopic multiple images belonging to 6 different background sources. By exploiting MUSE data, in combination with the deep HFF images, we develop an improved total mass model of MACS J1149.5+2223. This model includes 308 total mass components for the member galaxies and requires four additional mass profiles, one of which is associated with a cluster galaxy overdensity identified in the North, representing the DM mass distribution on larger scales. The values of the resulting 34 free parameters are optimized based on the observed positions of 106 multiple images from 34 different families, that cover the redshift range between 1.240 and 5.983. Our final model has a multiple image position rms value of 0.39", which is well in agreement with that of other cluster lens models. With this refined mass model, we pave the way towards even better strong-lensing analyses that will exploit the deep and high resolution observations with HST and JWST on a pixel level in the region of the supernova Refsdal host. This will increase the number of observables by around two orders of magnitudes, thus offering us the opportunity of carrying out more precise and accurate cosmographic measurements.</description>

      <title>The Significance of Void Shape: Neutrino Mass from Voronoi Void-Halos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive neutrinos suppress the growth of cosmic structure on nonlinear scales, motivating the use of information beyond the power spectrum to tighten constraints on the neutrino mass, for example by considering cosmic voids. It was recently proposed that constraints on neutrino mass from the halo mass function (HMF) can be improved by considering only the halos that reside within voids -- the void-halo mass function (VHMF). We extend this analysis, which made spherical assumptions about the shape of voids, to take into account the non-spherical nature of voids as defined by the Voronoi-tessellation-based void finder, VIDE. In turn, after accounting for one spurious non-spherical void, we find no evidence that the VHMF contains information beyond the HMF. Given this finding, we then introduce a novel summary statistic by splitting halos according to the emptiness of their individual environments, defined by the Voronoi cell volume each halo resides in, and combining the mass functions from each split. We name the corresponding statistic the VorHMF and find that it could provide information regarding neutrino mass beyond the HMF. Our work thus motivates the importance of accounting for the full shape of voids in future analyses, both in terms of removing outliers to achieve robust results and as an additional source of cosmological information.</description>

      <title>Model independent calibration for sound horizon combining observations of supernovae and transversal BAO measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sound horizon is a key theoretical prediction of the cosmological model that depends on the speed of sound and the rate of expansion in the early universe, before matter and radiation decoupled. The standard ruler for low redshift calibration of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) is a direct measurement that would exist even if the standard cosmological model and the standard assumptions of early physics did not. We propose a new model-independent method to calibrate sound horizon $r^h_s$ (relative standard ruler) by using the latest observations of SNe Ia and transversal BAO measurements. The final result reports $r_s^{h}=107.10^{+1.36}_{-1.32}$ $Mpc/h$ in the framework of the Pantheon dataset. This result changes to $r_s^{h}=105.63^{+1.33}_{-1.31}$ $Mpc/h$ when uses Pantheon+ dataset. Note that even without an estimate of dimensionless Hubble constant $h$, the combination of BAO and SNe Ia datasets already constrain the low-redshift standard ruler scale $r_s^{h}$ at the $\sim1.26\%$ level. More importantly, it is interesting to find that most of the $r_s^{h}$ obtained at high redshifts have a larger value (9 out of 15 results are larger than the result obtained by combining all BAOs). This finding may give us a better understanding of the discordance between the data sets or Hubble tension or reveal new physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Age of massive galaxies at redshift 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) data analyses have shown that massive red galaxies existed at redshifts $z&gt;6$, a discovery that is difficult to understand in the context of standard cosmology ($\Lambda $CDM). Here we analyze these observations more deeply by fitting a stellar population model to the optical and near-infrared photometric data. These fits include a main stellar population in addition to a residual younger population and with the same extinction for both (a lower extinction for the younger population is unphysical). Extra stellar populations or the inclusion of an AGN component do not significantly improve the fits. These galaxies are being viewed at very high redshifts, with an average $\langle z\rangle \approx 8.2$, when the $\Lambda$CDM Universe was only $\approx 600$ Myr old. This result conflicts with the inferred ages of these galaxies, however, which were on average between 0.9 and 2.4 Gyr old within 95% CL. Given the sequence of star formation and galaxy assembly in the standard model, these galaxies should instead be even younger than 290 Myr on average, for which our analysis assigns a probability of only $&lt;3\times 10^{-4}$ ($\gtrsim 3.6\sigma $ tension). This outcome may indicate the need to consider non-standard cosmologies. Nevertheless, our conclusions result from several approximations in stellar astrophysics and extinction, so they should be taken with a grain of salt. Further research is necessary to corroborate the possible existence of galaxies older than the $\Lambda $CDM universe at their observed redshifts.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Gravitational Lensing and SDSS BOSS cross-correlation measurement and constraints on gravity with the $E_G$ statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive new constraints on the $E_G$ statistic as a test of gravity, combining the CMB lensing map estimated from Data Release 6 (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope with SDSS BOSS CMASS and LOWZ galaxy data. We develop an analysis pipeline to measure the cross-correlation between CMB lensing maps and galaxy data, following a blinding policy and testing the approach through null and consistency checks. By testing the equivalence of the spatial and temporal gravitational potentials, the $E_G$ statistic can distinguish $\Lambda$CDM from alternative models of gravity. We find $E_G= 0.31^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ for ACT and CMASS data at 68.28\% confidence level, and $E_G = 0.49^{+0.14}_{-0.11}$ for ACT and LOWZ. Systematic errors are estimated to be 3\% and 4\% respectively. Including CMB lensing information from Planck PR4 results in $E_G = 0.34^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ with CMASS and $E_G= 0.43^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ with LOWZ. These are consistent with predictions for the $\Lambda$CDM model that best fits the Planck CMB anisotropy and SDSS BOSS BAO, where $E_G^{\rm GR} (z_{\rm eff} = 0.555) = 0.401\pm 0.005$ for CMB lensing combined with CMASS and $E_G^{\rm GR} (z_{\rm eff} = 0.316) = 0.452\pm0.005$ combined with LOWZ. We also find $E_G$ to be scale independent, with PTE $&gt;5\%$, as predicted by general relativity. The methods developed in this work are also applicable to improved future analyses with upcoming spectroscopic galaxy samples and CMB lensing measurements.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian, post-Born, three-dimensional, on-the-fly ray tracing algorithm for gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analyses of the next generation cosmological surveys demand an accurate, efficient, and differentiable method for simulating the universe and its observables across cosmological volumes. We present Hamiltonian ray tracing (HRT) -- the first post-Born (accounting for lens-lens coupling and without relying on the Born approximation), three-dimensional (without assuming the thin-lens approximation), and on-the-fly (applicable to any structure formation simulations) ray tracing algorithm based on the Hamiltonian formalism. HRT performs symplectic integration of the photon geodesics in a weak gravitational field, and can integrate tightly with any gravity solver, enabling co-evolution of matter particles and light rays with minimal additional computations. We implement HRT in the particle-mesh library \texttt{pmwd}, leveraging hardware accelerators such as GPUs and automatic differentiation capabilities based on \texttt{JAX}. When tested on a point-mass lens, HRT achieves sub-percent accuracy in deflection angles above the resolution limit across both weak and moderately strong lensing regimes. We also test HRT in cosmological simulations on the convergence maps and their power spectra.</description>

      <title>The future of cosmological likelihood-based inference: accelerated high-dimensional parameter estimation and model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We advocate for a new paradigm of cosmological likelihood-based inference, leveraging recent developments in machine learning and its underlying technology, to accelerate Bayesian inference in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we combine (i) emulation, where a machine learning model is trained to mimic cosmological observables, e.g. CosmoPower-JAX; (ii) differentiable and probabilistic programming, e.g. JAX and NumPyro, respectively; (iii) scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques that exploit gradients, e.g. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo; and (iv) decoupled and scalable Bayesian model selection techniques that compute the Bayesian evidence purely from posterior samples, e.g. the learned harmonic mean implemented in harmonic. This paradigm allows us to carry out a complete Bayesian analysis, including both parameter estimation and model selection, in a fraction of the time of traditional approaches. First, we demonstrate the application of this paradigm on a simulated cosmic shear analysis for a Stage IV survey in 37- and 39-dimensional parameter spaces, comparing $\Lambda$CDM and a dynamical dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM). We recover posterior contours and evidence estimates that are in excellent agreement with those computed by the traditional nested sampling approach while reducing the computational cost from 8 months on 48 CPU cores to 2 days on 12 GPUs. Second, we consider a joint analysis between three simulated next-generation surveys, each performing a 3x2pt analysis, resulting in 157- and 159-dimensional parameter spaces. Standard nested sampling techniques are simply not feasible in this high-dimensional setting, requiring a projected 12 years of compute time on 48 CPU cores; on the other hand, the proposed approach only requires 8 days of compute time on 24 GPUs. All packages used in our analyses are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Anthropic Selection for a Low-Entropy Past</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The definition of thermodynamic entropy is dependent on one's assignment of physical microstates to observed macrostates. As a result, low entropy in the distant past could be equivalently explained by selection of a particular observer. In this paper, I make the case that because we observe a low-entropy past everywhere even as we look further and further away, anthropic selection over observers does not explain the non-equilibrium state of the observed cosmos. Under a uniform prior over possible world states, the probability of a non-equilibrium past, given our local observations, decreases to zero as the size of the world tends toward infinity. This claim is not dependent on choice of observer, unless the amount of information used to encode the observer's coarse-graining perception function scales linearly with the size of the world. As a result, for anthropic selection to choose a world like the one we live in, the initial state of a universe with size $N$ must be low-information, having Kolmogorov complexity that does not scale with $N$.</description>

      <title>Axion baryogenesis puts a new spin on the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a rotating axion field that makes a transition from a matter-like equation of state to a kination-like equation of state around the epoch of recombination can significantly ameliorate the Hubble tension, i.e., the discrepancy between the determinations of the present-day expansion rate $H_0$ from observations of the cosmic microwave background on one hand and Type Ia supernovae on the other. We consider a specific, UV-complete model of such a rotating axion and find that it can relax the Hubble tension without exacerbating tensions in determinations of other cosmological parameters, in particular the amplitude of matter fluctuations $S_8$. We subsequently demonstrate how this rotating axion model can also generate the baryon asymmetry of our universe, by introducing a coupling of the axion field to right-handed neutrinos. This baryogenesis model predicts heavy neutral leptons that are most naturally within reach of future lepton colliders, but in finely-tuned regions of parameter space may also be accessible at the high-luminosity LHC and the beam dump experiment SHiP.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of self-replicating universes in black holes formed by dark matter-seeded stellar collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that dark matter with certain minimal properties can convert the majority of baryons in galaxies to black holes over hundred trillion year timescales. We argue that this has implications for cosmologies which propose that new universes are created in black hole interiors. We focus on the paradigm of cosmological natural selection, which connects black hole production to a universe's likelihood for existing. Further, we propose that the universe's timescale for entropy production could be dynamically linked to black hole production in a naturally selected universe. Our universe would fit this scenario for models of particle dark matter that convert helium white dwarfs to black holes in around a hundred trillion years, where the dominant source of entropy in our universe are the helium white dwarfs' stellar progenitors, which cease forming and burning also in around a hundred trillion years. Much of this dark matter could be discovered at ongoing experiments.</description>

      <title>In-situ Measurements of Dark Photon Dark Matter using Parker Solar Probe: Going beyond the Radio Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photon dark matter emerges as a compelling candidate for ultralight bosonic dark matter, detectable through resonant conversion into photons within a plasma environment. This study employs in-situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the first spacecraft to venture into the solar corona, to probe for DPDM signatures. The PSP in-situ measurements go beyond the traditional radio window, spanning frequencies between about 10 kHz and 20 MHz, a challenging range inaccessible to Earth-based radio astronomy. Additionally, the proximity of PSP to the resonant conversion location enhances the signal flux, providing a distinct advantage over ground-based observations. As a result, the PSP data establishes the most stringent constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ for DPDM frequencies between 70 kHz and 20 MHz, with values of $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}$. Investigating the data from STEREO satellites resulted in weaker constraints compared to those obtained from PSP. By utilizing state-of-the-art solar observations from space, we have surpassed the cosmic microwave background limits established in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Constraining regularization ambiguities in Loop Quantum Cosmology via CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to investigate the potential observational signals of different regularization ambiguities in loop quantum cosmological models, we systematically compute and compare the primordial scalar power spectra and the resulting angular power spectra in the standard loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and its Thiemann regularized versions -- modified LQC-I/II (mLQC-I/II), using both the dressed metric and the hybrid approaches. All three loop quantum cosmological models yield a non-singular bounce with a post-bounce physics that converges rapidly in a few Planck seconds. Using Starobinsky potential and the initial conditions for the background dynamics chosen to yield the same inflationary e-foldings, which are fixed to be $65$ in all three LQC models, we require that all three models result in the same scale-invariant regime for the primordial power spectrum with a relative difference of less than one percent. This permits us to explore the differences resulting from the deep Planck regime in the angular power spectrum. For the adiabatic states, our results demonstrate that the angular power spectrum predicted by the hybrid approach has a smaller deviation from the angular power spectrum predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model at large angles in comparison with the dressed metric approach for all three models. The angular power spectrum predicted by mLQC-I in both the hybrid and the dressed metric approaches shows the smallest deviation from the one predicted by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model at large angular scales, except for the case of fourth order adiabatic initial states in the hybrid approach. On the contrary, mLQC-II results in the largest deviations for the amplitude of the angular power spectrum at large angles and is most disfavored.</description>

      <title>WST - Widefield Spectroscopic Telescope: Motivation, science drivers and top-level requirements for a new dedicated facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope (WST) project. WST is a 12-metre wide-field spectroscopic survey telescope with simultaneous operation of a large field-of-view (3 sq. degree), high-multiplex (20,000) multi-object spectrograph (MOS), with both a low and high-resolution modes, and a giant 3x3 arcmin2 integral field spectrograph (IFS). In scientific capability, these specifications place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. In only 5 years of operation, the MOS would target 250 million galaxies and 25 million stars at low spectral resolution, plus 2 million stars at high resolution. Without need for pre-imaged targets, the IFS would deliver 4 billion spectra offering many serendipitous discoveries. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work in synergy with future ground and space-based facilities. We show how it can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; the origin of stars and planets; and time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST's uniquely rich dataset may yield unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The telescope and instruments are designed as an integrated system and will mostly use existing technology, with the aim to minimise the carbon footprint and environmental impact. We will propose WST as the next European Southern Observatory (ESO) project after completion of the 39-metre ELT.</description>

      <title>Systematic comparison of neural networks used in discovering strong gravitational lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient algorithms are being developed to search for strong gravitational lens systems owing to increasing large imaging surveys. Neural networks have been successfully used to discover galaxy-scale lens systems in imaging surveys such as the Kilo Degree Survey, Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) Survey and Dark Energy Survey over the last few years. Thus, it has become imperative to understand how some of these networks compare, their strengths and the role of the training datasets as most of the networks make use of supervised learning algorithms. In this work, we present the first-of-its-kind systematic comparison and benchmarking of networks from four teams that have analysed the HSC Survey data. Each team has designed their training samples and developed neural networks independently but coordinated apriori in reserving specific datasets strictly for test purposes. The test sample consists of mock lenses, real (candidate) lenses and real non-lenses gathered from various sources to benchmark and characterise the performance of each of the network. While each team's network performed much better on their own constructed test samples compared to those from others, all networks performed comparable on the test sample with real (candidate) lenses and non-lenses. We also investigate the impact of swapping the training samples amongst the teams while retaining the same network architecture. We find that this resulted in improved performance for some networks. These results have direct implications on measures to be taken for lens searches with upcoming imaging surveys such as the Rubin-Legacy Survey of Space and Time, Roman and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Coupled Scalar Fields Model and Cosmological Tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the kinetically coupled early dark energy (EDE) and scalar field dark matter to address cosmological tensions. The EDE model presents an intriguing theoretical approach to resolving the Hubble tension, but it exacerbates the large-scale structure tension. We consider the interaction between dark matter and EDE, such that the drag of dark energy on dark matter suppresses structure growth, which can alleviate large-scale structure tension. We replace cold dark matter with scalar field dark matter, which has the property of suppressing structure growth on small scales. We employed the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to constrain the model parameters, our new model reveals a non-zero coupling constant of $0.030 \pm 0.026$ at a 68% confidence level. The coupled model yields the Hubble constant value of $72.38^{+0.71}_{-0.82}$ km/s/Mpc, which resolves the Hubble tension. However, similar to the EDE model, it also obtains a larger $S_8$ value compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model, further exacerbating the large-scale structure tension. The EDE model and the new model yield the best-fit values of $0.8316$ and $0.8146$ for $S_8$, respectively, indicating that the new model partially alleviates the negative effect of the EDE model. However, this signature disappears when comparing marginalised posterior probabilities, and both models produce similar results. The values obtained from the EDE model and the new model are $0.822^{+0.011}_{-0.0093}$ and $0.819^{+0.013}_{-0.0092}$, respectively, at a 68% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Detecting Relativistic Doppler in Galaxy Clustering with Tailored Galaxy Samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to obtain a high-significance detection of relativistic effects on cosmological scales. Measurements of such effects would be instrumental for our understanding of the Universe, as they would provide a further confirmation of the validity of general relativity as the correct description of the gravitational interaction, in a regime very far from that of strong gravity, where it has been tested to exquisite accuracy. Despite its relevance, the detection of relativistic effects has hitherto eluded us, mainly because they are stronger on the largest cosmic scales, plagued by cosmic variance. Our work focuses on the cosmological probe of galaxy clustering, describing the excess probability of finding pairs of galaxies at a given separation due to them being part of the same underlying cosmic large-scale structure. We focus on the two-point correlation function of the distribution of galaxies in Fourier space -- the power spectrum -- where relativistic effects appear as an imaginary contribution to the real power spectrum. By carefully tailoring cuts in magnitude/luminosity, we are able to obtain two samples (bright and faint) of the same galaxy population, whose cross-correlation power spectrum allows for a detection of the relativistic contribution. In particular, we optimise the definition of the samples to maximise the detection significance of the relativistic Doppler term for both a low-$z$ Bright Galaxy Sample and a high-$z$ H$\alpha$ emission line galaxy population.</description>

      <title>Low- and high-redshift H II starburst galaxies obey different luminosity-velocity dispersion relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To determine whether or not H II starburst galaxies (H IIG) are standardizable candles, we study the correlation between the H$\beta$ luminosity ($L$) and the velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of the ionized gas from H IIG measurements by simultaneously constraining the $L-\sigma$ relation parameters and the cosmological model parameters. We investigate six flat and nonflat relativistic dark energy cosmological models. We find that low-redshift and high-redshift H IIG data subsets are standardizable but obey different $L-\sigma$ relations. Current H IIG data are too sparse and too non-uniformly distributed in redshift to allow for a determination of why the samples follow different relations, but it could be caused by the high-redshift sample containing relatively fewer intrinsically dimmer sources (Malmquist bias) or it could be a consequence of H IIG evolution. Until this issue is better understood, H IIG data cosmological constraints must be treated with caution.</description>

      <title>Neural style transfer of weak lensing mass maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new generative model of projected cosmic mass density maps inferred from weak gravitational lensing observations of distant galaxies (weak lensing mass maps). We construct the model based on a neural style transfer so that it can transform Gaussian weak lensing mass maps into deeply non-Gaussian counterparts as predicted in ray-tracing lensing simulations. We develop an unpaired image-to-image translation method with Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (Cycle GAN), which learn efficient mapping from an input domain to a target domain. Our model is designed to enjoy important advantages; it is trainable with no need for paired simulation data, flexible to make the input domain visually meaningful, and expandable to rapidly-produce a map with a larger sky coverage than training data without additional learning. Using 10,000 lensing simulations, we find that appropriate labeling of training data based on field variance allows the model to reproduce a correct scatter in summary statistics for weak lensing mass maps. Compared with a popular log-normal model, our model improves in predicting the statistical natures of three-point correlations and local properties of rare high-density regions. We also demonstrate that our model enables us to produce a continuous map with a sky coverage of $\sim166\, \mathrm{deg}^2$ but similar non-Gaussian features to training data covering $\sim12\, \mathrm{deg}^2$ in a GPU minute. Hence, our model can be beneficial to massive productions of synthetic weak lensing mass maps, which is of great importance in future precise real-world analyses.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signals From Early Matter Domination: Interpolating Between Fast and Slow Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An epoch of matter domination in the early universe can enhance the primordial stochastic gravitational wave signal, potentially making it detectable to upcoming gravitational wave experiments. However, the resulting gravitational wave signal is quite sensitive to the end of the early matter-dominated epoch. If matter domination ends gradually, a cancellation results in an extremely suppressed signal, while in the limit of an instantaneous transition, there is a resonant-like enhancement. The end of the matter dominated epoch cannot be instantaneous, however, and previous analyses have used a Gaussian smoothing technique to account for this, and consider only a limited regime around the fast transition limit. In this work, we present a study of the enhanced gravitational wave signal from early matter domination without making either approximation and show how the signal smoothly evolves from the strongly suppressed to strongly enhanced regimes.</description>

      <title>A unified linear intrinsic alignment model for elliptical and disc galaxies and the resulting ellipticity spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alignments of spiral galaxies were thought to result from tidal torquing, where tidal field of the cosmic large-scale structure exert torquing moments onto dark matter haloes, determining their angular momentum and ultimately the orientation of galactic discs. In this model, resulting intrinsic ellipticity correlations are typically present on small scales, but neither observations nor simulations have found empirical evidence; instead, simulations point at the possibility that alignments of disc galaxies follow a similar alignment model as elliptical galaxies, but with a weaker alignment amplitude. In our article we make the case for the theory of linear alignments resulting from tidal distortions of the galactic disc, investigate the physical properties of this model and derive the resulting angular ellipticity spectra, as they would appear as a contribution to weak gravitational lensing in surveys such as Euclid's. We discuss in detail on the statistical and physical properties of tidally induced alignments in disc galaxies, as they are relevant for mitigation of alignment contamination in weak lensing data, comment on the consistency between the alignment amplitude in spiral and elliptical galaxies and finally, estimate their observability with an Euclid-like survey.</description>

      <title>Joint constraints from cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering: internal tension as an indicator of intrinsic alignment modelling error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cosmological analyses it is common to combine different types of measurement from the same survey. In this paper we use simulated DES Y3 and LSST Y1 data to explore differences in sensitivity to intrinsic alignments (IA) between cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing. We generate mock shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering data, contaminated with a range of IA scenarios. Using a simple 2-parameter IA model (NLA) in a DES Y3 like analysis, we show that the galaxy-galaxy lensing + galaxy clustering combination ($2\times2$pt) is significantly more robust to IA mismodelling than cosmic shear. IA scenarios that produce up to $5\sigma$ biases for shear are seen to be unbiased at the level of $\sim1\sigma$ for $2\times2$pt. We demonstrate that this robustness can be largely attributed to the redshift separation in galaxy-galaxy lensing, which provides a cleaner separation of lensing and IA contributions. We identify secondary factors which may also contribute, including the possibility of cancellation of higher-order IA terms in $2\times2$pt and differences in sensitivity to physical scales. Unfortunately this does not typically correspond to equally effective self-calibration in a $3\times2$pt analysis of the same data, which can show significant biases driven by the cosmic shear part of the data vector. If we increase the precision of our mock analyses to a level roughly equivalent to LSST Y1, we find a similar pattern, with considerably more bias in a cosmic shear analysis than a $2\times2$pt one, and significant bias in a joint analysis of the two. Our findings suggest that IA model error can manifest itself as internal tension between $\xi_\pm$ and $\gamma_t + w$ data vectors. We thus propose that such tension (or the lack thereof) can be employed as a test of model sufficiency or insufficiency when choosing a fiducial IA model, alongside other data-driven methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some attempts of easing the critical Hubble tension present in modern cosmology have resorted to using variations of fundamental constants, such as the fine-structure constant, at the time of recombination. In this article we demonstrate that there are critical hurdles to construct such viable models using scalar fields, due to the striking precision of local constraints on the fine-structure constant stability. These hurdles demonstrate that in single-field models one has to extremely fine-tune the shape of the potential and/or the initial conditions. Indeed, for single field models in a potential that is not fine-tuned we can put a generic bound at recombination of $\Delta \alpha/\alpha &lt; 5\cdot 10^{-4}$ (95\% CL).</description>

      <title>New galaxy UV luminosity constraints on warm dark matter from JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exploit the recent {\it James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) determination of galaxy UV luminosity functions over the redshift range $z=9-14.5$ to derive constraints on warm dark matter (WDM) models. The delayed structure formation in WDM universes make high-redshift observations a powerful probe to set limits on the particle mass $m_\mathrm{x}$ of WDM candidates. By integrating these observations with blank-field surveys conducted by the {\it Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) at redshifts $z=4-8$, we impose constraints on both astrophysical parameters ($\beta$, $\gamma$, $\epsilon_{\mathrm N}$, $M_c$ for a double-power law star formation efficiency, and $\sigma_{M_{\mathrm{UV}}}$ for a Gaussian magnitude-halo mass relation) and the WDM parameter (dark matter particle mass $m_\mathrm{x}$) simultaneously. We find a new limit of $m_\mathrm{x} \geq 3.2$ keV for the mass of thermal relic WDM particles at $95\%$ confidence level. This bound is tighter than the most stringent result derived using HST data before. Future JWST observations could further reduce the observation uncertainties and improve this constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) predictions of cosmological phase transitions are almost invariably evaluated at either the nucleation or percolation temperature. We investigate the effect of the transition temperature choice on GW predictions, for phase transitions with weak, intermediate and strong supercooling. We find that the peak amplitude of the GW signal varies by a factor of a few for weakly supercooled phase transitions, and by an order of magnitude for strongly supercooled phase transitions. The variation in amplitude for even weakly supercooled phase transitions can be several orders of magnitude if one uses the mean bubble separation, while the variation is milder if one uses the mean bubble radius instead. We also investigate the impact of various approximations used in GW predictions. Many of these approximations introduce at least a 10% error in the GW signal, with others introducing an error of over an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Particle shells from relativistic bubble walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic bubble walls from cosmological phase transitions (PT) necessarily accumulate expanding shells of particles. We systematically characterize shell properties, and identify and calculate the processes that prevent them from free streaming: phase-space saturation effects, out-of-equilibrium $2\to2$ and $3\to2$ shell-shell and shell-bath interactions, and shell interactions with bubble walls. We find that shells do not free stream in scenarios widely studied in the literature, where standard predictions will need to be reevaluated, including those of bubble wall velocities, gravitational waves (GW) and particle production. Our results support the use of bulk-flow GW predictions in all regions where shells free stream, irrespectively of whether or not the latent heat is mostly converted in the scalar field gradient.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from slow phase transitions: a model-building perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) through delayed vacuum decay during slow cosmic first-order phase transitions. Two specific models, the polynomial potential and the real singlet extension of the Standard Model, are used as illustrative examples. Our findings reveal that models with zero-temperature scalar potential barriers are conducive to the realization of this mechanism, as the phase transition duration is extended by the U-shaped Euclidean action. We find that the resulting PBH density is highly sensitive to the barrier height, with abundant PBH formation observed for sufficiently high barriers. Notably, the phase transition needs not to be ultra-supercooled (i.e. the parameter $\alpha\gg1$), and the commonly used exponential nucleation approximation $\Gamma(t)\sim e^{\beta t}$ fails to capture the PBH formation dynamics in such models.</description>

      <title>A study of the fine-structure constant dependence of radiative capture in Halo-EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fine-structure constant dependence of the rates of some selected radiative capture reactions within the framework of so-called Halo Effective Field Theory in order to assess the adequacy of some assumptions made on the Coulomb penetrability. We find that this dependence deviates from that implied by a parameterization of the cross sections of this effect via a simple penetration factor. Some features of this fine-structure dependence are discussed, in particular its potential impact on the abundances of the light elements in primordial nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Probing Massive Fields with Multi-Band Gravitational-Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the prospect of probing massive fields and testing gravitational theories with multi-band observations of gravitational waves emitted from coalescing compact binaries. Focusing on the dipole radiation induced by a massive field, we show that multi-band observations can probe the field with mass ranging from $10^{-16}$ eV to $10^{-15}$ eV, a parameter space that cannot be probed by the milli-Hertz band observations alone. Multi-band observations can also improve the constraints obtained with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binaries by up to 3 orders of magnitude in the mass range. Moreover, we show that multi-band observations can discriminate the spin of the field, which cannot be identified with single-band observations.</description>
