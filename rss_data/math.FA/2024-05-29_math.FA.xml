      <title>A new class of evolution multivalued quasi-variational inequalities I: existence and nonsmooth optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a new kind of evolution multivalued quasi-variational inequalities with feedback effect and a nonlinear bifunction which contain several (evolution) quasi-variational/hemivariational inequalities as special cases. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. The first goal is to establish a novel framework for proving the existence of solutions and the compactness of solution set to the evolution multivalued quasi-variational inequalities, under quite mild assumptions. Whereas, the second contribution is to introduce and study a nonlinear and nonsmooth optimal control problem governed by an evolution multivalued quasi-variational inequality, and then to obtain the sufficient conditions for guaranteeing the solvability of the nonlinear and nonsmooth optimal control problem under consideration. Such nonlinear and nonsmooth optimal control problem could as a useful model to explore the simultaneous distributed-boundary optimal control problems driven by evolution multivalued quasi-variational inequalities, and optimal parameters identification for evolution multivalued quasi-variational inequalities.</description>

      <title>Shift-invariant subspaces of Sobolev type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper has the characteristics of a review paper in which results of shift-invariant subspaces of Sobolev type are summarized without proofs. The structure of shift-invariant spaces $V_s$, $s\in\mathbb{R}$, generated by at most countable family of generators, which are subspaces of Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{R}^n)$, are announced in \cite{aap} and Bessel sequences, frames and Riesz families of such spaces are characterized. With the Fourier multiplier $\left(1-\frac{\Delta}{4\pi^2}\right)^{s/2}f=\mathcal{F}^{-1}\big((1+|t|^2)^{s/2}\widehat{f}(t)\big)$, we are able to extend notions and theorems in \cite{MB} to spaces of the Sobolev type.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Multivariate Gabor Frames and a Higher-Dimensional Lyubarskii-Seip-Wallst\'en Result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an equivalence relation on the set of lattices in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ such that equivalent lattices share identical structures of Gabor frames, up to unitary equivalence, a notion we define. These equivalence classes are parameterized by symplectic forms on $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ and they consist of lattices related by symplectic transformations. This implies that $2d^2 - d$ parameters suffice to describe the possible structures of Gabor systems over lattices in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$, as opposed to the $4d^2$ degrees of freedom in the choice of lattice. We also prove that (under a mild additional assumption) symplectic transformations are the only linear transformations of the time-frequency plane which implement equivalences of this kind, thereby characterizing symplectic transformations as the structure-preserving transformations of the time-frequency plane in the context of Gabor analysis.
  We also investigate the equivalence classes that have separable lattices as representatives and find that the parameter space in this case is $d^2$-dimensional. We provide an explicit example showing that non-separable and irrational lattices can behave exactly like separable and rational ones.
  Finally, this approach allows us to prove a higher-dimensional variant of the Lyubarskii-Seip-Wallst\'en Theorem for Gaussian Gabor frames. This gives us, for a large class of lattices in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ (including all symplectic ones), necessary and sufficient conditions for $d$-parameter families of Gaussians to generate Gabor frames.</description>

      <title>Finsler $p$-Laplace equation with a potential: Maz'ya-type characterization and attainments of the Hardy constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study positive properties of the quasilinear elliptic equation
  $$-\mathrm{div}\mathcal{A}(x,\nabla u)+V|u|^{p-2}u=0\quad (1&lt;p&lt;\infty)\qquad \mbox{ in } \Omega,$$ where the function $\mathcal{A}(x,\xi)$ is induced by a family of norms on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ ($n\geq 2$) parameterized by points in the domain $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}$, and $V$ belongs to a certain local Morrey space. We first establish two-sided estimates for Bregman distances of $|\xi|^{p}_{s,a}$ ($1&lt;s&lt;\infty$), where $a=(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n})$ and $a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n}$ are certain functions with positive local lower and upper bounds in $\Omega$. These estimates lead to a Maz'ya-type characterization for Hardy-weights of the corresponding functionals. Then we prove three types of sufficient conditions for the attainment of the Hardy constant in a certain space $\widetilde{W}^{1,p}_{0}(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>On walk-regular graphs and optimal duals of frames generated by graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Erasures are a common problem that arises while signals or data are being transmitted. A profound challenge in frame theory is to find the optimal dual frames ($OD$-frames) to minimize the reconstruction error if erasures occur. In this paper, we study the optimal duals of frames generated by graphs. First, we characterize walk-regular graphs. Then, it is shown that the diagonal entries of the Moore-Penrose inverse of the Laplacian matrix (or adjacency matrix) of a walk-regular graph are equal. Besides, we prove that connected graphs generate full spark frames. Using these results, we establish that the canonical dual frames are the unique $OD$-frames of a frame generated by a walk-regular graph. A sufficient condition under which the canonical dual frame is the unique $OD$-frame is known. Here, we establish that the condition is also necessary if the frame is generated by a connected graph.</description>

      <title>Selector form of Weaver's conjecture, Feichtinger's conjecture, and frame sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show an extension of a probabilistic result of Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava, which resolved the Kadison-Singer problem, for block diagonal positive semidefinite random matrices. We use this result to show several selector results, which generalize their partition counterparts. This includes a selector form of Weaver's KS$_r$ conjecture for block diagonal trace class operators, which extends a selector result for Bessel sequences, or equivalently rank one matrices, due to Londner and the author. We also show a selector variant of Feichtinger's conjecture for a (possibly infinite) collection of Bessel sequences, extending earlier results for a single Bessel sequence. We prove a generalization of the $R_\epsilon$ conjecture of Casazza, Tremain, and Vershynin for infinite collection of equal norm Bessel sequences. In particular, our selector result yields a conjectured asymptotically optimal bound for a single Bessel sequence in terms of Riesz sequence tightness parameter.
  We establish an iterated selector form of Weaver's KS$_2$ conjecture and show its applications. This includes a solution of an open problem on nearly unit norm Parseval frames of exponentials, which was posed by Londner and the author. We generalize a discretization result for continuous frames by Freeman and Speegle in two ways. First, we extend their result from the setting of rank one operators to positive trace operator valued measures. Second, we establish a nearly tight discretization of bounded continuous Parseval frames. In particular, our selector result yields an improvement of the result of Nitzan, Olevskii, and Ulanovskii and implies the existence of nearly tight exponential frames for unbounded sets with an explicit control on their frame redundancy.</description>

      <title>Regularity of matrix coefficients of a compact symmetric pair of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider symmetric Gelfand pairs $(G,K)$ where $G$ is a compact Lie group and $K$ a subgroup of fixed point of an involutive automorphism. We study the regularity of $K$-bi-invariant matrix coefficients of $G$. The results rely on the analysis of the spherical functions of the Gelfand pair $(G,K)$. When the symmetric space $G/K$ is of rank $1$ or isomorphic to a Lie group, we find the optimal regularity of $K$-bi-invariant matrix coefficients. Furthermore, in rank $1$ we also show the optimal regularity of $K$-bi-invariant Herz-Schur multipliers of $S_p(L^2(G))$. We also give a lower bound for the optimal regularity in some families of higher rank symmetric spaces. From these results, we make a conjecture in the general case involving the root system of the symmetric space. Finally, we prove that if all $K$-bi-invariant matrix coefficients of $G$ have the same regularity, then so do all $K$-finite matrix coefficients.</description>

      <title>Trace and Index of Dirac-Schr\"odinger Operators on Open Space with Operator Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop trace and index formulas for a Dirac-Schr\"odinger operator $D$ on open space of odd dimension $d\geq 3$ with a potential given by a family of self-adjoint unbounded operators acting on a infinite dimensional Hilbert space $H$. The presented results generalize formulas surrounding the Callias index theorem to unbounded operator potentials, for which the operator $D$ is not necessarily Fredholm. We include examples, where the trace formula is used to calculate the Witten index of non-Fredholm massless $(d+1)$-Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators acting in $L^2\left(\mathbb{R}^{d+1},H\right)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study Fourier multipliers on quantum Euclidean spaces and obtain results on their $L^p -L^q$ boundedness. On the way to get these results, we prove Paley, Hausdorff-Young, Hausdorff-Young-Paley, and Hardy-Littlewood inequalities on the quantum Euclidean space. As applications, we establish the $L^p -L^q$ estimate for the heat semigroup and Sobolev embedding theorem on quantum Euclidean spaces.

Abstract: In this paper, we study H\"ormander type Fourier multiplier theorem and the Nikolskii inequality on quantum tori. On the way to obtain these results, we also prove some classical inequalities such as Paley type, Hausdorff-Young-Paley, Hardy-Littlewood, and Logarithmic Sobolev inequalities on quantum tori. As applications we establish embedding theorems between Sobolev, Besov spaces as well as embeddings between Besov and Wiener and Beurling spaces on quantum tori. We also analyse $\beta$-versions of Wiener and Beurling spaces and their embeddings, and interpolation properties of all these spaces on quantum tori. As an applications of the analysis, we also derive a version of the Nash inequality, and the time decay for solutions of a heat type equation.</description>

      <title>A note on the Huijsmans-de Pagter problem on finite dimensional ordered vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical problem posed in 1992 by Huijsmans and de Pagter asks whether, for every positive operator $T$ on a Banach lattice with spectrum $\sigma(T) = \{1\}$, the inequality $T \ge \operatorname{id}$ holds true. While the problem remains unsolved in its entirety, a positive solution is known in finite dimensions. In the broader context of ordered Banach spaces, Drnov\v{s}ek provided an infinite-dimensional counterexample. In this note, we demonstrate the existence of finite-dimensional counterexamples, specifically on the ice cream cone and on a polyhedral cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$. On the other hand, taking inspiration from the notion of $m$-isometries, we establish that each counterexample must contain a Jordan block of size at least $3$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Volterra-type integral operators between Bloch-type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Volterra-type integral operator plays an essential role in modern complex analysis and operator theory. Recently, Chalmoukis \cite{Cn} introduced a generalized integral operator, say $I_{g,a}$, defined by $$I_{g,a}f=I^n(a_0f^{(n-1)}g'+a_1f^{(n-2)}g''+\cdots+a_{n-1}fg^{(n)}),$$ where $g\in H(\mathbb{D})$ and $a=(a_0,a_1,\cdots,a_{n-1})\in \mathbb{C}^n$. $I^n$ is the $n$th iteration of the integral operator $I$. In this paper, we introduce a more generalized integral operators $I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}$ that cover $I_{g,a}$ on the Bloch-type space $\mathcal{B}^{\alpha}$, defined by $$I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}f=I^n(fg_0+\cdots+f^{(n-1)}g_{n-1}).$$ We show the rigidity of the operator $I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}$ and further the sum $\sum_{i=1}^nI_{g_i}^{N_i,k_i}$, where $I_{g_i}^{N_i,k_i}f=I^{N_i}(f^{(k_i)}g_i)$. Specifically, the boundedness and compactness of $\sum_{i=1}^nI_{g_i}^{N_i,k_i}$ are equal to those of each $I_{g_i}^{N_i,k_i}$. Moreover, the boundedness and compactness of $I^n((fg')^{(n-1)})$ are independent of $n$ when $\alpha&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>The complete Pick property for pairs of kernels and Shimorin's factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{H}_k, \mathcal{H}_{\ell})$ be a pair of Hilbert function spaces with kernels $k, \ell$. In a 2005 paper, Shimorin showed that a certain factorization condition on $(k, \ell)$ yields a commutant lifting theorem for multipliers $\mathcal{H}_k\to\mathcal{H}_{\ell}$, thus unifying and extending previous results due to Ball-Trent-Vinnikov and Volberg-Treil. Our main result is a strong converse to Shimorin's theorem for a large class of holomorphic pairs $(k, \ell),$ which leads to a full characterization of the complete Pick property for such pairs. We also present an alternative, short proof of sufficiency for Shimorin's condition. Finally, we establish necessary conditions for abstract pairs $(k, \ell)$ to satisfy the complete Pick property, further generalizing Shimorin's work with proofs that are new even in the single-kernel case $k=\ell.$ Shimorin's approach differs from ours in that we do not work with the Nevanlinna-Pick problem directly; instead, we are able to extract vital information for $(k, \ell)$ through Carath\'eodory-Fej\'er interpolation.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Residues, Equivariant Traces, and Trace Expansions for an Operator Algebra on $\mathbb R^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an algebra $\mathscr A$ of Fourier integral operators on $\mathbb R^n$. It consists of all operators $D: \mathscr S(\mathbb R^n)\to \mathscr S(\mathbb R^n)$ on the Schwartz space $\mathscr S(\mathbb R^n)$ that can be written as finite sums $$ D= \sum R_gT_w A, $$ with Shubin type pseudodifferential operators $A$, Heisenberg-Weyl operators $T_w$, $w\in \mathbb C^n$, and lifts $R_g$, $g\in \mathrm U(n)$, of unitary matrices $g$ on $\mathbb C^n$ to operators $R_g$ in the complex metaplectic group.
  For $D \in \mathscr A$ and a suitable auxiliary Shubin pseudodifferential operator $H$ we establish expansions for $\mathop{\mathrm {Tr}}(D(H-\lambda)^{-K})$ as $|\lambda| \to \infty$ in a sector of $\mathbb C$ for sufficiently large $K$ and of $\mathop{\mathrm {Tr}}(De^{-tH})$ as $t\to 0^+$. We also obtain the singularity structure of the meromorphic extension of $z\mapsto \mathop{\mathrm{Tr}}(DH^{-z})$ to $\mathbb C$.
  Moreover, we find a noncommutative residue as a suitable coefficient in these expansions and construct from it a family of localized equivariant traces on the algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Wasserstein divergences are modified versions of quantum Wasserstein distances defined by channels, and they are conjectured to be genuine metrics on quantum state spaces by De Palma and Trevisan. We prove triangle inequality for quantum Wasserstein divergences for every quantum system described by a separable Hilbert space and any quadratic cost operator under the assumption that a particular state involved is pure, and all the states have finite energy. We also provide strong numerical evidence suggesting that the triangle inequality holds in general, for an arbitrary choice of states.</description>
