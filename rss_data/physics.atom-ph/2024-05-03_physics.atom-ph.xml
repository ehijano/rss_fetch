      <title>Stepwise ionization of Mo$^{14+}$ ions in EBIT: The importance of the metastable level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The visible spectrum of Mo$^{15+}$ ions was measured using a high-temperature superconducting electron-beam ion trap at the Shanghai EBIT Laboratory, with an electron beam energy $E_{e}$=400 eV, significantly lower than the ionization potential (IP=544.0 eV) of Mo$^{14+}$ ions in the ground state. To expound on the experiment, the energy level structure, radiative transition properties, electron-impact excitation, and electron-impact ionization cross section for both the ground state and low-lying excited state of the Mo$^{14+}$ ions were calculated using Dirac-Fock-Slater method with a local central potential and distorted wave approximation. The results demonstrated reasonable agreement with both available experimental and theoretical data. Through an analysis of the related atomic processes of Mo$^{14+}$ ion, a scenario involving the stepwise ionization of the metastable state 3p$^{6}$3d$^{9}$4s was proposed to explain the presence of the Mo$^{15+}$ ions with a lower energy of the incident electron. Finally, the significance of the metastable levels in ionizing Mo$^{14+}$ ions is highlighted.</description>

      <title>Elastic electron scattering from Be, Mg, and Ca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive set of theoretical results for differential, integrated, and momentum transfer cross sections for the elastic scattering of electrons by beryllium, magnesium and calcium, at energies below 1 keV. In addition, we provide Sherman function values for elastic electron scattering from calcium in the same energy range. This study extends the application of our method of calculations, already employed for barium and strontium, to all stable alkaline-earth-metal atoms. Our semi-empirical approach to treating target polarization has produced in our earlier work a satisfactory agreement with experimental values and precise theoretical results such as convergent close-coupling calculations for barium. The present data are expected to be of similar high accuracy, based on our previous success in similar calculations for barium and all inert gases.</description>

      <title>Handling the asymmetric spectral line profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses some features of the spectral line profile theory used in the treatment of measured atomic transitions. It is shown that going beyond the established linear approximation for the spectral line contour in the case of its nonresonant extension, the potential for a more accurate extraction of atomic characteristics from experimental data arises. Using the example of the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$_\alpha$) transition in hydrogen, a simple analysis of the observed spectral line distorted by a possible interfering transitions is given. In particular, the results obtained in the present work clearly demonstrate that the processing of the same experimental data at different settings can provide an accurate determination of the transition frequency, the centre of gravity as well as the hyperfine splitting of the ground state in hydrogen-like atomic systems. The latter is especially important for setting up precision spectroscopic experiments on the antihydrogen atom.</description>

      <title>Polarization dependent non-Hermitian atomic grating controlled by dipole blockade effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme for a non-Hermitian atomic grating within an ultra-cold rubidium-87 ($^{87}Rb$) atomic ensemble. The grating's diffraction properties depend on the polarization states of incident photons and are controlled non-locally through Rydberg interactions. Multiple types of polarization-dependent diffraction modes are generated, benefiting from no crosstalk atomic transition channels based on transition selection rules. Those polarization-dependent diffraction modes can be switched using dynamic optical pulse trains, exploiting the Rydberg blockade effect, and are tunable by non-Hermitian optical modulation. Our work will advance the application of asymmetric optical scattering by utilizing the polarization degree of freedom within continuous media and benefit the application of versatile non-Hermitian/asymmetric optical devices.</description>

      <title>A multidimensional approach to quantum state tomography of photoelectron wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in reconstructing the density matrix of photoionized electrons, in particular in complex systems where decoherence can be introduced either by a partial measurement of the system or through coupling with a stochastic environment. To this, end, several methods to reconstruct the density matrix, quantum state tomography protocols, have been developed and tested on photoelectrons ejected from noble gases following absorption of XUV photons from attosecond pulses. It remains a challenge to obtain model-free, single scan protocols that can reconstruct the density matrix with high fidelities. Current methods require extensive measurements or involve complex fitting of the signal. Faithful single-scan reconstructions would be of great help to increase the number of systems that can be studied. We propose a new and more efficient protocol - rainbow-KRAKEN - that is able to reconstruct the continuous variable density matrix of a photoelectron in a single time delay scan. It is based on measuring the coherences of a photoelectron created by absorption of an XUV pulse using a broadband IR probe that is scanned in time and a narrowband IR reference that is temporally fixed to the XUV pulse. We illustrate its performance for a Fano resonance in He as well as mixed states in Ar arising from spin-orbit splitting. We show that the protocol results in excellent fidelities and near-perfect estimation of the purity.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of dissociative recombination and vibrational excitation of the BF$_2^+$ ion by an electron impact</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-sections for dissociative recombination and electron-impact vibrational excitation of the BF$^+_2$ molecular ion are computed using a theoretical approach that combines the normal modes approximation for the vibrational states of the target ion and use of the UK R-matrix code to evaluate electron-ion scattering matrices for fixed geometries of the ion. Thermally-averaged rate coefficients are obtained from the cross-sections for temperatures in the 10-3000 K range.</description>

      <title>Tomography of a single-atom-resolved detector in the presence of shot-to-shot number fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tomography of single-particle-resolved detectors is of primary importance for characterizing particle correlations with applications in quantum metrology, quantum simulation and quantum computing. However, it is a non-trivial task in practice due to the unavoidable presence of noise that affects the measurement but does not originate from the detector. In this work, we address this problem for a three-dimensional single-atom-resolved detector where shot-to-shot atom number fluctuations are a central issue to perform a quantum detector tomography. We overcome this difficulty by exploiting the parallel measurement of counting statistics in sub-volumes of the detector, from which we evaluate the effect of shot-to-shot fluctuations and perform a local tomography of the detector. In addition, we illustrate the validity of our method from applying it to Gaussian quantum states with different number statistics. Finally, we show that the response of Micro-Channel Plate detectors is well-described from using a binomial distribution with the detection efficiency as a single parameter.</description>

      <title>Satellite lines from autoionizing states of Fe XVI and the problems with the X-ray Fe XVII lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new calculations of atomic data needed to model autoionizing states of Fe XVI. We compare the state energies, radiative and excitation data with a sample of results from previous literature. We find a large scatter of results, the most significant ones in the autoionization rates, which are very sensitive to the configuration interaction and state mixing. We find relatively good agreement between the autoionization rates and the collisional excitation rates calculated with the R-matrix suite of programs and autostructure. The largest model, which includes J-resolved states up to n=10, produces ab-initio wavelengths and intensities of the satellite lines which agree well with solar high-resolution spectra of active regions, with few minor wavelength adjustements. We review previous literature, finding many incorrect identifications, most notably those in the NIST database. We provide several new tentative identifications in the 15-15.7 A range, and several new ones at shorter wavelengths, where previous lines were unidentified. Compared to the previous CHIANTI model, the present one has an increased flux in the 15--15.7 A range at 2 MK of a factor of 1.9, resolving the discrepancies found in the analysis of the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-Ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) observation. It appears that the satellite lines also resolve the long-standing discrepancy in the intensity of the important Fe XVII 3D line at 15.26 A.</description>

      <title>A Formulation of Quantum Fluid Mechanics and Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formalism of classical mechanics is given for time-dependent many-body states of quantum mechanics, describing both fluid flow and point mass trajectories. The familiar equations of energy, motion, and those of Lagrangian mechanics are obtained. An energy and continuity equation is demonstrated to be equivalent to the real and imaginary parts of the time dependent Schroedinger equation, respectively, where the Schroedinger equation is in density matrix form. For certain stationary states, using Lagrangian mechanics and a Hamiltonian function for quantum mechanics, equations for point-mass trajectories are obtained. For 1-body states and fluid flows, the energy equation and equations of motion are the Bernoulli and Euler equations of fluid mechanics, respectively. Generalizations of the energy and Euler equations are derived to obtain equations that are in the same form as they are in classical mechanics. The fluid flow type is compressible, inviscid, irrotational, with the nonclassical element of local variable mass. Over all space mass is conserved. The variable mass is a necessary condition for the fluid flow to agree with the zero orbital angular momentum for s states of hydrogen. Cross flows are examined, where velocity directions are changed without changing the kinetic energy. For one-electron atoms, the velocity modification gives closed orbits for trajectories, and mass conservation, vortexes, and density stratification for fluid flows. For many body states, Under certain conditions, and by hypotheses, Euler equations of orbital-flows are obtained. One-body Schroedinger equations that are a generalization of the Hartree-Fock equations are also obtained. These equations contain a quantum Coulomb's law, involving the 2-body pair function of reduced density matrix theory that replace the charge densities.</description>

      <title>Observation of an inverse turbulent-wave cascade in a driven quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe an inverse turbulent-wave cascade, from small to large lengthscales, in a homogeneous 2D Bose gas driven isotropically on a lengthscale much smaller than its size. Starting with an equilibrium condensed gas, at long drive times we observe a nonthermal steady state. At increasing lengthscales, starting from the forcing one, the steady-state momentum distribution features in turn: (i) a power-law spectrum, with an exponent close to the analytical result for a particle cascade in weak-wave turbulence, and (ii) a spectrum intriguingly reminiscent of a nonthermal fixed point associated with universal coarsening in an isolated 2D gas. In further experiments, based on anisotropic driving, we also reveal the qualitative picture of the cascade-formation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum feedback control of a two-atom network closed by a semi-infinite waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamics of a coherent feedback network where two two-level atoms are coupled with a semi-infinite waveguide. In this set-up, the two-level atoms can work as the photon source, and the photons can be emitted into the waveguide via the nonchiral or chiral couplings between the atom and the waveguide, according to whether the coupling strengths between the atoms and different directional propagating modes in the waveguide are identical or not. For the photon emitted by one of the two atoms, it can be reflected by the terminal mirror, or interact with the other atom, and then the photon can re-interact with the former atom. When the two atoms are both initially excited, finally there can be two-photon, one-photon or zero-photon states in the waveguide via the spontaneous emission and feedback interactions, and this is influenced by the locations of the atoms and the chirality of the coupling between the atom and the waveguide. Similarly, if only one of the two atoms is initially excited, there can be zero or one photon in the waveguide. Thus we can control the number of the photons in the waveguide and the atomic states by tuning the feedback loop length and the chiral couplings between the atom and waveguide. The photonic state in the waveguide is analyzed in the frequency domain and the spatial domain, and the transient process of photon emissions can be better understood based on the comprehensive analysis in these two domains.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Measurement in the Mid-Band with Atom Interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Waves (GWs) have been detected in the $\sim$100 Hz and nHz bands, but most of the gravitational spectrum remains unobserved. A variety of detector concepts have been proposed to expand the range of observable frequencies. In this work, we study the capability of GW detectors in the ``mid-band'', the $\sim$30 mHz -- 10 Hz range between LISA and LIGO, to measure the signals from and constrain the properties of ${\sim}$1 -- 100 $M_\odot$ compact binaries. We focus on atom-interferometer-based detectors. We describe a Fisher matrix code, AIMforGW, which we created to evaluate their capabilities, and present numerical results for two benchmarks: terrestrial km-scale detectors, and satellite-borne detectors in medium Earth orbit. Mid-band GW detectors are particularly well-suited to pinpointing the location of GW sources on the sky. We demonstrate that a satellite-borne detector could achieve sub-degree sky localization for any detectable source with chirp mass $\mathcal{M}_c \lesssim 50 M_\odot$. We also compare different detector configurations, including different locations of terrestrial detectors and various choices of the orbit of a satellite-borne detector. As we show, a network of only two terrestrial single-baseline detectors or one single-baseline satellite-borne detector would each provide close-to-uniform sky-coverage, with signal-to-noise ratios varying by less than a factor of two across the entire sky. We hope that this work contributes to the efforts of the GW community to assess the merits of different detector proposals.</description>

      <title>Finite Pulse-Time Effects in Long-Baseline Quantum Clock Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum-clock interferometry has been suggested as a quantum probe to test the universality of free fall (UFF) and the universality of gravitational redshift (UGR). In typical experimental schemes it seems advantageous to employ Doppler-free E1-M1 transitions which have so far been investigated in quantum gases at rest. Here, we consider the fully quantized atomic degrees of freedom and study the interplay of the quantum center-of-mass (COM) $-$ that can become delocalized $-$ together with the internal clock transitions. In particular, we derive a model for finite-time E1-M1 transitions with atomic intern-extern coupling and arbitrary position-dependent laser intensities. We further provide generalizations to the ideal expressions for perturbed recoilless clock pulses. Finally, we show at the example of a Gaussian laser beam that the proposed quantum-clock interferometers are stable against perturbations from varying optical fields for a sufficiently small quantum delocalization of the atomic COM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate qubit state measurements assisted by a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) in a neutral atom quantum processor. We present two CNN architectures for analyzing neutral atom qubit readout data: a compact 5-layer single-qubit CNN architecture and a 6-layer multi-qubit CNN architecture. We benchmark both architectures against a conventional Gaussian threshold analysis method. In a sparse array (9 {\mu}m atom separation) which experiences negligible crosstalk, we observed up to 32% and 56% error reduction for the multi-qubit and single-qubit architectures respectively, as compared to the benchmark. In a tightly spaced array (5 {\mu}m atom separation), which suffers from readout crosstalk, we observed up to 43% and 32% error reduction in the multi-qubit and single-qubit CNN architectures respectively, as compared to the benchmark. By examining the correlation between the predicted states of neighboring qubits, we found that the multi-qubit CNN architecture reduces the crosstalk correlation up to 78.5%. This work demonstrates a proof of concept for a CNN network to be implemented as a real-time readout processing method on a neutral atom quantum computer, enabling faster readout time and improved fidelity.</description>

      <title>Topological photon pumping in quantum optical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the concept of topological pumping in one-dimensional systems with long-range interactions and apply it to the transport of a photon in quantum optical systems. In our theoretical investigation, we introduce an extended version of the Rice-Mele model with all-to-all exchange interactions. By analyzing its properties, we identify the general conditions for topological pumping and demonstrate the topologically protected and dispersionless transport of a photon on a one-dimensional emitter chain. As concrete examples, we investigate three different popular quantum optics platforms, namely Rydberg atom lattices, dense lattices of atoms excited to low-lying electronic states, and atoms coupled to waveguides, using experimentally relevant parameters. We observe that despite the long-ranged character of the dipole-dipole interactions, topological pumping facilitates the transport of a photon with a fidelity per cycle which can reach 99.9%. Moreover, we find that the photon pumping process remains topologically protected against local disorder in the coupling rates.</description>
