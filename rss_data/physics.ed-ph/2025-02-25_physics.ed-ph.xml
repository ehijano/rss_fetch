      <title>Assessing Pedagogical Readiness for Digital Innovation: A Mixed-Methods Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital innovation in education has revolutionized teaching and learning processes, demanding a rethink of pedagogical competence among educators. This study evaluates the preparation of instructors to use digital technologies into their educational practices. The study used a mixed-methods approach, integrating both qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys to evaluate teachers' institutional support systems, beliefs, and technical proficiency. The results show that even while a large number of educators acknowledge the benefits of digital tools, problems including poor professional development and change aversion still exist. In order to improve digital pedagogical preparation, the study emphasizes the necessity of focused training initiatives and encouraging institutional regulations. There is discussion on the implications for educational institutions and policymakers.</description>

      <title>Dominant misconceptions and alluvial flows between Engineering and Physical Science students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we assess the comprehension of physics concepts by Physical Science and Engineering students enrolled in their first semester at the University of Johannesburg (UJ), South Africa ($2022$). We employ different graphical measures to explore similarities and differences using the results of both pre- and post-test data from the Force Concept Inventory assessment tool, from which we calculate dominant misconceptions (DMs) and gains. We also use alluvial diagrams to track the choices made by these two groups of students from pre- to post-test stages. In our analysis, we find that DM results indicate that participating Engineering students outperformed Physical Science students on average, however, the same types of normalised DMs persist at the post-test level. We call these DMs "persistent misconceptions." This is very useful when tracking persistent misconceptions, where when using repeated measures and alluvial diagrams with smaller groups of students, we find that Physical Science students tend to make more chaotic choices.</description>

      <title>Comparing large language models for supervised analysis of students' lab notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) hold significant promise in improving physics education research that uses machine learning. In this study, we compare the application of various models to perform large-scale analysis of written text grounded in a physics education research classification problem: identifying skills in students' typed lab notes through sentence-level labeling. Specifically, we use training data to fine-tune two different LLMs, BERT and LLaMA, and compare the performance of these models to both a traditional bag of words approach and a few-shot LLM (without fine-tuning).} We evaluate the models based on their resource use, performance metrics, and research outcomes when identifying skills in lab notes. We find that higher-resource models often, but not necessarily, perform better than lower-resource models. We also find that all models estimate similar trends in research outcomes, although the absolute values of the estimated measurements are not always within uncertainties of each other. We use the results to discuss relevant considerations for education researchers seeking to select a model type to use as a classifier.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Laplace transform in quantum mechanics: correcting a flawed approach for the stationary Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laplace transform is a valuable tool in physics, particularly in solving differential equations with initial or boundary conditions. A 2014 study by Tsaur and Wang (2014 \emph{Eur.~J.~Phys.} \textbf{35} 015006) introduced a Laplace-transform-based method to solve the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for various potentials. However, their approach contains critical methodological flaws: the authors disregard essential boundary conditions and apply the residue theorem incorrectly in the inverse transformation process. These errors ultimately cancel out, leading to correct results despite a flawed derivation. In this paper, we revisit the use of the Laplace transform for the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation, clarifying correct practices in handling boundary conditions and singularities. This analysis offers a sound and consistent framework for the application of Laplace transforms in stationary quantum mechanics, underscoring their educational utility in quantum mechanics coursework.</description>
