      <title>Fibers of the square map in some finite groups of Lie type and an application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be one of the finite general linear, unitary, symplectic or orthogonal groups over finite fields of odd order. We find the cardinality of the fibers of the square map at a given generic element. Using this we find the number of real conjugacy classes of $G$. This is primarily achieved by leveraging a recent solution to Brauer's problem 14.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Generation of Finite Almost Simple Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if G is a sufficiently large finite almost simple group of Lie type, then given a fixed nontrivial element x in G and a coset of G modulo its socle, the probability that x and a random element of the coset generate a subgroup containing the socle is uniformly bounded away from 0 (and goes to 1 if the field size goes to infinity). This is new even if G is simple. Together with results of Lucchini and Burness--Guralnick--Harper, this proves a conjecture of Lucchini and has an application to profinite groups. A key step in the proof is the determination of the limits for the proportion of elements in a classical group which fix no subspace of any bounded dimension.</description>

      <title>Uniclass automorphisms of spherical buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An automorphism of a building is called uniclass if the Weyl distance between any chamber and its image lies in a single (twisted) conjugacy class of the Coxeter group. In this paper we characterise uniclass automorphisms of spherical buildings in terms of their fixed structure. For this purpose we introduce the notion of a Weyl substructure in a spherical building. We also link uniclass automorphisms to the Freudenthal--Tits magic square.</description>

      <title>Tactical decompositions in finite polar spaces and non-spreading classical group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For finite classical groups acting naturally on the set of points of their ambient polar spaces, the symmetry properties of \emph{synchronising} and \emph{separating} are equivalent to natural and well-studied problems on the existence of certain configurations in finite geometry. The more general class of \emph{spreading} permutation groups is harder to describe, and it is the purpose of this paper to explore this property for finite classical groups. In particular, we show that for most finite classical groups, their natural action on the points of its polar space is non-spreading. We develop and use a result on tactical decompositions (an \emph{AB-Lemma}) that provides a useful technique for finding witnesses for non-spreading permutation groups. We also consider some of the other primitive actions of the classical groups.</description>

      <title>Foldings in relatively hyperbolic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrier graphs of groups representing subgroups of a given relatively hyperbolic groups are introduced and a combination theorem for relatively quasi-convex subgroups is proven. Subsequently a theory of folds for such carrier graphs is introduced and finiteness results for subgroups of locally relatively quasiconvex relatively hyperbolic groups and Kleinian groups are established.</description>

      <title>Intersecting subsets in finite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset (subgroup) $S$ of a transitive permutation group $G\leq Sym(\Omega)$ is called an intersecting subset (subgroup, resp.) if the ratio $xy^{-1}$ of any elements $x,y\in S$ fixes some point. A transitive group is said to have the EKR property if the size of each intersecting subset is at most the order of the point stabilizer. A nice result of Meagher-Spiga-Tiep (2016) says that 2-transitive permutation groups have the EKR property. In this paper, we systematically study intersecting subsets in more general transitive permutation groups, including primitive (quasiprimitive) groups, rank-3 groups, Suzuki groups, and some special solvable groups. We present new families of groups that have the EKR property, and various families of groups that do not have the EKR property. This paper significantly improves the unpublished version of this paper, and particularly solves Problem 1.4 of it.</description>

      <title>Monodromy groups of indecomposable coverings of bounded genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each nonnegative integer $g$, we classify the ramification types and monodromy groups of indecomposable coverings of complex curves $f: X\to Y$ where $X$ has genus $g$, under the hypothesis that $n:=\deg(f)$ is sufficiently large and the monodromy group is not $A_n$ or $S_n$. This proves a conjecture of Guralnick and several conjectures of Guralnick and Shareshian.</description>

Abstract: The combination of this paper and its companion complete the classification of monodromy groups of indecomposable coverings of complex curves $f:X\rightarrow \mathbb P^1$ of sufficiently large degree in comparison to the genus of $X$. In this paper we determine all such coverings with monodromy group $G\leq S_\ell\wr S_t$ of product type for $t\ge 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay between omega-categoricity and pseudofiniteness for groups, conjecturing that omega-categorical pseudofinite groups are finite-by-abelian-by-finite. We show that the conjecture reduces to nilpotent p-groups of class 2, and give a proof that several of the known examples of omega-categorical p-groups satisfy the conjecture. In particular, we show by a direct counting argument that for any odd prime p the (omega-categorical) model companion of the theory of nilpotent class 2 exponent p groups, constructed by Saracino and Wood, is not pseudofinite, and that an omega-categorical group constructed by Baudisch with supersimple rank 1 theory is not pseudofinite. We also survey some scattered literature on omega-categorical groups over 50 years.</description>

      <title>Residual finiteness of fundamental $n$-quandles of links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate residual finiteness and subquandle separability of quandles. The existence of these finiteness properties implies the solvability of the word problem and the generalised word problem for quandles. We prove that the fundamental $n$-quandle of any link in the 3-sphere is residually finite for each $n \ge 2$. This supplements the recent result on residual finiteness of link quandles and the classification of links whose fundamental $n$-quandles are finite for some $n$. We also establish several general results on these finiteness properties and give many families of quandles admitting them.</description>

      <title>Bass-Serre theory for groupoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.09576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper a Bass-Serre theory in the groupoid setting is developed and a structure theorem is established. Any groupoid action without inversion of edges on a forest induces a graph of groupoids, while any graph of groupoids satisfying certain hypothesis admits a canonical associated groupoid, called the fundamental groupoid, and a forest, called the Bass-Serre forest, such that the fundamental groupoid acts on the Bass-Serre forest. The structure theorem states that these processes are mutually inverse.</description>

      <title>Finitely presented condensed groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal G$ denote the space of finitely generated marked groups. For any finitely generated group $G$, we construct a continuous, injective map $f$ from the space of subgroups $Sub(G)$ to $\mathcal G$ that sends conjugate subgroups to isomorphic marked groups; in addition, if $G$ is finitely presented and $H\le G$ is finitely generated, then $f(H)$ is finitely presented. This result allows us to transfer various topological phenomena occurring in $Sub(G)$ to $\mathcal G$. In particular, we provide the first example of a finitely presented group whose isomorphism class in $\mathcal G$ has no isolated points.</description>

      <title>Spreading primitive groups of diagonal type do not exist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07846v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synchronisation hierarchy of finite permutation groups consists of classes of groups lying between 2-transitive groups and primitive groups. This includes the class of spreading groups, which are defined in terms of sets and multisets of permuted points, and which are known to be primitive of almost simple, affine or diagonal type. In this paper, we prove that in fact no spreading group of diagonal type exists. As part of our proof, we show that all non-abelian finite simple groups, other than six sporadic groups, have a transitive action in which a proper normal subgroup of a point stabiliser is supplemented by all corresponding two-point stabilisers.</description>

      <title>Simplex path integral and simplex renormalization group for high-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01895v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern theories of phase transitions and scale-invariance are rooted in path integral formulation and renormalization groups (RG). Despite the applicability of these approaches on simple systems with only pairwise interactions, they are less effective on complex systems with un-decomposable high-order interactions (i.e., interactions among arbitrary sets of units). To precisely characterize the universality of high-order interacting systems, we propose simplex path integral and simplex renormalization group (SRG) as the generalizations of classic approaches to arbitrary high-order and heterogeneous interactions. We first formalize the trajectories of units governed by high-order interactions to define path integrals on corresponding simplexes based on a high-order propagator. Then we develop a method to integrate out short-range high-order interactions in the momentum space, accompanied by a coarse graining procedure functioning on the simplex structure generated by high-order interactions. The proposed SRG, equipped with a divide-and-conquer framework, can deal with the absence of ergodicity arised from the sparse distribution of high-order interactions and renormalize a system with intertwined high-order interactions on $p$-order according to its properties on $q$-order ($p\leq q$). The associated scaling relation and its corollaries support to differentiate among scale-invariant, weakly scale-invariant, and scale-dependent systems across different orders. We have validated our theory in multi-order scale-invariance verification, topological invariance discovery, organizational structure identification, and information bottleneck analysis to demonstrate its capacity for identifying intrinsic properties of high-order interacting systems during system reduction.</description>

Abstract: Let $(X,d)$, $(Y, d')$ be two roughly geodesically complete Gromov hyperbolic spaces under comparable isometric actions of $\Gamma$. Assume that the limit set $\Lambda \Gamma=\partial X\partial Y$. If spaces $X$ and $Y$ have the same asymptotic marked length spectrum, meaning that
  $$\lim_{{l_{d}([\gamma])\to \infty}}\frac{l_d(\gamma)}{l_{d'}(\gamma)}=1.$$ Then $(X,d)$ and $(Y,d')$ are $\Gamma$-equivariantly roughly isometric.</description>
