      <title>On the first Steenrod square for Chow groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a weak version of the homological first Steenrod square, a natural transformation from the modulo two Chow group to the Chow group modulo two and two-torsion. No assumption is made on the characteristic of the base field. As an application, we generalize a theorem of Nikita Karpenko on the parity of the first Witt index of quadratic forms to the case of a base field of characteristic two.</description>

Abstract: We prove that families of Calabi-Yau threefolds (CY3's) admit Bridgeland stability conditions when they are obtained via orbifolding from a family of CY3's admitting Bridgeland stability conditions.

      <title>Analysis of kinematics of mechanisms containing revolute joints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinematics of rigid bodies can be analyzed in many different ways. The advantage of using Euler parameters is that the resulting equations are polynomials and hence computational algebra, in particular Gr\"obner bases, can be used to study them. The disadvantage of the Gr\"obner basis methods is that the computational complexity grows quite fast in the worst case in the number of variables and the degree of polynomials. In the present article we show how to simplify computations when the mechanism contains revolute joints. The idea is based on the fact that the ideal representing the constraints of the revolute joint is not prime. Choosing the appropriate prime component reduces significantly the computational cost. We illustrate the method by applying it to the well known Bennett's and Bricard's mechanisms, but it can be applied to any mechanism which has revolute joints.</description>

      <title>The Kodaira Embedding Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chow's Theorem and GAGA are renowned results demonstrating the algebraic nature of projective manifolds and, more broadly, projective analytic varieties. However, determining if a particular manifold is projective is not, generally, a simple task. The Kodaira Embedding Theorem provides an intrinsic characterization of projective varieties in terms of line bundles; in particular, it states that a manifold is projective if and only if it admits a positive line bundle. We prove only the 'if' implication in this paper, giving a sufficient condition for a manifold bundle to be embedded in projective space. Along the way, we prove several other interesting results. Of particular note is the Kodaira-Nakano Vanishing Theorem, a crucial tool for eliminating higher cohomology of complex manifolds, as well as Lemmas 6.2 and 6.1, which provide important relationships between divisors, line bundles, and blowups. Although this treatment is relatively self-contained, we omit a rigorous development of Hodge theory, some basic complex analysis results, and some theorems regarding Cech cohomology (including Leray's Theorem).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a chapter for a book in honor of Bernd Sturmfels and his contributions. We describe the contributions by Bernd Sturmfels and his collaborators in harnessing algebraic and combinatorial methods for analyzing chemical reaction networks. Topics explored include the steady-state variety, counting steady states, and the global attractor conjecture. We also recount some personal stories that highlight Sturmfels's long-lasting impact on this research area.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a notion of Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity suitable for scrolls obtained as projectivisations of sums of line bundles on $\mathbb P^m$. We show that this is a natural generalisation of the well known regularity on projective and multiprojective spaces and we prove Horrocks-type splitting criteria for vector bundles.</description>

Abstract: Mirzakhani-Zograf proved the large genus asymptotic expansions of Weil-Petersson volumes and showed that the asymptotic coefficients are polynomials in $\mathbb Q[\pi^{-2},\pi^2]$. They also conjectured that these are actually polynomials in $\mathbb Q[\pi^{-2}]$. In this paper, we prove Mirzakhani-Zograf's conjecture.</description>

      <title>On certain integral Frobenius period maps for Shimura varieties and their reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate an integral period map for the crystalline prismatization of the $p$-integral model of a Shimura variety $\widetilde{S}$ with good reduction. By analyzing reductions of this map, we derive a period map from the mod $p$ fiber $S$ of $\widetilde{S}$ to the moduli stack of 1-1 truncated local $G$-shtukas in the prismatic topology, which refines the zip period map of $S$ within this topology. Furthermore, we show that the pair $(\widetilde{S}, S)$ is associated with a double $G$-zip. Additionally, we introduce a framework of base reduction diagrams.</description>

      <title>Orthosymplectic modules of cohomological Hall algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study modules and comodules for cohomological Hall algebras equipped with their vertex coproducts arising as objects with classical type stabilizer groups. Specifically we consider how classical type parabolic induction gives rise to actions of CoHAs of quivers with potential, of preprojective algberas, and of dimension zero sheaves on a smooth proper surface. In all cases the CoHA action is compatible with a localised (and vertex) coaction making the module a twisted Yetter-Drinfeld module over the CoHA with its localised braided bialgebra structure. In the case of dimension zero sheaves on a surface the action is related to an approach to the AGT conjecture in classical type using moduli stacks of orthosymplectic perverse coherent sheaves, a compactification of the stack of classical type bundles on a surface.</description>

      <title>Toric Mirror Symmetry for Homotopy Theorists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct functors sending torus-equivariant quasi-coherent sheaves on toric schemes over the sphere spectrum to constructible sheaves of spectra on real vector spaces. This provides a spectral lift of the toric homolgoical mirror symmetry theorem of Fang-Liu-Treumann-Zaslow (arXiv:1007.0053). Along the way, we obtain symmetric monoidal structures and functoriality results concerning those functors, which are new even over a field $k$. We also explain how the `non-equivariant' version of the theorem would follow from this functoriality via the de-equivariantization technique. As a concrete application, we obtain an alternative proof of Beilinson's linear algebraic description of quasi-coherent sheaves on projective spaces with spectral coefficients.</description>

      <title>Rational points in coarse moduli spaces and twisted representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study moduli spaces and moduli stacks for representations of associative algebras in Azumaya algebras, in rather general settings. We do not impose any stability condition and work over arbitrary ground rings, but restrict attention to the so-called Schur representations, where the only automorphisms are scalar multiplications. The stack comprises twisted representations, which are representations that live on the gerbe of splittings for the Azumaya algebra. Such generalized spaces and stacks appear naturally: For any rational point on the classical coarse moduli space of matrix representations, the machinery of non-abelian cohomology produces a modified moduli problem for which the point acquires geometric origin. The latter are given by representations in Azumaya algebras.</description>

Abstract: We prove an elegant structure theorem for log de Rham-Witt sheaves with vanishing along an effective Cartier divisor $D$ defined in arXiv:2403.18763, answering a question of Shuji Saito during the Mainz conference and a question of Yigeng Zhao during a short visit of the author last summer. Our structural result for the log forms also lays the foundation for the study of Milnor $K$-theory with vanishing along $D$ in the paper to come.</description>

Abstract: We propose a concept of truncation for arbitrary smooth projective toric varieties and construct explicit cellular resolutions for nef truncations of their total coordinate rings. We show that these resolutions agree with the short resolutions of Hanlon, Hicks, and Lazarev, which were motivated by symplectic geometry, and we use our definition to exhibit nontrivial homology in the commutative algebraic analogue of their construction.</description>

      <title>Singular loci in varieties of tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Vec-variety is a suitable functor from finite-dimensional vector spaces to finite-dimensional varieties. Most varieties in the geometry of tensors, e.g. the variety of d-way tensors of slice rank at most r, are of this form. We prove that the singular locus of a Vec-variety is a proper closed Vec-subvariety, analogously to the situation for ordinary finite-dimensional varieties. Via earlier work of the third author, this implies that these singular loci admit a description by finitely many polynomial equations.
  A natural follow-up question to our main result is whether a Vec-variety also admits a suitably functorial resolution of singularities. We establish some preliminary results in this direction in the regime where the dimension of evaluations of a Vec-variety grows linearly with that of the input vector space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Tannakian formalism, one can attach to a principally polarized abelian variety a reductive group, along with a representation. We show that this group and the representation characterize Jacobians in genus up to $5$. More generally, our results hold on the bielliptic Prym locus in all genera. This gives the first evidence towards a recent conjecture by Weissauer and Kr\"amer. The main tool in our proof is a criterion for detecting Jacobians relying on Chern-Mather classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Log-canonical and $F$-pure thresholds of pairs in equal characteristic admit an analog in the recent theory of singularities in mixed characteristic, which is known as the plus-pure threshold. In this paper we study plus-pure thresholds for singularities of the form $p^a + x^b \in {\bf Z}_p [[ x ]]$, showing that in a number of cases this plus-pure threshold agrees with the $F$-pure threshold of the singularity $t^a + x^b \in {\bf F}_p [[ t, x ]]$. We also discuss a few other sporadic examples.</description>

As an application, we prove that, given a projective generalised klt pair $(X,B+M)$ with data $M'$ being just a nef $\mathbb{R}$-divisor, if $K_X+B+M$ birationally has a Nakayama-Zariski decomposition with nef positive part, and either if $M'$ or the positive part is log numerically effective, then it has a minimal model. Furthermore, we prove this for generalised lc pairs in dimension $3$. This is a generalisation of the main theorem of [Birkar-Hu14]. We also prove some related results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we compute the Chow--Witt rings of the classifying space ${\rm BSL}_n^c$ of quadratically oriented vector bundles of rank $n$. We also discuss the corresponding quadratically-oriented cobordism spectrum ${\rm MSL}^c$ and show that it is equivalent to $\rm{MSL}$ after inverting $\eta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a geometric generalization of class field theory, demonstrating how adelic constructions, central to the spectral realization of zeros of L-functions and the geometric framework for explicit formulas in number theory, naturally extend the classical theory. This generalization transitions from the idele class group, which acts as the adelic analog of Galois groups, to a geometric framework associated with schemes and the ring of integers of global fields. This perspective provides a conceptual explanation for the role of the adele class space in the spectral realization of L-function zeros and identifies the idele class group as a generic point in this context. The sector $X_{\mathbb{Q}}$ of the adele class space corresponding to the Riemann zeta function gives the class field counterpart of the scaling topos. The main result is the construction of a functor mapping finite abelian extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ to finite covers of $X_{\mathbb{Q}}$, with the monodromy of periodic orbits of length $\log p$ under the scaling action corresponding to the Galois action of the Frobenius at the prime p.</description>

      <title>Geometric-combinatorial approaches to tilting theory for weighted projective lines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a geometric-combinatorial model for the category of coherent sheaves on the weighted projective line of type (2,2,n) via a cylindrical surface with n marked points on each of its upper and lower boundaries, equipped with an order 2 self-homeomorphism. A bijection is established between indecomposable sheaves on the weighted projective line and skew-curves on the surface. Moreover, by defining a skew-arc as a self-compatible skew-curve and a pseudo-triangulation as a maximal set of distinct pairwise compatible skew-arcs, we show that pseudo-triangulations correspond bijectively to tilting sheaves. Under this bijection, the flip of a skew-arc within a pseudo-triangulation coincides with the tilting mutation. As an application, we prove the connectivity of the tilting graph for the category of coherent sheaves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the category of countable Tate modules over an arbitrary discrete ring embeds fully faithfully into that of condensed modules. If the base ring is of finite type, we characterize the essential image as generated by the free module of infinite countable rank under direct sums, duals and retracts. In the $\infty$-categorical context, we establish a fully faithful embedding of the $\infty$-category of countable Tate objects in perfect complexes, with uniformly bounded tor-amplitude, into the derived $\infty$-category of condensed modules. The boundedness assumption is necessary to ensure fullness, as we prove via an explicit counterexample in the unbounded case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simplicial cochain complex can be derived from a locally small poset by taking the nerve of the poset viewed as a category. We show that the simplicial cochain complex and a relative Hochschild cochain complex of the incidence algebra of the poset are isomorphic as operads with multiplications. This result implies that the hG-algebras derived from those operads are isomorphic, which is a generalization of the Gerstenhaber-Shack theorem. The isomorphism also induces a differential graded Lie algebra isomorphism, which we use to compute the moduli space of formal deformations of the incidence algebra.</description>

Abstract: Coloured graphical models are Gaussian statistical models determined by an undirected coloured graph. These models can be described by linear spaces of symmetric matrices. We outline a relationship between the symmetries of the graph and the linear forms that vanish on the reciprocal variety of the model. In particular, we give four families for which such linear forms are completely described by symmetries.</description>

Abstract: We show a stability-type theorem for foliations on projective spaces which arise as pullbacks of foliations with a split tangent sheaf on weighted projective spaces. As a consequence, we will be able to construct many irreducible components of the corresponding spaces of foliations, most of them being previously unknown. This result also provides an alternative and unified proof for the stability of other families of foliations.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we introduce the $k$-th collineation variety of a third order tensor. This is the closure of the image of the rational map of size $k$ minors of a matrix of linear forms associated to the tensor. We classify such varieties in the case of pencils of matrices, and nets of matrices of small size. We discuss the natural stratification of tensor spaces induced by the invariants and the geometric type of the collineation varieties.</description>

      <title>Generic motives and motivic cohomology of fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes are devoted to the study of generic motives and their application to the structure of the motivic cohomology of fields. Related to Voevodsky's homotopy $t$-structure on motivic complexes, generic motives are also central to the conjectural motivic $t$-structure, as was shown by Beilinson. Morphisms of generic motives are closely related to the functoriality of Rost's cycle modules. e obtain some new computations of generic motives, and deduce computations of morphisms of generic motives, which draw a conjectural picture.
  The structure of generic motives reflects into that of motivic cohomology of fields. After giving a new argument for determining weights in the K-theory of number fields using Borel's isomorphism, we deduce that many motivic cohomology groups of fields have infinite rank, usually of the same cardinality as the field itself. As an example motivic cohomology groups of the real or complex numbers are shown to be uncountable in many degrees and twists. Despite these results, we formulate a hope on their behavior with respect to transcendental elements, providing a counterpart to the Beilinson-Soul\'e vanishing conjecture.</description>

Abstract: The modular curves serve as excellent objects for testing conjectures in arithmetic geometry. They possess a natural geometric definition in contrast with rather nontrivial structure. On the other hand, they are well-studied from the perspective of number theory. Furthermore, there is a well-developed and powerful analytic technique available. We will use the square of the modular curve as the experimental object to investigate the arithmetic properties of the periods of mixed Hodge structures. There is an additional reason for this study: this square is naturally associated with a family of (Hecke) curves. These curves form components of the Neron-Severi locus, allowing for the interpretation of the square of the moduli curve as the moduli space of split (i.e., the product of two elliptic curves) abelian surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01807v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a reduced complex projective plane curve, and let $d_1$ and $d_2$ be the first two smallest exponents of $C$. For a free curve $C$ of degree $d$, there is a simple formula relating $d,d_1, d_2$ and the total Tjurina number of $C$. Our first result discusses how this result changes when the curve $C$ is no longer free. For a free line arrangement, the Poincar\'e polynomial coincides with the Betti polynomial $B(t)$ and with the product $P(t)=(1+d_1t)(1+d_2t)$. Our second result shows that for any curve $C$, the difference $P(t)-B(t)$ is a polynomial $a t +bt^2$, with $a$ and $b$ non-negative integers. Moreover $a =0$ or $b=0$ if and only if $C$ is a free line arrangement. Finally we give new bounds for the second exponent $d_2$ of a line arrangement $\mathcal A$, the corresponding lower bound being an improvement of a result by H. Schenck concerning the relation between the maximal exponent of $\mathcal A$ and the maximal multiplicity of points in $\mathcal A$.</description>

      <title>Slope Stable Sheaves and Hermitian-Einstein Metrics on Normal Varieties with Big Cohomology Classes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of $\alpha$-slope stability of sheaves where $\alpha$ is a big cohomology class. We also define the notion of a $T$-Hermitian-Einstein metric for sheaves in terms of a closed positive $(1,1)$-current $T$. The first main theorem establishes the invariance of these notions under bimeromorphic transformations that are compositions of proper bimeromorphic maps and bimeromorphic morphisms isomorphic in codimension 1. The second main theorem proves the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence with respect to the canonical divisor on a projective variety of general type. As a consequence of this correspondence, we show that the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality holds and the $T$-Hermitian-Einstein metric provides a characterization of the equality in the inequality on varieties of general type. Additionally, we extend the Bogomolov-Gieseker inequality to non-projective normal varieties with a transcendental big and nef cohomology class.</description>

Using conjectural descriptions of twists of superstrings in terms of topological strings, we argue that this action can be thought of as a version of S-duality that preserves an SU(3)-invariant twist of type IIB supergravity. We analyze how SL(2,Z) acts on various deformations of the holomorphic-topological twist of 4-dimensional N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory, which come from residual supertranslations and superconformal symmetries, and are of relevance to geometric Langlands theory and gauge-theoretic constructions of the Yangian.</description>

Abstract: Using brane quantization, we study the representation theory of the spherical double affine Hecke algebra of type $A_1$ in terms of the topological A-model on the moduli space of flat SL(2,C)-connections on a once-punctured torus. In particular, we provide an explicit match between finite-dimensional representations and A-branes with compact support; one consequence is the discovery of new finite-dimensional indecomposable representations. We proceed to embed the A-model story in an M-theory brane construction, closely related to the one used in the 3d/3d correspondence; as a result, we identify modular tensor categories behind particular finite-dimensional representations with PSL(2,Z) action. Using a further connection to the fivebrane system for the class S construction, we go on to study the relationship of Coulomb branch geometry and algebras of line operators in 4d N=2* theories to the double affine Hecke algebra.</description>

Abstract: We provide a complete description of the ideal that serves as the resultant ideal for n univariate polynomials of degree d. We in particular describe a set of generators of this resultant ideal arising as maximal minors of a set of cascading matrices formed from the coefficients of the polynomials, generalising the classical Sylvester resultant of two polynomials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry &amp; Critical Points for Symmetric Tensor Decomposition Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonconvex optimization problem associated with the decomposition of a real symmetric tensor into a sum of rank one terms. Use is made of the rich symmetry structure to construct infinite families of critical points represented by Puiseux series in the problem dimension, and so obtain precise analytic estimates on the value of the objective function and the Hessian spectrum. The results allow an analytic characterization of various obstructions to using local optimization methods, revealing in particular a complex array of saddles and minima differing by their symmetry, structure and analytic properties. A~desirable phenomenon, occurring for all critical points considered, concerns the number of negative Hessian eigenvalues increasing with the value of the objective function. Our approach makes use of Newton polyhedra as well as results from real algebraic geometry, notably the Curve Selection Lemma, to determine the extremal character of degenerate critical points, establishing in particular the existence of infinite families of third-order saddles which can significantly slow down the optimization process.</description>

      <title>Proper holomorphic maps between bounded symmetric domains with small rank differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the rigidity of proper holomorphic maps $f\colon \Omega\to\Omega'$ between irreducible bounded symmetric domains $\Omega$ and $\Omega'$ with small rank differences: $2\leq \text{rank}(\Omega')&lt; 2\,\text{rank}(\Omega)-1$. More precisely, if either $\Omega$ and $\Omega'$ have the same type or $\Omega$ is of type~III and $\Omega'$ is of type~I, then up to automorphisms, $f$ is of the form $f=\imath\circ F$, where $F = F_1\times F_2\colon \Omega\to \Omega_1'\times \Omega_2'$. Here $\Omega_1'$, $\Omega_2'$ are bounded symmetric domains, the map $F_1\colon \Omega \to \Omega_1'$ is a standard embedding, $F_2: \Omega \to \Omega_2'$, and $\imath\colon \Omega'_1\times \Omega'_2 \to \Omega'$ is a totally geodesic holomorphic isometric embedding. Moreover we show that, under the rank condition above, there exists no proper holomorphic map $f: \Omega \to \Omega'$ if $\Omega$ is of type~I and $\Omega'$ is of type~III, or $\Omega$ is of type~II and $\Omega'$ is either of type~I or III. By considering boundary values of proper holomorphic maps on maximal boundary components of $\Omega$, we construct rational maps between moduli spaces of subgrassmannians of compact duals of $\Omega$ and $\Omega'$, and induced CR-maps between CR-hypersurfaces of mixed signature, thereby forcing the moduli map to satisfy strong local differential-geometric constraints (or that such moduli maps do not exist), and complete the proofs from rigidity results on geometric substructures modeled on certain admissible pairs of rational homogeneous spaces of Picard number 1.</description>

Abstract: Let G be a compact real Lie group, and let f be an irreducible complex character of G, of degree &gt; 1. We show that there exists an element g of G, of finite order, such that f(g)=0. We also give an unpublished result of Deligne, about replacing " of finite order " by " of order a power of a prime number ".</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-character stacks and Langlands duality over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the mixed Poincar\'e polynomial of generic parabolic $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-character stacks with coefficients in some local systems arising from the conjugacy class of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ which has a non-connected stabiliser. We give a conjectural formula that we prove to be true under the Euler specialisation. We then prove that this conjectured formula interpolates the structure coefficients of the two based rings$ \left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)),Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_2),*\right)$ and $\left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)), CS(\mathrm{SL}_2),\cdot\right) $ where for a group $H$, $\mathcal{C}(H)$ denotes the space of complex valued class functions on $H$, $Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_2)$ denotes the basis of characteristic functions of intermediate extensions of equivariant local systems on conjugacy classes of $\mathrm{PGL}_2$ and $CS(\mathrm{SL}_2)$ the basis of characteristic functions of Lusztig's character-sheaves on $\mathrm{SL}_2$. Our result reminds us of a non-abelian Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>Branes and Representations of DAHA $C^\vee C_1$: affine braid group action on category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the representation theory of the spherical double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) of $C^\vee C_1$, using brane quantization. By showing a one-to-one correspondence between Lagrangian $A$-branes with compact support and finite-dimensional representations of the spherical DAHA, we provide evidence of derived equivalence between the $A$-brane category of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety of a four-punctured sphere and the representation category of DAHA of $C^\vee C_1$. The $D_4$ root system plays an essential role in understanding both the geometry and representation theory. In particular, this $A$-model approach reveals the action of an affine braid group of type $D_4$ on the category. As a by-product, our geometric investigation offers detailed information about the low-energy effective dynamics of the SU(2) $N_f=4$ Seiberg-Witten theory.</description>
