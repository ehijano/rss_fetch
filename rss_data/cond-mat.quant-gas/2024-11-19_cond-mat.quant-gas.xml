      <title>Validity of the Fr\"ohlich model for a mobile impurity in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the many-body Hamiltonian describing a mobile impurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Using exact unitary transformations and rigorous error estimates, we show the validity of the Bogoliubov-Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian for the Bose polaron in the regime of moderately strong, repulsive interactions with a dilute BEC. Moreover, we calculate analytically the universal logarithmic correction to the ground state energy that arises from an impurity mediated phonon-phonon interaction.</description>

      <title>Topological Pathways to Two-Dimensional Quantum Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the formation and decay kinetics of vortices in two dimensional, compressible quantum turbulence. We follow the temporal evolution of a quantum fluid of exciton polaritons, hybrid light matter quasiparticles, and measure both phase and modulus of the order parameter in the turbulent regime. Fundamental topological conservation laws require that the formation and annihilation of vortices also involve critical points of the velocity field, namely nodes and saddles. Identifying the simplest mechanisms underlying these processes enables us to develop an effective kinetic model that closely aligns with the experimental observations, and shows that different processes are responsible for vortex number growth and decay. These findings underscore the crucial role played by topological constraints in shaping nonlinear, turbulent evolution of two dimensional quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>String-Breaking Dynamics in Quantum Adiabatic and Diabatic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement prohibits isolation of color charges, e.g., quarks, in nature via a process called string breaking: the separation of two charges results in an increase in the energy of a color flux, visualized as a string, connecting those charges. Eventually, creating additional charges is energetically favored, hence breaking the string. Such a phenomenon can be probed in simpler models, including quantum spin chains, enabling enhanced understanding of string-breaking dynamics. A challenging task is to understand how string breaking occurs as time elapses, in an out-of-equilibrium setting. This work establishes the phenomenology of dynamical string breaking induced by a gradual increase of string tension over time. It, thus, goes beyond instantaneous quench processes and enables tracking the real-time evolution of strings in a more controlled setting. We focus on domain-wall confinement in a family of quantum Ising chains. Our results indicate that, for sufficiently short strings and slow evolution, string breaking can be described by the transition dynamics of a two-state quantum system akin to a Landau-Zener process. For longer strings, a more intricate spatiotemporal pattern emerges: the string breaks by forming a superposition of bubbles (domains of flipped spins of varying sizes), which involve highly excited states. We finally demonstrate that string breaking driven only by quantum fluctuations can be realized in the presence of sufficiently long-ranged interactions. This work holds immediate relevance for studying string breaking in quantum-simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Chiral Majorana Edge States and Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Two-Dimensional Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetal/Superconductor Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals are renowned for the host of singular symmetry-protected band degeneracies which can give rise to other exotic phases. In this work, we consider a two-dimensional Dirac semimetal stabilized by PT symmetry and nonsymmorphic symmetries. We find that an out-of-plane Zeeman field can lift the Dirac points and transform the system into a Chern insulator with chiral edge states. By placing the nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, we uncover that chiral topological superconductors with large Chern numbers can be achieved. In addition, we find that topologically-protected Bogoliubov Fermi surface can also emerge in this system, due to the coexistence of inversion symmetry and particle-hole symmetry. Notably, we find that the chiral Majorana edge state persists even when the Chern number becomes ill-defined due to the appearance of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The impact of these Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces on the thermal Hall effects is also investigated. Our study not only identifies a class of materials capable of realizing topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces through conventional s-wave superconductivity, but also uncovers an exotic phase where chiral Majorana edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces coexist.</description>

      <title>Fractal Quasicondensation in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unveil a novel mechanism for quasicondensation of hard-core bosons in the presence of quasiperiodicity-induced multifractal single-particle states. The new critical state, here dubbed fractal quasicondensate, is characterized by natural orbitals with multifractal properties and by an occupancy of the lowest natural orbital, {\lambda}0 ~ L{\gamma}, which grows with system size but with a nonuniversal scaling exponent, {\gamma} &lt; 1/2. In contrast to fractal quasicondensates obtained when the chemical potential lies in a region of multifractal single-particle states, placing the chemical potential in regions of localized or delocalized states yields, respectively, no condensation or the usual 1D quasicondensation with {\gamma} = 1/2. Our findings are established by studying one-dimensional hardcore bosons subjected to various quasiperiodic potentials, including the well-known Aubry-Andre model, employing a mapping to non-interacting fermionics that allows for numerically exact results. We discuss how to test our findings in state-of-the-art ultracold atom experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Strongly-Interacting Regime of Effective Multi-Body Interactions in a Trapped Ultracold Atom System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly-interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction, evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important first step for our deeper understanding of an important relation to a strongly-interacting mesoscopic Bose polaron problem.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical dynamics of a coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from a saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle, hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <title>Surface criticality in the mixed-field Ising model with sign-inverted next-nearest-neighbor interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atoms in an optical tweezer array have been used as a quantum simulator of the spin-$1/2$ antiferromagnetic Ising model with longitudinal and transverse fields. We suggest how to implement the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction whose sign is opposite to that of the nearest neighbor one in the Rydberg atom systems. We show that this can be achieved by weakly coupling one Rydberg state with another Rydberg state. We further study the surface criticality associated with the first-order quantum phase transition between the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, which emerges due to the sign-inverted NNN interaction. From the microscopic model, we derive a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equation, which describes static and dynamic properties of the antiferromagnetic order parameter near the transition. Using both analytical GL theory and numerical method based on a mean-field theory, we calculate the order parameter in the proximity of a boundary of the system in order to show that the healing length of the order parameter logarithmically diverges, signaling the surface criticality.</description>

      <title>Two-component repulsive atomic Fermi gases in a thin spherical shell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present possible ground-state structures of two-component atomic Fermi gases with repulsive interactions in a thin spherical shell geometry by implementing a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. The system exhibits a miscible-immiscible transition from a homogeneous mixture to two-chunk phase separation as the interaction strength crosses a critical value. While the critical value is relatively insensitive to population imbalance for equal-mass mixtures, it decreases with the mass ratio when mass-imbalance is present. The interaction may be tuned by the two-body scattering length or the radius of the sphere, thereby allowing the system to cross the transition by varying different parameters. When the atoms on the sphere are rotating, three-chunk sandwich structures emerge in mass-imbalanced mixtures as a consequence of maximal angular momentum along the rotation axis. Some indications of geometric effects and possible experimental implications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Infinite cycles of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first-quantized description of bosonic systems permutation cycles formed by the particles play a fundamental role. In the ideal Bose gas Bose-Enstein condensation (BEC) is signaled by the appearance of infinite cycles. When the particles interact, the two phenomena may not be simultaneous, the existence of infinite cycles is necessary but not sufficient for BEC. We demonstrate that their appearance is always accompanied by a singularity in the thermodynamic quantities which in three and four dimensions can be as strong as a one-sided divergence of the isothermal compressibility. Arguments are presented that long-range interactions can give rise to unexpected results, such as the absence of infinite cycles in three dimensions for long-range repulsion or their presence in one and two dimensions if the pair potential has a long attractive tail.</description>

      <title>Measuring a localization phase diagram controlled by the interplay of disorder and driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of various localizing mechanisms is a central topic of modern condensed matter physics. In this work we experimentally explore the interplay between quasiperiodic disorder and periodic driving, each of which in isolation is capable of driving a metal-insulator phase transition. Using a 1D quasiperiodic cold-atom chain we measure transport across the full phase diagram varying both drive strength and quasidisorder strength. We observe lobes of metallic phases bounded by quantum phase transitions which depend on both drive and disorder. While these observations are broadly consistent with expectations from a high-drive-frequency theoretical model, we also observe clear departures from the predictions of this model, including anomalous changes in localization behavior at lower drive frequency. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that understanding the full measured phase diagram requires an extension to commonly-used approximate theories of Floquet matter.</description>
