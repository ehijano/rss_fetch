      <title>The m-th Longest Runs of Multivariate Random Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distributions of the $m$-th longest runs of multivariate random sequences are considered. For random sequences made up of $k$ kinds of letters, the lengths of the runs are sorted in two ways to give two definitions of run length ordering. In one definition, the lengths of the runs are sorted separately for each letter type. In the second definition, the lengths of all the runs are sorted together. Exact formulas are developed for the distributions of the m-th longest runs for both definitions. The derivations are based on a two-step method that is applicable to various other runs-related distributions, such as joint distributions of several letter types and multiple run lengths of a single letter type.</description>

      <title>Joint distribution of rises, falls, and number of runs in random sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the matrix formulation of the two-step approach to the distributions of runs, a recursive relation and an explicit expression are derived for the generating function of the joint distribution of rises and falls for multivariate random sequences in terms of generating functions of individual letters, from which the generating functions of the joint distribution of rises, falls, and number of runs are obtained. An explicit formula for the joint distribution of rises and falls with arbitrary specification is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Critical Kernel Imperfectness in $4$-quasi-transitive and $4$-anti-transitive digraphs of small diameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A kernel in a digraph is an independent and absorbent subset of its vertex set. A digraph is critical kernel imperfect if it does not have a kernel, but every proper induced subdigraph does. In this article, we characterize asymmetrical $4$-quasi-transitive and $4$-transitive digraphs, as well as $2$-anti-transitive, and asymmetrical $4$-anti-transitive digraphs with bounded diameter, which are critical kernel imperfect.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ramsey-Tur\'an Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ramsey-Tur\'an problem for $K_p$ asks for the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $K_p$-free graph with independence number $o(n)$. In a natural generalization of the problem, cliques larger than the edge $K_2$ are counted. Let {\bf RT}$(n,\#K_q,K_p,o(n))$ denote the maximum number of copies of $K_q$ in an $n$-vertex $K_p$-free graph with independence number $o(n)$. Balogh, Liu and Sharifzadeh determined the asymptotics of {\bf RT}$(n,\# K_3,K_p,o(n))$. In this paper we will establish the asymptotics for counting copies of $K_4$, $K_5$, and for the case $p \geq 5q$. We also provide a family of counterexamples to a conjecture of Balogh, Liu and Sharifzadeh.</description>

      <title>Genetic algorithm and edge-colorings of complete graphs with connected classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of a particular genetic algorithm, the Rank Genetic Algorithm (Rank GA), to address a graph theory problem. The Rank GA was introduced to address the problem of graph coloring, exploring into the specialized field of Chromatic Graph Theory. We successfully improved several of the previously known lower bounds. To validate the effectiveness of these new bounds, we performed an analytical approximation, confirming their validity. The findings underscore the interdisciplinary impact of the use of genetic algorithms in theoretical mathematical research.</description>

      <title>The Order of the (123, 132)-Avoiding Stack Sort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $s$ be West's deterministic stack-sorting map. A well-known result (West) is that any length $n$ permutation can be sorted with $n-1$ iterations of $s.$ In 2020, Defant introduced the notion of highly-sorted permutations -- permutations in $s^t(S_n)$ for $t \lessapprox n-1.$ In 2023, Choi and Choi extended this notion to generalized stack-sorting maps $s_{\sigma},$ where we relax the condition of becoming sorted to the analogous condition of becoming periodic with respect to $s_{\sigma}.$ In this work, we introduce the notion of minimally-sorted permutations $\mathfrak{M}_n$ as an antithesis to Defant's highly-sorted permutations, and show that $\text{ord}_{s_{123, 132}}(S_n) = 2 \lfloor \frac{n-1}{2} \rfloor,$ strengthening Berlow's 2021 classification of periodic points.</description>

      <title>Generating all invertible matrices by row operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that all invertible $n \times n$ matrices over any finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ can be generated in a Gray code fashion. More specifically, there exists a listing such that (1) each matrix appears exactly once, and (2) two consecutive matrices differ by adding or subtracting one row from a previous or subsequent row, or by multiplying or diving a row by the generator of the multiplicative group of $\mathbb{F}_q$. This even holds if the addition and subtraction of each row is allowed to some specific rows satisfying a certain mild condition. Moreover, we can prescribe the first and the last matrix if $n\ge 3$, or $n=2$ and $q&gt;2$. In other words, the corresponding flip graph on all invertible $n \times n$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is Hamilton connected if it is not a cycle.</description>

      <title>Unavoidable induced subgraphs in graphs with complete bipartite induced minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a graph contains the complete bipartite graph $K_{134, 12}$ as an induced minor, then it contains a cycle of length at most~12 or a theta as an induced subgraph. With a longer and more technical proof, we prove that if a graph contains $K_{3, 4}$ as an induced minor, then it contains a triangle or a theta as an induced subgraph. Here, a \emph{theta} is a graph made of three internally vertex-disjoint chordless paths $P_1 = a \dots b$, $P_2 = a \dots b$, $P_3 = a \dots b$, each of length at least two, such that no edges exist between the paths except the three edges incident to $a$ and the three edges incident to $b$.
  A consequence is that excluding a grid and a complete bipartite graph as induced minors is not enough to guarantee a bounded tree-independence number, or even that the treewidth is bounded by a function of the size of the maximum clique, because the existence of graphs with large treewidth that contain no triangles or thetas as induced subgraphs is already known (the so-called layered wheels).</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to two conjectures on mean color numbers of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean color number of an $n$-vertex graph $G$, denoted by $\mu(G)$, is the average number of colors used in all proper $n$-colorings of $G$. For any graph $G$ and a vertex $w$ in $G$, Dong (2003) conjectured that if $H$ is a graph obtained from a graph $G$ by deleting all but one of the edges which are incident to $w$, then $\mu(G)\geq \mu(H)$; and also conjectured that $\mu(G)\geq \mu((G-w)\cup K_1)$. We prove that there is an infinite family of counterexamples to these two conjectures.</description>

      <title>Topologically Interlocking Blocks inside the Tetroctahedrille</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological interlocking assembly consists of rigid blocks together with a fixed frame, such that any subset of blocks is kinematically constrained and therefore cannot be removed from the assembly. In this paper we pursue a modular approach to construct (non-convex) interlocking blocks by combining finitely many tetrahedra and octahedra. This gives rise to polyhedra whose vertices can be described by the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb, also known as tetroctahedrille. We show that the resulting interlocking blocks are very versatile and allow many possibilities to form topological interlocking assemblies consisting of copies of a single block. We formulate a generalised construction of some of the introduced blocks to construct families of topological interlocking blocks. Moreover, we demonstrate a geometric application by using the tetroctahedrille to approximate given geometric objects. Finally, we show that given topological interlocking assemblies can be deformed continuously in order to obtain new topological interlocking assemblies.</description>

      <title>Hypertree shrinking avoiding low degree vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shrinking operation converts a hypergraph into a graph by choosing, from each hyperedge, two endvertices of a corresponding graph edge. A hypertree is a hypergraph which can be shrunk to a tree on the same vertex set. Klimo\v{s}ov\'{a} and Thomass\'{e} [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 156 (2022), 250--293] proved (as a tool to obtain their main result on edge-decompositions of graphs into paths of equal length) that any rank $3$ hypertree $T$ can be shrunk to a tree where the degree of each vertex is at least $1/100$ times its degree in $T$. We prove a stronger and a more general bound, replacing the constant $1/100$ with $1/2k$ when the rank is $k$. In place of entropy compression (used by Klimo\v{s}ov\'{a} and Thomass\'{e}), we use a hypergraph orientation lemma combined with a characterisation of edge-coloured graphs admitting rainbow spanning trees.</description>

      <title>Some properties of the Zero-set Intersection graph of $C(X)$ and its Line graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C(X)$ be the ring of all continuous real valued functions defined on a completely regular Hausdorff topological space $X$. The zero-set intersection graph $\Gamma (C(X))$ of $C(X)$ is a simple graph with vertex set all non units of $C(X)$ and two vertices are adjacent if the intersection of the zero sets of the functions is non empty. In this paper, we study the zero-set intersection graph of $C(X)$ and its line graph. We show that if $X$ has more than two points, then these graphs are connected with diameter and radius 2. We show that the girth of the graph is 3 and the graphs are both triangulated and hypertriangulated. We find the domination number of these graphs and finally we prove that $C(X)$ is a von Neuman regular ring if and only if $C(X)$ is an almost regular ring and for all $f \in V(\Gamma (C(X)))$ there exists $g \in V(\Gamma(C(X)))$ such that $Z(f) \cap Z(g) = \phi$ and $\{f, g\}$ dominates $\Gamma(C(X))$. Finally, we derive some properties of the line graph of $\Gamma (C(X))$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $n$-tuple $s$ of non-negative integers, the $s$-weak order is a lattice structure on $s$-trees, generalizing the weak order on permutations. We first describe the join irreducible elements, the canonical join representations, and the forcing order of the $s$-weak order in terms of combinatorial objects, generalizing the arcs, the non-crossing arc diagrams, and the subarc order for the weak order. We then extend the theory of shards and shard polytopes to construct geometric realizations of the $s$-weak order and all its lattice quotients as polyhedral complexes, generalizing the quotient fans and quotientopes of the weak order.</description>

      <title>Chordal matroids arising from generalized parallel connections II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1961, Dirac showed that chordal graphs are exactly the graphs that can be constructed from complete graphs by a sequence of clique-sums. In an earlier paper, by analogy with Dirac's result, we introduced the class of $GF(q)$-chordal matroids as those matroids that can be constructed from projective geometries over $GF(q)$ by a sequence of generalized parallel connections across projective geometries over $GF(q)$. Our main result showed that when $q=2$, such matroids have no induced minor in $\{M(C_4),M(K_4)\}$. In this paper, we show that the class of $GF(2)$-chordal matroids coincides with the class of binary matroids that have none of $M(K_4)$, $M^*(K_{3,3})$, or $M(C_n)$ for $n\geq 4$ as a flat. We also show that $GF(q)$-chordal matroids can be characterized by an analogous result to Rose's 1970 characterization of chordal graphs as those that have a perfect elimination ordering of vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a "shifted analogue" $\mathrm{SH}_n$ of the parking function symmetric function $\mathrm{PF}_n$. The expansion of $\mathrm{SH}_n$ in terms of three bases for shifted symmetric functions is explicitly described. We don't know a shifted analogue for parking functions themselves, but some desirable properties of such an analogue are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look at both the \emph{group labeling lights out game} and the \emph{neighborhood lights out game}. Our main focus is to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for when the group labeling lights out game on path graphs, cycle graphs, and complete bipartite graphs can be won for every possible initial labeling. In the process of solving this problem, we demonstrate a new proof for when the neighborhood lights out game on complete bipartite graphs can be won for every possible initial labeling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A given subset $A$ of natural numbers is said to be complete if every element of $\N$ is the sum of distinct terms taken from $A$. This topic is strongly connected to the knapsack problem which is known to be NP complete. The main goal of the paper is to study the structure of subset sums in a higher dimension. We show 'dense' sets and generalized arithmetic progrssions in subset sums of certain sets.</description>

Abstract: Subspace codes have recently been used for error correction in random network coding. In this work, we focus on one-orbit cyclic subspace codes. If $S$ is an $\mathbb{F}_q$-subspace of $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$, then the one-orbit cyclic subspace code defined by $S$ is \[ \mathrm{Orb}(S)=\{\alpha S \colon \alpha \in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*\}, \]where $\alpha S=\lbrace \alpha s \colon s\in S\rbrace$ for any $\alpha\in \mathbb{F}_{q^n}^*$. Few classification results of subspace codes are known, therefore it is quite natural to initiate a classification of cyclic subspace codes, especially in the light of the recent classification of the isometries for cyclic subspace codes. We consider three-dimensional one-orbit cyclic subspace codes, which are divided into three families: the first one containing only $\mathrm{Orb}(\mathbb{F}_{q^3})$; the second one containing the optimum-distance codes; and the third one whose elements are codes with minimum distance $2$. We study inequivalent codes in the latter two families.</description>

      <title>A divisor generating q-series identity and its applications to probability theory and random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In I981, Uchimura studied a divisor generating $q$-series that has applications in probability theory and in the analysis of data structures, called heaps. Mainly, he proved the following identity. For $|q|&lt;1$, \begin{equation*} \sum_{n=1}^\infty n q^n (q^{n+1})_\infty =\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1} q^{\frac{n(n+1)}{2} } }{(1-q^n) ( q)_n } = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{ q^n }{1-q^n}. \end{equation*} Over the years, this identity has been generalized by many mathematicians in different directions. Uchimura himself in 1987, Dilcher (1995), Andrews-Crippa-Simon (1997), and recently Gupta-Kumar (2021) found a generalization of the aforementioned identity. Any generalization of the right most expression of the above identity, we name as divisor-type sum, whereas a generalization of the middle expression we say Ramanujan-type sum, and any generalization of the left most expression we refer it as Uchimura-type sum. Quite surprisingly, Simon, Crippa and Collenberg (1993) showed that the same divisor generating function has a connection with random acyclic digraphs. One of the main themes of this paper is to study these different generalizations and present a unified theory. We also discuss applications of these generalized identities in probability theory for the analysis of heaps and random acyclic digraphs.</description>

      <title>Upper tails of subgraph counts in directed random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upper tail problem in a sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph asks for the probability that the number of copies of some fixed subgraph exceeds its expected value by a constant factor. We study the analogous problem for oriented subgraphs in directed random graphs. By adapting the proof of Cook, Dembo, and Pham, we reduce this upper tail problem to the asymptotic of a certain variational problem over edge weighted directed graphs. We give upper and lower bounds for the solution to the corresponding variational problem, which differ by a constant factor of at most $2$. We provide a host of subgraphs where the upper and lower bounds coincide, giving the solution to the upper tail problem. Examples of such digraphs include triangles, stars, directed $k$-cycles, and balanced digraphs.</description>

      <title>Equal Requests are Asymptotically Hardest for Data Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a distributed storage system serving hot data, the data recovery performance becomes important, captured e.g. by the service rate. We give partial evidence for it being hardest to serve a sequence of equal user requests (as in PIR coding regime) both for concrete and random user requests and server contents.
  We prove that a constant request sequence is locally hardest to serve: If enough copies of each vector are stored in servers, then if a request sequence with all requests equal can be served then we can still serve it if a few requests are changed.
  For random iid server contents, with number of data symbols constant (for simplicity) and the number of servers growing, we show that the maximum number of user requests we can serve divided by the number of servers we need approaches a limit almost surely. For uniform server contents, we show this limit is 1/2, both for sequences of copies of a fixed request and of any requests, so it is at least as hard to serve equal requests as any requests. For iid requests independent from the uniform server contents the limit is at least 1/2 and equal to 1/2 if requests are all equal to a fixed request almost surely, confirming the same.
  As a building block, we deduce from a 1952 result of Marshall Hall, Jr. on abelian groups, that any collection of half as many requests as coded symbols in the doubled binary simplex code can be served by this code. This implies the fractional version of the Functional Batch Code Conjecture that allows half-servers.</description>

      <title>Edge-length preserving embeddings of graphs between normed spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of graph flattenability, initially formalized by Belk and Connelly and later expanded by Sitharam and Willoughby, extends the question of embedding finite metric spaces into a given normed space. A finite simple graph $G=(V,E)$ is said to be $(X,Y)$-flattenable if any set of induced edge lengths from an embedding of $G$ into a normed space $Y$ can also be realised by an embedding of $G$ into a normed space $X$. This property, being minor-closed, can be characterized by a finite list of forbidden minors. Following the establishment of fundamental results about $(X,Y)$-flattenability, we identify sufficient conditions under which it implies independence with respect to the associated rigidity matroids for $X$ and $Y$. We show that the spaces $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ serve as two natural extreme spaces of flattenability and discuss $(X, \ell_p )$-flattenability for varying $p$. We provide a complete characterization of $(X,Y)$-flattenable graphs for the specific case when $X$ is 2-dimensional and $Y$ is infinite-dimensional.</description>

Abstract: The discriminantal arrangement $\mathcal{B}(n,k,\mathcal{A})$ has been introduced by Manin and Schectman in 1989 and it consists of all non-generic translates of a generic arrangement $\mathcal{A}$ of n hyperplanes in a $k$-dimensional space. It is known that its combinatorics depends on the original arrangement A which, following Bayer and Brandt [3], is called very generic if the intersection lattice of the induced discriminantal arrangement has maximum cardinality, non-very generic otherwise. While a complete description of the combinatorics of $\mathcal{B}(n,k,\mathcal{A})$ when $\mathcal{A}$ is very generic is known (see [2]), very few is known in the non-very generic case. Even to provide examples of non very generic arrangements proved to be a non-trivial task (see [17]). In this paper, we characterize, classify and provide examples of non-very generic arrangements in low dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04188v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Heawood inequality states that if the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices is embeddable in the sphere with $g$ handles, then $g \ge\dfrac{(n-3)(n-4)}{12}$. A higher-dimensional analogue of the Heawood inequality is the K\"uhnel conjecture. In a simplified form it states that for every integer $k&gt;0$ there is $c_k&gt;0$ such that if the union of $k$-faces of $n$-simplex embeds into the connected sum of $g$ copies of the Cartesian product $S^k\times S^k$ of two $k$-dimensional spheres, then $g\ge c_k n^{k+1}$. For $k&gt;1$ only linear estimates were known. We present a quadratic estimate $g\ge c_k n^2$. The proof is based on beautiful and fruitful interplay between geometric topology, combinatorics and linear algebra.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a universal obstruction of a graph parameter with respect to some quasi-ordering relation on graphs. Universal obstructions may serve as a canonical obstruction characterization of the approximate behaviour of graph parameters. We provide an order-theoretic characterization of the finiteness of universal obstructions and, when this is the case, we present some algorithmic implications on the existence of fixed-parameter algorithms.</description>

      <title>Super FiboCatalan Numbers and their Lucas Analogues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Catalan observed in 1874 that the numbers $S(m,n) = \frac{(2m)! (2n)!}{m! n! (m+n)!}$, now called the super Catalan numbers, are integers but there is still no known combinatorial interpretation for them in general, although interpretations have been given for the case $m=2$ and for $S(m, m+s)$ for $0 \leq s \leq 4$. In this paper, we define the super FiboCatalan numbers $S(m,n)_F = \frac{F_{2m}! F_{2n}!}{F_m! F_n! F_{m+n}!}$ and the generalized FiboCatalan numbers $J_{r,F} \frac{F_{2n}!}{F_n! F_{n+r+1}!}$ where $J_{r,F} = \frac{F_{2r+1}!}{F_r!}$. In addition, we give Lucas analogues for both of these numbers and use a result of Sagan and Tirrell to prove that the Lucas analogues are polynomials with non-negative integer coefficients which in turn proves that the super FiboCatalan numbers and the generalized FiboCatalan numbers are integers.</description>

Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to a long-standing conjecture of Thomassen, stating that every sufficiently highly connected graph has a $k$-vertex-connected orientation. We prove that a connectivity of order $O(k^2)$ suffices. As a key tool, we show that for every pair of positive integers $d$ and $t$, every $(t \cdot h(d))$-connected graph contains $t$ edge-disjoint $d$-rigid (in particular, $d$-connected) spanning subgraphs, where $h(d) = 10d(d+1)$. This also implies a positive answer to the conjecture of Kriesell that every sufficiently highly connected graph $G$ contains a spanning tree $T$ such that $G-E(T)$ is $k$-connected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using dominating sets to separate vertices of graphs is a well-studied problem in the larger domain of identification problems. In such problems, the objective is to choose a suitable dominating set $C$ of a graph $G$ such that the neighbourhoods of all vertices of $G$ have distinct intersections with $C$. Such a dominating and separating set $C$ is often referred to as a \emph{code} in the literature. Depending on the types of dominating and separating sets used, various problems arise under various names in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a new problem in the same realm of identification problems whereby the code, called \emph{open-separating dominating code}, or \emph{OSD-code} for short, is a dominating set and uses open neighbourhoods for separating vertices. The paper studies the fundamental properties concerning the existence, hardness and minimality of OSD-codes. Due to the emergence of a close and yet difficult to establish relation of the OSD-codes with another well-studied code in the literature called open locating dominating codes, or OLD-codes for short, we compare the two on various graph families. Finally, we also provide an equivalent reformulation of the problem of finding OSD-codes of a graph as a covering problem in a suitable hypergraph and discuss the polyhedra associated with OSD-codes, again in relation to OLD-codes of some graph families already studied in this context.</description>

Abstract: Discriminantal arrangements are hyperplane arrangements, which are generalized braid ones. They are constructed from given hyperplane arrangements, but their combinatorics are not invariant under combinatorial equivalence. However, it is known that the combinatorics of the discriminantal arrangement are constant on a Zariski open set of the space of hyperplane arrangements. In the present paper, we introduce non-very generic varieties in the space of hyperplane arrangements to classify discriminantal arrangements and show that the Zariski open set is the complement of non-very generic varieties. We study their basic properties and construction and provide examples, including infinite families of non-very generic varieties. In particular, the construction we call degeneration is a powerful tool for constructing non-very generic varieties. As an application, we provide lists of non-very generic varieties for spaces of small line arrangements.</description>

We also provide a definition for the projectivization of a leg bundle and prove the Borel-Hirzebruch type formula for its graph equivariant cohomology, assuming that the projectivization is again a GKM graph. Furthermore, we study the realization of the projective GKM fiber bundle, in the sense of Guillemin-Sabatini-Zara, can be obtained from the projectivization of a leg bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a population with dynamic pairwise connections, we ask if the entire population could be (indirectly) infected by a small group of $k$ initially infected individuals. We formalise this problem as the Temporal Reachability Dominating Set (TaRDiS}) problem on temporal graphs. We provide positive and negative parameterized complexity results in four different parameters: the number $k$ of initially infected, the lifetime $\tau$ of the graph, the number of locally earliest edges in the graph, and the treewidth of the footprint graph $\mathcal{G}_\downarrow$.
  We additionally introduce and study the MaxMinTaRDiS problem, where the aim is to schedule connections between individuals so that at least $k$ individuals must be infected for the entire population to become fully infected. We classify three variants of the problem: Strict, Nonstrict, and Happy. We show these to be coNP-complete, NP-hard, and $\Sigma_2^P$-complete, respectively. Interestingly, we obtain hardness of the Nonstrict variant by showing that a natural restriction is exactly the well-studied Distance-3 Independent Set problem on static graphs.</description>

Abstract: The study of longest increasing subsequences (LIS) in permutations led to that of Young diagrams via Robinson-Schensted's (RS) correspondence. In a celebrated paper, Vershik and Kerov obtained a limit theorem for such diagrams and found that the LIS of a uniform permutation of size n behaves as $2\sqrt{n}$. Independently and much later, Hoppen et al. introduced the theory of permutons as a scaling limit of permutations. In this paper, we extend in some sense the RS correspondence of permutations to the space of permutons. When the "RS-tableaux" of a permuton are non-trivial, we show that the RS-tableaux of random permutations sampled from this permuton exhibit a linear behavior, in the sense that their first rows and columns have lengths of linear order. In particular, the LIS of such permutations behaves as a multiple of n. We also prove some large deviation results for these convergences. Finally, by studying asymptotic properties of Fomin's algorithm for permutations, we show that the RS-tableaux of a permuton satisfy a partial differential equation.</description>

      <title>Diameter of classical groups generated by transvections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07086</link>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite classical group generated by transvections, i.e., one of $\operatorname{SL}_n(q)$, $\operatorname{SU}_n(q)$, $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(q)$, or $\operatorname{O}^\pm_{2n}(q)$ ($q$ even), and let $X$ be a generating set for $G$ containing at least one transvection. Building on work of Garonzi, Halasi, and Somlai, we prove that the diameter of the Cayley graph $\operatorname{Cay}(G, X)$ is bounded by $(n \log q)^C$ for some constant $C$. This confirms Babai's conjecture on the diameter of finite simple groups in the case of generating sets containing a transvection.
  By combining this with a result of the author and Jezernik it follows that if $G$ is one of $\operatorname{SL}_n(q)$, $\operatorname{SU}_n(q)$, $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(q)$ and $X$ contains three random generators then with high probability the diameter $\operatorname{Cay}(G, X)$ is bounded by $n^{O(\log q)}$. This confirms Babai's conjecture for non-orthogonal classical simple groups over small fields and three random generators.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>
