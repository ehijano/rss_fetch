      <title>Contextual Biasing for LLM-Based ASR with Hotword Retrieval and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) has recently achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet contextual biasing for named entities and hotwords under large vocabularies remains challenging. In this work, we propose a scalable two-stage framework that integrates hotword retrieval with LLM-ASR adaptation. First, we extend the Global-Local Contrastive Language-Audio pre-trained model (GLCLAP) to retrieve a compact top-k set of hotword candidates from a large vocabulary via robustness-aware data augmentation and fuzzy matching. Second, we inject the retrieved candidates as textual prompts into an LLM-ASR model and fine-tune it with Generative Rejection-Based Policy Optimization (GRPO), using a task-driven reward that jointly optimizes hotword recognition and overall transcription accuracy. Experiments on hotword-focused test sets show substantial keyword error rate (KER) reductions while maintaining sentence accuracy on general ASR benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework for large-vocabulary contextual biasing.</description>

      <title>Rare Word Recognition and Translation Without Fine-Tuning via Task Vector in Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare words remain a critical bottleneck for speech-to-text systems. While direct fine-tuning improves recognition of target words, it often incurs high cost, catastrophic forgetting, and limited scalability. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free paradigm based on task vectors for rare word recognition and translation. By defining task vectors as parameter differences and introducing word-level task vector arithmetic, our approach enables flexible composition of rare-word capabilities, greatly enhancing scalability and reusability. Extensive experiments across multiple domains show that the proposed method matches or surpasses fine-tuned models on target words, improves general performance by about 5 BLEU, and mitigates catastrophic forgetting.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Preference Optimization Improves Zero-shot Text-to-Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating human feedback to align text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human preferences has proven to be an effective approach for enhancing the robustness of language model-based TTS systems. Current approaches primarily focus on using preference data annotated at the utterance level. However, frequent issues that affect the listening experience often only arise in specific segments of audio samples, while other segments are well-generated. In this study, we propose a fine-grained preference optimization approach (FPO) to enhance the robustness of TTS systems. FPO focuses on addressing localized issues in generated samples rather than uniformly optimizing the entire utterance. Specifically, we first analyze the types of issues in generated samples, categorize them into two groups, and propose a selective training loss strategy to optimize preferences based on fine-grained labels for each issue type. Experimental results show that FPO enhances the robustness of zero-shot TTS systems by effectively addressing local issues, significantly reducing the bad case ratio, and improving intelligibility. Furthermore, FPO exhibits superior data efficiency compared with baseline systems, achieving similar performance with fewer training samples.</description>

      <title>ControlAudio: Tackling Text-Guided, Timing-Indicated and Intelligible Audio Generation via Progressive Diffusion Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) generation with fine-grained control signals, e.g., precise timing control or intelligible speech content, has been explored in recent works. However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text, timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation, augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme. Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT) on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity, significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective evaluations.

      <title>SpidR: Learning Fast and Stable Linguistic Units for Spoken Language Models Without Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The parallel advances in language modeling and speech representation learning have raised the prospect of learning language directly from speech without textual intermediates. This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr.</description>
