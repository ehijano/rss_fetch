      <title>On the maxmin-$\omega$ eigenspaces and their over-approximation by zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maxmin-$\omega$ dynamical systems were previously introduced as a generalization of dynamical systems expressed by tropical linear algebra. To describe steady states of such systems one has to study an eigenproblem of the form $A\otimes_{\omega} x=\lambda+x$ where $\otimes_{\omega}$ is the maxmin-$\omega$ matrix-vector multiplication. This eigenproblem can be viewed in more general framework of nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. However, instead of studying such eigenspaces directly we develop a different approach: over-approximation by zones. These are traditionally convex sets of special kind which proved to be highly useful in computer science and also relevant in tropical convexity. We first construct a sequence of zones over-approximating a maxmin-$\omega$ eigenspace. Next, the limit of this sequence is refined in a heuristic procedure, which yields a refined zone and also the eigenvalue $\lambda$ with a high success rate. Based on the numerical experiments, in successful cases there is a column of the difference bound matrix (DBM) representation of the refined zone which yields an eigenvector.</description>

      <title>Representations of Lie-Yamaguti algebras with semisimple enveloping Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a Lie-Yamaguti algebra whose standard enveloping Lie algebra $L(T)$ is semisimple and $[T, T, T]=T$. Then we give a description of representations of $T$ in terms of representations of $L(T)$ with certain additional data. Similarly, if $(T, \sigma)$ is an infinitesimal $s$-manifold such that $L(T)$ is semisimple, then any representation of $(T, \sigma)$ comes from a representation of $L(T)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study identities of Lie superalgebras over a field of characteristic zero. We construct a series of examples of finite-dimensional solvable Lie superalgebras with a non-nilpotent commutator subalgebra for which PI-exponent of codimension growth exists and is an integer number.</description>

      <title>Distributive decomposition of near-vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides two characterizations of regularity for near-vector spaces: first, by expressing them as a direct sum of vector spaces over division rings formed by distributive elements; second, by expressing their dimension in term of the dimension of these summands. These results offer new insights into the structure and properties of near-vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Cohomology theory of Rota-Baxter family BiHom-$\Omega$-associative algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce the concept of Rota-Baxter family BiHom-$\Omega$-associative algebras, then we define the cochain complex of BiHom-$\Omega$-associative algebras and verify it via Maurer-Cartan methods. Next, we further introduce and study the cohomology theory of Rota-Baxter family BiHom-$\Omega$-associative algebras of weight $\lambda$ and show that this cohomology controls the corresponding deformations. Finally, we study abelian extensions of Rota-Baxter family BiHom-$\Omega$-associative algebras in terms of the second cohomology group.</description>

      <title>A note on the probability of a groupoid having deficient sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset $X$ of a groupoid is said to be deficient if $|X \cdot X|\leq |X|$. It is well-known that the probability that a random groupoid has a deficient $t$-element set with $t\geq 3$ is zero. However, as conjectured in [4], we show that the probability is not zero in the case of sets of two elements and calculate the exact value. We explore some generalisations on deficient sets and their likelihoods.</description>

      <title>An introduction to monomorphism categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript was written for the Proceedings of the ICRA 2022 in Buenos Aires. It can be divided into four parts: The first part is an introduction to the theory of monomorphism categories, including a short survey on some representation theoretic results. The second part is a summary of some recent results on monomorphism categories based on joint work with Nan Gao, Julian K\"ulshammer and Chrysostomos Psaroudakis. It also includes a new result, namely a classification of all monomorphism categories of finite type over cyclic abelian groups. The third part concerns the relationship between submodule categories and $p$-valuated abelian groups. The last part contains a proof of wildness of a certain monomorphism category, rectifying a statement in the literature.</description>

      <title>Applications of Dual Complex Adjoint Matrix in Eigenvalue Computation of Dual Quaternion Hermitian Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dual quaternions and dual quaternion matrices have found widespread applications in robotic research, with their spectral theory been extensively studied in recent years. This paper delves into the realm of eigenvalue computation and related problems specific to dual quaternion Hermitian matrices. We establish the connection between dual quaternion matrices and their dual complex adjoint matrices, concerning eigenvalue problems and matrix rank-k approximations. By integrating the dual complex adjoint matrix, we refine the power method for eigenvalue computation for dual quaternion Hermitian matrices, achieving greater numerical efficiency. Furthermore, leveraging the eigen-decomposition of dual complex adjoint matrices, we introduce a novel approach for calculating all eigenpairs of dual quaternion Hermitian matrices. This method surpasses the power method in terms of accuracy and speed and addresses its limitations, as exemplified by its application to the eigenvalue computation of Laplacian matrices, where our algorithm demonstrates significant advantages. Additionally, we apply the improved power method and optimal rank-k approximations to pose graph optimization problem, enhancing efficiency and success rates, especially under low observation conditions.</description>

      <title>Generalized NS-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.07530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize to arbitrary categories of algebras the notion of an NS-algebra. We do this by using a bimodule property, as we did for defining the general notions of a dendriform and tridendriform algebra. We show that several types of operators lead to NS-algebras: Nijenhuis operators, twisted Rota-Baxter operators and relative Rota-Baxter operators of arbitrary weight.</description>

      <title>Dual Quaternion Laplacian, Directed Gain Graph and Formation Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the multi-agent formation control problem in a directed graph. We show that a desired relative configuration scheme is reasonable in a directed graph if and only if for any cycle in this directed graph, the product of relative configurations of the forward arcs, and inverses of relative configurations of the backward arcs, is equal to $1$. We then show that for a reasonable desired relative configuration scheme in a directed and connected graph, the dual quaternion Laplacian is similar to the unweighted Laplacian of the directed graph, zero is an eigenvalue of these two Laplacian matrices, and a formation vector is a desired formation satisfying this reasonable desired relative configuration scheme if and only if it is a unit dual quaternion vector and an eigenvector, corresponding to the zero eigenvalue, of the dual quaternion Laplacian matrix. A numerical method is given to determine {whether} a given desired relative configuration scheme is reasonable or not. A control law is presented when the desired relative configuration scheme is reasonable. Our discussion is extended to general directed gain graphs.</description>
