      <title>Negative refraction of light in an atomic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest to manipulate light propagation in ways not possible with natural media has driven the development of artificially structured metamaterials. One of the most striking effects is negative refraction, where the light beam deflects away from the boundary normal. However, due to material characteristics, the applications of this phenomenon, such as lensing that surpasses the diffraction limit, have been constrained. Here, we demonstrate negative refraction of light in an atomic medium without the use of artificial metamaterials, employing essentially exact simulations of light propagation. High transmission negative refraction is achieved in atomic arrays for different level structures and lattice constants, within the scope of currently realised experimental systems. We introduce an intuitive description of negative refraction based on collective excitation bands, whose transverse group velocities are antiparallel to the excitation quasi-momenta. We also illustrate how this phenomenon is robust to lattice imperfections and can be significantly enhanced through subradiance.</description>

      <title>High-power single-cycle THz emission from large-area photoconductive emitters at 400 kHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report high average power THz emission from a GaAs-based large-area photoconductive emitter, excited by a commercial Yb-laser amplifier without any compression schemes, doubled to the green. The LAE is pumped at 11.4 W of green average power (515 nm) and 310 fs pulse duration at 400-kHz repetition rate. We obtain a maximum THz power of 6.7 mW with a spectrum extended up to 3 THz. Using electro-optic sampling (EOS) for detection, we measure a high dynamic range of 107 dB in a measurement time of 70 s. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest power THz source so far demonstrated by photoconductive emitters, based on a simple and robust, commercially available Yb-laser.</description>

      <title>Perturbed three-channel waveform synthesizer for efficient isolated attosecond pulse generation and characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of gigawatt-class isolated attosecond pulses (IAPs) is vital for attosecond pump-probe experiments. In such experiments, the temporal duration of IAPs must be determined quickly and accurately. In this study, we developed a perturbed three-channel waveform synthesizer for efficient IAPs generation and characterization at low repetition rates ( 10 Hz). Intense IAPs centered at photon energies of 60 eV (227 as duration) in Ar and 107 eV (128 as duration) in Ne were generated by the driving field from a three-channel waveform synthesizer and characterized using all-optical frequencyresolved optical gating (AO-FROG), which accelerated the measurement time to several minutes, providing fast feedback for the tunability of the IAP source. The peak power of the IAPs is higher than that reported in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a simplified theoretical analytical estimation of the quantum cascade laser build-up time, accurately taking into account the main effects: the QCL overheating during the pump pulse and the photon mode filling effect. The non-trivial interplay of the mentioned effects brings about a variety of possible experimental build-up time behaviors. The latter range from decreasing curvature for low-power devices to non-monotonous function for devices performing at high power.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-driven Two-Dimensional Mapping for Electron Temporal Profile Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision measurement of real-time electron temporal profiles is crucial for advancing electron and X-ray devices used in ultrafast imaging and spectroscopy. While high temporal resolution and large temporal window can be achieved separately using different technologies, real-time measurement enabling simultaneous high resolution and large window remains challenging. Here, we present the first THz-driven sampling electron oscilloscope capable of measuring electron pulses with high temporal resolution and a scalable, large temporal window simultaneously. The transient THz electric field induces temporal electron streaking in the vertical axis, while extended interaction along the horizontal axis leads to a propagation-induced time delay, enabling electron beam sampling with sub-cycle THz wave. This allows real-time femtosecond electron measurement with a tens-of-picosecond window, surpassing previous THz-based techniques by an order of magnitude. The measurement capability is further enhanced through projection imaging, deflection cavity tilting, and shorted antenna utilization, resulting in signal spatial magnification, extended temporal window, and increased field strength. The technique holds promise for a wide range of applications and opens new opportunities in ultrafast science and accelerator technologies.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear unitary circuits for photonic neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonics has unlocked the potential for energy-efficient acceleration of deep learning. Most approaches toward photonic deep learning have diligently reproduced traditional deep learning architectures using photonic platforms, separately implementing linear-optical matrix calculations and nonlinear activations via electro-optical conversion, optical nonlinearities, and signal-encoded materials. Here we propose a concept of nonlinear unitary photonic circuits to achieve the integration of linear and nonlinear expressivity essential for deep neural networks. We devise a building block for two-dimensional nonlinear unitary operations, featuring norm-preserving mappings with nonconservative inner products, which enables the construction of high-dimensional nonlinear unitary circuits. Using deep nonlinear unitary circuits, we demonstrate exponential growth in trajectory length and near-complete coverage of the output space, both of which are essential for deep learning. Along with neuroevolutionary learning examples for the regression of a nonconvex function, our results pave the way to photonic neural networks with highly expressive inference and stable training.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Based Classification of Chern Phases in Honeycomb Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a symmetry-based classification of Chern phases in honeycomb photonic crystals, considering arbitrary nonreciprocal couplings compatible with energy conservation. Our analysis focuses on crystals formed through nonreciprocal perturbations of photonic graphene. These perturbations, which can have arbitrary spatial variations, are generally described by scalar and vector fields. Using a tight-binding model, we consider the most general nonreciprocal interactions, including gyromagnetic, pseudo-Tellegen, and moving medium responses, and examine how the corresponding nonreciprocal fields influence the crystal's topology. Our findings reveal that nonreciprocal interactions alone are insufficient to induce a topologically nontrivial phase. Instead, a nontrivial p6m component in the nonreciprocal fields is required to open a bandgap and achieve a non-zero Chern number. These results provide a symmetry-based roadmap for engineering photonic topological phases via nonreciprocal perturbations of photonic graphene, offering practical guidelines for designing topological phases in graphene-like photonic crystals.</description>

      <title>Monolithic integration of blue light sources into silicon nitride photonic chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically photonic chips with monolithically integrated blue light sources. According to our evaluations, a group-III nitride light emitting heterostructure can be efficiently combined with silicon nitride waveguiding layers. Low losses, high level of miniaturization and built-in light injection mechanism potentially make the selected platform attractive for applications and draw up an addition or even alternative to silicon photonics. We use a combination of drift-diffusion and Maxwell equations to build a model of the proposed multilayer structure. The model allows to choose the best parameters for both light emitting sandwich and waveguiding layers as well as to pick an optimal coupling regime. High transmittance coefficients are obtained. Various optimal geometries are analised with respect to captured power, desired polarization and excited modes. The obtained numbers are promising and allow in the future to pave the way towards hetero-integrated blue photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Generation of Subfemtosecond Deep and Vacuum UV pulses via Two-Photon Rabi Oscillations in Alkali Atoms or Alkaline Earth Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is proposed for the formation of femto- and subfemtosecond pulses of the deep ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet radiation via generating the third harmonic of femtosecond laser pulses during their resonant interaction with alkali atoms or alkaline earth ions. The pulse formation occurs due to two-photon Rabi oscillations between quasi-equidistant energy levels of atoms or ions. The duration of the generated third harmonic pulse is several times shorter than far from resonance, while the generation efficiency is up to 3-4 orders of magnitude higher.</description>

      <title>Effect of top metallic contacts on energy conversion performances for near-field thermophotovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of metallic contact grids on the front side of thermophotovoltaic cells is critical since it can cause significant optical and electrical resistive losses, particularly in the near field. However, from the theoretical point of view, this effect has been either discarded or studied by means of extremely simplified models like the shadowing methods, that consist in simply ignoring the fraction of the semiconductor surface covered by metal. Our study, based on a rigorous three-body theoretical framework and implemented using the scattering matrix approach with the Fourier modal method augmented with adaptive spatial resolution, provides deeper insight into the influence of the front metal contact grid. This approach allows direct access to the radiative power absorbed by the semiconductor, enabling the proposal of an alternative definition for the thermophotovoltaic cell efficiency. By modeling this grid as a metallic grating, we demonstrate its significant impact on the net radiative power absorbed by the cell and, consequently, on the generated electrical power. Our analysis reveals behaviors differing substantially from those predicted by previous simplistic approaches.</description>

      <title>Energy Scalability Limits of Dissipative Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we apply a thermodynamical approach to elucidate the primary constraints on the energy scaling of dissipative solitons (DS). We rely on the adiabatic theory of strongly chirped DS and define the DS energy scaling in terms of dissipative soliton resonance (DSR). Three main experimentally verifiable signatures identify a transition to DSR: i) growth of a Lorentzian spike at the centrum of the DS spectrum, which resembles a spectral condensation in Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), ii) saturation of the spectrum broadening, and iii) asymptotical DS stretching. We connect the DSR breakup with three critical factors: i) decoupling of two correlation scales inherent in strongly chirped DS, ii) resulting rise of the DS entropy with energy, which provokes its disintegration, and iii) transition to a nonequilibrium phase, which is characterized by negative temperature. The breakup results in multiple stable DSs with lower energy. Theoretical results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental data from a Kerr-lens mode-locked Cr$^{2+}$:ZnS chirped-pulse oscillator (CPO) that paves the way for optimizing high-energy femtosecond pulse generation in solid-state CPO and all-normal-dispersion fiber lasers.</description>

      <title>Quantized Hall drift in a frequency-encoded photonic Chern insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prospect of developing more efficient classical or quantum photonic devices through the suppression of backscattering is a major driving force for the field of topological photonics. However, genuine protection against backscattering in photonics requires implementing architectures with broken time-reversal which is technically challenging. Here, we make use of a frequency-encoded synthetic dimension scheme in an optical fibre loop platform to experimentally realise a photonic Chern insulator inspired from the Haldane model where time-reversal is explicitly broken through temporal modulation. The bands' topology is assessed by reconstructing the Bloch states' geometry across the Brillouin zone. We further highlight its consequences by measuring a driven-dissipative analogue of the quantized transverse Hall conductivity. Our results thus open the door to harnessing topologically protected unidirectional transport of light in frequency-multiplexed photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Reduction of thermal instability of soliton states in coupled Kerr-microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kerr-microresonator frequency combs in integrated photonics waveguides are promising technologies for next-generation positioning, navigation, and timing applications, with advantages that include platforms that are mass-producible and CMOS-compatible and spectra that are phase-coherent and octave-spanning. Fundamental thermal noise in the resonator material typically limits the timing and frequency stability of a microcomb. The small optical mode volume of the microresonators exaggerates this effect, as it both increases the magnitude and shortens the timescale of thermodynamic fluctuations. In this work, we investigate thermal instability in silicon nitride microring resonators as well as techniques for reducing their effects on the microcomb light. We characterize the time-dependent thermal response in silicon nitride microring resonators through experimental measurements and finite element method simulations. Through fast control of the pump laser frequency, we reduce thermal recoil due to heating. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of a coupled microresonator system with tunable mode interactions to stabilize a soliton pulse against thermal shifts.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Faraday Precession of Light Polarization in Time-Reversal Invariant Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of electromagnetic waves through materials displaying a non-linear Hall effect. The coupled Maxwell-Boltzmann equations for traveling waves can be mapped onto ordinary differential equations that resemble those for the motion of a pendulum. In the weakly non-linear regime relevant for most experiments, we find that the polarization of light displays a Faraday-like precession of its polarization direction that swings back and forth around the direction of Berry dipole vector as the light beam traverses the material. This occurs concomitantly with an oscillation of its degree of polarization, with a characteristic frequency that increases linearly with the intensity of the traveling wave. These effects could be observed by measuring thickness dependent Faraday rotations as well as the emission of lower frequency radiation associated with the polarization oscillations in materials displaying the non-linear Hall effect.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Enhanced Biphoton Generation with Incoherent Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-chip quantum photon sources are pivotal components in integrated photonics, driving significant advancements in quantum information technologies over recent decades. Traditionally, the coherence of the pump beam has been considered a critical property in ensuring the quality of the source. In this work, we produce a photon-pair source via spontaneous four-wave mixing pumped by temporally incoherent light in a standard silicon nanowire. Compared to a coherent laser, the incoherence improves pump utilization efficiency, which results in higher source brightness. Additionally, its spectrally uncorrelated nature of incoherent light is transferred to the generated photon source, allowing high-purity state preparation without the need for narrow filtering. Experimentally, we demonstrate the advantages using an amplified spontaneous emission source over a continuous-wave laser. With temporally incoherent pumping, the photon pair generation rate increases by 40%. The coincidence-to-accidental ratio and heralded second-order autocorrelation exhibit improved performance at low power. Our work expands the scope of incoherently pumped quantum states and provides a method for generating photon sources using a more readily accessible light.</description>

Abstract: With the growing number of satellite-based Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) payload launches, it becomes essential to ensure compatibility across different platforms for satellite tracking and quantum signal acquisition. In this paper, the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) presents the development of the Abu Dhabi Quantum Optical Ground Station (ADQOGS) for secure free-space optical communications. With the know-how of GA-Synopta's experienced engineering team, we have developed a versatile multi-wavelength quantum acquisition and tracking system tailored to support various upcoming space-based QKD missions, crucial for the practical implementation of global quantum communication networks. This system is capable of handling multiple wavelengths, ranging from 600 nm to 1560 nm for downlink beacons and 1530 nm to 1610 nm for uplink beacons. It includes a free-space quantum module adequate to detect QKD signals at $780\pm10$ nm and $850\pm3$ nm and offers spatial and spectral filtering capabilities along with a motorized polarization correction system.</description>

      <title>Frequency-tunable biphoton generation via spontaneous four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental results on tuning biphoton frequency by introducing a detuned coupling field in spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM), and examine its impact on the pairing ratio. This tunability is achieved by manipulating the inherent electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) effect in the double-$\Lambda$ scheme. Introducing a detuned coupling field degrades the efficiency of EIT-based stimulated four-wave mixing, which in turn reduces the biphoton pairing ratio. However, this reduction can be mitigated by increasing the optical power of the coupling field. Additionally, we observe that blue- and red-detuning the biphoton frequency results in distinct temporal profiles of biphoton wavepackets due to phase mismatch. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms of frequency-tunable biphoton generation via SFWM, and suggest potential optimizations for applications in quantum communication and information processing.</description>

      <title>Deep priors for satellite image restoration with accurate uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite optical images, upon their on-ground receipt, offer a distorted view of the observed scene. Their restoration, classically including denoising, deblurring, and sometimes super-resolution, is required before their exploitation. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainty related to this restoration could be valuable by lowering the risk of hallucination and avoiding propagating these biases in downstream applications. Deep learning methods are now state-of-the-art for satellite image restoration. However, they require to train a specific network for each sensor and they do not provide the associated uncertainties. This paper proposes a generic method involving a single network to restore images from several sensors and a scalable way to derive the uncertainties. We focus on deep regularization (DR) methods, which learn a deep prior on target images before plugging it into a model-based optimization scheme. First, we introduce VBLE-xz, which solves the inverse problem in the latent space of a variational compressive autoencoder, estimating the uncertainty jointly in the latent and in the image spaces. It enables scalable posterior sampling with relevant and calibrated uncertainties. Second, we propose the denoiser-based method SatDPIR, adapted from DPIR, which efficiently computes accurate point estimates. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on very high resolution simulated and real Pleiades images, asserting both the performance and robustness of the proposed methods. VBLE-xz and SatDPIR achieve state-of-the-art results compared to direct inversion methods. In particular, VBLE-xz is a scalable method to get realistic posterior samples and accurate uncertainties, while SatDPIR represents a compelling alternative to direct inversion methods when uncertainty quantification is not required.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory of Wave Scattering from Electromagnetic Time Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modulating macroscopic parameters of materials in time offers innovative avenues for manipulating electromagnetic waves. Due to such enticing prospects, the general research subject of time-varying systems is expanding today in different branches of electromagnetism and optics. However, compared with the research efforts and progresses that have taken place in the realm of classical electrodynamics, the quantum aspects of this emerging subject have been less explored. Here, through the lens of quantum optics, we study the scattering of electromagnetic fields from an isotropic and nondispersive material with a suddenly changing refractive index, creating a time interface. We revisit the transformation of the bosonic mode operators and corresponding quantum states due to this interface, governed by the two-mode squeeze operator. Building on this foundation, more importantly, our analysis focuses on the photon statistics and quantum state engineering of the scattered light, elucidating various quantum optical phenomena and opportunities arising from the time interface. Notably, these include photon-pair production and destruction, photon bunching and antibunching, vacuum generation, quantum state discrimination, and quantum state freezing. To bridge theory and experiment, we propose a possible circuit quantum electrodynamics approach for validating our theoretical predictions. We hope that our work inspires experimental investigations and further quantum optical explorations of electromagnetic field interaction with photonic time crystals or with dispersive time-varying materials.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Time Interfaces in Wire Media: Innovations for Subwavelength Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically study temporal interfaces between media with strong spatial dispersion and dielectrics. In particular, we consider a temporal discontinuity that transforms a wire medium sample, a metamaterial with resonant spatial dispersion, into a uniaxial dielectric. We show that this transition results in a transformation of the deeply subwavelength spatial spectrum of TEM waves propagating in the wire medium at a certain frequency into a spectrum of plane waves at new frequencies that are all higher than the initial one. The waves at different frequencies propagate in different directions. Their complex amplitudes and propagation directions are uniquely related to the amplitudes of the spatial harmonics of the fields which existed before the transition. We explain how to implement this transition. The revealed effect may result in a promising method of subwavelength imaging.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fluorescence Lifetime Parameter Estimation Accuracy with Differential Transformer Based Deep Learning Model Incorporating Pixelwise Instrument Response Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLI) is a critical molecular imaging modality that provides unique information about the tissue microenvironment, which is invaluable for biomedical applications. FLI operates by acquiring and analyzing photon time-of-arrival histograms to extract quantitative parameters associated with temporal fluorescence decay. These histograms are influenced by the intrinsic properties of the fluorophore, instrument parameters, time-of-flight distributions associated with pixel-wise variations in the topographic and optical characteristics of the sample. Recent advancements in Deep Learning (DL) have enabled improved fluorescence lifetime parameter estimation. However, existing models are primarily designed for planar surface samples, limiting their applicability in translational scenarios involving complex surface profiles, such as \textit{in-vivo} whole-animal or imaged guided surgical applications. To address this limitation, we present MFliNet (Macroscopic FLI Network), a novel DL architecture that integrates the Instrument Response Function (IRF) as an additional input alongside experimental photon time-of-arrival histograms. Leveraging the capabilities of a Differential Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, MFliNet effectively focuses on critical input features, such as variations in photon time-of-arrival distributions. We evaluate MFliNet using rigorously designed tissue-mimicking phantoms and preclinical in-vivo cancer xenograft models. Our results demonstrate the model's robustness and suitability for complex macroscopic FLI applications, offering new opportunities for advanced biomedical imaging in diverse and challenging settings.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved photon statistics of general nanophotonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While experimental measurements of photon correlations have become routine in laboratories, theoretical access to these quantities for the light generated in complex nanophotonic devices remains a major challenge. Current methods are limited to specific simplified cases and lack generality. Here we present a novel method that provides access to photon statistics resolved in space and frequency in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. Within the macroscopic QED framework, we develop a practical tool to compute electric field correlations for complex quantum systems by including lossy two-level systems that act as field detectors within the system. To make the implementation feasible, we use a recently developed multi-emitter few-mode quantization method to correctly account for fully retarded light propagation to the detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique by studying the photon correlations of one and two emitters in close proximity to a plasmonic nanoparticle. The simulations show that even in these relatively simple configurations, the light statistics exhibit a strong angular dependence. These results highlight the importance of going beyond conventional quantum-optical approaches to fully capture the analyzed physical effects and enable the study of the quantum light generation in realistic nanophotonic devices.</description>
