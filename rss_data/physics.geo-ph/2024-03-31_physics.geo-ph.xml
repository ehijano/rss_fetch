      <title>A Digital Twin for Geological Carbon Storage with Controlled Injectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an uncertainty-aware Digital Twin (DT) for geologic carbon storage (GCS), capable of handling multimodal time-lapse data and controlling CO2 injectivity to mitigate reservoir fracturing risks. In GCS, DT represents virtual replicas of subsurface systems that incorporate real-time data and advanced generative Artificial Intelligence (genAI) techniques, including neural posterior density estimation via simulation-based inference and sequential Bayesian inference. These methods enable the effective monitoring and control of CO2 storage projects, addressing challenges such as subsurface complexity, operational optimization, and risk mitigation. By integrating diverse monitoring data, e.g., geophysical well observations and imaged seismic, DT can bridge the gaps between seemingly distinct fields like geophysics and reservoir engineering. In addition, the recent advancements in genAI also facilitate DT with principled uncertainty quantification. Through recursive training and inference, DT utilizes simulated current state samples, e.g., CO2 saturation, paired with corresponding geophysical field observations to train its neural networks and enable posterior sampling upon receiving new field data. However, it lacks decision-making and control capabilities, which is necessary for full DT functionality. This study aims to demonstrate how DT can inform decision-making processes to prevent risks such as cap rock fracturing during CO2 storage operations.</description>

      <title>Fossil and present-day stromatolite ooids contain a meteoritic polymer of glycine and iron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hemoglycin, a space polymer of glycine and iron, has been identified in the carbonaceous chondritic meteorites Allende, Acfer 086, Kaba, Sutters Mill and Orgueil. Its core form has a mass of 1494Da and is basically an antiparallel pair of polyglycine strands linked at each end by an iron atom. The polymer forms two- and three- dimensional lattices with an inter-vertex distance of 4.9nm. Here the extraction technique for meteorites is applied to a 2.1Gya fossil stromatolite to reveal the presence of hemoglycin by mass spectrometry. Intact ooids from a recent (3,000Ya) stromatolite exhibited the same visible hemoglycin fluorescence in response to x-rays as an intact crystal from the Orgueil meteorite. X-ray analysis confirmed the existence in ooids of an internal 3-dimensional lattice of 4.9nm inter-vertex spacing, matching the spacing of lattices in meteoritic crystals. FTIR measurements of acid-treated ooid and a Sutters Mill meteoritic crystal both show the presence, via the splitting of the Amide I band, of an extended anti-parallel beta sheet structure. It seems probable that the copious in-fall of carbonaceous meteoritic material, from Archaean times onward, has left traces of hemoglycin in sedimentary carbonates and potentially has influenced ooid formation.</description>

      <title>Seismic and acoustic signals from the 2014 'Interstellar Meteor'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct a thorough analysis of seismic and acoustic data from the so-called `Interstellar Meteor' which entered the Earth's atmosphere off the coast of Papua New Guinea on 2014-01-08. We conclude that both previously-reported seismic signals are spurious -- one has characteristics suggesting a local vehicular-traffic based origin; whilst the other is statistically indistinguishable from the background noise. As such, previously-reported localisations based on this data are spurious. Analysis of acoustic data provides a best fit location estimate which is very far ($\sim$170~km) from the reported fireball location. Accordingly, we conclude that material recovered from the seafloor and purported to be from the meteor is almost certainly unrelated to it, and is likely of more mundane (non-interstellar) origin.</description>
