      <title>The operator of relative complementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the operator of relative complementation is meant a mapping assigning to every element x of an interval [a,b] of a lattice L the set x^{ab} of all relative complements of x in [a,b]. Of course, if L is relatively complemented then x^{ab} is non-empty for each interval [a,b] and every element x belonging to it. We study the question under what condition a complement of x in L induces a relative complement of x in [a,b] It is well-known that this is the case provided L is modular and complemented. However, we present a more general result. Further, we investigate properties of the operator of relative complementation, in particular in the case when the interval [a,b] is a modular sublattice of L or if it is finite. Moreover, we characterize when the operator of relative complementation is involutive and we show a class of lattices where this identity holds. Finally, we establish sufficient conditions under which two different complements of a given element x of [a,b] induce the same relative complement of x in this interval.</description>

      <title>General Presentations of Algebras and Foundations of $\tau$-tilting Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we explain how the main results in "$\tau$-tilting theory" by Adachi-Iyama-Reiten follow from the results in Section 5 of "General presentations of algebras" by Derksen-Fei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2017, Walter Taylor showed that there exist $2$-dimensional simplicial complexes which admit the structure of topological modular lattice but not topological distributive lattice. We give a positive answer to his question as to whether $n$-dimensional simplicial complexes with the same property exist. We do this by giving, for each $n\ge2$, an infinite family of compact simplicial complexes which admit the structure of topological modular lattice but not topological distributive lattice.</description>

      <title>Universal localizations, Atiyah conjectures and graphs of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a countable group that is the fundamental group of a graph of groups with finite edge groups and vertex groups that satisfy the strong Atiyah conjecture over $K \subseteq \mathbb{C}$ a field closed under complex conjugation. Assume that the orders of finite subgroups of $G$ are bounded above. We show that $G$ satisfies the strong Atiyah conjecture over $K$. In particular, this implies that the strong Atiyah conjecture is closed under free products. Moreover, we prove that the $\ast$-regular closure of $K[G]$ in $\mathcal{U}(G)$, $\mathcal{R}_{\small K[G]}$, is a universal localization of the graph of rings associated to the graph of groups, where the rings are the corresponding $\ast$-regular closures. As a result, we obtain that the algebraic and center-valued Atiyah conjecture over $K$ are also closed under the graph of groups construction provided that the edge groups are finite. We also infer some consequences on the structure of the $K_0$ and $K_1$-groups of $\mathcal{R}_{\small K[G]}$. The techniques developed allow us to prove that $K[G]$ fulfills the strong, algebraic and center-valued Atiyah conjectures and that $\mathcal{R}_{\small K[G]}$ is the universal localization of $K[G]$ over the set of all matrices that become invertible in $\mathcal{U}(G)$ if $G$ lies in a certain class of groups $\mathcal{T}_{\small \mathcal{VLI}}$, which contains in particular virtually-{locally indicable} groups that are the fundamental group of a graph of virtually free groups.</description>
