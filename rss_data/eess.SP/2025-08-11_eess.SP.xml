      <title>A Remark on the AAA Method for Secret-Key Generation in Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broadly applicable method for secret-key generation is named for its accumulative, adaptable and additive (AAA) properties. This paper first shows a robustness of its performance. Namely, even if there is an inter correlation or a leakage caused intra correlation among the superimposed packets, provided there is a nonzero probability for each packet to be missed in full or in part by Eve, then the equivocation of the key generated by the AAA method always becomes perfect as the number of superpositions becomes infinite. Also shown in this paper is a comparison between the AAA method and an ideal method based on reciprocal channel estimation, which reveals several advantages of the AAA method.</description>

      <title>STEEP -- An Alternative To Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secret-message transmission by echoing encrypted probes (STEEP) is discussed as an alternative to quantum key distribution (QKD). The former only needs classic or non-quantum channels while the latter needs both quantum and classic channels for secret-key generation. STEEP is shown to yield a secrecy rate sufficient for one-time pads encryption in many practical situations including in-air channels or undersea optical cables. Other advantages of STEEP over QKD include cost, complexity, compatibility, and robustness against constant eavesdropping.</description>

      <title>IRS-Assisted IoT Activity Detection Under Asynchronous Transmission and Heterogeneous Powers: Detectors and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of activity detection in distributed Internet of Things (IoT) networks, where devices employ asynchronous transmissions with heterogeneous power levels to report their local observations. The system leverages an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to enhance detection reliability, with optional incorporation of a direct line-of-sight (LoS) path. We formulate the detection problem as a binary hypothesis test and develop four detectors: an optimal detector alongside three computationally efficient detectors designed for practical scenarios with different levels of prior knowledge about noise variance, channel state information, and device transmit powers. For each detector, we derive closed-form expressions for both detection and false alarm probabilities, establishing theoretical performance benchmarks. Extensive simulations validate our analytical results and systematically evaluate the impact of key system parameters including the number of antennas, samples, users, and IRS elements on detection performance. The proposed framework effectively bridges theoretical optimality with implementation practicality, providing a scalable solution for IRS-assisted IoT networks in emerging 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Functional Chirp Signalling for Next-Generation Multi-Carrier Wireless Networks: Communications, Sensing and ISAC Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the increasingly demanding quality-of-service requirements of the next-generation multi-carrier mobile networks, it is essential to design multi-functional signalling schemes facilitating efficient, flexible, and reliable communication and sensing in complex wireless environments. As a compelling candidate, we advocate chirp signalling, beneficially amalgamating sequences (e.g., Zadoff-Chu sequences) with waveforms (e.g., chirp spread spectrum and frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar), given their resilience against doubly selective channels. Besides chirp sequences, a wide range of chirp waveforms is considered, ranging from FMCW to affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM), to create a promising chirp multicarrier waveform. This study also highlights the advantages of such waveforms in supporting reliable high-mobility communications, plus integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Finally, we outline several emerging research directions for chirp signalling designs.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Radio Map Estimation: Fundamentals and Implementation via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio map estimation (RME) is the problem of inferring the value of a certain metric (e.g. signal power) across an area of interest given a collection of measurements. While most works tackle this problem from a purely non-Bayesian perspective, some Bayesian estimators have been proposed. However, the latter focus on estimating the map itself, the Bayesian standpoint is adopted mainly to exploit prior information or to capture uncertainty. This paper pursues a more general formulation, where the goal is to determine the posterior distribution of the map given the measurements. Besides handling uncertainty and allowing standard Bayesian estimates, solving this problem is seen to enable minimum mean square error estimation of arbitrary map functionals (e.g. capacity, bit error rate, or coverage area to name a few) while training only for power estimation. A general Bayesian estimator is proposed based on conditional diffusion models and both the Bayesian and non-Bayesian paradigms are compared analytically and numerically to determine when the Bayesian approach is preferable.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Neural Radio Radiance Field for Localized Statistical Channel Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents MM-LSCM, a self-supervised multi-modal neural radio radiance field framework for localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) for next-generation network optimization. Traditional LSCM methods rely solely on RSRP data, limiting their ability to model environmental structures that affect signal propagation. To address this, we propose a dual-branch neural architecture that integrates RSRP data and LiDAR point cloud information, enhancing spatial awareness and predictive accuracy. MM-LSCM leverages volume-rendering-based multi-modal synthesis to align radio propagation with environmental obstacles and employs a self-supervised training approach, eliminating the need for costly labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that MM-LSCM significantly outperforms conventional methods in channel reconstruction accuracy and robustness to noise, making it a promising solution for real-world wireless network optimization.</description>

      <title>Fast End-to-End Simulation and Exploration of Many-RISCV-Core Baseband Transceivers for Software-Defined Radio-Access Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast-rising demand for wireless bandwidth requires rapid evolution of high-performance baseband processing infrastructure. Programmable many-core processors for software-defined radio (SDR) have emerged as high-performance baseband processing engines, offering the flexibility required to capture evolving wireless standards and technologies. This trend must be supported by a design framework enabling functional validation and end-to-end performance analysis of SDR hardware within realistic radio environment models. We propose a static binary translation based simulator augmented with a fast, approximate timing model of the hardware and coupled to wireless channel models to simulate the most performance-critical physical layer functions implemented in software on a many (1024) RISC-V cores cluster customized for SDR. Our framework simulates the detection of a 5G OFDM-symbol on a server-class processor in 9.5s-3min, on a single thread, depending on the input MIMO size (three orders of magnitude faster than RTL simulation). The simulation is easily parallelized to 128 threads with 73-121x speedup compared to a single thread.</description>

      <title>A 66-Gb/s/5.5-W RISC-V Many-Core Cluster for 5G+ Software-Defined Radio Uplinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the scale-up of new radio (NR) complexity in 5G and beyond, the physical layer's computing load on base stations is increasing under a strictly constrained latency and power budget; base stations must process &gt; 20-Gb/s uplink wireless data rate on the fly, in &lt; 10 W. At the same time, the programmability and reconfigurability of base station components are the key requirements; it reduces the time and cost of new networks' deployment, it lowers the acceptance threshold for industry players to enter the market, and it ensures return on investments in a fast-paced evolution of standards. In this article, we present the design of a many-core cluster for 5G and beyond base station processing. Our design features 1024, streamlined RISC-V cores with domain-specific FP extensions, and 4-MiB shared memory. It provides the necessary computational capabilities for software-defined processing of the lower physical layer of 5G physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH), satisfying high-end throughput requirements (66 Gb/s for a transition time interval (TTI), 9.4-302 Gb/s depending on the processing stage). The throughput metrics for the implemented functions are ten times higher than in state-of-the-art (SoTA) application-specific instruction processors (ASIPs). The energy efficiency on key NR kernels (2-41 Gb/s/W), measured at 800 MHz, 25 {\deg}C, and 0.8 V, on a placed and routed instance in 12-nm CMOS technology, is competitive with SoTA architectures. The PUSCH processing runs end-to-end on a single cluster in 1.7 ms, at &lt;6-W average power consumption, achieving 12 Gb/s/W.</description>

      <title>Efficient Deep Neural Receiver with Post-Training Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has recently garnered significant interest in wireless communications due to its superior performance compared to traditional model-based algorithms. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated notable improvements in block error rate (BLER) under various channel models and mobility scenarios. However, the high computational complexity and resource demands of deep CNNs pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained edge systems. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Release 20 highlights the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI) integration in enabling advanced radio-access networks for 6G systems. The hard real-time processing demands of 5G and 6G require efficient techniques such as post-training quantization (PTQ), quantization-aware training (QAT), pruning, and hybrid approaches to meet latency requirements. In this paper, we focus on PTQ to reduce model complexity by lowering the bit-width of weights, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Our analysis employs symmetric uniform quantization, applying both per-tensor and per-channel PTQ to a neural receiver achieving performance comparable to full-precision models. Specifically, 8-bit per-channel quantization maintains BLER performance with minimal degradation, while 4-bit quantization shows great promise but requires further optimization to achieve target BLER levels. These results highlight the potential of ultra-low bitwidth PTQ for efficient neural receiver deployment in 6G systems.</description>

      <title>MALRIS: Malicious Hardware in RIS-Assisted Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) enhance wireless communication by dynamically shaping the propagation environment, but their integration introduces hardware-level security risks. This paper presents the concept of Malicious RIS (MALRIS), where compromised components behave adversarially, even under passive operation. The focus of this work is on practical threats such as manufacturing time tampering, malicious firmware, and partial element control. Two representative attacks, power-splitting and element-splitting, are modeled to assess their impact. Simulations in a RIS-assisted system reveal that even a limited hardware compromise can significantly degrade performance metrics such as bit error rate, throughput, and secrecy metrics. By exposing this overlooked threat surface, this work aims to promote awareness and support secure, trustworthy RIS deployment in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Full-Dimensional Beamforming for Multi-User MIMO-OFDM ISAC for Low-Altitude UAV with Zero Sensing Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play an important role for low-altitude economy with a wide range of applications like precise agriculture, aerial delivery and surveillance. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key technology to enable the large-scale deployment and routine usage of UAVs by providing both communication and sensing services efficiently. For UAV ISAC systems, as UAV often acts as both a communication user equipment (UE) and a sensing target, traditional ISAC systems that usually allocate dedicated TF resources for sensing are inefficient due to the severe degradation of communication spectral efficiency. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based ISAC framework for UAVs that eliminates the need for dedicated sensing TF resources, achieving zero TF sensing overhead. By designing the transmit beamforming to meet the requirements for both communication and sensing tasks, our proposed approach enables the communication TF resources to be fully reused for sensing, thereby enhancing both the communication sum rate and the sensing performance in terms of resolution, unambiguous range, and accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a low-complexity target searching beamforming algorithm and a two-stage super-resolution sensing algorithm, which ensure efficient implementation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MIMO-OFDM-ISAC framework not only improves the communication sum rate but also outperforms traditional ISAC systems in sensing performance, making it a promising solution for future ISAC systems to support low-altitude UAVs.</description>

      <title>Arbitrarily-high-dimensional reconciliation via cross-rotation for continuous-variable quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multidimensional rotation serves as a powerful tool for enhancing information reconciliation and extending the transmission distance in continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). However, the lack of closed-form orthogonal transformations for high-dimensional rotations has limited the maximum reconciliation efficiency to channels with 8 dimensions over the past decade. This paper presents a cross-rotation scheme to overcome this limitation and enable reconciliation in arbitrarily high dimensions, constrained to even multiples of 8. The key treatment involves reshaping the string vector into matrix form and applying orthogonal transformations to its columns and rows in a cross manner, thereby increasing the reconciliation dimension by one order per cross-rotation while significantly reducing the communication overhead over the classical channel. A rigorous performance analysis is also presented from the perspective of achievable sum-rate. Simulation results demonstrate that 64-dimensional cross-rotation nearly approaches the upper bound, making it a recommended choice for practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Non-Stationarity Objective Assessment with Hard Label Criteria for Supervised Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective non-stationarity measures are resource intensive and impose critical limitations for real-time processing solutions. In this paper, a novel Hard Label Criteria (HLC) algorithm is proposed to generate a global non-stationarity label for acoustic signals, enabling supervised learning strategies to be trained as stationarity estimators. The HLC is first evaluated on state-of-the-art general-purpose acoustic models, demonstrating that these models encode stationarity information. Furthermore, the first-of-its-kind HLC-based Network for Acoustic Non-Stationarity Assessment (NANSA) is proposed. NANSA models outperform competing approaches, achieving up to 99\% classification accuracy, while solving the computational infeasibility of traditional objective measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the multivariate fields of experts, a new framework for the learning of image priors. Our model generalizes existing fields of experts methods by incorporating multivariate potential functions constructed via Moreau envelopes of the $\ell_\infty$-norm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal across a range of inverse problems that include image denoising, deblurring, compressed-sensing magnetic-resonance imaging, and computed tomography. The proposed approach outperforms comparable univariate models and achieves performance close to that of deep-learning-based regularizers while being significantly faster, requiring fewer parameters, and being trained on substantially fewer data. In addition, our model retains a relatively high level of interpretability due to its structured design.</description>

      <title>Diversity Analysis for Terahertz Communication Systems under Small-Scale Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The terahertz (THz) band is a key enabler for future wireless systems, promising ultra-high data rates and dense spatial reuse. However, the reliability of THz links remains a major challenge due to severe path loss and small-scale fading effects, particularly in dynamic indoor and outdoor environments. This paper presents a comprehensive diversity analysis framework for THz communication systems under realistic small-scale fading conditions. We model fading statistically using the generalized $\alpha$-$\mu$ distribution for indoor scenarios and the mixture of gamma (MG) model for outdoor propagation. We complement previous works that analyzed diversity under $\alpha$-$\mu$ channels [1],[2]. In particular, we present new insights on diversity for the MG channel in addition to recovering the results of [2] using a different approach. Moreover, we derive asymptotic expressions for the bit error rate as a function of the inverse signal-to-noise ratio, recovering all of the $\alpha$-$\mu$ diversity results using a simpler approximation method. The analytical results are extensively validated through Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement. Our findings show that the achievable diversity in THz systems is strongly influenced by the number of independent paths, the severity of fading, and frequency selectivity. The proposed framework provides system designers with clear guidelines to quantify and optimize diversity gains under emerging channel models, paving the way for more reliable high-frequency wireless links in next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Measuring Dependencies between Biological Signals with Self-supervision, and its Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02703</link>

Abstract: Measuring the statistical dependence between observed signals is a primary tool for scientific discovery. However, biological systems often exhibit complex non-linear interactions that currently cannot be captured without a priori knowledge regarding the nature of dependence. We introduce a self-supervised approach, concurrence, which is inspired by the observation that if two signals are dependent, then one should be able to distinguish between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them. Experiments with fMRI, physiological and behavioral signals show that, to our knowledge, concurrence is the first approach that can expose relationships across such a wide spectrum of signals and extract scientifically relevant differences without ad-hoc parameter tuning or reliance on a priori information, providing a potent tool for scientific discoveries across fields. However, dependencies caused by extraneous factors remain an open problem, thus researchers should validate that exposed relationships truly pertain to the question(s) of interest.</description>

      <title>How to Proactively Monitor Untrusted Communications with Cell-Free Massive MIMO?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) proactive monitoring system in which multiple multi-antenna monitoring nodes (MNs) are assigned to either observe the transmissions from an untrusted transmitter (UT) or to jam the reception at the untrusted receiver (UR). We propose an effective channel state information (CSI) acquisition scheme for the monitoring system. In our approach, the MNs leverage the pilot signals transmitted during the uplink and downlink phases of the untrusted link and estimate the effective channels corresponding to the UT and UR via a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation scheme. We derive new spectral efficiency (SE) expressions for the untrusted link and the monitoring system. For the latter, the SE is derived for two CSI availability cases at the central processing unit (CPU); namely case-1: imperfect CSI knowledge at both MNs and CPU, case-2: imperfect CSI knowledge at the MNs and no CSI knowledge at the CPU. To improve the monitoring performance, we propose a novel joint mode assignment and jamming power control optimization method to maximize the monitoring success probability (MSP) based on the Bayesian optimization framework. Numerical results show that (a) our CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring system relying on the proposed CSI acquisition and optimization approach significantly outperforms the considered benchmarks; (b) the MSP performance of our CF-mMIMO proactive monitoring system is greater than 0.8, regardless of the number of antennas at the untrusted nodes or the precoding scheme for the untrusted transmission link.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Based Sensor Optimization for Bio-markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10649</link>

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) biosensors, in particular those based on inter-digitated capacitors (IDCs), are pivotal in areas like biomedical diagnosis, remote sensing, and wireless communication. Despite their advantages of low cost and easy fabrication, their sensitivity can be hindered by design imperfections, environmental factors, and circuit noise. This paper investigates enhancing the sensitivity of IDC-based RF sensors using novel reinforcement learning based Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (RLBPSO), and it is compared to Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and other state-of-the-art methods. By focusing on optimizing design parameters like electrode design and finger width, the proposed study found notable improvements in sensor sensitivity. The proposed RLBPSO method shows best optimized design for various frequency ranges when compared to current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Markov Random Field model for Hypergraph-based Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14172v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the data-generating process is essential for building machine learning models that generalise well while ensuring robustness and interpretability. This paper addresses the fundamental challenge of modelling the data generation processes on hypergraphs and explores how such models can inform the design of machine learning algorithms for hypergraph data. The key to our approach is the development of a hypergraph Markov random field that models the joint distribution of the node features and hyperedge features in a hypergraph through a multivariate Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix is uniquely determined by the hypergraph structure. The proposed data-generating process provides a valuable inductive bias for various hypergraph machine learning tasks, thus enhancing the algorithm design. In this paper, we focus on two representative downstream tasks: structure inference and node classification. Accordingly, we introduce two novel frameworks: 1) an original hypergraph structure inference framework named HGSI, and 2) a novel learning framework entitled Hypergraph-MLP for node classification on hypergraphs. Empirical evaluation of the proposed frameworks demonstrates that: 1) HGSI outperforms existing hypergraph structure inference methods on both synthetic and real-world data; and 2) Hypergraph-MLP outperforms baselines in six hypergraph node classification benchmarks, at the same time promoting runtime efficiency and robustness against structural perturbations during inference.</description>
