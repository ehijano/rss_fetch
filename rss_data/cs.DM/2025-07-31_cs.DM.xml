      <title>Structure of $k$-Matching-Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the class of $k$-matching-planar graphs, which is a significant generalisation of many existing beyond planar graph classes, including $k$-planar graphs. For $k \geqslant 0$, a simple topological graph $G$ (that is, a graph drawn in the plane such that every pair of edges intersect at most once, including endpoints) is $k$-matching-planar if for every edge $e \in E(G)$, every matching amongst the edges of $G$ that cross $e$ has size at most $k$. We prove that every simple topological $k$-matching-planar graph is isomorphic to a subgraph of the strong product of a graph with bounded treewidth and a path. This result qualitatively extends the planar graph product structure theorem of Dujmovi\'c, Joret, Micek, Morin, Ueckerdt, and Wood [J. ACM 2020] and recent product structure theorems for other beyond planar graph classes. Using this result, we deduce that the class of simple topological $k$-matching-planar graphs has several attractive properties, making it the broadest class of simple beyond planar graphs in the literature that has these properties. All of our results about simple topological $k$-matching-planar graphs generalise to the non-simple setting, where the maximum number of pairwise crossing edges incident to a common vertex becomes relevant.
  The paper introduces several tools and results of independent interest. We show that every simple topological $k$-matching-planar graph admits an edge-colouring with $\mathcal{O}(k^{3}\log k)$ colours such that monochromatic edges do not cross. As a key ingredient of the proof of our main product structure theorem, we introduce the concept of weak shallow minors, which subsume and generalise shallow minors, a key concept in graph sparsity theory. We also establish upper bounds on the treewidth of graphs with well-behaved circular drawings that qualitatively generalise several existing results.</description>

      <title>A quasi-optimal upper bound for induced paths in sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2012, Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez proved that graphs of bounded degeneracy that have a path of order $n$ also have an induced path of order $\Omega(\log \log n)$. In this paper we give an almost matching upper bound by describing, for arbitrarily large values of $n$, a 2-degenerate graph that has a path of order $n$ and where all induced paths have order $O(\log \log n \cdot \log \log \log n)$.</description>

      <title>A new width parameter of graphs based on edge cuts: $\alpha$-edge-crossing width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce graph width parameters, called $\alpha$-edge-crossing width and edge-crossing width. These are defined in terms of the number of edges crossing a bag of a tree-cut decomposition. They are motivated by edge-cut width, recently introduced by Brand et al. (WG 2022). We show that edge-crossing width is equivalent to the known parameter tree-partition-width. On the other hand, $\alpha$-edge-crossing width is a new parameter; tree-cut width and $\alpha$-edge-crossing width are incomparable, and they both lie between tree-partition-width and edge-cut width.
  We provide an algorithm that, for a given $n$-vertex graph $G$ and integers $k$ and $\alpha$, in time $2^{O((\alpha+k)\log (\alpha+k))}n^2$ either outputs a tree-cut decomposition certifying that the $\alpha$-edge-crossing width of $G$ is at most $2\alpha^2+5k$ or confirms that the $\alpha$-edge-crossing width of $G$ is more than $k$. As applications, for every fixed $\alpha$, we obtain FPT algorithms for the List Coloring and Precoloring Extension problems parameterized by $\alpha$-edge-crossing width. They were known to be W[1]-hard parameterized by tree-partition-width, and FPT parameterized by edge-cut width, and we close the complexity gap between these two parameters.</description>

      <title>Trail Trap: a variant of Partizan Edge Geography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a two-player game played on undirected graphs called {\sc Trail Trap}, which is a variant of a game known as {\sc Partizan Edge Geography}. One player starts by choosing any edge and moving a token from one endpoint to the other; the other player then chooses a different edge and does the same. Alternating turns, each player moves their token along an unused edge from its current vertex to an adjacent vertex, until one player cannot move and loses. We present an algorithm to determine which player has a winning strategy when the graph is a tree and partially characterize the trees on which a given player wins. Additionally, we show that it is NP-hard to determine if Player~2 has a winning strategy on {\sc Trail Trap} from the starting position, even for connected bipartite planar graphs with maximum degree $4$. We determine which player has a winning strategy for certain subclasses of complete bipartite graphs and grid graphs, and we propose several open problems for further study.</description>

      <title>On $(k,g)$-Graphs without $(g+1)$-Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graph is a $k$-regular graph of girth $g$ which does not contain cycles of length $g+1$. Such graphs are known to exist for all parameter pairs $k \geq 3, g \geq 3 $, and we focus on determining the orders $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$ of the smallest $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graphs. This problem can be viewed as a special case of the previously studied Girth Pair Problem, the problem of finding the order of a smallest $k$-regular graph in which the length of a smallest even length cycle and the length of a smallest odd length cycle are prescribed. When considering the case of an odd girth $g$, this problem also yields results towards the Cage Problem, the problem of finding the order of a smallest $k$-regular graph of girth $g$. We establish the monotonicity of the function $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$ with respect to increasing $g$, and present universal lower bounds for the values $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$. We propose an algorithm for generating all $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graphs on $n$ vertices, use this algorithm to determine several of the smaller values $n(k,g,\underline{g+1})$, and discuss various approaches to finding smallest $(k,g,\underline{g+1})$-graphs within several classes of highly symmetrical graphs.</description>

      <title>Reweighted Spectral Partitioning Works: Bounds for Special Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral partitioning is a method that can be used to compute small sparse cuts or small edge-separators in a wide variety of graph classes, by computing the second-smallest eigenvalue (and eigenvector) of the Laplacian matrix. Upper bounds on this eigenvalue for certain graph classes imply that the method obtains small edge-separators for these classes, usually with a sub-optimal dependence on the maximum degree. In this work, we show that a related method, called reweighted spectral partitioning, guarantees near-optimal sparse vertex-cuts and vertex-separators in a wide variety of graph classes. In many cases, this involves little-to-no necessary dependence on maximum degree.
  We also obtain a new proof of the planar separator theorem, a strengthened eigenvalue bound for bounded-genus graphs, and a refined form of the recent Cheeger-style inequality for vertex expansion via a specialized dimension-reduction step.</description>

      <title>A simple layered-wheel-like construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant interest in characterizing the induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth and pathwidth. While this has recently been resolved for pathwidth, the case of treewidth remains open, and prior work has reduced the problem to understanding the layered-wheel-like obstructions -- graphs that contain large complete minor models with each branching set inducing a path; exclude large walls as induced minors; exclude large complete bipartite graphs as induced minors; and exclude large complete subgraphs.
  There are various constructions of such graphs, but they are all rather involved. In this paper, we present a simple construction of layered-wheel-like graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth. Three notable features of our construction are: (a) the vertices of degree at least four can be made to be arbitrarily far apart; (b) the girth can be made to be arbitrarily large; and (c) every outerstring induced subgraph of the graphs from our construction has treewidth bounded by an absolute constant. In contrast, among several previously known constructions of layered wheels, none achieves (a); at most one satisfies either (b) or (c); and none satisfies both (b) and (c) simultaneously.
  In particular, this is related to a former conjecture of Trotignon, that every graph with large enough treewidth, excluding large walls and large complete bipartite graphs as induced minors, and large complete subgraphs, must contain an outerstring induced subgraph of large treewidth. Our construction provides the first counterexample to this conjecture that can also be made to have arbitrarily large girth.</description>
