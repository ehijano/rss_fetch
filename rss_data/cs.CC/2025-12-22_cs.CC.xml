      <title>When Symmetry Yields NP-Hardness: Affine ML-SAT on S5 Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hemaspaandra~et~al.~[JCSS 2010] conjectured that satisfiability for multi-modal logic restricted to the connectives XOR and 1, over frame classes T, S4, and S5, is solvable in polynomial time. We refute this for S5 frames, by proving NP-hardness.</description>

      <title>Refining the Complexity Landscape of Speed Scaling: Hardness and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of scheduling jobs on a single speed-scalable processor with the objective of capturing the trade-off between the (weighted) flow time and the energy consumption. This trade-off has been extensively explored in the literature through a number of problem formulations that differ in the specific job characteristics and the precise objective function. Nevertheless, the computational complexity of four important problem variants has remained unresolved and was explicitly identified as an open question in prior work. In this paper, we settle the complexity of these variants.
  More specifically, we prove that the problem of minimizing the objective of total (weighted) flow time plus energy is NP-hard for the cases of (i) unit-weight jobs with arbitrary sizes, and (ii)~arbitrary-weight jobs with unit sizes. These results extend to the objective of minimizing the total (weighted) flow time subject to an energy budget and hold even when the schedule is required to adhere to a given priority ordering.
  In contrast, we show that when a completion-time ordering is provided, the same problem variants become polynomial-time solvable. The latter result highlights the subtle differences between priority and completion orderings for the problem.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Bipartite Degree Realizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the \emph{Bipartite Degree Realization} (BDR) problem: given a graphic degree sequence $D$, decide whether it admits a realization as a bipartite graph. While bipartite realizability for a fixed vertex partition can be decided in polynomial time via the Gale--Ryser theorem, the computational complexity of BDR without a prescribed partition remains unresolved. We address this question through a parameterized analysis.
  For constants $0 \le c_1 \le c_2 \le 1$, we define $\mathrm{BDR}_{c_1,c_2}$ as the restriction of BDR to degree sequences of length $n$ whose degrees lie in the interval $[c_1 n, c_2 n]$. Our main result shows that $\mathrm{BDR}_{c_1,c_2}$ is solvable in polynomial time whenever $0 \le c_1 \le c_2 \le \frac{\sqrt{c_1(c_1+4)}-c_1}{2}$, as well as for all $c_1 &gt; \tfrac12$. The proof relies on a reduction to extremal \emph{least balanced degree sequences} and a detailed verification of the critical Gale--Ryser inequalities, combined with a bounded subset-sum formulation.
  We further show that, assuming the NP-completeness of unrestricted BDR, the problem $\mathrm{BDR}_{c_1,c_2}$ remains NP-complete for all $0 &lt; c_2 &lt; \tfrac12$ and $c_1 &lt; 1 - c_2 - \sqrt{1-2c_2}$. Our results clarify the algorithmic landscape of bipartite degree realization and contribute to the broader study of potentially bipartite graphic degree sequences.</description>

      <title>Near Optimal Alphabet-Soundness Tradeoff PCPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$, for sufficiently large $q\in\mathbb{N}$ power of $2$, for all $\delta&gt;0$, it is NP-hard to distinguish whether a given $2$-Prover-$1$-Round projection game with alphabet size $q$ has value at least $1-\delta$, or value at most $1/q^{1-\varepsilon}$. This establishes a nearly optimal alphabet-to-soundness tradeoff for $2$-query PCPs with alphabet size $q$, improving upon a result of [Chan, Journal of the ACM 2016]. Our result has the following implications:
  1) Near optimal hardness for Quadratic Programming: it is NP-hard to approximate the value of a given Boolean Quadratic Program within factor $(\log n)^{1 - o(1)}$ under quasi-polynomial time reductions. This improves upon a result of [Khot, Safra, ToC 2013] and nearly matches the performance of the best known algorithms due to [Megretski, IWOTA 2000], [Nemirovski, Roos, Terlaky, Mathematical programming 1999] and [Charikar, Wirth, FOCS 2004] that achieve $O(\log n)$ approximation ratio.
  2) Bounded degree $2$-CSPs: under randomized reductions, for sufficiently large $d&gt;0$, it is NP-hard to approximate the value of $2$-CSPs in which each variable appears in at most $d$ constraints within factor $(1-o(1))\frac{d}{2}$, improving upon a result of [Lee, Manurangsi, ITCS 2024].
  3) Improved hardness results for connectivity problems: using results of [Laekhanukit, SODA 2014] and [Manurangsi, Inf. Process. Lett., 2019], we deduce improved hardness results for the Rooted $k$-Connectivity Problem, the Vertex-Connectivity Survivable Network Design Problem and the Vertex-Connectivity $k$-Route Cut Problem.</description>

      <title>A Homological Separation of $\mathbf{P}$ from $\mathbf{NP}$ via Computational Topology and Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes the separation of complexity classes $\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{NP}$ through a novel homological algebraic approach grounded in category theory. We construct the computational category $\mathbf{Comp}$, embedding computational problems and reductions into a unified categorical framework. By developing computational homology theory, we associate to each problem $L$ a chain complex $C_{\bullet}(L)$ whose homology groups $H_n(L)$ capture topological invariants of computational processes. Our main result demonstrates that problems in $\mathbf{P}$ exhibit trivial computational homology ($H_n(L) = 0$ for all $n &gt; 0$), while $\mathbf{NP}$-complete problems such as SAT possess non-trivial homology ($H_1(\mathrm{SAT}) \neq 0$). This homological distinction provides the first rigorous proof of $\mathbf{P} \neq \mathbf{NP}$ using topological methods. Our work inaugurates computational topology as a new paradigm for complexity analysis, offering finer distinctions than traditional combinatorial approaches and establishing connections between structural complexity theory and homological invariants.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Instances for Scheduling and Packing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two instances $(I,k)$ and $(I',k')$ of a parameterized problem $P$ are equivalent if they have the same set of solutions (static equivalent) or if the set of solutions of $(I,k)$ can be constructed by the set of solutions for $(I',k')$ and some computable pre-solutions. If the algorithm constructing such a (static) equivalent instance whose size is polynomial bounded runs in fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) time, we say that there exists a (static) equivalent instance for this problem. In this paper we present (static) equivalent instances for Scheduling and Knapsack problems. We improve the bound for the $\ell_1$-norm of an equivalent vector given by Eisenbrand, Hunkenschr\"oder, Klein, Kouteck\'y, Levin, and Onn and show how this yields equivalent instances for integer linear programs (ILPs) and related problems. We obtain an $O(MN^2\log(NU))$ static equivalent instance for feasibility ILPs where $M$ is the number of constraints, $N$ is the number of variables and $U$ is an upper bound for the $\ell_\infty$-norm of the smallest feasible solution. With this, we get an $O(n^2\log(n))$ static equivalent instance for Knapsack where $n$ is the number of items. Moreover, we give an $O(M^2N\log(NM\Delta))$ kernel for feasibility ILPs where $\Delta$ is an upper bound for the $\ell_\infty$-norm of the given constraint matrix.
  Using balancing results by Knop et al., the ConfILP and a proximity result by Eisenbrand and Weismantel we give an $O(d^2\log(p_{\max}))$ equivalent instance for LoadBalancing, a generalization of scheduling problems. Here $d$ is the number of different processing times and $p_{\max}$ is the largest processing time.</description>

      <title>Analogy between List Coloring Problems and the Interval $k$-$(\gamma,\mu)$-choosability property: theoretical aspects of complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates structural and computational aspects of list-based graph coloring under interval constraints. Building on the framework of analogous and p-analogous problems, we show that classical List Coloring, $\mu$-coloring, and $(\gamma,\mu)$-coloring share strong complexity-preserving correspondences on graph classes closed under pendant-vertex extensions. These equivalences allow hardness and tractability results to transfer directly among the models. Motivated by applications in scheduling and resource allocation with bounded ranges, we introduce the interval-restricted $k$-$(\gamma,\mu)$-coloring model, where each vertex receives an interval of exactly $k$ consecutive admissible colors. We prove that, although $(\gamma,\mu)$-coloring is NP-complete even on several well-structured graph classes, its $k$-restricted version becomes polynomial-time solvable for any fixed $k$. Extending this formulation, we define $k$-$(\gamma,\mu)$-choosability and analyze its expressive power and computational limits. Our results show that the number of admissible list assignments is drastically reduced under interval constraints, yielding a more tractable alternative to classical choosability, even though the general decision problem remains located at high levels of the polynomial hierarchy. Overall, the paper provides a unified view of list-coloring variants through structural reductions, establishes new complexity bounds for interval-based models, and highlights the algorithmic advantages of imposing fixed-size consecutive color ranges.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimality for Single-Source Personalized PageRank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The \emph{Single-Source Personalized PageRank} (SSPPR) query is central to graph OLAP, measuring the probability $\pi(s,t)$ that an $\alpha$-decay random walk from node $s$ terminates at $t$. Despite decades of research, a significant gap remains between upper and lower bounds for its computational complexity. Existing upper bounds are $O\left(\min\left(\frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon^2}, \frac{\sqrt{m \log n}}{\epsilon}, m \log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ for SSPPR-A and $O\left(\min\left(\frac{\log(1/n)}{\delta}, \sqrt{m \log(n/\delta)}, m \log \left(\frac{\log(n)}{m\delta}\right)\right)\right)$ for SSPPR-R, with trivial lower bounds of $\Omega(\min(n,1/\epsilon))$ and $\Omega(\min(n,1/\delta))$.
  This work narrows or closes this gap. We improve the upper bounds for SSPPR-A and SSPPR-R to $O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\right)$ and $O\left(\min\left(\frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\delta}, m + n \log(n) \log \left(\frac{\log(n)}{m\delta}\right)\right)\right)$, respectively, offering improvements by factors of $\log(1/\epsilon)$ and $\log\left(\frac{\log(n)}{m\delta}\right)$. On the lower bound side, we establish stronger results: $\Omega(\min(m, 1/\epsilon^2))$ for SSPPR-A and $\Omega(\min(m, \frac{\log(1/\delta)}{\delta}))$ for SSPPR-R, strengthening theoretical foundations. Our upper and lower bounds for SSPPR-R coincide for graphs with $m \in \Omega(n \log^2 n)$ and any threshold $\delta, 1/\delta \in O(\text{poly}(n))$, achieving theoretical optimality in most graph regimes. The SSPPR-A query attains partial optimality for large error thresholds, matching our new lower bound. This is the first optimal result for SSPPR queries. Our techniques generalize to the Single-Target Personalized PageRank (STPPR) query, improving its lower bound from $\Omega(\min(n, 1/\delta))$ to $\Omega(\min(m, \frac{n}{\delta} \log n))$, matching the upper bound and revealing its optimality.</description>
