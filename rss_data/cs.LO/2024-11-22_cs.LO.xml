      <title>Computable Approximations of Semicomputable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the computability of topological graphs, which are obtained by gluing arcs and rays together at their endpoints. We prove that every semicomputable graph in a computable metric space can be approximated, with arbitrary precision, by its computable subgraph with computable endpoints.</description>

      <title>A Quadratic Lower Bound for Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that deciding simulation equivalence and simulation preorder have quadratic lower bounds assuming that the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis holds. This is in line with the best know quadratic upper bounds of simulation equivalence. This means that deciding simulation is inherently quadratic. A typical consequence of this result is that computing simulation equivalence is fundamentally harder than bisimilarity.</description>

      <title>Creating a Formally Verified Neural Network for Autonomous Navigation: An Experience Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increased reliance of self-driving vehicles on neural networks opens up the challenge of their verification.  In this paper we present an experience report, describing a case study which we undertook to explore the design and training of a neural network on a custom dataset for vision-based autonomous navigation. We are particularly interested in the use of machine learning with differentiable logics to obtain networks satisfying basic safety properties by design, guaranteeing the behaviour of the neural network after training. We motivate the choice of a suitable neural network verifier for our purposes and report our observations on the use of neural network verifiers for self-driving systems.</description>

      <title>Using Formal Models, Safety Shields and Certified Control to Validate AI-Based Train Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The certification of autonomous systems is an important concern in science and industry. The KI-LOK project explores new methods for certifying and safely integrating AI components into autonomous trains. We pursued a two-layered approach: (1) ensuring the safety of the steering system by formal analysis using the B method, and (2) improving the reliability of the perception system with a runtime certificate checker. This work links both strategies within a demonstrator that runs simulations on the formal model, controlled by the real AI output and the real certificate checker. The demonstrator is integrated into the validation tool ProB. This enables runtime monitoring, runtime verification, and statistical validation of formal safety properties using a formal B model. Consequently, one can detect and analyse potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses of the AI and the certificate checker. We apply these techniques to a signal detection case study and present our findings.</description>

      <title>Truly Supercritical Trade-offs for Resolution, Cutting Planes, Monotone Circuits, and Weisfeiler-Leman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit supercritical trade-off for monotone circuits, showing that there are functions computable by small circuits for which any circuit must have depth super-linear or even super-polynomial in the number of variables, far exceeding the linear worst-case upper bound. We obtain similar trade-offs in proof complexity, where we establish the first size-depth trade-offs for cutting planes and resolution that are truly supercritical, i.e., in terms of formula size rather than number of variables, and we also show supercritical trade-offs between width and size for treelike resolution. Our results build on a new supercritical width-depth trade-off for resolution, obtained by refining and strengthening the compression scheme for the Cop-Robber game in [Grohe, Lichter, Neuen &amp; Schweitzer 2023]. This yields robust supercritical trade-offs for dimension versus iteration number in the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, which also translate into trade-offs between number of variables and quantifier depth in first-order logic. Our other results follow from improved lifting theorems that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Linear Arboreal Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10088v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arboreal categories, introduced by Abramsky and Reggio, axiomatise categories with tree-shaped objects. These categories provide a categorical language for formalising behavioural notions such as simulation, bisimulation, and resource-indexing. In this paper, we strengthen the axioms of an arboreal category to exclude `branching' behaviour, obtaining a notion of `linear arboreal category'. We then demonstrate that every arboreal category satisfying a linearisability condition has an associated linear arboreal subcategory related via an adjunction. This identifies the relationship between the pebble-relation comonad, of Montacute and Shah, and the pebbling comonad, of Abramsky, Dawar, and Wang, and generalises it further. As another outcome of this new framework, we obtain a linear variant of the arboreal category for modal logic. By doing so we recover different linear-time equivalences between transition systems as instances of their categorical definitions. We conclude with new preservation and characterisation theorems relating trace inclusion and trace equivalence with different linear fragments of modal logic.</description>

      <title>On the Computability of Measures of Regular Sets of Infinite Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rabin tree theorem yields an algorithm to solve the satisfiability problem for monadic second-order logic over infinite trees. Here we solve the probabilistic variant of this problem. Namely, we show how to compute the probability that a randomly chosen tree satisfies a given formula. We additionally show that this probability is an algebraic number. This closes a line of research where similar results were shown for formalisms weaker than the full monadic second-order logic.</description>

      <title>Homotopy type theory as a language for diagrams of $\infty$-logoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that certain diagrams of $\infty$-logoses are reconstructed in homotopy type theory extended with some lex, accessible modalities, which enables us to use plain homotopy type theory to reason about not only a single $\infty$-logos but also a diagram of $\infty$-logoses. This also provides a higher dimensional version of Sterling's synthetic Tait computability -- a type theory for higher dimensional logical relations.</description>

      <title>Complete and Terminating Tableau Calculus for Undirected Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid logic is a modal logic with additional operators specifying nominals and is highly expressive. For example, there is no formula corresponding to the irreflexivity of Kripke frames in basic modal logic, but there is in hybrid logic. Irreflexivity is significant in that irreflexive and symmetric Kripke frames can be regarded as undirected graphs reviewed from a graph theoretic point of view. Thus, the study of the hybrid logic with axioms corresponding to irreflexivity and symmetry can help to elucidate the logical properties of undirected graphs. In this paper, we formulate the tableau method of the hybrid logic for undirected graphs. Our main result is to show the completeness theorem and the termination property of the tableau method, which leads us to prove the decidability.</description>

      <title>Finite-Choice Logic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logic programming, as exemplified by datalog, defines the meaning of a program as its unique smallest model: the deductive closure of its inference rules. However, many problems call for an enumeration of models that vary along some set of choices while maintaining structural and logical constraints -- there is no single canonical model. The notion of stable models for logic programs with negation has successfully captured programmer intuition about the set of valid solutions for such problems, giving rise to a family of programming languages and associated solvers known as answer set programming. Unfortunately, the definition of a stable model is frustratingly indirect, especially in the presence of rules containing free variables.
  We propose a new formalism, finite-choice logic programming, that uses choice, not negation, to admit multiple solutions. Finite-choice logic programming contains all the expressive power of the stable model semantics, gives meaning to a new and useful class of programs, and enjoys a least-fixed-point interpretation over a novel domain. We present an algorithm for exploring the solution space and prove it correct with respect to our semantics. Our implementation, the Dusa logic programming language, has performance that compares favorably with state-of-the-art answer set solvers and exhibits more predictable scaling with problem size.</description>

      <title>The subTuring degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a notion of reducibility for partial functions on the natural numbers, which we call subTuring reducibility. One important aspect is that the subTuring degrees correspond to the structure of the realizability subtoposes of the effective topos. We show that the subTuring degrees (that is, the realizability subtoposes of the effective topos) form a dense non-modular (thus, non-distributive) lattice. We also show that there is a nonzero join-irreducible subTuring degree (which implies that there is a realizability subtopos of the effective topos that cannot be decomposed into two smaller realizability subtoposes).</description>

      <title>FCA using the Concept Explorer in 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we give a very short introduction to Formal Concept Analysis, accompanied by an example in order to build concept lattices from a context. We build the lattice using the Java-based software Concept Explorer (ConExp) in a recent version of Linux. Installing an appropriate Java version is necessary, because ConExp was developed some time ago using a Sun Java version, which is not open-source. As a result, it has been observed that ConExp will not build a lattice when started with an open-source Java version. Therefore, we also sketch the procedure we followed to install an appropriate Java version which makes ConExp work again, i.e., to "build lattices again". We also show how to start ConExp with a 32 bit Java version, which requires a few additional libraries.</description>
