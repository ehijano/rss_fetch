      <title>The principle of minimum virtual work and its application in bridge engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mechanics, common energy principles are based on fixed boundary conditions. However, in bridge engineering structures, it is usually necessary to adjust the boundary conditions to make the structure's internal force reasonable and save materials. However, there is currently little theoretical research in this area. To solve this problem, this paper proposes the principle of minimum virtual work for movable boundaries in mechanics through theoretical derivation such as variation method and tensor analysis. It reveals that the exact solution of the mechanical system minimizes the total virtual work of the system among all possible displacements, and the conclusion that the principle of minimum potential energy is a special case of this principle is obtained. At the same time, proposed virtual work boundaries and control conditions, which added to the fundamental equations of mechanics. The general formula of multidimensional variation method for movable boundaries is also proposed, which can be used to easily derive the basic control equations of the mechanical system. The incremental method is used to prove the theory of minimum value in multidimensional space, which extends the Pontryagin's minimum value principle. Multiple bridge examples were listed to demonstrate the extensive practical value of the theory presented in this article. The theory proposed in this article enriches the energy principle and variation method, establishes fundamental equations of mechanics for the structural optimization of movable boundary, and provides a path for active control of mechanical structures, which has important theoretical and engineering practical significance.</description>

      <title>Crack Dynamics in Rotating, Initially Stressed Material Strips: A Mathematical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current study explores the analysis of crack in initially stressed, rotating material strips, drawing insights from singular integral equations. In this work, a self-reinforced material strip with finite thickness and infinite extent, subjected to initial stress and rotational motion, has been considered to examine the Griffith fracture. The edges of the strip are pushed by constant loads from punches moving alongside it. This study makes waves in the material that affect the fracture's movement. A distinct mathematical technique is utilized to streamline the resolution of a pair of singular integral equations featuring First-order singularities. These obtained equations help us understand how the fracture behaves. The force acting at the fracture's edge is modeled using the Dirac delta function. Then, the Hilbert transformation method calculates the stress intensity factor (SIF) at the fracture's edge. Additionally, the study explores various scenarios, including constant intensity force without punch pressure, rotation parameter, initial stress, and isotropy in the strip, deduced from the SIF expression. Numerical computations and graphical analyses are conducted to assess the influence of various factors on SIF in the study. Finally, a comparison is made between the behavior of fractures in the initially stressed and rotating reinforced material strip and those in a standard material strip to identify any differences.</description>
