      <title>A Mathematical Model of Hematopoiesis during Systemic Infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic critical illness (CCI) is a disease state in which, following an initial insult, a patient neither recovers nor dies but instead remains in a state of critical illness. CCI is characterized by prolonged organ dysfunction, weight loss, and persistent increased vulnerability to infection. Recent data has shown that patients with CCI generally exhibit persistent immune dysfunction, characterized by prolonged elevation of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this paper, we introduce a host response model that couples hematopoiesis dynamics with immune response to infection. Specifically, we incorporate the reactions between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals with specific hematopoietic stem cell compartments with a reduced model of acute inflammation. We found that a maladaptive hematopoietic response to pathogenic insult is able to qualitatively reproduce similar behavior to that seen in CCI patients, namely the presence of a persistent, elevated level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This suggests that maladaptive hematopoietic responses in vivo may play a role in the development of CCI.</description>

      <title>SynthPert: Enhancing LLM Biological Reasoning via Synthetic Reasoning Traces for Cellular Perturbation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting cellular responses to genetic perturbations represents a fundamental challenge in systems biology, critical for advancing therapeutic discovery and virtual cell modeling. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for biological reasoning, their application to perturbation prediction remains underexplored due to challenges in adapting them to structured experimental data. We present SynthPert, a novel method that enhances LLM performance through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic reasoning traces generated by frontier models. Using the PerturbQA benchmark, we demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but surpasses the capabilities of the frontier model that generated the training data. Our results reveal three key insights: (1) Synthetic reasoning traces effectively distill biological knowledge even when partially inaccurate, (2) This approach enables cross-cell-type generalization with 87% accuracy on unseen RPE1 cells, and (3) Performance gains persist despite using only 2% of quality-filtered training data. This work shows the effectiveness of synthetic reasoning distillation for enhancing domain-specific reasoning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Rotational migration in human pancreatic ductal organoids depends on actin and myosin activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotational migration is one specific form of collective cell migration when epithelial cells are confined in a spherical geometry, such as in the epithelial acini. This tissue-level rotation motion is crucial for the morphogenesis of multiple epithelial systems. Here, we introduce a new primary human model for the study of rotational migration, pancreatic ductal organoids. Live imaging revealed the persistent rotation of the organoids over time. By tracking the nuclei, the three-dimensional trajectory of the cellular movement was reconstructed and the velocity of the rotation was quantified. The presence of focal adhesion clusters and prominent actin stress fibers were observed at the basal side of the organoids, suggesting the interactions between the cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix. Finally, our inhibition study showed the dependence of pancreatic ductal organoid rotational migration on myosin activity, actin polymerization, and actin branching. We hope that this model will enable future studies with human primary cells, which are more faithful to normal epithelial cells.</description>
