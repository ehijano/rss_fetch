      <title>QCMaquis 4.0: Multi-Purpose Electronic, Vibrational, and Vibronic Structure and Dynamics Calculations with the Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QCMaquis is a quantum chemistry software package for general molecular structure calculations in a matrix product state/matrix product operator formalism of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). It supports a wide range of features for electronic structure, multi-component (pre-Born-Oppenheimer), anharmonic vibrational structure, and vibronic calculations. In addition to the ground and excited state solvers, QCMaquis allows for time propagation of matrix product states based on the tangent-space formulation of time-dependent DMRG. The latest developments include transcorrelated electronic structure calculations, very recent vibrational and vibronic models, and a convenient Python wrapper, facilitating the interface with external libraries. This paper reviews all the new features of QCMaquis and demonstrates them with new results.</description>

      <title>Family-Vicsek universality of the binary intrinsic dimension of nonequilibrium data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic dimension (ID) is a powerful tool to detect and quantify correlations from data. Recently, it has been successfully applied to study statistical and many-body systems in equilibrium. Yet, its application to systems away from equilibrium remains largely unexplored. Here we study the ID of nonequilibrium growth dynamics data, and show that even after reducing these data to binary form, their binary intrinsic dimension (BID) retains essential physical information. Specifically, we find that, akin to the surface width, it exhibits Family-Vicsek dynamical scaling -- a fundamental feature to describe universality in surface roughness phenomena. These findings highlight the ability of the BID to correctly discern key properties and correlations in nonequilibrium data, and open an avenue for alternative characterizations of out-of-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>accLB: A High-Performance Lattice Boltzmann Code for Multiphase Turbulence on Multi-Gpu Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present accLB, a high-performance Fortran-based lattice Boltzmann (LB) solver tailored to multiphase turbulent flows on multi-GPU architectures. The code couples a conservative phase-field formulation of the Allen-Cahn equation with a thread-safe, regularized LB method to capture complex interface dynamics. Designed from the ground up for HPC environments, accLB employs MPI for distributed memory parallelism and OpenACC for GPU acceleration, achieving excellent portability and scalability on leading pre-exascale systems such as Leonardo and LUMI. Benchmark tests demonstrate strong and weak scaling efficiencies on multiple GPUs. Physical validation includes direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT). Further, we examine bubble-laden HIT and observe a transition to a $-3$ energy scaling, as in experiments and theoretical predictions, due to bubble-induced dissipation, along with enhanced small-scale intermittency. These results highlight accLB as a robust and scalable platform for the simulation of multiphase turbulence in extreme computational regimes.</description>

      <title>Qracle: A Graph-Neural-Network-based Parameter Initializer for Variational Quantum Eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a leading class of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms with broad applications in quantum physics and quantum chemistry. However, as system size increases, VQE optimization is increasingly hindered by the barren plateau phenomenon, where gradients vanish and the loss function becomes trapped in local minima. While machine learning-based parameter initialization methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they often show limited effectiveness in complex VQE problems. This is primarily due to their inadequate ability to model the intricate correlations embedded in the Hamiltonian structure and the associated ansatz circuits. In this paper, we propose \textit{Qracle}, a graph neural network (GNN)-based parameter initializer for VQEs. \textit{Qracle} systematically encodes both the Hamiltonian and the associated ansatz circuit into a unified graph representation and leverages a GNN to learn a mapping from VQE problem graphs to optimized ansatz parameters. Compared to state-of-the-art initialization techniques, \textit{Qracle} achieves a reduction in initial loss of up to $10.86$, accelerates convergence by decreasing optimization steps by up to $64.42\%$, and improves final performance with up to a $26.43\%$ reduction in Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).</description>

      <title>Hacktive Matter: data-driven discovery through hackathon-based cross-disciplinary coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The past decade has seen unprecedented growth in active matter and autonomous biomaterials research, yielding diverse classes of materials that promise revolutionary applications such as self-healing infrastructure and self-sensing tissue implants. However, inconsistencies in metrics, definitions, and analysis algorithms across research groups, as well as the high-dimension data streams, has hindered identification of performance intersections. Progress in this arena demands multi-disciplinary team approaches to discovery with scaffolded training and cross-pollination of ideas, and requires new learning and collaboration methods. To address this challenge, we have developed a hackathon platform to train future scientists and engineers in big data, interdisciplinary collaboration, and community coding; and to design and beta-test high-throughput (HTP) biomaterials analysis software and workflows. We enforce a flat hierarchy, pairing participants ranging from high school students to faculty with varied experiences and skills to collectively contribute to data acquisition and processing, ideation, coding, testing and dissemination. With clearly-defined goals and deliverables, participants achieve success through a series of tutorials, small group coding sessions, facilitated breakouts, and large group report-outs and discussions. These modules facilitate efficient iterative algorithm development and optimization; strengthen community and collaboration skills; and establish teams, benchmarks, and community standards for continued productive work. Our hackathons provide a powerful model for the soft matter community to educate and train students and collaborators in cutting edge data-driven analysis, which is critical for future innovation in complex materials research.</description>

      <title>Accelerating point defect photo-emission calculations with machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework leveraging universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to dramatically accelerate the calculation of photoluminescence (PL) spectra of atomic or molecular emitters with \emph{ab initio} accuracy. By replacing the costly density functional theory (DFT) computation of phonon modes with much faster MLIP phonon mode calculations, our approach achieves speed improvements exceeding an order of magnitude with minimal precision loss. We benchmark the approach using a dataset comprising \emph{ab initio} emission spectra of 791 color centers spanning various types of crystal point defects in different charge and magnetic states. The method is also applied to a molecular emitter adsorbed on a hexagonal boron nitride surface. Across all the systems, we find excellent agreement for both the Huang-Rhys factor and the PL lineshapes. This application of universal MLIPs bridges the gap between computational efficiency and spectroscopic fidelity, opening pathways to high-throughput screening of defect-engineered materials. Our work not only demonstrates accelerated calculation of PL spectra with DFT accuracy, but also makes such calculations tractable for more complex materials.</description>

      <title>Fully independent response in disordered solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike in crystals, it is difficult to trace emergent material properties of amorphous solids to their underlying structure. Nevertheless, one can tune features of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to specific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the structure. This has been understood through the notion of independent bond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs have different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated inverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified in a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse design. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the simultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much stronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the mechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across a wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable parameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our formulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter changes, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability. These results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference between ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to both understand and perform inverse design.</description>

      <title>Pyrometheus: Symbolic abstractions for XPU and automatically differentiated computation of combustion kinetics and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cost of combustion simulations is often dominated by the evaluation of net production rates of chemical species and mixture thermodynamics (thermochemistry). Execution on computing accelerators (XPUs) like graphic processing units (GPUs) can greatly reduce this cost. However, established thermochemistry software is not readily portable to such devices or sacrifices valuable analytical forms that enable differentiation for sensitivity analysis and implicit time integration. Symbolic abstractions are developed with corresponding transformations that enable computation on accelerators and automatic differentiation by avoiding premature specification of detail. The software package Pyrometheus is introduced as an implementation of these abstractions and their transformations for combustion thermochemistry. The formulation facilitates code generation from the symbolic representation of a specific thermochemical mechanism in multiple target languages, including Python, C++, and Fortran. Computational concerns are separated: the generated code processes array-valued expressions but does not specify their semantics. These semantics are provided by compatible array libraries, such as NumPy, Pytato, and Google JAX. Thus, the generated code retains a symbolic representation of the thermochemistry, which translates to computation on accelerators and CPUs and automatic differentiation. The design and operation of these symbolic abstractions and their companion tool, Pyrometheus, are discussed throughout. Roofline demonstrations show that the computation of chemical source terms within MFC, a Fortran-based flow solver we link to Pyrometheus, is performant.</description>

      <title>SA-GAT-SR: Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks with Symbolic Regression for high-fidelity material property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.</description>

      <title>Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07769v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex and backward-facing step flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number. Geometry extrapolation studies on a separate cavity flow configuration show promising cross-mesh capabilities of the super-resolution strategy.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of chaos in billiards: the role of mixed curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boundary of a billiard system plays a crucial role in shaping its dynamics, which may be integrable, mixed, or fully chaotic. When a boundary has varying curvature, it offers a unique setting to study the relation between classical chaos and quantum behaviour. In this study, we introduce two geometrically distinct billiards: a bean-shaped boundary and a peanut-shaped variant of Cassini ovals. These systems incorporate both focusing and defocusing walls with no neutral segments. Our study reveals a strong correlation between classical and quantum dynamics. Our analysis of billiard flow diagrams confirms sensitivity to initial conditions(ICs)- a defining feature of chaos. Poincar\'e maps further show the phase space intricately woven with regions of chaotic motion and stability islands. Moving to the quantum domain, we employ nearest-neighbour spacing distribution and level spacing ratio as statistical measures to characterise chaos. Early time saturation in spectral complexity also supports an ergodic hierarchy in these systems. We observe a striking quantum phenomenon, i.e. eigenfunction scarring. This work bridges geometric boundary effects, classical hyperbolicity, and quantum ergodicity, offering a framework to engineer chaos in confined systems.</description>
