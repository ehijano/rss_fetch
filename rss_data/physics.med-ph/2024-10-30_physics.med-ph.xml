      <title>Accelerated, Robust Lower-Field Neonatal MRI with Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neonatal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive assessment of potential brain abnormalities during the critical phase of early life development. Recently, interest has developed in lower field (i.e., below 1.5 Tesla) MRI systems that trade-off magnetic field strength for portability and access in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Unfortunately, lower-field neonatal MRI still suffers from long scan times and motion artifacts that can limit its clinical utility for neonates. This work improves motion robustness and accelerates lower field neonatal MRI through diffusion-based generative modeling and signal processing based motion modeling. We first gather a training dataset of clinical neonatal MRI images. Then we train a diffusion-based generative model to learn the statistical distribution of fully-sampled images by applying several signal processing methods to handle the lower signal-to-noise ratio and lower quality of our MRI images. Finally, we present experiments demonstrating the utility of our generative model to improve reconstruction performance across two tasks: accelerated MRI and motion correction.</description>

      <title>Skin dose in breast radiation therapy: Monte Carlo calculations from deformed vector fields (DVF)-driven CT images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skin dose in radiotherapy is a key issue for reducing patient side effects, but dose calculations in this high-gradient region remains a challenge. To support radiation therapists and medical physicist in their decisions, a computational tool has been developed to systematically recalculate the skin dose for each treatment session, taking into account changes in breast geometry. This tool is based on Monte Carlo skin dose calculations from deformed vector fields (DVF)-driven CT images, using 3D-scanner data. The application of deformation fields to the initial patient CT, as well as the validation of Monte Carlo skin dose calculations and comparison with TPS algorithm, are presented. The tool is currently being evaluated using data from a clinical study involving 60 patients (MorphoBreast3D).</description>

      <title>Conceptualization of ionization dose to water to quantify radiation therapy doses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \emph{Objective.} This study conceptualizes the ionization dose to water as the dose absorbed to water and expended exclusively on ionization, which is essential for radiation therapy, and formulates its dosimetric procedures for high-energy photon, electron, proton, and ion beams. It also aims to design optimal ionization chambers to reduce large dosimetric uncertainty for proton and ion beams. \emph{Approach.} Based on the international code of practice, the dosimetric procedure without the $W$-value correction was formulated for all beams, and that without the stopping-power-ratio correction was formulated for proton and ion beams. For the latter, water-equivalent gas was considered for gas-sealed ionization chambers. Reference dosimetry was performed virtually for test beams. \emph{Main results.} For photon and electron beams, the ionization dose was essentially equivalent to the absorbed dose. For proton and ion beams, dosimetric uncertainties were greatly reduced, especially with water-equivalent gas, to \SI{0.7}{\%} and \SI{1.0}{\%}, respectively. Nitrogen-based water-equivalent gas mixtures were designed with helium, methane, and ethane. Dosimetry with the helium mixture was prone and sensitive to leakage, while the methane and ethane mixtures were flammable. \emph{Significance.} The ionization dose with reduced beam quality corrections provides dose representations of improved accuracy and relevance to radiation therapy, particularly for proton and ion beams.</description>

      <title>First-in-human spinal cord tumor imaging with fast adaptive focus tracking robotic-OCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21809v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current surgical procedures for spinal cord tumors lack in vivo high-resolution, high-speed multifunctional imaging systems, posing challenges for precise tumor resection and intraoperative decision-making. This study introduces the Fast Adaptive Focus Tracking Robotic Optical Coherence Tomography (FACT-ROCT) system,designed to overcome these obstacles by providing real-time, artifact-free multifunctional imaging of spinal cord tumors during surgery. By integrating cross-scanning, adaptive focus tracking and robotics, the system addresses motion artifacts and resolution degradation from tissue movement, achieving wide-area, high-resolution imaging. We conducted intraoperative imaging on 21 patients, including 13 with spinal gliomas and 8 with other tumors. This study marks the first demonstration of OCT in situ imaging of human spinal cord tumors, providing micrometer-scale in vivo structural images and demonstrating FACT-ROCT's potential to differentiate various tumor types in real-time. Analysis of the attenuation coefficients of spinal gliomas revealed increased heterogeneity with higher malignancy grades. So, we proposed the standard deviation of the attenuation coefficient as a physical marker, achieving over 90% accuracy in distinguishing high- from low-grade gliomas intraoperatively at a threshold. FACT-ROCT even enabled extensive in vivo microvascular imaging of spinal cord tumors, covering 70 mm * 13 mm * 10 mm within 2 minutes. Quantitative vascular tortuosity comparisons confirmed greater tortuosity in higher-grade tumors. The ability to perform extensive vascular imaging and real-time tumor grading during surgery provides critical information for surgical strategy, such as minimizing intraoperative bleeding and optimizing tumor resection while preserving functional tissue.</description>

      <title>Chemical Shift Encoding based Double Bonds Quantification in Triglycerides using Deep Image Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01926v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fatty acid can potentially serve as biomarker for evaluating metabolic disorder and inflammation condition, and quantifying the double bonds is the key for revealing fatty acid information. This study presents an assessment of a deep learning approach utilizing Deep Image Prior (DIP) for the quantification of double bonds and methylene-interrupted double bonds of triglyceride derived from chemical-shift encoded multi-echo gradient echo images, all achieved without the necessity for network training. The methodology implemented a cost function grounded in signal constraints to continually refine the neural network's parameters on a single slice of images through iterative processes. Validation procedures encompassed both phantom experiments and in-vivo scans. The outcomes evidenced a concordance between the quantified values and the established reference standards, notably exemplified by a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 (p = 0.0005) derived from the phantom experiments. The results in water-oil phantom also demonstrate the quantification reliability of the DIP method under the condition of having a relatively low-fat signal. Furthermore, the in-vivo assessments showcased the method's competency by showcasing consistent quantification results that closely mirrored previously published findings concerning subcutaneous fat. In summary, the study underscores the potential of Deep Image Prior in enabling the quantification of double bonds and methylene-interrupted double bonds from chemical-shift encoded multi-echo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, suggesting potential avenues for future research and clinical applications in the field.</description>
