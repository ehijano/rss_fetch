      <title>Complex Dynamics in Reaction-Phase Separation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of sustained spatio-temporal behaviors in reaction-phase separation systems. We focus on binary systems, in which either one or both species can phase separate, and we discuss the stability of the homogeneous state determining the conditions for the emergence of a Hopf-type bifurcation. We then examine the effects of a specific autocatalytic chemical reaction, and computationally determine the full solutions to the partial differential equations. We find that when both species phase separate, sustained pulsed dynamics arise in one dimension. When considered in two dimensions, the system generates persistent, complex dynamic droplets, which do not generally appear if only one of the species can phase separate. We finally discuss the emergence of dynamics with complex features, which can be understood using the framework of a cellular automata.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric deformations of a perturbed spherical bubble in an incompressible fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a gas bubble in a fluid with surface tension, initially near a spherical equilibrium. While there are many studies and applications of radial bubble dynamics, the theory of general deformations from a spherical equilibrium is less developed. We aim to understand how asymmetrically perturbed equilibrium bubbles evolve toward spherical equilibrium due to thermal or viscous dissipation in an incompressible liquid. We focus on the isobaric approximation [Prosperetti, JFM, 1991], under which the gas pressure within the bubble is spatially uniform and obeys the ideal gas law. The liquid outside the bubble is incompressible, irrotational, and has surface tension. We prove that any equilibrium gas bubble must be spherical by showing that the bubble boundary is a closed surface of constant mean curvature. We then study the initial value problem (IVP) for the coupled PDEs, constitutive laws and interface conditions of the isobaric approximation for general (asymmetric) small initial perturbations of the spherical bubble in the linearized approximation. Our first result, considering thermal damping without viscosity, proves that the linearized IVP is globally well-posed. The monopole (radial) component of the perturbation decays exponentially over time, while the multipole (non-radial) components undergo undamped oscillations. This indicates a limitation of the isobaric model for non-spherical dynamics. Our second result, incorporating viscous dissipation, shows that the IVP is linear and nonlinearly ill-posed due to an incompatibility of normal stress boundary conditions, for non-spherical solutions, and the irrotationality assumption. Our study concludes that to accurately capture the dynamics of general deformations of a gas bubble, the model must account for either vorticity generated at the bubble-fluid boundary, spatial non-uniformities in the gas pressure, or both.</description>
