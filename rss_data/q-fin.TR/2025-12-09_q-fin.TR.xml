      <title>Wealth or Stealth? The Camouflage Effect in Insider Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Kyle-type model where insider trading takes place among a potentially large population of liquidity traders and is subject to legal penalties. Insiders exploit the liquidity provided by the trading masses to "camouflage" their actions and balance expected wealth with the necessary stealth to avoid detection. Under a diverse spectrum of prosecution schemes, we establish the existence of equilibria for arbitrary population sizes and a unique limiting equilibrium. A convergence analysis determines the scale of insider trading by a stealth index $\gamma$, revealing that the equilibrium can be closely approximated by a simple limit due to diminished price informativeness. Empirical aspects are derived from two calibration experiments using non-overlapping data sets spanning from 1980 to 2018, which underline the indispensable role of a large population in insider trading models with legal risk, along with important implications for the incidence of stealth trading and the deterrent effect of legal enforcement.</description>

      <title>Order-Flow Filtration and Directional Association with Short-Horizon Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic markets generate dense order flow with many transient orders, which degrade directional signals derived from the limit order book (LOB). We study whether simple structural filters on order lifetime, modification count, and modification timing sharpen the association between order book imbalance (OBI) and short-horizon returns in BankNifty index futures, where unfiltered OBI is already known to be a strong short-horizon directional indicator. The efficacy of each filter is evaluated using a three-step diagnostic ladder: contemporaneous correlations, linear association between discretised regimes, and Hawkes event-time excitation between OBI and return regimes. Our results indicate that filtration of the aggregate order flow produces only modest changes relative to the unfiltered benchmark. By contrast, when filters are applied on the parent orders of executed trades, the resulting OBI series exhibits systematically stronger directional association. Motivated by recent regulatory initiatives to curb noisy order flow, we treat the association between OBI and short-horizon returns as a policy-relevant diagnostic of market quality. We then compare unfiltered and filtered OBI series, using tick-by-tick data from the National Stock Exchange of India, to infer how structural filters on the order flow affect OBI-return dynamics in an emerging market setting.</description>

      <title>Autodeleveraging: Impossibilities and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autodeleveraging (ADL) is a last-resort loss socialization mechanism for perpetual futures venues. It is triggered when solvency-preserving liquidations fail. Despite the dominance of perpetual futures in the crypto derivatives market, with over \$60 trillion of volume in 2024, there has been no formal study of ADL. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous model of ADL. We prove that ADL mechanisms face a fundamental \emph{trilemma}: no policy can simultaneously satisfy exchange \emph{solvency}, \emph{revenue}, and \emph{fairness} to traders. This impossibility theorem implies that as participation scales, a novel form of \emph{moral hazard} grows asymptotically, rendering `zero-loss' socialization impossible. Constructively, we show that three classes of ADL mechanisms can optimally navigate this trilemma to provide fairness, robustness to price shocks, and maximal exchange revenue. We analyze these mechanisms on the Hyperliquid dataset from October 10, 2025, when ADL was used repeatedly to close \$2.1 billion of positions in 12 minutes. By comparing our ADL mechanisms to the standard approaches used in practice, we demonstrate empirically that Hyperliquid's production queue overutilized ADL by $\approx 28\times$ relative to our optimal policy, imposing roughly \$653 million of unnecessary haircuts on winning traders. This comparison also suggests that Binance overutilized ADL far more than Hyperliquid. Our results both theoretically and empirically demonstrate that optimized ADL mechanisms can dramatically reduce the loss of trader profits while maintaining exchange solvency.</description>
