      <title>A Principal Submanifold-based Approach for Clustering and Multiscale RNA Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RNA structure determination is essential for understanding its biological functions. However, the reconstruction process often faces challenges, such as atomic clashes, which can lead to inaccurate models. To address these challenges, we introduce the principal submanifold (PSM) approach for analyzing RNA data on a torus. This method provides an accurate, low-dimensional feature representation, overcoming the limitations of previous torus-based methods. By combining PSM with DBSCAN, we propose a novel clustering technique, the principal submanifold-based DBSCAN (PSM-DBSCAN). Our approach achieves superior clustering accuracy and increased robustness to noise. Additionally, we apply this new method for multiscale corrections, effectively resolving RNA backbone clashes at both microscopic and mesoscopic scales. Extensive simulations and comparative studies highlight the enhanced precision and scalability of our method, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches. The proposed methodology offers a robust foundation for correcting complex RNA structures and has broad implications for applications in structural biology and bioinformatics.</description>

      <title>CryoSAMU: Enhancing 3D Cryo-EM Density Maps of Protein Structures at Intermediate Resolution with Structure-Aware Multimodal U-Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 3D density maps at intermediate resolution (4-8 {\AA}) is crucial in protein structure determination. Recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of automated approaches for enhancing experimental cryo-EM density maps. Yet, these methods are not optimized for intermediate-resolution maps and rely on map density features alone. To address this, we propose CryoSAMU, a novel method designed to enhance 3D cryo-EM density maps of protein structures using structure-aware multimodal U-Nets and trained on curated intermediate-resolution density maps. We comprehensively evaluate CryoSAMU across various metrics and demonstrate its competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, CryoSAMU achieves significantly faster processing speed, showing promise for future practical applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/chenwei-zhang/CryoSAMU.</description>

      <title>Structured Random Binding: a minimal model of protein-protein interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe Structured Random Binding (SRB), a minimal model of protein-protein interactions rooted in the statistical physics of disordered systems. In this model, nonspecific binding is a generic consequence of the interaction between random proteins, exhibiting a phase transition from a high temperature state where nonspecific complexes are transient and lack well-defined interaction interfaces, to a low temperature state where the complex structure is frozen and a definite interaction interface is present. Numerically, weakly-bound nonspecific complexes can evolve into tightly-bound, highly specific complexes, but only if the structural correlation length along the peptide backbone is short; moreover, evolved tightly-bound homodimers favor the same interface structure that is predominant in real protein homodimers.</description>

      <title>Structure-Based Experimental Datasets for Benchmarking Protein Simulation Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review article provides an overview of structurally oriented experimental datasets that can be used to benchmark protein force fields, focusing on data generated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and room temperature (RT) protein crystallography. We discuss what the observables are, what they tell us about structure and dynamics, what makes them useful for assessing force field accuracy, and how they can be connected to molecular dynamics simulations carried out using the force field one wishes to benchmark. We also touch on statistical issues that arise when comparing simulations with experiment. We hope this article will be particularly useful to computational researchers and trainees who develop, benchmark, or use protein force fields for molecular simulations.</description>
