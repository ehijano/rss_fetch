      <title>Extent of the Magnetotail of Venus From the Solar Orbiter, Parker Solar Probe and BepiColombo Flybys</title>

Abstract: We analyze data from multiple flybys by the Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) missions to study the interaction between Venus' plasma environment and the solar wind forming the induced magnetosphere. Through examination of magnetic field and plasma density signatures we characterize the spatial extent and dynamics of Venus' magnetotail, focusing mainly on boundary crossings. Notably, we observe significant differences in boundary crossing location and appearance between flybys, highlighting the dynamic nature of Venus' magnetotail. In particular, during Solar Orbiter's third flyby, extreme solar wind conditions led to significant variations in the magnetosheath plasma density and magnetic field properties, but the increased dynamic pressure did not compress the magnetotail. Instead, it is possible that the increased EUV flux at this time rather caused it to expand in size. Key findings also include the identification of several far downstream bow shock (BS), or bow wave, crossings to at least 60 Rv (1 Rv = 6,052 km is the radius of Venus), and the induced magnetospheric boundary to at least 20 Rv. These crossings provide insight into the extent of the induced magnetosphere. Pre-existing models from Venus Express were only constrained to within ~5 Rv of the planet, and we provide modifications to better fit the far-downstream crossings. The new model BS is now significantly closer to the central tail than previously suggested, by about 10 Rv at 60 Rv downstream.</description>
