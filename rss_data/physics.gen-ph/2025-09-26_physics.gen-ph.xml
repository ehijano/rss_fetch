      <title>An exact approach to frustrated total internal reflection and Goos-H\"anchen shift for s-polarised light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact analogy between wave mechanics in quantum theory and the scalar wave treatment of optics emerges from the marriage of Newtonian formulation of geometrical optics [1] and the ``formal quantum theory of light rays'' [2]. Here the incidence of a ray of light on the interface between two media is treated as the incidence of a wavefunction on a potential barrier. This leads to the coefficient of reflection identical to Fresnel's formula for s-polarised light [3], although there is no concept of the polarisation of light in this model. In the present work, we apply this model to the total internal reflection of light and evanescent waves. We also deduce a one-to-one correspondence between the transmission coefficient in wave mechanics and frustrated total internal reflection for all angles of incidence. Further, we demonstrate that this model can also be used to derive the Goos-H\"anchen shift for s-polarised light. This work augments the discussion on these topics found in the standard texts in optics [4].</description>

      <title>Electromagnetism from relativistic fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10445v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a matter-space framework in which particles including photons are modeled as residing on a three-dimensional matter space, while the familiar electromagnetic fields in four-dimensional spacetime arise as projections. A set of constraint equations, implied by the absence of nontrivial 4-forms on a three-dimensional space, yields a ``matter-space gauge symmetry'', which manifests on a subset of the 1-form fields in 4-dimensional spacetime. Employing the electro-magnetic duality, the gauge symmetry enforces a precise relation between the potential $A_a$ and the field strength $F_{ab}$, reproducing one half of Maxwell's equations. The remaining Maxwell equation follows from an action principle for relativistic fluids formulated on matter space. Notably, in this construction the dynamics of electromagnetism emerges from the set of constraints, rather than being added ad hoc. This formulation not only ensures consistency with conventional electromagnetism but also provides deeper insights on the particle nature of the electromagnetic field. To support this claim, we demonstrate that i) the Aharonov-Bohm effect arises solely from the matter-space gauge potential. ii) the helicity is shown to be conserved automatically. iii) nonlinear corrections analogous to mass renormalization are intrinsically incorporated. This framework offers a fundamental interplay between matter and electromagnetic fields.</description>
