      <title>Design and Implementation of ARA Wireless Living Lab for Rural Broadband and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the rural broadband challenge and to leverage the unique opportunities that rural regions provide for piloting advanced wireless applications, we design and implement the ARA wireless living lab for research and innovation in rural wireless systems and their applications in precision agriculture, community services, and so on. ARA focuses on the unique community, application, and economic context of rural regions, and it features the first-of-its-kind, real-world deployment of long-distance, high-capacity wireless x-haul and access platforms across a rural area of diameter over 30 km. With both software-defined radios and programmable COTS systems and through effective orchestration of these wireless resources with fiber as well as compute resources embedded end-to-end across user equipment, base stations, edge, and cloud, ARA offers programmability, performance, robustness, and heterogeneity at the same time, thus enabling rural-focused co-evolution of wireless and applications while helping advance the frontiers of wireless systems in domains such as O-RAN, NextG, and agriculture applications. Here we present the design principles and implementation strategies of ARA, characterize its performance and heterogeneity, and highlight example wireless and application experiments uniquely enabled by ARA.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Enhancing Linux Kernel-based Packet Switching on WiFi Access Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of WiFi devices and their traffic demands continue to rise, the need for a scalable and high-performance wireless infrastructure becomes increasingly essential. Central to this infrastructure are WiFi Access Points (APs), which facilitate packet switching between Ethernet and WiFi interfaces. Despite APs' reliance on the Linux kernel's data plane for packet switching, the detailed operations and complexities of switching packets between Ethernet and WiFi interfaces have not been investigated in existing works. This paper makes the following contributions towards filling this research gap. Through macro and micro-analysis of empirical experiments, our study reveals insights in two distinct categories. Firstly, while the kernel's statistics offer valuable insights into system operations, we identify and discuss potential pitfalls that can severely affect system analysis. For instance, we reveal the implications of device drivers on the meaning and accuracy of the statistics related to packet-switching tasks and processor utilization. Secondly, we analyze the impact of the packet switching path and core configuration on performance and power consumption. Specifically, we identify the differences in Ethernet-to-WiFi and WiFi-to-Ethernet data paths regarding processing components, multi-core utilization, and energy efficiency. We show that the WiFi-to-Ethernet data path leverages better multi-core processing and exhibits lower power consumption.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Diffusion-based Incentive Mechanism for Generative AI-driven Digital Twins in Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPSs) are an integral component of modern manufacturing and industries. By digitizing data throughout the product life cycle, Digital Twins (DTs) in ICPSs enable a shift from current industrial infrastructures to intelligent and adaptive infrastructures. Thanks to data process capability, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) can drive the construction and update of DTs to improve predictive accuracy and prepare for diverse smart manufacturing. However, mechanisms that leverage sensing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices to share data for the construction of DTs are susceptible to adverse selection problems. In this paper, we first develop a GAI-driven DT architecture for ICPSs. To address the adverse selection problem caused by information asymmetry, we propose a contract theory model and develop the sustainable diffusion-based soft actor-critic algorithm to identify the optimal feasible contract. Specifically, we leverage the dynamic structured pruning technique to reduce parameter numbers of actor networks, allowing sustainability and efficient implementation of the proposed algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Improving Energy Efficiency in Federated Learning Through the Optimization of Communication Resources Scheduling of Wireless IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows devices to train a global machine learning model without sharing data. In the context of wireless networks, the inherently unreliable nature of the transmission channel introduces delays and errors that compromise the regularity of updating the global model. Furthermore, limited resources and energy consumption of devices are factors that affect FL performance. Therefore, this work proposes a new FL algorithm called FL-E2WS that considers both the requirements of federated training and a wireless network within the scope of the Internet of Things. To reduce the energy cost of devices, FL-E2WS schedules communication resources to allocate the ideal bandwidth and power for the transmission of models under certain device selection and uplink resource block allocation, meeting delay requirements, power consumption, and packet error rate. The simulation results demonstrate that FL-E2WS reduces energy consumption by up to 70.12% and enhances the accuracy of the global model by up to 10.21% compared to the FL algorithms that lacks transmission channel knowledge. Additionally, when compared to FL versions that scale communication resources, FL-E2WS achieves up to a 38.61% reduction in energy consumption and improves the accuracy of the global model by up to 1.61%.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of TSN Forwarding Mechanisms on Best-Effort Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) enables the transmission of multiple traffic types within a single network. While the performance of high-priority traffic has been extensively studied in recent years, the performance of low-priority traffic varies significantly between different TSN forwarding algorithms. This paper provides an overview of existing TSN forwarding algorithms and discusses their impact on best-effort traffic. The effects are quantified through simulations of synthetic and realistic networks. The considered forwarding mechanisms are Strict Priority (SP), Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS), Credit-Based Shaper (CBS), Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS), and Time-Aware Shaper (TAS).
  The findings indicate that ATS, CBS, and ETS can significantly reduce queuing delays and queue lengths for best-effort traffic when compared to SP and TAS. This effect is enhanced when the reserved bandwidth for high priority queues - using CBS, ATS, or ETS - is reduced to the lowest possible value, within the reserved rate and latency requirements. Specifically, the simulations demonstrate that the choice of forwarding algorithm can improve the performance of low-priority traffic by up to twenty times compared to the least effective algorithm. This study not only provides a comprehensive understanding of the various TSN forwarding algorithms but can also serve as guidance at networks' design time to improve the performance for all types of traffic.</description>

      <title>Community Cellular Networks Coverage Visualizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The community cellular networks volunteers and researchers currently rarely have an access to information about the networks for each site. This makes it difficult for them to evaluate network performance, identify outrages and downtimes, or even to show the current site locations. In this paper, we propose the Community Cellular Networks Coverage Visualizer, a performance dashboard to help reduce the workload of technicians and gain trust from illustrating the reliability of the networks. The map displays the overall and in-depth performance for each current and future CCNs sites with privacy-focused implementation, while the multi-series line chart emphasizes on providing the capability of network overtime. Not only it will help users identify locations that have stronger and reliable signals nearby, but our applicaiton will also be an essential tool for volunteers and engineers to determine the optimal locations to install a new site and quickly identify possible network failures.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Routing in Quantum Networks: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement routing in near-term quantum networks consists of choosing the optimal sequence of short-range entanglements to combine through swapping operations to establish end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. Similar to traditional routing technologies, a quantum routing protocol uses network information to choose the best paths to satisfy a set of end-to-end entanglement requests. However, in addition to network state information, a quantum routing protocol must also take into account the requested entanglement fidelity, the probabilistic nature of swapping operations, and the short lifetime of entangled states. In this work, we formulate a practical entanglement routing problem and analyze and categorize the main approaches to address it, drawing comparisons to, and inspiration from, classical network routing strategies where applicable. We classify and discuss the studied quantum routing schemes into reactive, proactive, opportunistic, and virtual routing</description>

      <title>Tailoring Graph Neural Network-based Flow-guided Localization to Individual Bloodstreams and Activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-guided localization using in-body nanodevices in the bloodstream is expected to be beneficial for early disease detection, continuous monitoring of biological conditions, and targeted treatment. The nanodevices face size and power constraints that produce erroneous raw data for localization purposes. On-body anchors receive this data, and use it to derive the locations of diagnostic events of interest. Different Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been recently proposed for this task, yet they are currently restricted to a reference bloodstream of a resting patient. As such, they are unable to deal with the physical diversity of patients' bloodstreams and cannot provide continuous monitoring due to changes in individual patient's activities. Toward addressing these issues for the current State-of-the-Art (SotA) flow-guided localization approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose a pipeline for GNN adaptation based on individual physiological indicators including height, weight, and heart rate. Our results indicate that the proposed adaptions are beneficial in reconciling the individual differences between bloodstreams and activities.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Mapping Study on SDN Controllers for Enhancing Security in IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: The increase in Internet of Things (IoT) devices gives rise to an increase in deceptive manipulations by malicious actors. These actors should be prevented from targeting the IoT networks. Cybersecurity threats have evolved and become dynamically sophisticated, such that they could exploit any vulnerability found in IoT networks. However, with the introduction of the Software Defined Network (SDN) in the IoT networks as the central monitoring unit, IoT networks are less vulnerable and less prone to threats. %Although, the SDN itself is vulnerable to several threats.
  Objective: To present a comprehensive and unbiased overview of the state-of-the-art on IoT networks security enhancement using SDN controllers.
  Method: We review the current body of knowledge on enhancing the security of IoT networks using SDN with a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) following the established guidelines.
  Results: The SMS result comprises 33 primary studies analyzed against four major research questions. The SMS highlights current research trends and identifies gaps in the SDN-IoT network security.
  Conclusion: We conclude that the SDN controller architecture commonly used for securing IoT networks is the centralized controller architecture. However, this architecture is not without its limitations. Additionally, the predominant technique utilized for risk mitigation is machine learning.</description>

      <title>Modeling Interfering Sources in Shared Queues for Timely Computations in Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing stochastic models on age of information (AoI) focus on a single shared server serving status update packets from $N&gt;1$ sources where each packet update stream is Poisson, i.e., single-hop scenario. In the current work, we study a two-hop edge computing system for which status updates from the information sources are still Poisson but they are not immediately available at the shared edge server, but instead they need to first receive service from a transmission server dedicated to each source. For exponentially distributed and heterogeneous service times for both the dedicated servers and the edge server, and bufferless preemptive resource management, we develop an analytical model using absorbing Markov chains (AMC) for obtaining the distribution of AoI for any source in the system. Moreover, for a given tagged source, the traffic arriving at the shared server from the $N-1$ un-tagged sources, namely the interference traffic, is not Poisson any more, but is instead a Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP) whose state space grows exponentially with $N$. Therefore, we propose to employ a model reduction technique that approximates the behavior of the MMPP interference traffic with two states only, making it possible to approximately obtain the AoI statistics even for a very large number of sources. Numerical examples are presented to validate the proposed exact and approximate models.</description>

      <title>Insights from the Design Space Exploration of Flow-Guided Nanoscale Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanodevices with Terahertz (THz)-based wireless communication capabilities are providing a primer for flow-guided localization within the human bloodstreams. Such localization is allowing for assigning the locations of sensed events with the events themselves, providing benefits along the lines of early and precise diagnostics, and reduced costs and invasiveness. Flow-guided localization is still in a rudimentary phase, with only a handful of works targeting the problem. Nonetheless, the performance assessments of the proposed solutions are already carried out in a non-standardized way, usually along a single performance metric, and ignoring various aspects that are relevant at such a scale (e.g., nanodevices' limited energy) and for such a challenging environment (e.g., extreme attenuation of in-body THz propagation). As such, these assessments feature low levels of realism and cannot be compared in an objective way. Toward addressing this issue, we account for the environmental and scale-related peculiarities of the scenario and assess the performance of two state-of-the-art flow-guided localization approaches along a set of heterogeneous performance metrics such as the accuracy and reliability of localization.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Graph-based Learning Method for Sub-band Allocation in 6G Subnetworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an unsupervised approach for frequency sub-band allocation in wireless networks using graph-based learning. We consider a dense deployment of subnetworks in the factory environment with a limited number of sub-bands which must be optimally allocated to coordinate inter-subnetwork interference. We model the subnetwork deployment as a conflict graph and propose an unsupervised learning approach inspired by the graph colouring heuristic and the Potts model to optimize the sub-band allocation using graph neural networks. The numerical evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves close performance to the centralized greedy colouring sub-band allocation heuristic with lower computational time complexity. In addition, it incurs reduced signalling overhead compared to iterative optimization heuristics that require all the mutual interfering channel information. We further demonstrate that the method is robust to different network settings.</description>

      <title>Secure Targeted Message Dissemination in IoT Using Blockchain Enabled Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smart devices are considered as an integral part of Internet of Things (IoT), have an aim to make a dynamic network to exchange information, collect data, analysis, and make optimal decisions in an autonomous way to achieve more efficient, automatic, and economical services. Message dissemination among these smart devices allows adding new features, sending updated instructions, alerts or safety messages, informing the pricing information or billing amount, incentives, and installing security patches. On one hand, such message disseminations are directly beneficial to the all parties involved in the IoT system. On the other hand, due to remote procedure, smart devices, vendors, and other involved authorities might have to meet a number of security, privacy, and performance related concerns while disseminating messages among targeted devices. To this end, in this paper, we design STarEdgeChain, a security and privacy aware targeted message dissemination in IoT to show how blockchain along with advanced cryptographic techniques are devoted to address such concerns. In fact, the STarEdgeChain employs a permissioned blockchain assisted edge computing in order to expedite a single signcrypted message dissemination among targeted groups of devices, at the same time avoiding the dependency of utilizing multiple unicasting approaches. Finally, we develop a software prototype of STarEdgeChain and show it's practicability for smart devices. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/mbaqer/Blockchain-IoT</description>
