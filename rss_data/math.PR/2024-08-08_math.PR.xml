      <title>Exponential inequalities and laws of the iterated logarithm for multiple Poisson--Wiener integrals and Poisson $U$-statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove tail and moment inequalities for multiple stochastic integrals on the Poisson space and for Poisson $U$-statistics. We use them to demonstrate the Law of the Iterated Logarithm for these processes when the intensity of the Poisson process tends to infinity, with normalization depending on the degree of the multiple stochastic integral or degeneracy of the kernel defining the $U$-statistic.
  We apply our results to several classical functionals of Poisson point processes, obtaining improvements or complements of known concentration of measure results as well as new laws of the iterated logarithm. Examples include subgraph counts and power length functionals of geometric random graphs, intersections of Poisson $k$-flats, quadratic functionals of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck L\'evy process and $U$-statistics of marked processes.

      <title>On the product of correlated normal random variables and the noncentral chi-square difference distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We represent the product of two correlated normal random variables, and more generally the sum of independent copies of such random variables, as a difference of two independent noncentral chi-square random variables (which we refer to as the noncentral chi-square difference distribution). As a consequence, we obtain, amongst other results, an exact formula for the probability density function of the noncentral chi-square difference distribution, a Stein characterisation of the noncentral chi-square difference distribution, a simple formula for the moments of the sum of independent copies of the product of correlated normal random variables and an exact formula for the probability that such a random variable is negative.</description>

      <title>Comparing the Efficiency of General State Space Reversible MCMC Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review and provide new proofs of results used to compare the efficiency of estimates generated by reversible MCMC algorithms on a general state space. We provide a full proof of the formula for the asymptotic variance for real-valued functionals on $\phi$-irreducible reversible Markov chains, first introduced by Kipnis and Varadhan. Given two Markov kernels $P$ and $Q$ with stationary measure $\pi$, we say that the Markov kernel $P$ efficiency dominates the Markov kernel $Q$ if the asymptotic variance with respect to $P$ is at most the asymptotic variance with respect to $Q$ for every real-valued functional $f\in L^2(\pi)$. Assuming only a basic background in functional analysis, we prove that for two $\phi$-irreducible reversible Markov kernels $P$ and $Q$, $P$ efficiency dominates $Q$ if and only if the operator $Q-P$, where $P$ is the operator on $L^2(\pi)$ that maps $f\mapsto\int f(y)P(\cdot,dy)$ and similarly for $Q$, is positive on $L^2(\pi)$, i.e. $\langle f,(Q-P)f\rangle\geq0$ for every $f\in L^2(\pi)$. We use this result to show that reversible antithetic kernels are more efficient than i.i.d. sampling, and that efficiency dominance is a partial ordering on $\phi$-irreducible reversible Markov kernels. We also provide a proof based on that of Tierney that Peskun dominance is a sufficient condition for efficiency dominance for reversible kernels. Using these results, we show that Markov kernels formed by randomly selecting other "component" Markov kernels will always efficiency dominate another Markov kernel formed in this way, as long as the component kernels of the former efficiency dominate those of the latter. These results on the efficiency dominance of combining component kernels generalises the results on the efficiency dominance of combined chains introduced by Neal and Rosenthal from finite state spaces to general state spaces.</description>

      <title>Concentration of measure on spheres and related manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study various generalizations of concentration of measure on the unit sphere, in particular by means of log-Sobolev inequalities. First, we show Sudakov-type concentration results and local semicircular laws for weighted random matrices. A further branch addresses higher order concentration (i.\,e., concentration for non-Lipschitz functions which have bounded derivatives of higher order) for $\ell_p^n$-spheres. This is based on a type of generalized log-Sobolev inqualities referred to as $\mathrm{LS}_q$-inequalities. More generally, we prove higher order concentration bounds for probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ which satisfy an $\mathrm{LS}_q$-inequality. Finally, we derive concentration bounds for sequences of smooth symmetric functions on the Euclidean sphere which are closely related to Edgeworth-type expansions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G_{n,k}$ be the group of permutations of $\{1,2,\ldots, kn\}$ that permutes the first $k$ symbols arbitrarily, then the next $k$ symbols and so on through the last $k$ symbols. Finally the $n$ blocks of size $k$ are permuted in an arbitrary way. For $\sigma$ chosen uniformly in $G_{n,k}$, let $L_{n,k}$ be the length of the longest increasing subsequence in $\sigma$. For $k,n$ growing, we determine that the limiting mean of $L_{n,k}$ is asymptotic to $4\sqrt{nk}$. This is different from parallel variations of the Vershik-Kerov theorem for colored permutations.</description>

      <title>Constrained volume-difference percolation model on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a percolation model with restrictions on the opening of sites on the square lattice. In this model, each site $s \in \mathbb{Z}^{2}$ starts closed and an attempt to open it occurs at time $t=t_s$, where $(t_s)_{s \in \mathbb{Z}^2}$ is a sequence of independent random variables uniformly distributed on the interval $[0,1]$. The site will open if the volume difference between the two largest clusters adjacent to it is greater than or equal to a constant $r$ or if it has at most one adjacent cluster. Through numerical analysis, we determine the critical threshold $t_c(r)$ for various values of $r$, verifying that $t_c(r)$ is non-decreasing in $r$ and that there exists a critical value $r_c=5$ beyond which percolation does not occur. Additionally, when $t=1$ and $1 \leq r \leq 9$, we estimate the averages of the density of open sites, the number of distinct cluster volumes, and the volume of the largest cluster.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Bias and Kemeny's Constant in Markov Reward Processes with an Application to Markov Chain Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a unichain Markov reward process (MRP), we provide an explicit expression for the bias values in terms of mean first passage times. This result implies a generalization of known Markov chain perturbation bounds for the stationary distribution to the case where the perturbed chain is not irreducible. It further yields an improved perturbation bound in 1-norm. As a special case, Kemeny's constant can be interpreted as the translated bias in an MRP with constant reward 1, which offers an intuitive explanation why it is a constant.</description>

      <title>An existence and uniqueness theory to stochastic partial differential equations involving pseudo-differential operators driven by space-time white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to develop a new weak formulation that ensures well-posedness for a broad range of stochastic partial differential equations with pseudo-differential operators whose symbols depend only on time and spatial frequencies. The main focus of this paper is to relax the conditions on the symbols of pseudo-differential operators and data while still ensuring that the stochastic partial differential equations remain well-posed in a weak sense. Specifically, we allow symbols to be random and remove all regularity and ellipticity conditions on them. As a result, our main operators include many interesting rough operators that cannot generate any regularity gain or integrability improvement from the equations. In addition, our data do not need to be regular or possess finite stochastic moments.</description>

      <title>The marginal majority effect: when social influence produces lock-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People are influenced by the choices of others, a phenomenon observed across contexts in the social and behavioral sciences. Social influence can lock in an initial popularity advantage of an option over a higher quality alternative. Yet several experiments designed to enable social influence have found that social systems self-correct rather than lock-in. Here we identify a behavioral phenomenon that makes inferior lock-in possible, which we call the 'marginal majority effect': A discontinuous increase in the choice probability of an option as its popularity exceeds that of a competing option. We demonstrate the existence of marginal majority effects in several recent experiments and show that lock-in always occurs when the effect is large enough to offset the quality effect on choice, but rarely otherwise. Our results reconcile conflicting past empirical evidence and connect a behavioral phenomenon to the possibility of social lock-in.</description>

      <title>Traces of powers of random matrices over local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be chosen uniformly at random w.r.t. the Haar measure on the unitary group $U_n$, the unitary symplectic group $USp_{2n}$ or the orthogonal group $O_n$. Diaconis and Shashahani proved that the traces $\mathrm{tr}(M),\mathrm{tr}(M^2),\ldots,\mathrm{tr}(M^k)$ converge in distribution to independent normal random variables as $k$ is fixed and $n\to\infty$. Recently, Gorodetsky and Rodgers proved analogs for these results for matrices chosen from certain finite matrix groups. For example, let $M$ be chosen uniformly at random from $U_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$. They show that $\{\mathrm{tr}(M^i)\}_{i=1,p\nmid i}^{k}$ converge in distribution to independent uniform random variables in $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ as $k$ is fixed and $n\to\infty$.
  We prove analogs for these results over local fields. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a local field with a ring of integers $\mathcal{O}$, a uniformizer $\pi$, and a residue field of odd characteristic. Let $\mathcal{K}/\mathcal{F}$ be an unramified extension of degree $2$ with a ring of integers $\mathcal{R}$. Let $M$ be chosen uniformly at random w.r.t. the Haar measure on the unitary group $U_n(\mathcal{O})$, and fix $k$. We prove that the traces of powers $\{\mathrm{tr}(M^i)\}_{i=1,p\nmid i}^k$ converge to independent uniform random variables on $\mathcal{R}$, as $n\to\infty$. We also consider the case where $k$ may tend to infinity with $n$. We show that for some constant $c$ (coming from the mod $\pi$ distribution), the total variation distance from independent uniform random variables on $\mathcal{R}$ is $o(1)$ as $n\to\infty$, as long as $k&lt;c\cdot n$. We also consider other matrix groups over local fields and prove similar results for them. Moreover, we consider traces of powers $M^{pi}$ and traces of negative powers, and show that apart from certain necessary modular restrictions, they also equidistribute in the limit.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Convergence of Quadratically Regularized Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear programs with quadratic regularization are attracting renewed interest due to their applications in optimal transport: unlike entropic regularization, the squared-norm penalty gives rise to sparse approximations of optimal transport couplings. It is well known that the solution of a quadratically regularized linear program over any polytope converges stationarily to the minimal-norm solution of the linear program when the regularization parameter tends to zero. However, that result is merely qualitative. Our main result quantifies the convergence by specifying the exact threshold for the regularization parameter, after which the regularized solution also solves the linear program. Moreover, we bound the suboptimality of the regularized solution before the threshold. These results are complemented by a convergence rate for the regime of large regularization. We apply our general results to the setting of optimal transport, where we shed light on how the threshold and suboptimality depend on the number of data points.</description>

      <title>Sunflowers in set systems with small VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of $r$ distinct sets $\{A_1,\ldots, A_r\}$ is an $r$-sunflower if for all $1 \leqslant i &lt; j \leqslant r$ and $1 \leqslant i' &lt; j' \leqslant r$, we have $A_i \cap A_j = A_{i'} \cap A_{j'}$. Erd\H{o}s and Rado conjectured in 1960 that every family $\mathcal{H}$ of $\ell$-element sets of size at least $K(r)^\ell$ contains an $r$-sunflower, where $K(r)$ is some function that depends only on $r$. We prove that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a family of $\ell$-element sets of VC-dimension at most $d$ and $|\mathcal{H}| &gt; (C r (\log d+\log^\ast \ell))^\ell$ for some absolute constant $C &gt; 0$, then $\mathcal{H}$ contains an $r$-sunflower. This improves a recent result of Fox, Pach, and Suk. When $d=1$, we obtain a sharp bound, namely that $|\mathcal{H}| &gt; (r-1)^\ell$ is sufficient. Along the way, we establish a strengthening of the Kahn-Kalai conjecture for set families of bounded VC-dimension, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and large deviations for the linear statistics of the one-dimensional trapped Riesz gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the classical trapped Riesz gas, i.e., $N$ particles at positions $x_i$ in one dimension with a repulsive power law interacting potential $\propto 1/|x_i-x_j|^{k}$, with $k&gt;-2$, in an external confining potential of the form $V(x) \sim |x|^n$. We focus on the equilibrium Gibbs state of the gas, for which the density has a finite support $[-\ell_0/2,\ell_0/2]$. We study the fluctuations of the linear statistics ${\cal L}_N = \sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)$ in the large $N$ limit for smooth functions $f(x)$. We obtain analytic formulae for the cumulants of ${\cal L}_N$ for general $k&gt;-2$. For long range interactions, i.e. $k&lt;1$, which include the log-gas ($k \to 0$) and the Coulomb gas ($k =-1$) these are obtained for monomials $f(x)= |x|^m$. For short range interactions, i.e. $k&gt;1$, which include the Calogero-Moser model, i.e. $k=2$, we compute the third cumulant of ${\cal L}_N$ for general $f(x)$ and arbitrary cumulants for monomials $f(x)= |x|^m$. We also obtain the large deviation form of the probability distribution of ${\cal L}_N$, which exhibits an "evaporation transition" where the fluctuation of ${\cal L}_N$ is dominated by the one of the largest $x_i$. In addition, in the short range case, we extend our results to a (non-smooth) indicator function $f(x)$, obtaining thereby the higher order cumulants for the full counting statistics of the number of particles in an interval $[-L/2,L/2]$. We show in particular that they exhibit an interesting scaling form as $L/2$ approaches the edge of the gas $L/\ell_0 \to 1$, which we relate to the large deviations of the emptiness probability of the complementary interval on the real line.</description>

      <title>Local Central Limit Theorem for unbounded long-range potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the equivalence between the integral central limit theorem and the local central limit theorem for two-body potentials with long-range interactions on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\ge 1$. The spin space can be an arbitrary, possibly unbounded subset of the real axis with a suitable a-priori measure. For general unbounded spins, our method works at high-enough temperature, but for bounded spins our results hold for every temperature. Our proof relies on the control of the integrated characteristic function, which is achieved by dividing the integration into three different regions, following a standard approach proposed forty years ago by Campanino, Del Grosso and Tirozzi. The bounds required in the different regions are obtained through cluster-expansion techniques. For bounded spins, the arbitrariness of the temperature is achieved through a decimation ("dilution") technique, also introduced in the later reference.</description>

      <title>Local and global existence for the stochastic Prandtl equation driven by multiplicative noises in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the local and global existence for the stochastic Prandtl equation in two and three dimensions, which governs the velocity field inside the boundary layer that appears in the inviscid limit of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equation with non-slip boundary condition. New problem arises when establishing the well-posedness in the stochastic regime: one can never derive a pathwise control of the energy functional which is used to describe the analytic radius of the solution in the deterministic setting. To this end, we establish higher-order estimates in the conormal Sobolev spaces in order to get rid of the dependence of the analytic radius on the unknown. Three approximate schemes are constructed for solving the stochastic Prandtl equation, and a local well-posedness is obtained in a tangentially analytic and normally Sobolev-type space. Furthermore, we study the stochastic Prandtl equation driven by a tangential random diffusion, and find that the noise regularizes the equation in the sense that in both two and three dimensions, there exists a global Gevrey-2 solution with high probability and the radius growing linearly in time.</description>

Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions for a regular graph $G$ of growing degree $d$, guaranteeing a phase transition in its random subgraph $G_p$ similar to that of $G(n,p)$ when $p\cdot d\approx 1$. These conditions capture several well-studied graphs, such as (percolation on) the complete graph $K_n$, the binary hypercube $Q^d$, $d$-regular expanders, and random $d$-regular graphs. In particular, this serves as a unified proof for these (and other) cases.
  Suppose that $G$ is a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, with $d=\omega(1)$. Let $\epsilon&gt;0$ be a small constant, and let $p=\frac{1+\epsilon}{d}$. Let $y(\epsilon)$ be the survival probability of a Galton-Watson tree with offspring distribution Po$(1+\epsilon)$. We show that if $G$ satisfies a (very) mild edge expansion requirement, and if one has fairly good control on the expansion of small sets in $G$, then typically the percolated random subgraph $G_p$ contains a unique giant component of asymptotic order $y(\epsilon)n$, and all the other components in $G_p$ are of order $O(\log n/\epsilon^2)$.
  We also show that this result is tight, in the sense that if one asks for a slightly weaker control on the expansion of small sets in $G$, then there are $d$-regular graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices, where typically the second largest component is of order $\Omega(d\log (n/d))=\omega(\log n)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $d\ge 3$ be a fixed integer. Let $y:= y(p)$ be the probability that the root of an infinite $d$-regular tree belongs to an infinite cluster after $p$-bond-percolation. We show that for every constants $b,\alpha&gt;0$ and $1&lt;\lambda&lt; d-1$, there exist constants $c,C&gt;0$ such that the following holds. Let $G$ be a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, satisfying that for every $U\subseteq V(G)$ with $|U|\le \frac{n}{2}$, $e(U,U^c)\ge b|U|$ and for every $U\subseteq V(G)$ with $|U|\le \log^Cn$, $e(U)\le (1+c)|U|$. Let $p=\frac{\lambda}{d-1}$. Then, with probability tending to one as $n$ tends to infinity, the largest component $L_1$ in the random subgraph $G_p$ of $G$ satisfies $\left|1-\frac{|L_1|}{yn}\right|\le \alpha$, and all the other components in $G_p$ are of order $O\left(\frac{\lambda\log n}{(\lambda-1)^2}\right)$. This generalises (and improves upon) results for random $d$-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Log-Harnack Inequality and Bismut Formula for McKean-Vlasov SDEs with Singularities in all Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The log-Harnack inequality and Bismut formula are established for McKean-Vlasov SDEs with singularities in all (time, space, distribution) variables, where the drift satisfies an integrability condition in time-space, and the continuity in distribution may be weaker than Dini.
  The main results considerably improve the existing ones for the case where the drift is $L$-differentiable and Lipschitz continuous in distribution with respect to the 2-Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>From logarithmic delocalization of the six-vertex height function under sloped boundary conditions to weakened crossing probability estimates for the Ashkin-Teller, generalized random-cluster, and $(q_{\sigma},q_{\tau})$-cubic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To obtain Russo-Seymour-Welsh estimates for the height function of the six-vertex model under sloped boundary conditions, which can be leveraged to demonstrate that the height function logarithmically delocalizes under a broader class of boundary conditions, we formulate crossing probability estimates in strips of the square lattice and the cylinder, for parameters satisfying $a\equiv b$, $c \in [1,2]$, and $\mathrm{max} \{ a , b \} \leq c$, in which each of the first two conditions respectively relate to invariance under vertical and diagonal reflections enforced through the symmetry $\sigma \xi \geq -\xi$ for domains in strips of the square lattice, and satisfaction of FKG, for the height function and for its absolute value. To determine whether arguments for estimating crossing probabilities of the height function for flat boundary conditions from a recent work due to Duminil-Copin, Karila, Manolescu, and Oulamara remain applicable for sloped boundary conditions, from the set of possible slopes given by the interior of the set of rational points from $[-1,1] \times [-1,1]$, we analyze sloped Gibbs states, which do not have infinitely many disjointly oriented circuits. In comparison to Russo-Seymour-Welsh arguments for flat boundary conditions, arguments for sloped boundary conditions present additional complications for both planar and cylindrical settings, in which crossing events that are considered in the strip, and then extended to the annulus and cylinder, must be maintained across rectangles of large aspect ratio, in spite of the fact that some proportion of faces within the strip freeze with positive probability.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of Dyson Brownian motion on the circle and multiradial SLE0+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main motivation of the present work is to investigate the asymptotic behavior as $\kappa \to 0+$ of multiradial Schramm-Loewner evolution, SLE$_\kappa$. We show that this process with the common parameterization satisfies a finite-time large deviation principle (LDP) in the Hausdorff metric with non-negative rate function, the multiradial Loewner energy. We also characterize the large-time behavior of curves with finite energy and zero energy (whose driving functions correspond to the trigonometric Calogero-Moser system).
  The first half of this article is of independent interest regardless of SLE theory. It is devoted to proving a finite-time LDP for Dyson Brownian motion on the circle for a fixed number $n$ of particles as the coupling parameter $\beta=8/\kappa$ tends to $\infty$. To our knowledge, in the literature large deviations of Dyson Brownian motion has only been considered for fixed $\beta$ and as $n$ tends to $\infty$. While the non-Lipschitz drift precludes the application of the Freidlin-Wentzell theorem, we show that the rate function has the same form as in Freidlin-Wentzell theory for diffusions with uniformly Lipschitz drift.
  In the second half of this article, we turn to proving an LDP for multiradial SLE$_\kappa$. Here, the main technical difficulty is that the SLE$_\kappa$ curves have a common target point, preventing the usual configurational, or global, approach. Instead, we make careful use of the contraction principle from the LDP for Dyson Brownian motion (proven in the first part of the article), combined with topological results in Loewner theory: we show that finite-energy multiradial Loewner hulls are always disjoint unions of simple curves, except possibly at their common endpoint. A key to this is obtained from a derivative estimate for the radial Loewner map in terms of the energy of its driving function.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Markovian Arrivals and Service with Applications to Intermittent Overload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Almost all queueing analysis assumes i.i.d. arrivals and service. In reality, arrival and service rates fluctuate over time. In particular, it is common for real systems to intermittently experience overload, where the arrival rate temporarily exceeds the service rate, which an i.i.d. model cannot capture. We consider the MAMS system, where the arrival and service rates each vary according to an arbitrary finite-state Markov chain, allowing intermittent overload to be modeled.
  We derive the first explicit characterization of mean queue length in the MAMS system, with explicit bounds for all arrival and service chains at all loads. Our bounds are tight in heavy traffic. We prove even stronger bounds for the important special case of two-level arrivals with intermittent overload.
  Our key contribution is an extension to the drift method, based on the novel concepts of relative arrivals and relative completions. These quantities allow us to tractably capture the transient correlational effect of the arrival and service processes on the mean queue length.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strict lower bound for the diameter of a symmetric graph is proposed, which is calculable with the order ($n$) and other local parameters of the graph such as the degree, even girth $g$ ($\geq 4$), and number of $g$-cycles traversing a vertex, which are easily determined by inspecting a small portion of the graph (unless the girth is large). It is applied to the symmetric Cayley graphs of the Rubik's Cube groups of various sizes and metrics, yielding slightly tighter lower bounds than those of random $k$-regular graphs proposed by Bollob\'{a}s and de la Vega, which range from 60% to 77% of the correct diameters of large-$n$ graphs.</description>
