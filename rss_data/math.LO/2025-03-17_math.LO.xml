      <title>A Natural Transformation between the Completeness and Compactness Theorems in Classical Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a categorical framework that reveals the deep relationship between the completeness and compactness theorems in classical logic. Although these theorems have traditionally been approached by distinct methods, our study shows that they are naturally equivalent through the lens of category theory. By introducing the basic concepts of categories, functors, and natural transformations, we establish that the model constructions derived from each theorem can be viewed as functors from the category of logical theories to the category of their models. In particular, one functor is defined using the Henkin construction from the completeness theorem, while another is defined based on the finite satisfiability condition of the compactness theorem. We then prove the existence of a natural transformation between these two functors, which demonstrates that the models produced by each method are isomorphic in a canonical way. This result not only bridges the gap between the proof-theoretic and model-theoretic perspectives but also provides a unified, conceptual framework that can be extended to other areas of mathematical logic. Our exposition is designed to be accessible, offering insight into both the categorical formalism and its implications for understanding fundamental logical theorems.</description>

      <title>Domination, fibrations and splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with finite rank stability theory, and more precisely two classical ways to decompose a type using minimal types. The first is its domination equivalence to a Morley power of minimal types, and the second its semi-minimal analysis, both of which are useful in applications. Our main interest is to explore how these two decompositions are connected. We prove that neither determine the other in general, and give more precise connections using various notions from the model theory literature such as uniform internality, proper fibrations and disintegratedness.</description>

      <title>Doubly partially conservative sentences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of the present paper is to analyze several variants of Solovay's theorem on the existence of doubly partially conservative sentences. First, we investigate $\Theta$ sentences that are doubly $(\Gamma, \Lambda)$-conservative over $T$ for several triples $(\Theta, \Gamma, \Lambda)$. Among other things, we prove that the existence of a $\Delta_{n+1}(\mathsf{PA})$ sentence that is doubly $(\Sigma_n, \Sigma_n)$-conservative over $T$ is equivalent to the $\Sigma_{n+1}$-inconsistency of $T$ over $\mathsf{PA}$. Secondly, we study $\Theta$ sentences that are hereditarily doubly $(\Gamma, \Lambda)$-conservative over $T$ for several triples $(\Theta, \Gamma, \Lambda)$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Martin's remarking proof of $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_2$-determinacy from an iterable rank-into-rank embedding highlighted the connection between large cardinals and determinacy. In this paper, we isolate a large cardinal object called a measurable dilator from Martin's proof of $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_2$-determinacy, which captures the structural essence of Martin's proof of $\mathbf{\Pi}^1_2$-determinacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue to develop a research line initiated in \cite{wollic22}, studying I/O logic from an algebraic approach based on subordination algebras. We introduce the classes of slanted (co-)Heyting algebras as equivalent presentations of distributive lattices with subordination relations. Interpreting subordination relations as the algebraic counterparts of input/output relations on formulas yields (slanted) modal operations with interesting deontic interpretations. We study the theory of slanted and co-slanted Heyting algebras, develop algorithmic correspondence and inverse correspondence, and present some deontically meaningful axiomatic extensions and examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study groups definable in existentially closed geometric fields with commuting derivations. Our main result is that such a group can be definably embedded in a group interpretable in the underlying geometric field. Compared to earlier work of the first two authors toguether with K. Peterzil, the novelty is that we also deal with infinite dimensional groups.</description>

      <title>Distribution-Free Modal Logics: Sahlqvist -- Van Benthem Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extension and generalization of Sahlqvist--Van Benthem correspondence to the case of distribution-free modal logic, with, or without negation and/or implication connectives. We follow a reductionist strategy, reducing the correspondence problem at hand to the same problem, but for a suitable system of sorted modal logic (the modal companion of the distribution-free system). The reduction, via a fully abstract translation, builds on duality between normal lattice expansions and sorted residuated frames with relations (a generalization of classical Kripke frames with relations). The approach is scalable and it can be generalized to other systems, with or without distribution, such as distributive modal logic, or substructural logics with, or without additional modal operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown, from $\sigma$-centered Martin's Axiom, that there exists a proper dense subgroup of the symmetric group on a countably infinite set whose natural action on sufficiently flexible relational structures is transitive. This allows us to give consistent positive answers to some questions of Peter M. Neumann from the 1980s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hurewicz property is a classical generalization of $\sigma$-compactness and Sierpi\'nski sets (whose existence follows from CH) are standard examples of non-$\sigma$-compact Hurewicz spaces. We show, solving a problem stated by Szewczak and Tsaban, that for each Sierpi\'nski set S of cardinality at least $\mathfrak b$ there is a Hurewicz space H with $S\times H$ not Hurewicz. Some other questions in the literature concerning this topic are also answered.</description>

      <title>Propositional Dynamic Logic has Craig Interpolation: a tableau-based proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Propositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) has the Craig Interpolation Property. This question has been open for many years. Three proof attempts were published, but later criticized in the literature or retracted. Our proof is based on the main ideas from Borzechowski (1988). We define a cyclic tableau system for PDL with a loading mechanism to recognize successful repeats. For this system, we show soundness and completeness via a game. To show interpolation, we modify Maehara's method to work for tableaux with repeats: we first define pre-interpolants at each node, and then use a quasi-tableau to define interpolants for clusters (strongly connected components). In different terms, our method solves the fixpoint equations that characterize the desired interpolants, and the method ensures that the solutions to these equations can be expressed within PDL. The proof is constructive and we show how to compute interpolants. We also make available a Haskell implementation of the proof system that provides interpolants. Lastly, we mention ongoing work to formally verify this proof in the interactive theorem prover Lean, and several questions for future work.</description>

      <title>Guessing genericity -- looking at parametrized diamonds from a different perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study a family of axioms that closely follows the pattern of parametrized diamonds, studied by Moore, Hru\v{s}\'ak, and D\v{z}amonja in [13]. However, our approach appeals to model theoretic / forcing theoretic notions, rather than pure combinatorics. The main goal of the paper is to exhibit a surprising, close connection between seemingly very distinct principles. As an application, we show that forcing with a measure algebra preserves (a variant of) $\diamondsuit(\mathfrak{d})$, improving an old result of M. Hru\v{s}\'ak.</description>

      <title>Tree-like graphings, wallings, and median graphings of equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove several results showing that every locally finite Borel graph whose large-scale geometry is "tree-like" induces a treeable equivalence relation. In particular, our hypotheses hold if each component of the original graph either has bounded tree-width or is quasi-isometric to a tree, answering a question of Tucker-Drob. In the latter case, we moreover show that there exists a Borel quasi-isometry to a Borel forest, under the additional assumption of (componentwise) bounded degree. We also extend these results on quasi-treeings to Borel proper metric spaces. In fact, our most general result shows treeability of countable Borel equivalence relations equipped with an abstract wallspace structure on each class obeying some local finiteness conditions, which we call a proper walling. The proof is based on the Stone duality between proper wallings and median graphs, i.e., CAT(0) cube complexes. Finally, we strengthen the conclusion of treeability in these results to hyperfiniteness in the case where the original graph has one (selected) end per component, generalizing the same result for trees due to Dougherty--Jackson--Kechris.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I provide an overview of some of Sundholm's remarks on the history and philosophy of logic. In particular, I focus on Sundholm's proposal to explain meaning with no object-language/metalanguage distinction, and to provide a consequently contentual approach to formalisms for proofs. When applied to Gentzen's Natural Deduction in its two 1935 and 1936 variants, this triggers a reading of each variant as pointing to one of the poles in the distinction between proof-objects and proof-acts, also introduced by Sundholm. I suggest that the basis of this picture is given by a Martin-Loefian reading of the notion of analytic assertion.</description>

      <title>Irregular triads in 3-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01737v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past several years, numerous authors have explored model theoretically motivated combinatorial conditions that ensure that a graph has an efficient regular decomposition in the sense of Szemer\'edi. In this paper we set out a research program that explores a corresponding set of questions for 3-uniform hypergraphs, a setting in which useful notions of regularity are significantly more intricate.
  The main results in this paper concern certain combinatorial properties which arose as natural higher-order generalizations of the order property in parallel work of the authors in the arithmetic setting. Interpreted in the context of 3-uniform hypergraphs, these are tightly connected to the nature of irregular triads. Specifically, we show that a hereditary property of 3-uniform hypergraphs admits regular decompositions with so-called "linear error" if and only if it does not have the functional order property.
  Along the way, we show that a hereditary property of 3-uniform hypergraphs is homogeneous (i.e. all regular triads have density near $0$ or near $1$) if and only it has bounded $\textrm{VC}_2$-dimension. This provides a quantitative version of a recent result of Chernikov and Towsner.
  We also address several questions arising from prior work on tame regularity in hypergraphs. In particular, we characterize the hereditary properties of $3$-uniform hypergraphs admitting the type of regular partitions appearing in work of Fox et al. as those that have bounded slicewise $\textrm{VC}$-dimension. This is again analogous to a recent non-quantitative result of Chernikov and Towsner.</description>

      <title>On a Rice theorem for dynamical properties of SFTs on groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with undecidable domino problem, such as $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We prove that all nontrivial dynamical properties for sofic $G$-subshifts are undecidable, that this is not true for $G$-SFTs, and an undecidability result for dynamical properties of $G$-SFTs similar to the Adian-Rabin theorem. Furthermore we prove a Rice-like result for dynamical invariants asserting that every computable real-valued invariant for $G$-SFTs that is monotone by disjoint unions and products is constant.</description>
