      <title>Electronic structure of topological defects in the pair-density-wave superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair density Waves (PDW) are a inhomogeneous superconducting states whose Cooper pairs posses a finite momentum resulting in a oscillatory gap in space, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. There is growing evidence for the existence of PDW superconducting order in many strongly correlated materials particularly in the cuprate superconductios and in several other different types of systems. A feature of the PDW state is that inherently it has a CDW as a composite order associated with it. Here we study the structure of the electronic topological defects of the PDW, paying special attention to the half-vortex and its electronic structure that can be detected in STM experiments. We discuss tell-tale signatures of the defects in violations of inversion symmetry, in the excitation spectrum and their spectral functions in the presence of topological defects. We discuss the "Fermi surface" topology of Bogoliubov quasi-particle of the PDW phases and we briefly discuss the role of quasi-particle-interference.</description>

      <title>Time reversal symmetry breaking and zero magnetic field Josephson diode effect in Dirac semimetal Cd3As2-mediated asymmetric SQUIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A zero-magnetic-field Josephson diode effect (JDE) is observed in an asymmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) mediated by Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Herein it is shown that phase coupling between the surface and bulk superconducting channels, a unique phenomenon recently identified in the observations of fractional Josephson effect and Leggett modes in Cd3As2, can break time reversal symmetry (TRS) and, therefore, give rise to the zero-field JDE. It is identified that the efficiency of the JDE can be readily controlled by varying the geometry of the Josephson junction (JJ) arms in the SQUIDs, thus providing an explanation of different JDE behaviors in two SQUIDs examined in this work. Our results are anticipated to have important implications in superconducting electronic circuit applications.</description>

      <title>Phase dynamics of tunnel Al-based ferromagnetic Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By measuring the current-voltage characteristics and the switching current distributions as a function of temperature, we have investigated the phase dynamics of Al tunnel ferromagnetic Josephson junctions (JJs), designed to fall in the typical range of parameters of state-of-the-art transmons, providing evidence of phase diffusion processes. The comparison with the experimental outcomes on non-magnetic JJs with nominally the same electrodynamical parameters demonstrates that the introduction of ferromagnetic barriers does not cause any sizeable detrimental effect, and supports the notion of including tunnel ferromagnetic JJs in qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity-tuned band topology and superconductivity in two-dimensional materials and related heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity, band topology, and superconductivity are respectively local, global, and macroscopic properties of quantum materials, and understanding their mutual couplings offers unique opportunities for exploring rich physics and enhanced functionalities. In this mini-review, we attempt to highlight some of the latest advances in this vibrant area, focusing in particular on ferroelectricity-tuned superconductivity and band topology in two-dimensional (2D) materials and related heterostructures. We will first present results from predictive studies of the delicate couplings between ferroelectricity and topology or superconductivity based on first-principles calculations and phenomenological modeling, with ferroelectricity-enabled topological superconductivity as an appealing objective. Next, we will cover the latest advances on experimental studies of ferroelectricity-tuned superconductivity based on different 2D materials or van der Waals heterostructures. Finally, as perspectives, we will outline schemes that may allow to materialize new types of 2D systems that simultaneously harbor ferroelectricity and superconductivity, or that may lead to enhanced ferroelectric superconductivity, ferroelectric topological superconductivity, and new types of superconducting devices such as superconducting diodes.</description>

      <title>Pressurized phase transition cascade in BaMn$_2$P$_2$ and BaMn$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural analogue of iron-based superconductors the BaMn$_2$P$_2$ and BaMn$_2$As$_2$ compounds under hydrostatic pressure upto 140 GPa were studied within the framework of DFT+U. The transition from an antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator to an antiferromagnetic metal is observed under pressure of 6.4 GPa for BaMn$_2$P$_2$ and 8.3 GPa for BaMn$_2$As$_2$. This second order phase transition to the AFM metallic state provides an appropriate normal state for possible superconductivity in these materials. Moreover, a further increase in pressure leads to a series of first order magnetostructural phase transitions between different antiferromagnetic phases, then to a ferromagnetic metal and finally to a nonmagnetic metal. In case of doping these compounds could potentially be a superconductors under pressure (above 6-8 GPa) with critical temperature growing under pressure.</description>

      <title>Majorana zero modes under electron correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a systematic investigation of the correlated topological superconductors (TSCs), especially their non-trivial Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Compared to the non-interacting MZMs, the emerged correlated MZMs become projected MZMs. To prove this, we study the topological superconducting nanowire under the Hubbard and Hatsugai-Kohmoto interactions. Both of them become correlated TSCs under a magnetic field. Their topological properties are numerically computed by the Wilson loop and entanglement spectrum. We successfully extract the projected MZMs connecting the ground state and excited state through exact diagonalization. We also extend our results to the spinful Kitaev chain. Our results can provide a new perspective and understanding of the correlated MZMs.</description>

      <title>Theory of Correlated Insulator(s) and Superconductor at $\nu=1$ in Twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of a superconducting phase, an intertwined insulating phase, and a continuous transition between the two at a commensurate filling of $\nu=1$ in bilayers of twisted WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$) at $\theta=3.65^0$ raises a number of intriguing questions about the origin of this phenomenology. Starting with a simplified three-orbital model of tWSe$_2$, including an on-site and nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, as well as a chiral-exchange interaction, we discuss the possibility of a displacement-field induced direct superconductor to quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator transition at $\nu=1$ using parton mean-field theory. We discuss the nature of these correlated insulators, their expected evolution with the displacement-field, and their phenomenological properties. Further experiments will likely help unravel the mysteries tied to this fascinating experimental platform.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensional Antiferromagnetic Spin Fluctuations in the Spin-triplet Superconductor Candidate CeRh$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tetragonal heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ ($T_{\rm c}=0.3$ K) exhibits an exceptionally high critical field of 14 T for $\textbf{B} \parallel \textbf{c}$. It undergoes a field-driven first-order phase transition between superconducting (SC) states, potentially transitioning from spin-singlet to spin-triplet superconductivity. To elucidate the underlying pairing mechanism, we probe spin fluctuations in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ using neutron scattering. We find dynamic $(\pi,\pi)$ antiferromagnetic spin correlations with an anisotropic quasi-two-dimensional correlation volume. Our data place an upper limit of 0.31 $\mu_{\rm B}$ on the staggered magnetization of corresponding N\'{e}el orders at $T=0.08$ K. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, treating Ce $4f$ electrons as core states, show that the AFM wave vector connects significant areas of the Fermi surface. Our findings show the dominant excitations in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ for $\hbar\omega&lt; 1.2$~meV are magnetic and indicate superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ is mediated by AFM spin fluctuations associated with a proximate quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Field Theory for Superconducting Branes and Generalized Particle-Vortex Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a field theory of closed $p$-brane $C_p^{}$ interacting with a $(p+1)$-form gauge field $A_{p+1}^{}$. This is a generalization of the Ginzburg-Landau theory (Abelian-Higgs model) for superconducting particles to higher-dimensional superconducting branes. A higher-form gauge invariant action is constructed by utilizing the Area derivative, which is a higher-dimensional generalization of the ordinary derivative. We find that the fundamental phenomena of superconductivity, such as the Meisser effect, topological defects, topological order, are naturally extended in the brane-field theory. We explicitly construct a topologically non-trivial static configuration that is characterized by the first homotopy group. Then, we calculate the low-energy effective theory in the presence of the topological defect and find that it is described by a BF-type topological field theory coupled with the world-volume of the topological defect. We also conjecture an infra-red duality between the superconducting brane-field model and dual brane-field model with a global $\mathrm{U}(1)$ higher-form symmetry as a generalization of the Particle-Vortex duality.</description>

      <title>Correlated Electronic Structure and Incipient Flat Bands of the Kagome Superconductor CsCr3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials exhibit many novel phenomena emerging from the interplay between lattice geometry, electronic structure, and topology. A prime example is the vanadium-based kagome materials AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs) with superconductivity and unconventional charge-density wave (CDW). More interestingly, the substitution of vanadium by chromium further introduces magnetism and enhances the correlation effect in CsCr3Sb5 which likewise exhibits superconductivity under pressure and competing density-wave state. Here we systematically investigate the electronic structure of CsCr3Sb5 using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (APRES) and ab-initio calculations. Overall, the measured electronic structure agrees with the theoretical calculation. Remarkably, Cr 3d orbitals exhibit incoherent electronic states and contribute to incipient flat bands close to the Fermi level. The electronic structure shows a minor change across the magnetic transition at 55 K, suggesting a weak interplay between the local magnetic moment and itinerant electrons. Furthermore, we reveal a drastic enhancement of the electron scattering rate across the magnetic transition, which is relevant to the semiconducting-like transport property of the system at high temperatures. Our results suggest that CsCr3Sb5 is a strongly correlated Hund's metal with incipient flat bands near the Fermi level, which provides an electronic basis for understanding its novel properties in comparison to the non-magnetic and weakly correlated AV3Sb5.</description>

      <title>Quenched pair breaking by interlayer correlations as a key to superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with $T_\mathrm{c} \simeq 80~\mathrm{K}$ under high pressure opens up a new route to high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. This material realizes a bilayer square lattice model featuring a strong interlayer hybridization unlike many unconventional superconductors. A key question in this regard concerns how electronic correlations driven by the interlayer hybridization affect the low-energy electronic structure and the concomitant superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate using a cluster dynamical mean-field theory that the interlayer electronic correlations (IECs) induce a Lifshitz transition resulting in a change of Fermi surface topology. By solving an appropriate gap equation, we further show that the leading pairing instability, $s \pm$-wave, is enhanced by the IECs. The underlying mechanism is the quenching of a strong ferromagnetic channel, resulting from the Lifshitz transition driven by the IECs. Based on this picture, we provide a possible reason of why superconductivity emerges only under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Cavity engineered phonon-mediated superconductivity in MgB$_2$ from first principles quantum electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed $\textit{ab initio}$ quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong-light matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be enhanced by $\approx 73\%$ ($\approx 40\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity. The results highlight that strong-light matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection, Andreev states, and long ballistic SNS junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis in the present paper is based on the most known concept introduced by the brilliant physicist Alexander Andreev: Andreev bound states in a normal metal sandwiched between two superconductors. The paper presents results of direct calculations of {\em ab initio} expressions for the currents in a long ballistic SNS junction. The expressions are expanded in $1/L$ ($L$ is the thickness of the normal layer). The main contribution $\propto 1/L$ to the current agrees with the results obtained in the past, but the analysis suggests a new physical picture of the charge transport through the junction free from the problem with the charge conservation law. The saw-tooth current-phase relation at $T=0$ directly follows from the Galilean invariance of the Bogolyubov-de Gennes equations proved in the paper. The proof is valid for any variation of the energy gap in space if the Andreev reflection is the only scattering process. The respective roles of the contributions of bound and continuum states to the current are clarified. They depend on the junction dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum dynamics of spin-orbit coupled Andreev states in a Zeeman field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework to describe the quantum many-body dynamics of Andreev states in Josephson junctions with spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic Zeeman field. In such cases, employing a doubled Nambu spinor description is technically advantageous but one then has to be careful to avoid double-counting problems. By deriving the Lindblad master equation in the socalled excitation picture, we show that a physically consistent many-body theory free from doublecounting problems follows. We apply our formalism to a study of dynamical parity stabilization of the Andreev sector at intermediate times after an initial microwave pulse, in particular addressing the combined effects of spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field.</description>
