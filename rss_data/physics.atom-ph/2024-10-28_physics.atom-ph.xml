      <title>Ultra precise determination of Cs($nS_{1/2}$) and Cs($nD_J$) quantum defects for sensing and computing: Evaluation of core contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make absolute frequency measurements of Cs Rydberg transitions, $\vert 6S_{1/2}, F=3 \rangle \rightarrow \vert nS_{1/2}~(n=23\rm{-}90)\rangle$ and $\vert nD_{3/2,5/2}~(n=21\rm{-}90)\rangle$, with an accuracy of less than $ 72\,\rm kHz$. The quantum defect parameters for the measured Rydberg series are the most precise obtained to date. The quantum defect series is terminated at $\delta_4$, showing that prior fits requiring higher order quantum defects reflect uncertainties in the observations. The precision of the measured quantum defects allow for the calculation of Rydberg electric-dipole transitions and fine-structure intervals extrapolated from high principal quantum numbers, to rival that of sophisticated many-body relativistic calculations carried out at low Rydberg principal quantum numbers. We quantitatively predict the contributions to the quantum defect parameters from core polarization and core penetration of Cs inner shell electrons. A new value for the ionization energy, consistent across the $ nS_{1/2}$ and $ nD_{3/2,5/2}$ Rydberg series, is reported at $31406.467 751 48 (14)~\rm{cm}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Development of a high-power ultraviolet laser system and observation of fast coherent Rydberg excitation of ytterbium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the development of a high-power ultraviolet laser system operating at a wavelength of 325 nm for Rydberg excitation from the ${}^3\mathrm{P}_2$ state of ytterbium. Utilizing a two-stage frequency doubling scheme, we achieved an output power exceeding 800 mW. The system effectively suppresses frequency noise in the MHz range, which is critical for achieving high Rydberg excitation fidelity, through the use of a filtering cavity. Using this system, we demonstrated coherent excitation of the $(6s71s){}^3\mathrm{S}_1$ Rydberg state with a Rabi frequency of 2.13(3) MHz. Combined with our successful manipulations on the ${}^1\mathrm{S}_0-{}^3\mathrm{P}_2$ transition, this work represents a foundational step toward achieving high-fidelity Rydberg excitation, enabling advancements in quantum simulation and computing with neutral atom arrays.</description>

      <title>The Advantages of Polarization Control in RABBITT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19655v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The RABBITT setup is theoretically studied for various combinations of XUV and IR field components polarization: 'linear+linear', `linear+circular' with crossed propagation directions, and `circular+circular' with parallel propagation directions. The general properties of photoelectron angular distributions and their responses to the variation of the IR pulse delay are studied. Numerical simulations are performed for the neon valence shell ionization into the region of structureless continuum using two approaches based on time dependent perturbation theory and solution of rate equations. To distinguish between "geometrical" governed by fields' polarization and spectroscopic features, additional analysis for the case of $s$-shell ionization is presented.</description>

      <title>The neutrino force at all length scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model predicts a long-range force mediated by a pair of neutrinos, known as "the neutrino force." We derive an expression for this force that is valid for all $r$. For large $r$, it reduces to the known $G_F^2/r^5$ form, while for small $r$, it scales as $1/r$. We explore the implications of this result for atomic parity violation (APV) experiments. A key feature of the neutrino force is that it is a long-range effect, meaning it cannot be treated as a correction to the tree-level exchange $Z$ diagram. We calculate the effects in muonium and positronium, finding that the neutrino force contributes about 4% and 16%, respectively, compared to the leading $ Z$ exchange. This indicates a significant impact on APV, with important implications for detecting the neutrino force and measuring the weak mixing angle in APV experiments.</description>

      <title>Coherent and incoherent light scattering by single-atom wavepackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study light scattering of single atoms in free space and discuss the results in terms of atom-photon entanglement and which-way information. Using ultracold atoms released from an optical lattice, we realize a Gedanken experiment which interferes single photons scattering off of Heisenberg uncertainty-limited wavepackets. We unify the free-space and trapped-atom pictures by measuring the light scattered during wavepacket expansion and show the coherence properties of the scattered light is independent of the presence of the trap. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of using atomic Mott insulators to create single-atom wavepackets for fundamental studies.</description>

      <title>Controlled dissipation for Rydberg atom experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple technique for adding controlled dissipation to Rydberg atom experiments. In our experiments we excite cold rubidium atoms in a magneto-optical trap to $70$-S Rydberg states, whilst simultaneously inducing forced dissipation by resonantly coupling the Rydberg state to a hyperfine level of the short-lived $6$-P state. The resulting effective dissipation can be varied in strength and switched on and off during a single experimental cycle.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation of Spin-Boson Models with Structured Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14624v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin-boson model, involving spins interacting with a bath of quantum harmonic oscillators, is a widely used representation of open quantum systems. Trapped ions present a natural platform for simulating the quantum dynamics of such models, thanks to the presence of both high quality internal qubit states and the motional modes of the ions that can simulate the relevant quantum degrees of freedom. In our work, we extend the previous body of work that focused on coherent coupling of the spins and bosons to perform quantum simulations with structured dissipative baths using the motional states of trapped ions. We demonstrate the capability for adjusting the bath's temperature and continuous spectral density by adding randomness to fully programmable control parameters. Subsequently, we simulate the dynamics of various spin-boson models with noise spectral densities constructed from coupling to several dissipative harmonic oscillator modes. The experimental outcomes closely align with theoretical predictions, indicating successful simulation of open quantum systems using a trapped-ion system.</description>
