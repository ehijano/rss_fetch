      <title>Regional Weather Variable Predictions by Machine Learning with Near-Surface Observational and Atmospheric Numerical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and timely regional weather prediction is vital for sectors dependent on weather-related decisions. Traditional prediction methods, based on atmospheric equations, often struggle with coarse temporal resolutions and inaccuracies. This paper presents a novel machine learning (ML) model, called MiMa (short for Micro-Macro), that integrates both near-surface observational data from Kentucky Mesonet stations (collected every five minutes, known as Micro data) and hourly atmospheric numerical outputs (termed as Macro data) for fine-resolution weather forecasting. The MiMa model employs an encoder-decoder transformer structure, with two encoders for processing multivariate data from both datasets and a decoder for forecasting weather variables over short time horizons. Each instance of the MiMa model, called a modelet, predicts the values of a specific weather parameter at an individual Mesonet station. The approach is extended with Re-MiMa modelets, which are designed to predict weather variables at ungauged locations by training on multivariate data from a few representative stations in a region, tagged with their elevations. Re-MiMa (short for Regional-MiMa) can provide highly accurate predictions across an entire region, even in areas without observational stations. Experimental results show that MiMa significantly outperforms current models, with Re-MiMa offering precise short-term forecasts for ungauged locations, marking a significant advancement in weather forecasting accuracy and applicability.</description>

      <title>Global Estimation of Subsurface Eddy Kinetic Energy of Mesoscale Eddies Using a Multiple-input Residual Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oceanic eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is a key quantity for measuring the intensity of mesoscale eddies and for parameterizing eddy effects in ocean climate models. Three decades of satellite altimetry observations allow a global assessment of sea surface information. However, the subsurface EKE with spatial filter has not been systematically studied due to the sparseness of subsurface observational data. The subsurface EKE can be inferred both theoretically and numerically from sea surface observations but is limited by the issue of decreasing correlation with sea surface variables as depth increases. In this work, inspired by the Taylor-series expansion of subsurface EKE, a multiple-input neural network approach is proposed to reconstruct the subsurface monthly mean EKE from sea surface variables and subsurface climatological variables (e.g., horizontal filtered velocity gradients). Four neural networks are trained on a high-resolution global ocean reanalysis dataset, namely, surface-input fully connected neural network model (FCNN), surface-input Residual neural network model (ResNet), multiple-input fully connected neural network model (MI-FCNN), and multiple-input residual neural network model (MI-ResNet). The proposed MI-FCNN and MI-ResNet models integrate the surface input variables and the vertical profiles of subsurface variables. The MI-ResNet model outperforms the FCNN, ResNet, and MI-FCNN models, and traditional physics-based models in both regional and global reconstruction of subsurface EKE in the upper 2000 m. In addition, the MI-ResNet model performs well for both regional and global observational data based on transfer learning. These findings reveal the potential of the MI-ResNet model for efficient and accurate reconstruction of subsurface oceanic variables.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal analysis of extreme winter temperatures in Ireland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse extreme daily minimum temperatures in winter months over the island of Ireland from 1950-2022. We model the marginal distributions of extreme winter minima using a generalised Pareto distribution (GPD), capturing temporal and spatial non-stationarities in the parameters of the GPD. We investigate two independent temporal non-stationarities in extreme winter minima. We model the long-term trend in magnitude of extreme winter minima as well as short-term, large fluctuations in magnitude caused by anomalous behaviour of the jet stream. We measure magnitudes of spatial events with a carefully chosen risk function and fit an r-Pareto process to extreme events exceeding a high-risk threshold. Our analysis is based on synoptic data observations courtesy of Met \'Eireann and the Met Office. We show that the frequency of extreme cold winter events is decreasing over the study period. The magnitude of extreme winter events is also decreasing, indicating that winters are warming, and apparently warming at a faster rate than extreme summer temperatures. We also show that extremely cold winter temperatures are warming at a faster rate than non-extreme winter temperatures. We find that a climate model output previously shown to be informative as a covariate for modelling extremely warm summer temperatures is less effective as a covariate for extremely cold winter temperatures. However, we show that the climate model is useful for informing a non-extreme temperature model.</description>

      <title>Neural general circulation models optimized to predict satellite-based precipitation observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate models struggle to accurately simulate precipitation, particularly extremes and the diurnal cycle. Here, we present a hybrid model that is trained directly on satellite-based precipitation observations. Our model runs at 2.8$^\circ$ resolution and is built on the differentiable NeuralGCM framework. The model demonstrates significant improvements over existing general circulation models, the ERA5 reanalysis, and a global cloud-resolving model in simulating precipitation. Our approach yields reduced biases, a more realistic precipitation distribution, improved representation of extremes, and a more accurate diurnal cycle. Furthermore, it outperforms the mid-range precipitation forecast of the ECMWF ensemble. This advance paves the way for more reliable simulations of current climate and demonstrates how training on observations can be used to directly improve GCMs.</description>

      <title>A Staged Deep Learning Approach to Spatial Refinement in 3D Temporal Atmospheric Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution spatiotemporal simulations effectively capture the complexities of atmospheric plume dispersion in complex terrain. However, their high computational cost makes them impractical for applications requiring rapid responses or iterative processes, such as optimization, uncertainty quantification, or inverse modeling. To address this challenge, this work introduces the Dual-Stage Temporal Three-dimensional UNet Super-resolution (DST3D-UNet-SR) model, a highly efficient deep learning model for plume dispersion prediction. DST3D-UNet-SR is composed of two sequential modules: the temporal module (TM), which predicts the transient evolution of a plume in complex terrain from low-resolution temporal data, and the spatial refinement module (SRM), which subsequently enhances the spatial resolution of the TM predictions. We train DST3DUNet- SR using a comprehensive dataset derived from high-resolution large eddy simulations (LES) of plume transport. We propose the DST3D-UNet-SR model to significantly accelerate LES simulations of three-dimensional plume dispersion by three orders of magnitude. Additionally, the model demonstrates the ability to dynamically adapt to evolving conditions through the incorporation of new observational data, substantially improving prediction accuracy in high-concentration regions near the source.

      <title>On the attribution of weather events to climate change using a fit to extreme value distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Changes in extreme weather events are a potentially important aspect of anthropogenic climate change (ACC), yet, are difficult to attribute to ACC because the record length is often similar to, or shorter than, extreme-event return periods. This study is motivated by the ``World Weather Attribution Project'' (WWA) and, specifically, their approach of fitting extreme value distribution functions to local observations. The approach calculates the dependence of distribution parameters on global mean surface temperature (GMST) and uses this dependence to attribute extreme events to ACC. Applying this method to preindustrial climate simulations with no time-varying greenhouse gas forcing, we still find a strong dependence of distribution parameters on GMST. This dependence results from internal climate variability (e.g., ENSO) affecting both extreme events and GMST. Therefore, dependence on GMST does not necessarily imply an effect of ACC on extremes. We further consider for these three cases whether an extreme value, normal, or log-normal distribution better represents the data; if a GMST-dependence of distribution parameters is justified using a likelihood ratio test; and if a meaningful attribution is possible given uncertainties in GMST dependence. In one case we find that an attribution of Australia's 2020--2021 Bushfires to ACC is difficult due to the effects of internal variability. In another involving the 2019--2021 drought in Madagascar we find that the small number of available data points precludes a meaningful attribution analysis. Overall, we find that the effects of internal climate variability on GMST and the uncertain relationship between GMST and regional extremes may lead to inaccurate attribution conclusions using the WWA approach.</description>

      <title>Friday the 13th Hailstorm in the province of Bulacan, Philippines (13 August 2021): A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This case study presents a thorough investigation of the environmental setup that led to the hail-producing severe storm that impacted the municipality of Norzagaray and City of San Jose Del Monte, including other nearby areas, in the province of Bulacan on the afternoon of August 13, 2021. During this period, 2-5 cm and potentially as large as $\sim$8 cm diameter hail was reported over these locations of Bulacan. For this purpose, the combination of HIMAWARI-8 AHI, PLDN and its flash counts, and meteorological indices; synoptic, thermodynamic, and kinematic indices, calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis are utilized to understand the nature of the hail event. In the morning, the pre-convective environment was comprised by a warm inversion layer that inhibited storm initiation, until the arrival of ample moisture and convective heating in the afternoon. By the afternoon, model sounding analysis revealed that the environment transitioned into uncapped profile with steep low-level lapse rate owing to warm, moist south-westerly wind flow from the Manila Bay in the lower troposphere and north-easterlies aloft crossing the SMMR induced by a weak low-pressure system located in the eastern Philippine Sea, with minimal turning on the wind profile. This promoted low-level convergence within the area of interest and build up of instability. The updraft associated with convectively unstable atmosphere, sufficient cloud-layer bulk shear, and storm nudging at its maturing phase countered entrainment-driven dilution and aided the growth of ice crystals by rapid collection of supercooled cloud liquid particles, which ultimately led to formation of hailstones.</description>

      <title>Dual Euler--Poincar\'e/Lie--Poisson formulation of subinertial stratified thermal ocean flow with identification of Casimirs as Noether quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric structure of a quasigeostrophic approximation to a recently introduced reduced-gravity thermal rotating shallow-water model that accounts for stratification. Specifically, it considers a low-frequency approximation of a model for flow above the ocean thermocline, governed by primitive equations with buoyancy variations in both horizontal and vertical directions. Like the thermal model, the stratified variant generates circulation patterns reminiscent of submesoscale instabilities visible in satellite images. An improvement is its ability to model mixed-layer restratification due to baroclinic instability.
  The primary contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that the model is derived from an Euler--Poincar\'e variational principle, culminating in a Kelvin--Noether theorem, previously established solely for the primitive-equation parent model. The model's Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure, earlier obtained through direct calculation, is shown to result from a Legendre transform with the associated geometry elucidated by identifying the relevant momentum map.
  Another significant contribution of this paper is the identification of the Casimirs of the Lie--Poisson system, including a newly found weaker Casimir family forming the kernel of the Lie--Poisson bracket, which results in potential vorticity evolution independent of buoyancy details as it advects under the flow. These conservation laws related to particle relabeling symmetry are explicitly linked to Noether quantities from the Euler--Poincar\'e principle when variations are not constrained to vanish at integration endpoints.
  The dual Euler--Poincar\'e/Lie--Poisson formalism provides a unified framework for describing quasigeostrophic reduced-gravity stratified thermal flow, mirroring the approach used in the primitive-equation setting.</description>
