      <title>Adapted Measures for Markov Interval Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adapted invariant measures, such as the natural area measure (Liouville), have a central place in the development of ergodic theory for billiards. These measures ensure local Pesin charts can be constructed almost everywhere even in the nonuniformly hyperbolic setting. Recently, for Sinai billiards satisfying certain conditions, the unique measure of maximal entropy has been shown to be adapted. However, not all positive entropy measures are. To investigate the connection between entropy and adaptedness, we examine Markov interval maps with exactly one singularity. We prove that a condition relating the entropy of the map and the "strength" of the singularity determines if the measure of maximal entropy is adapted with respect to this singularity. We also show that under a H\"{o}lder condition, recurrence of the singularity is necessary to have nonadapted invariant measures.</description>

      <title>Automatic computation of the glycemic index: data driven analysis of the glucose standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Glycemic Index (GI) is a tool for classifying carbohydrates based on their impact on postprandial glycemia, useful for diabetes prevention and management. This study applies a mathematical model for a data driven simulation of the glycemic response following glucose ingestion. The analysis reveals a direct correlation between glucose response profiles and parameters describing glucose absorption, enabling the classification of subjects into three groups based on the timing of their glycemic peak. Our results offer potential applications for both glycemic index simulation and advancing biological studies on diabetes.</description>

      <title>Time Scale Separation and Hierarchical Control with the Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman Operator (KO) is a mathematical construct that maps nonlinear (state space) dynamics to corresponding linear dynamics in an infinite-dimensional functional space. For practical applications, finite-dimensional approximations can be constructed with machine learning. The linearity of the KO facilitates the use of linear tools and theories on nonlinear dynamical systems without relying on local approximations. Additionally, the KO has the ability to incorporate forms of domain knowledge such as stability and known variable interactions. It therefore constitutes part of the broader interest in domain-aware or physics-informed machine learning. Hierarchical control and time scale separation are two common properties in engineered systems -- often found together -- that can pose both computational and practical challenges. These properties provide opportunities for further KO-based domain knowledge incorporation, but this has seldom been taken advantage of in the KO literature. This paper focuses on developing and using domain-aware Koopman formulations for systems with hierarchical control, systems with time scale separation, and systems with both. We show how those formulations can be leveraged to quantify the impact of cross-scale interactions on overall stability and to calculate optimal control policies at both fast and slow time scales.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent, Multi-Scale Systems with the Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman Operator (KO) takes nonlinear state dynamics and ``lifts'' those dynamics to an infinite-dimensional functional space of observables in which those dynamics are linear. Computational applications typically use a finite-dimensional approximation to the KO. The KO can also be applied to controlled dynamical systems, and the linearity of the KO then facilitates analysis and control calculations. In principle, the potential benefits provided by the KO, and the way that it facilitates the use of game theory via its linearity, would suggest it as a powerful approach for dealing with multi-agent control problems. In practice, though, there has not been much work in this space: most multi-agent KO work has treated those agents as different components of a single system rather than as distinct decision-making entities. This paper develops a KO formulation for multi-agent systems that structures the interactions between decision-making agents and extends this formulation to systems in which the agents have hierarchical control structures and time scale separated dynamics. We solve the multi-agent control problem in both cases as both a centralized optimization and as a general-sum game theory problem. The comparison of the two sets of optimality conditions defining the control solutions illustrates how coupling between agents can create differences between the social optimum and the Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Coarse graining of stochastic differential equations: averaging and projection method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study coarse-graining methods for stochastic differential equations. In particular we consider averaging and a type of projection operator method, sometimes referred to as effective dynamic via conditional expectations. The projection method (PM) we consider is related to the ``mimicking marginals'' coarse graining approach proposed by Gy\"ongy. The first contribution of this paper is to provide further theoretical background for the PM and a rigorous link to the Gy\"ongy method. Moreover, we compare PM and averaging. While averaging applies to systems with time scale separation, the PM can in principle be applied irrespective of this. However it is often assumed that the two methods coincide in presence of scale separation. The second contribution of this paper is to make this statement precise, provide sufficient conditions under which these two methods coincide and then show -- via examples and counterexamples -- that this needs not be the case.</description>

      <title>Intersection numbers between horizontal foliations of quadratic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish that the intersection number between the horizontal foliations of any two finite-area holomorphic quadratic differentials on an arbitrary Riemann surface is finite. Our main result shows that the intersection number is jointly continuous in the $L^1$-norm on the quadratic differentials. A corollary is that the Jenkins-Strebel differentials are not dense in the space of all finite-area holomorphic quadratic differentials when the infinite Riemann surface is not parabolic.</description>

      <title>Floquet-like theory and gauge transformations for general smooth dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Floquet theory allows to map a time-periodic system of linear differential equations into an autonomous one. By looking at it in a geometrical way, we extend the theory to a class of non-autonomous non-periodic equations. This is obtained by considering a change of variables which depends on time in a non-trivial way, i.e. introducing gauge transformations, well known in fundamental Physics and Field Theory -- but which seems to have received little attention in this context.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the quasi-periodic swing equations from the perspective of weak KAM theory. To this end, we firstly study a class of Hamiltonian systems. We obtain that the limit $u$, which derived from convergence of a sequence of functional minimizers, satisfies Hamilton-Jacobi equations in a weak sense. This is the so-called weak KAM solution. Meanwhile, we also get aminimal measures $\mu$. Finally, we derive that the existence of weak KAM solutions for the swing equations.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-monodromy and the Mandelbrot set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the discontinuity of codings for the Julia set of a quadratic map. To each parameter ray, we associate a natural coding for Julia sets on the ray. Given a hyperbolic component $H$ of the Mandelbrot set, we consider the codings along the two parameter rays landing on the root point of $H$. Our main result describes the discontinuity of these two codings in terms of the kneading sequences of the hyperbolic components which are conspicuous to $H$. This result can be interpreted as a solution to the degenerate case of the monodromy action conjecture in the horseshoe locus for the complex H\'enon family.</description>

      <title>Synchrony and canards in two coupled FitzHugh--Nagumo equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the fast-slow dynamics of two FitzHugh--Nagumo equations coupled symmetrically through the slow equations. We find a non-empty open set of parameter values for which the two equations synchronise, and another set with antisynchrony -- where the solution of one equation is minus the solution of the other. We also obtain bistability -- where these two types of solution coexist as attractors.
  Canards are shown to give rise to mixed-mode oscillations. They also initiate small amplitude transient oscillations before the onset of large amplitude relaxation oscillations. We also discuss briefly the effect of asymmetric coupling, with periodic forcing of one of the equations by the other. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: We study chain-recurrence and chain-transitivity in compact dynamical systems without any regularity assumptions. We prove that every compact system has a chain-recurrent point and a closed, invariant, chain-transitive subsystem. We also prove that, in fact, the same results hold for a strengthened form of chain-recurrence, which we identify.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exponential actions defined by vector configurations provide a universal framework for several constructions of holomorphic dynamics, non-Kaehler complex geometry, toric geometry and topology. These include leaf spaces of holomorphic foliations, intersections of real and Hermitian quadrics, the quotient construction of simplicial toric varieties, LVM and LVMB manifolds, complex-analytic structures on moment-angle manifolds and their partial quotients. In all of these cases, the geometry and topology of the appropriate quotient object can be described by combinatorial data including a pair of Gale dual vector configurations.</description>

      <title>Boundary Control for Stability and Invariance of Traffic Flow Dynamics: A Convex Optimization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter we propose an optimization-based boundary controller for traffic flow dynamics capable of achieving both stability and invariance conditions. The approach is based on the definition of Boundary Control Barrier Functionals, from which sets of invariance-preserving boundary controllers are derived. In combination with sets of stabilizing controllers, we reformulate the problem as a convex optimization program solved at each point in time to synthesize the boundary control inputs. We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal controllers that ensure both stability and invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Schr\"odinger operators in $\ell^2(\Z)$ whose potentials are defined via continuous sampling along the orbits of a homeomorphism on a compact metric space. We show that for each non-atomic ergodic measure $\mu$, there is a dense set of sampling functions such that the associated almost sure spectrum has finitely many gaps, the integrated density of states is smooth, and the Lyapunov exponent is smooth and positive. As a byproduct we answer a question of Walters about the existence of non-uniform $\SL(2,\R)$ cocycles in the affirmative.</description>
