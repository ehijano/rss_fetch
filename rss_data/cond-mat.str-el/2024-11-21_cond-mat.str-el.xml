      <title>Deep Boundary Perturbations at a Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new class of problems in the study of (quantum) critical phenomena, termed "deep boundary criticality". Traditionally, critical systems are analyzed with two types of perturbations: those uniformly distributed throughout the bulk, which can significantly alter the bulk criticality by triggering a nontrivial bulk renormalization group flow, and those confined to a boundary or subdimensional defect, which affect only the boundary or defect condition. Here, we go beyond this paradigm by studying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay algebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying the decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect on the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this new regime using two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions. Through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover exotic scaling laws in simple observables and observe qualitative changes in model behavior as the decay exponent varies.</description>

      <title>Investigation of magnetic excitations and charge order in a van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12887v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complex ground state of van der Waals (vdW) magnets is essential for designing new materials and devices that leverage these platforms. Here, we investigate a two-dimensional vdW ferromagnet -- Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$-- with one of the highest reported Curie temperatures, to elucidate its magnetic excitations and charge order. Using Fe $L_3 - $edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, we find the dual character of magnetic excitations, consisting of a coherent magnon and a continuum, similar to what is reported for its sister compound Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. The magnon has an energy of $\approx$ 36 meV at the maximum in-plane momentum transfer ($-$0.35 r.l.u.) allowed at Fe $L_3 - $edge. A broad and non-dispersive continuum extends up to 150 meV, 50$\%$ higher energy than in Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. Its intensity is sinusoidally modulated along the $L$ direction, with a period matching the inter-slab distance. Our findings suggest that while the unconventional dual character of magnetic excitations is generic to ternary Fe-Ge-Te vdW magnets, the correlation length of the out-of-plane magnetic interaction increases in Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ as compared to Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, supporting a stronger three-dimensional character for the former. Furthermore, by investigating the $\pm$(1/3, 1/3, $L$) peaks by resonant x-ray diffraction, we conclude these to have structural origin rather than charge order -- as previously reported -- and suggest doubling of the structural unit cell along the $c-$axis.</description>

      <title>Persistent Spin Dynamics in the Ising Triangular-lattice Antiferromagnet Ba$_6$Nd$_2$Ti$_4$O$_{17}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results of magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements on the polycrystalline Ba$_6$Nd$_2$Ti$_4$O$_{17}$, a disorder-free triangular-lattice antiferromagnet. The absence of long-range magnetic order or spin freezing is confirmed down to 30~mK, much less than the Curie-Weiss temperature -1.8~K. The magnetic and specific heat measurements reveal the effective-1/2 spins are Ising-like. The persistent spin dynamics is determined down to 37~mK. Our study present a remarkable example of Ising spins on the triangular lattice, which remains magnetically disordered at low temperatures and potentially hosts a quantum spin liquid ground state.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of bi-layer two-orbital model for La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ on a plaquette ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ with $T_c \approx 80K$ provides another intriguing platform to explore the microscopic mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. In this work, we study a previously proposed bi-layer two-orbital model Hamiltonian for La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ [Y. Shen, et al, Chinese Physics Letters 40, 127401 (2023)] on a plaquette ladder, which is a minimum setup with two-dimensional characteristic. We employ large-scale Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations to accurately determine the ground state of the model. We determine the density, magnetic structure, and the pairing property of the model. We find that with large effective inter-layer anti-ferromagnetic exchange for the 3$d_{z^2}$ orbital, both spin, charge, and pairing correlation display quasi-long-range behavior, which could be viewed as a precursor of possible true long-range order in the two dimensional limit. Interestingly, sign oscillation for the pairing correlation are observed for both the 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and 3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, indicating the presence of possible pair density wave in the system. Even though we only study the model on a quasi one-dimensional plaquette ladder geometry due to the computational difficulty, the results on the spin, charge, and pairing correlation provide valuable insight in the clarification of the properties of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ in the future.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Feats in the Physics of Correlated Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decades multifaceted manifestations of the breakdown of the self-consistent perturbation theory have been identified for the many-electron problem. Yet, the investigations have been so far mostly limited to paramagnetic states, where symmetry breaking is not allowed. Here, we extend the analysis to the spontaneously symmetry-broken antiferromagnetic (AF) phase of the repulsive Hubbard model. To this aim, we calculated two-particle quantities using dynamical mean-field theory for the AF-ordered Hubbard model and studied the possible occurrence of divergences of the irreducible vertex functions in the charge and spin sectors. Our calculations pinpoint the divergences in the AF phase diagram, showing that while the onset of AF order mitigates the breakdown of the perturbation expansion, it does not fully prevent it. Moreover, we have been able to link the changes in the dynamical structure of the corresponding generalized susceptibilities to the physical crossover from a weak-coupling (Slater) to a strong-coupling (Heisenberg) antiferromagnet, which takes place as the interaction strength is gradually increased. Finally, we discuss possible physical consequences of the irreducible vertex divergences in triggering phase-separation instabilities within the AF phase and elaborate on the implications of our findings for two-dimensional systems, where the onset of a long-range AF order is prevented by the Mermin-Wagner theorem.</description>

      <title>Thermal Entropy, Density Disorder and Antiferromagnetism of Repulsive Fermions in 3D Optical Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated antiferromagnetic phase transition was realized in a most recent optical lattice experiment for 3D fermionic Hubbard model [Shao {\it et al}., Nature {\bf 632}, 267 (2024)]. Despite the great achievement, it was observed that the AFM structure factor (and also the critical entropy) reaches the maximum around the interaction strength $U/t\simeq 11.75$, which is significantly larger than the theoretical prediction as $U/t\simeq 8$. Here we resolve this discrepancy by studying the interplay between the thermal entropy, density disorder and antiferromagnetism of half-filled 3D Hubbard model with numerically exact auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We have achieved accurate entropy phase diagram, which allows us to simulate arbitrary entropy path on the temperature-interaction plane and to track the experimental parameters. We then find that above discrepancy can be quantitatively explained by the {\it entropy increase} as enhancing the interaction in experiment, and together by the lattice {\it density disorder} existing in the experimental setup. We furthermore investigate the entropy dependence of double occupancy, and predict its universal behaviors which can be used as useful probes in future optical lattice experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are eigenstates in non-integrable isolated quantum systems that defy typical thermalization paradigms, violating the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and quantum ergodicity. We identify exact analytic scar solutions in a 2 + 1 dimensional lattice gauge theory in a quasi-1d limit as zero-magic stabilizer states. We propose a protocol for their experimental preparation, presenting an opportunity to demonstrate a quantum over classical advantage via simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics of a strongly coupled system. Our results also highlight the importance of magic for gauge theory thermalization, revealing a connection between computational complexity and quantum ergodicity.</description>

      <title>D-commuting SYK model: building quantum chaos from integrable blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of quantum chaotic models by combining multiple copies of integrable commuting SYK models. As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal.
  Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Orbital Description of Landau Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a minimal lattice model to provide an orbital description of lowest and first Landau levels. With the maximally localized Wannier functions with $s$, $p_-$, $p_+$ orbital characteristics, a three-orbital model is developed, where the lowest two Chern bands are flat with $\mathcal{C}=1$. This model can be viewed as consecutive band inversions between these Wannier states at $\Gamma$ and $K$ in momentum space, which adiabatically connects the atomic insulator limit to Landau level physics. Interestingly, many-body exact diagonalization and entanglement spectrum analysis suggest that the Abelian states can appear in the 1/3-filled lowest Chern band, while the signatures of the non-Abelian states are found in the half-filled first Chern band. This construction can be further extended to realize flat Chern bands resembling the higher Landau levels. Our results offer a new perspective to understand the lattice analogue of Landau levels, potentially enabling the realization of the fascinating topological phenomena at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Stacking-dependent ferroicity of reversed bilayer: altermagnetism or ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, as a new branch of magnetism independent of traditional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, has attracted extensive attention recently. At present, researchers have proved several kinds of three-dimensional altermagnets, but research on two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets remains elusive. Here, we propose a method for designing altermagnetism in 2D lattices: bilayer reversed stacking. This method could enable altermagnetism-type spin splitting to occur intrinsically and the spin-splitting can be controlled by crystal chirality. We also demonstrate it through a real material of bilayer PtBr$_3$ with AB' stacking order. Additionally, the combination of stacking order and slidetronics offers new opportunities for electrical writing and magnetic reading of electronic devices. In the case of AC' stacking, interlayer sliding results in reversible spontaneous polarization. This unique combination of antiferromagnetism and sliding ferroelectricity leads to polarization-controlled spin-splitting, thus enabling magnetoelectric coupling, which can be detected by magneto-optical Kerr effect even without net magnetization. Our research highlights that reversed stacking provides a platform to explore rich physical properties of magnetism, ferroelectricity, and spin-splitting.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Lorentz symmetric systems: a quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study on the hydrodynamic behavior of charge current in a Lorentz symmetric system: graphene at charge-neutrality. The momentum flow is completely decoupled from the charge current in this regime, since the electrons and holes propagate in opposite directions with exactly equal distribution functions. Instead of Navier-Stokes equations for the velocity field, we derive similar equations directly for the charge current. This eliminates the need for any coupling between the velocity field and charge current to explain the experimentally observed hydrodynamic flow profiles in graphene at half-filling. In this framework, the current diffusion coefficient replaces viscosity. To support this, we performed an extensive quantum Monte Carlo study, directly simulating samples with disordered edges using the underlying microscopic interacting quantum Hamiltonian. For the first time, we observe hydrodynamic behavior of the charge current in such simulations, extracting current profiles and a current diffusion coefficient whose temperature dependence qualitatively agrees with predictions from Boltzmann transport theory.</description>

      <title>Tunable surface electron gas and effect of phonons in Sr$_2$CuO$_3$: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the conducting CuO$_2$ planes in cuprate superconductors have been widely recognized as a crucial component in producing high superconducting $T_\text{c}$, recent experimental and theoretical studies on Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{3+}$$_\delta$ have also drawn much attention to the importance of Cu-O chains in one-dimensional (1D) cuprates. To better understand the cuprates containing Cu-O chains, here we have studied the electronic, magnetic, and phonon properties of Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ bulk and films based on the spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. We first reproduced the typical Mott insulator feature of the cuprate parent compound for bulk Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, and then built a Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ thin film with Cu-O chains exposed on the surface to directly investigate their characteristics. Different from the insulating bulk phase, the Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ surface shows interesting metallic properties. Further electronic structure calculations reveal the existence of spin-polarized electron gas between surface Sr atoms that strongly depends on the interchain coupling of Cu spins. Moreover, the phonon modes that involve the vibrations of in-chain and out-of-chain O atoms can induce strong charge and spin fluctuations in the surface layer of Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ film, which suggests significant multiple degree-of-freedom couplings that may be important for the superconductivity in 1D cuprates. Our work provides a comprehensive viewpoint of the properties of Cu-O chains in Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, facilitating a complete understanding of 1D cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Ramification of complex magnetism in Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ observed by Raman scattering spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Raman scattering spectroscopy, we uncover a complex magnetic behavior of Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ , which stands out among magnetic pyrochlores by the lowest temperature of the all-in-all-out (AIAO) Ir moments ordering ($T^\mathrm{N}_{\small\rm{Ir}}=33$~K) and the highest temperature at which AIAO order of rare-earth Nd ions is detected ($T^\mathrm{*}_{\small\rm{Nd}}$=15~K). Our findings suggest that in the temperature range between 15~K and 33~K, Nd magnetic moments exhibit strong fluctuations, possibly originating from spin ice behavior. This complex behavior emerges from the interplay of strong spin-orbit coupling, electronic correlations, and geometric frustration on two magnetic pyrochlore sublattices of Nd and Ir ions. The ordering of Ir magnetic moments is accompanied by an appearance of one-magnon Raman modes at 26.3 and 29.6 meV compatible with the AIAO order and of a broad mode at 14 meV, which could be associated with spinon continuum arising from Nd spin ice fluctuations. While two one-magnon excitations show minimal temperature evolution with decreasing temperature, the 14 meV mode shifts to higher frequencies as the temperature approaches a crossover to Nd AIAO order, broadens, and disappears below 15~K. An additional two-magnon excitation of the AIAO Nd order at around 33 meV appears in the spectra at low temperatures. These rather high energies of magnetic excitations of Nd moments make Nd$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ a particularly attractive playground to study the rare-earth magnetism on the pyrochlore lattice.</description>

      <title>Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments on altermagnetism, we investigate the Hubbard model on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice, where the onsite repulsion between electrons induces the onset of a staggered magnetic order in which opposite magnetic sublattices are related to each other only by rotations and glide reflections, and not by inversion nor translations. As a consequence, the magnetic phase displays an altermagnetic character, i.e. a finite (non-relativistic) Zeeman splitting of the electronic excitations, despite the absence of a net magnetization. By means of a variational Monte Carlo approach based on Jastrow-Slater wave functions, which accounts for electronic correlations beyond the single-particle approximation, we study how $d$-wave altermagnetism shows up in the ground state properties and in the spectral function of the system. We characterize the metal-insulator transition between altermagnetic phases at half-filling and the stability of altermagnetism as a function of doping. The calculation of the single-particle spectral function displays the spin-split nature of the electronic excitations, also within the Mott insulating regime. We discuss possible realizations of the model in the context of organic $\alpha$- or $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X charge transfer salts.</description>

      <title>The Weyl-Mott point: topological and non-Fermi liquid behavior from an isolated Green's function zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model in which a Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction is added to a system of fermions with a Weyl point in their non-interacting dispersion relation, and analyze its behavior as a function of the chemical potential. We show that the model exhibits a Weyl-Mott point -- a single isolated Green's function zero -- and that this implies an emergent non-Fermi-liquid state at the border of the metallic regime and a gapped topological state for the insulating one. The Weyl-Mott point inherits the topological charge from the original Green's function pole, and is therefore naturally associated with a strongly correlated chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Accurate Electron-phonon Interactions from Advanced Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is key for understanding many properties of materials such as superconductivity and electric resistivity. Although first principles density-functional-theory (DFT) based EPC calculations are used widely, their efficacy is limited by the accuracy and efficiency of the underlying exchange-correlation functionals. These limitations become exacerbated in complex $d$- and $f$-electron materials, where beyond-DFT approaches and empirical corrections, such as the Hubbard $U$, are commonly invoked. Here, using the examples of CoO and NiO, we show how the efficient r2scan density functional correctly captures strong EPC effects in transition-metal oxides without requiring the introduction of empirical parameters. We also demonstrate the ability of r2scan to accurately model phonon-mediated superconducting properties of the main group compounds (e.g., MgB$_2$), with improved electronic bands and phonon dispersions over those of traditional density functionals. Our study provides a pathway for extending the scope of accurate first principles modeling of electron-phonon interactions to encompass complex $d$-electron materials.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Hidden Ferroaxial Density Wave as the Origin of the Axial Higgs Mode in RTe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of an axial amplitude (Higgs) mode in the long-studied charge density wave (CDW) systems GdTe$_3$ and LaTe$_3$ suggests a heretofore unidentified hidden order. A theoretical study proposed that the axial Higgs results from a hidden ferroaxial component of the CDW, which could arise from non-trivial orbital texture. Here, we report extensive experimental studies on ErTe$_3$ and HoTe$_3$ that possess a high-temperature CDW similar to other RTe$_3$ (R = rare earth), along with an additional low-temperature CDW with an orthogonal ordering vector. Combining Raman spectroscopy with large-angle convergent beam electron diffraction (LACBED), rotational anisotropy second-harmonic generation (RA-SHG), and muon-spin relaxation ($\mu$SR), we provide unambiguous evidence that the high-temperature CDW breaks translation, rotation, and all vertical and diagonal mirror symmetries, but not time-reversal or inversion. In contrast, the low-temperature CDW only additionally breaks translation symmetry. Simultaneously, Raman scattering shows the high-temperature CDW produces an axial Higgs mode while the low-temperature mode is scalar. The weak monoclinic structural distortion and clear axial response in Raman and SHG are consistent with a ferroaxial phase in RTe$_3$ driven by coupled orbital and charge orders. Thus, our study provides a new standard for uncovering unconventional orders and confirms the power of Higgs modes to reveal them.</description>

      <title>Easy-plane ferromagnetic ordering and crystal-field ground state in the Kondo lattice CeCuSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the successful growth of CeCuSi single crystals using a metallic flux method and the physical properties using structural, magnetic, electrical transport, optical, and heat capacity measurements. CeCuSi crystallizes in a hexagonal-bar shape, and single crystal x-ray diffraction confirms the ZrBeSi-type structure (space group $P6_{3}/mmc$). CeCuSi orders ferromagnetically below $T_\textrm{C}=15.5$ K with easy magnetization direction within the basal plane. The Ce$^{3+}$ ions are situated within a triangular lattice with a point group of $D_{3d}$. We perform a detailed crystalline electric field (CEF) analysis of the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility, the Schottky anomaly in heat capacity, and the Raman-active excitations. The results indicate a ground state doublet with magnetic moment primarily in the basal plane, and a ferromagnetic interaction along both directions. The exponential behavior in resistivity and in heat capacity below $T_\textrm{C}$ can also be well explained by the ferromagnetic magnon model. We found that CeCuSi does not exhibit the CEF hard axis ordering observed in many ferromagnetic Kondo lattice (FM-KL) compounds. Our CEF analysis suggests that the exchange interactions along both axes are ferromagnetic, potentially explaining the absence of hard-axis ordering.</description>

      <title>Topological Optical Pseudospin Injection Beyond Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoinduced effects are now reckoned to be important tools to reveal a rich gamut of entrancing physics in topological materials, which are normally inaccessible to conventional probes. Here we investigate one of these intriguing effects, namely, {\it optical pseudospin injection} (OPI) beyond ordinary Weyl semimetals (WSMs), specifically in multi-WSMs (mWSMs) and higher-order WSMs. Remarkably, we demonstrate that OPI in mWSMs is independent of the frequency of the light and linearly proportional to the quantized topological charge as a consequence of the inherent band linearity in their dispersions. Interestingly, while the response does not depend on the tilting of a type-I node, it is a decreasing function of the same in type-II mWSMs. We also reveal that the frequency-independence can be destroyed either by going beyond a certain cutoff frequency under lattice regularization or by going to a higher-order Weyl phase. The predicted signatures of OPI beyond the ordinary WSM could be experimentally exploited, leading to effective access as well as distinguishing between different nontrivial Weyl topologies.</description>

      <title>Impurity bands, line-nodes, and anomalous thermal Hall effect in Weyl superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the anomalous thermal Hall effect (ATHE) in Weyl superconductors realized by the $E_{1u}$ ($p$-wave and $f$-wave) chiral superconducting order for the point group $D_{6h}$. Using the quasiclassical transport theory, we analyze the influence of the impurity scatterings and the line-nodal excitations on the ATHE. We compare the extrinsic (impurity-induced) ATHE with the intrinsic (topological) ATHE to identify the dominant contribution. Because the transverse response is sensitive to the slope in the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy, the extrinsic ATHE vanishes in both the Born (weak impurity potential) and unitarity (strong impurity potential) limits. The amplitude of the impurity contribution to the thermal Hall conductivity (THC) reaches maximum between these limits when the slope of the DOS becomes large due to impurity bands near the Fermi energy. In such situations, the extrinsic ATHE dominates the intrinsic ATHE even at low temperatures. The extrinsic ATHE is sensitive to line-nodal excitations, whereas the intrinsic ATHE is insensitive to bulk excitations. When line nodes involve the sign change of the order parameter, the impurity contribution to the THC is suppressed even though the phase space for low-energy excitation is large. In contrast, if line nodes are not accompanied by such sign changes, the extrinsic ATHE is significantly enhanced. Our results form a basis for the comprehensive analysis of anomalous thermal transport in Weyl superconductors.</description>

      <title>Bilayer stacking A-type altermagnet: A general approach to generating two-dimensional altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new concept of bilayer stacking A-type altermagnet (BSAA), in which two identical ferromagnetic monolayers are stacked with antiferromagnetic coupling to form a two-dimensional A-type altermagnet. By solving the stacking model, we derive all BSAAs for all layer groups and draw three key conclusions: (1) Only 17 layer groups can realize intrinsic A-type altermagnetism. All 2D A-type altermagnets must belong to these 17 layer groups, which will be helpful to search for 2D A-type altermagnet. (2) It is impossible to connect the two sublattices of BSAA using $S_{3z}$ or $S_{6z}$, a constraint that is also applicable to all 2D altermagnets. (3) $C_{2\alpha}$ is a general stacking operation to generate BSAA for an arbitrary monolayer. Our theory not only can explain the previously reported twisted-bilayer altermagnets, but also can provide more possibilities to generate A-type altermagnets. Our research has significantly broadened the range of candidate materials for 2D altermagnets. Based on conclusion (1), the bilayer NiZrCl$_6$ is predicted to exhibit intrinsic A-type altermagnetism. Additionally, we use twisted-bilayer NiCl$_2$, previously reported in the literature, as the second example of BSAA. Furthermore, utilizing symmetry analysis and first-principles calculation, we scrutinize their spin-momentum locking characteristic to substantiate their altermagnetic properties.</description>

Abstract: We investigate two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with affine $\widehat{su}(2)$ and $\widehat{su}(3)$ algebra symmetry. Their bosonic modular-invariant partition functions have been fully classified based on the ADE classification. In this work, we extend the classification to include fermionic and parafermionic CFTs with the same affine symmetries, utilizing techniques of fermionization and parafermionization. We find that the fermionic and parafermionic $\widehat{su}(2)$ models are related to non-simply laced Dynkin diagrams.</description>
