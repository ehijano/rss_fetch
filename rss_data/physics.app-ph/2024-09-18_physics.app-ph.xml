      <title>hklhop: a Selection Tool for Asymmetric Reflections of Spherically Bent Crystal Analysers for High Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High resolution, hard x-ray spectroscopy at synchrotron x-ray light sources commonly uses spherically bent crystal analyzers (SBCAs) formed by shaping a single crystal wafer to a spherical backing. These Rowland circle optics are almost always used in a 'symmetric' (or nearly symmetric) configuration wherein the reciprocal lattice vector used for energy selectivity via diffraction is coincident with the normal vector to the curved wafer surface. However, Gironda, et al., recently proposed that asymmetric operation of SBCA, wherein the reciprocal lattice vector is no longer normal to the wafer surface, has significant operational benefits and has been an underutilized opportunity. First, those authors find improved energy resolution through decreased Johann error, or equivalently find increased solid angle at a chosen experimental tolerance for energy broadening. Second, they find productive, high-resolution use of a large number of reciprocal lattice vectors from a single SBCA, thus enabling operation over a wide energy range without need to exchange SBCA upon making large changes in desired photon energy. These observations hold the potential to improve performance, increase flexibility and decrease cost for both laboratory and synchrotron applications. Given these motivations, we report an open-source software package, hklhop, that enables exploration of the complex space of analyzer wafer choice, experimental energy range or ranges, and desired suppression of Johann error. This package can guide both the design and the day-to-day operations of Rowland spectrometers enabled for asymmetric use.</description>

      <title>Unattended field measurement of bird source level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound power levels or so-called source levels are essential quantities when it comes to evaluating the active space of bird species, both in the study of animal communication and when designing bioacoustic monitoring schemes. However, little data is available in the literature. In this paper I demonstrate the feasibility of the measurement of apparent sound power in the field for bird species by using a calibrated 4-microphone horizontal array deployed on the ground. Time differences of arrival allow for the location of the sound source. Assuming a point source, the apparent sound power level is estimated after correcting for ground reflection and spherical divergence but cannot be corrected for source directivity. The benefits of my approach that is inspired from engineering measurement standards for elevated sound sources, is to minimize the contribution from ground reflections and to allow for unattended measurements, or measurements when the bird is not visible, owing to either foliage or obscurity. Moreover, my paper brings new data on sound power for 4 species of birds.</description>

      <title>Virtual VNA 2.0: Ambiguity-Free Scattering Matrix Estimation by Terminating Inaccessible Ports With Tunable and Coupled Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently introduced the "Virtual VNA" concept which estimates the $N \times N$ scattering matrix characterizing an arbitrarily complex linear system with $N$ monomodal ports by inputting and outputting waves only via $N_\mathrm{A}&lt;N$ ports while terminating the $N_\mathrm{S}=N-N_\mathrm{A}$ remaining ports with known tunable individual loads. However, vexing ambiguities about the signs of the off-diagonal scattering coefficients involving the $N_\mathrm{S}$ not-directly-accessible (NDA) ports remained. If only phase-insensitive measurements were used, an additional blockwise phase ambiguity ensued. Here, inspired by the emergence of "beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces" in wireless communications, we lift all ambiguities with at most $N_\mathrm{S}$ additional measurements involving a known multi-port load network. We experimentally validate our approach based on an 8-port chaotic cavity, using a simple coaxial cable as two-port load network. Endowed with the multi-port load network, the "Virtual VNA 2.0" is now able to estimate the entire scattering matrix without any ambiguity, even without ever measuring phase information explicitly. Potential applications include the characterization of antenna arrays.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Ultra-Thick Masks for X-ray Phase Contrast Imaging at Higher Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging (XPCI) provides higher sensitivity to contrast between low absorbing objects that can be invisible to conventional attenuation-based X-ray imaging. XPCI's main application has been so far focused on medical areas at relatively low energies (&lt; 100 keV). The translation to higher energy for industrial applications, where energies above 150 keV are often needed, is hindered by the lack of masks/gratings with sufficiently thick gold septa. Fabricating such structures with apertures of tens of micrometers becomes difficult at depths greater than a few hundreds of micrometers due to aspect ratio dependent effects such as anisotropic etching, and preferential gold (Au) deposition at the top of the apertures. In this work, these difficulties are overcome by Deep Reactive Ion Etching optimized by a stepped parameters approach and bismuth-mediated superconformal filling of Au, ultimately resulting in 500 micrometers deep silicon masks filled with Au at bulk density. The obtained masks, tested in an Edge Illumination XPCI system with a conventional source and a photon-counting detector, show good agreement with simulations at different energy thresholds. They also demonstrate a higher phase sensitivity for highly absorbing objects when compared to lower aspect ratio masks, proving their potential for industrial non-destructive testing.</description>

      <title>A model for the current-voltage characteristic of membrane/electrolyte junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model for the current-voltage characteristic of the junction between an Ion-Sensitive-Membrane and an electrolyte solution is derived and compared with numerical simulations of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck model for ion transport. The expression resembles that of a semiconductor pn junction with a non-ideality factor of 2. The non-ideality correlated to the voltage drop in the electrolyte induced by the re-arrangement of the counter-ions.</description>

      <title>Observation of Interface Piezoelectricity in Superconducting Devices on Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of superconducting quantum processors is driven by the need to reduce errors and scale for fault-tolerant computation. Reducing physical qubit error rates requires further advances in the microscopic modeling and control of decoherence mechanisms in superconducting qubits. Piezoelectric interactions contribute to decoherence by mediating energy exchange between microwave photons and acoustic phonons. Centrosymmetric materials like silicon and sapphire do not display piezoelectricity and are the preferred substrates for superconducting qubits. However, the broken centrosymmetry at material interfaces may lead to piezoelectric losses in qubits. While this loss mechanism was predicted two decades ago, interface piezoelectricity has not been experimentally observed in superconducting devices. Here, we report the observation of interface piezoelectricity at an aluminum-silicon junction and show that it constitutes an important loss channel for superconducting devices. We fabricate aluminum interdigital surface acoustic wave transducers on silicon and demonstrate piezoelectric transduction from room temperature to millikelvin temperatures. We find an effective electromechanical coupling factor of $K^2\approx 2 \times 10^{-5}\%$ comparable to weakly piezoelectric substrates. We model the impact of the measured interface piezoelectric response on superconducting qubits and find that the piezoelectric surface loss channel limits qubit quality factors to $Q\sim10^4-10^8$ for designs with different surface participation ratios and electromechanical mode matching. These results identify electromechanical surface losses as a significant dissipation channel for superconducting qubits, and show the need for heterostructure and phononic engineering to minimize errors in next-generation superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Compact Inversely-Designed Vertical Coupler with Bottom Reflector for Sub-Decibel Fiber-to-Chip Coupling on Silicon-on-Insulator Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design via topology optimization has led to innovations in integrated photonics and offers a promising way for designing high-efficiency on-chip couplers with a minimal footprint. In this work, we exploit topology optimization to design a compact vertical coupler incorporating a bottom reflector, which achieves sub-decibel coupling efficiency on the 220-nm silicon-on-insulator platform. The final design of the vertical coupler yields a predicted coupling efficiency of -0.35 dB at the wavelength of 1550 nm with a footprint of 14 {\mu}m x 14 {\mu}m, which is considerably smaller than conventional grating couplers. Its topology-optimized geometry can be realized by applying one full etch and one 70-nm shallow-etch process and the fabricability is also guaranteed by a minimum feature size around 150 nm. The proposed vertical coupler can further miniaturize photonic integrated circuits and enable highly-efficient networks between optical fibers and other photonic devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defect emitters in silicon are promising contenders as building blocks of solid-state quantum repeaters and sensor networks. Here we investigate a family of possible isoelectronic emitter defect complexes from a design standpoint. We show that the identification of key physical effects on quantum defect state localization can guide the search for telecom wavelength emitters. We demonstrate this by performing first-principles calculations on the Q center, predicting its charged sodium variants possessing ideal emission wavelength near the lowest-loss telecom bands and ground state spin for possible spin-photon interface and nanoscale spin sensor applications yet to be explored in experiments.</description>

      <title>Physical Insights into Electromagnetic Efficiency of Wireless Implantable Bioelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous implantable bioelectronics rely on wireless connectivity, necessitating highly efficient electromagnetic (EM) radiation systems. However, limitations in power, safety, and data transmission currently impede the advancement of innovative wireless medical devices, such as tetherless neural interfaces, electroceuticals, and surgical microrobots. To overcome these challenges and ensure sufficient link and power budgets for wireless implantable systems, this study explores the mechanisms behind EM radiation and losses, offering strategies to enhance radiation efficiency in wireless implantable bioelectronics. Using analytical modeling, the EM waves emitted by the implant are expanded as a series of spherical harmonics, enabling a detailed analysis of the radiation mechanisms. This framework is then extended to approximate absorption losses caused by the lossy and dispersive properties of tissues through derived analytical expressions. The radiation efficiency and in-body path loss are quantified and compared in terms of three primary loss mechanisms. The impact of various parameters on the EM efficiency of implantable devices is analyzed and quantified, including operating frequency, implant size, body-air interface curvature, and implantation location. Additionally, a rapid estimation technique is introduced to determine the optimal operating frequency for specific scenarios, along with a set of design principles aimed at improving radiation performance. The design strategies derived in this work - validated through numerical and experimental demonstrations on realistic implants - reveal a potential improvement in implant radiation efficiency or gain by a factor of five to ten, leading to a corresponding increase in overall link efficiency compared to conventional designs.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical model of optothermal fluidics in a confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the semi-analytical solution of the temperature and flow fields of a fluid confined in a narrow space between two parallel plates. The temperature increase is triggered by photothermal effects of fluids and/or boundaries due to the absorption of a focused Gaussian beam irradiated perpendicular to the fluid film, and then the temperature variation induces the flow fields through a buoyancy force and/or thermo-osmotic slip. The semi-analytical solution to this optothermal fluidic system is validated by comparing with the results of numerical simulation, and is applied to typical optothermal fluidic problems. In particular, the optothermal trap of nanoparticles observed in our previous experiment [T. Tsuji, et al., Electrophoresis, 42, 2401 (2021)] is investigated in terms of thermophoretic force and flow drag that are obtained semi-analytically. The semi-analytical solution can be shared through open-source codes that are available to researchers without the background of fluid mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally and computationally analyze impact-shock-induced stress wave propagation in packings of disordered flexible fibers. We find that dispersive wave propagation, associated with large stress attenuation, occurs much more prevalently in systems with larger fiber aspect ratios and moderate fiber flexibility. We trace these features to the microstructural properties of fiber contact chains and the energy-trapping abilities of deformable fibers. These findings provide new insights into physics of the shock-impacted flexible fiber packings and open the way towards an improved granular-material-based damping technology.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal phase-change metaoptics for reconfigurable nonvolatile image processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of smart imaging and vision systems will require compact and tunable optical computing hardware to perform high-speed and low-power image processing. These requirements are driving the development of computing metasurfaces to realize efficient front-end analog optical pre-processors, especially for edge-detection capability. Yet, there is still a lack of reconfigurable or programmable schemes, which may drastically enhance the impact of these devices at the system level. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a reconfigurable flat optical image processor using low-loss phase-change nonlocal metasurfaces. The metasurface is configured to realize different transfer functions in spatial frequency space, when transitioning the phase-change material between its amorphous and crystalline phases. This enables edge detection and bright-field imaging modes on the same device. The metasurface is compatible with a large numerical aperture of ~0.5, making it suitable for high resolution coherent optical imaging microscopy. The concept of phase-change reconfigurable nonlocal metasurfaces may enable emerging applications of artificial intelligence-assisted imaging and vision devices with switchable multitasking.</description>

      <title>A quantum protocol for applying arbitrary phase transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an operator that produces the state $|\phi\rangle=\sum\phi(x)\,|x\rangle$, we propose a quantum protocol that transforms any input state of the form $|\psi\rangle=\sum\psi(x)\,|x\rangle$ to $|\psi'\rangle=\sum\psi(x)\,e^{i\alpha|\phi(x)|^2}\,|x\rangle$. This protocol is thus programmable in the sense that one can use it to apply different phase profiles $e^{i\alpha|\phi(x)|^2}$ by choosing different $|\phi\rangle$ states as the input parameter at each run. Therefore, the problem of applying phases to a signal via a quantum computer is reduced to the problem of initializing a state $|\phi\rangle$ that corresponds to the desired phase profile. Furthermore, we discuss possible applications of this protocol, most importantly in Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Ambient Drift and Negative-Bias Temperature Instability in Foundry Carbon Nanotube Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Back-end-of-line (BEOL) logic integration is emerging as a complementary scaling path to supplement front-end-of-line (FEOL) Silicon. Among various options for BEOL logic, Carbon Nanotube Field-Effect Transistors (CNFETs) have been integrated within commercial silicon foundries, and complex CNFET circuits (e.g., RISC-V core, SRAM arrays) have been demonstrated. However, there lacks comprehensive studies that analyze the ambient drift (i.e., air-stability) and reliability of CNFETs. Here, for the first time, we thoroughly characterize and demonstrate how to overcome ambient drift and negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) in CNFETs using the following techniques: (1) Silicon Nitride encapsulation to limit ambient atmosphere induced threshold voltage shift (~8x reduction of median VT shift over 90 days) and (2) AC/pulsed operation to significantly improve CNFET NBTI vs. DC operation across a wide frequency range (e.g., 20% duty cycle AC operation at 10 MHz could extend CNFET NBTI time-to-failure by &gt;10000x vs. DC for a target VT shift tolerance &lt; 100 mV with gate stress bias VGS,stress = -1.2 V at 125 C).</description>

Abstract: Uniaxially strained Fe--Co disordered alloys have emerged as promising candidates for cost-effective rare-earth-free permanent magnets due to their high magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). Using first-principles, fully relativistic calculations within the coherent potential approximation and PBE exchange-correlation potential, we explore the MAE of tetragonal Fe--Co alloys under uniaxial compression. Our results reveal a previously uncharted high-MAE region, distinct from known structures and accessible through uniaxial compression.</description>

      <title>Quantum-limited optical lever measurement of a torsion oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical lever is a precision displacement sensor with broad applications. In principle, it can track the motion of a mechanical oscillator with added noise at the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL); however, demonstrating this performance requires an oscillator with an exceptionally high torque sensitivity, or, equivalently, zero-point angular displacement spectral density. Here, we describe optical lever measurements on Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoribbons possessing $Q&gt;3\times 10^7$ torsion modes with torque sensitivities of $10^{-20}\,\text{N m}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and zero-point displacement spectral densities of $10^{-10}\,\text{rad}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. Compensating aberrations and leveraging immunity to classical intensity noise, we realize angular displacement measurements with imprecisions 20 dB below the SQL and demonstrate feedback cooling, using a position modulated laser beam as a torque actuator, from room temperature to $\sim5000$ phonons. Our study signals the potential for a new class of torsional quantum optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design of Dallenbach Absorbers Under Broadband Broad-Angle Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical scenario where a \emph{single plane-wave} field impinge a Dallenbach absorber is well studied both theoretically and experimentally. However, occasionally a \emph{spectrum of plane-waves} impinges the absorber. Such a scenario occurs for example if an antenna is located adjacent to the absorbing layer. In this paper, for this scenario we obtain the absorbing performance bound and design an \emph{optimized layered absorber} that approaches the bound. In a numerical demonstration, we explore a realistic case where a dipole antenna is placed in the vicinity of a finite, electrically thin, Dallenbach absorber backed by a PEC plane in the 6G frequency range. In the absence of the absorbing layer covering the PEC plane, severe scattering from the plane distorts the radiated fields. These distortions are robustly mitigated by the specifically tailored optimal absorber to yield a more desired radiation pattern. Additionally, we propose a metamaterial realization that emulates the required properties of the absorbing layer for all field polarizations.</description>

      <title>Deformation Dynamics of Nanopores upon Water Imbibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capillarity-driven transport in nanoporous solids is widespread in nature and crucial for modern liquid-infused engineering materials. During imbibition, curved menisci driven by high negative Laplace pressures exert an enormous contractile load on the porous matrix. Due to the challenge of simultaneously monitoring imbibition and deformation with high spatial resolution, the resulting coupling of solid elasticity to liquid capillarity has remained largely unexplored. Here, we study water imbibition in mesoporous silica using optical imaging, gravimetry, and high-resolution dilatometry. In contrast to an expected Laplace pressure-induced contraction, we find a square-root-of-time expansion and an additional abrupt length increase when the menisci reach the top surface. The final expansion is absent when we stop the imbibition front inside the porous medium in a dynamic imbibition-evaporation equilibrium, as is typical for transpiration-driven hydraulic transport in plants, especially in trees. These peculiar deformation behaviors are validated by single-nanopore molecular dynamics simulations and described by a continuum model that highlights the importance of expansive surface stresses at the pore walls (Bangham effect) and the buildup or release of contractile Laplace pressures as menisci collectively advance, arrest, or disappear. Our model suggests that these observations apply to any imbibition process in nanopores, regardless of the liquid/solid combination, and that the Laplace contribution upon imbibition is precisely half that of vapor sorption, due to the linear pressure drop associated with viscous flow. Thus, simple deformation measurements can be used to quantify surface stresses and Laplace pressures or transport in a wide variety of natural and artificial porous media.</description>

      <title>Simulation of depth-dose curves and water equivalent ratios of energetic proton beams in cortical bone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have determined the depth-dose curve, the penetration range, and the water equivalent ratio (WER), for proton beams of clinical energies in cortical bone, by means of a detailed and accurate simulation that combines molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques. The fundamental input quantities (stopping power and energy loss straggling) for the simulation were obtained from a reliable electronic excitation spectrum of the condensed-phase target, which takes into account the organic and mineral phases that form it. Our simulations with these inputs, that are in excellent agreement with the scarce data available for a cortical bone target, deviate from simulations performed using other stopping quantities, such as those provided by the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) in its widely used Report 49. The results of this work emphasize the importance of an accurate determination of the stopping quantities of cortical bone in order to advance towards the millimetric precision for the proton penetration ranges and deposited dose needed in radiotherapy.</description>
