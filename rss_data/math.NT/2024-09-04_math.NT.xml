      <title>The growth of Tate-Shafarevich groups of $p$-supersingular elliptic curves over anticyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions at inert primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, and let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field. Consider an odd prime $p$ at which $E$ has good supersingular reduction with $a_p(E)=0$ and which is inert in $K$. Under the assumption that the signed Selmer groups are cotorsion modules over the corresponding Iwasawa algebra, we prove that the Mordell-Weil ranks of $E$ are bounded over any subextensions of the anticyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $K$. Additionally, we provide an asymptotic formula for the growth of the $p$-parts of the Tate-Shafarevich groups of $E$ over these extensions.</description>

      <title>Admissible groups over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a field K, one may ask which finite groups are Galois groups of field extensions L/K such that L is a maximal subfield of a division algebra with center K. This connection between inverse Galois theory and division algebras was first explored by Schacher in the 1960s. In this manuscript we consider this problem when K is a number field. For the case when L/K is assumed to be tamely ramified, we give a complete classification of number fields for which every solvable Sylow-metacyclic group is admissible, extending J. Sonn's result over the field of rational numbers. For the case when L/K is allowed to be wildly ramified, we give a characterization of admissible groups over several classes of number fields, and partial results in other cases.</description>

      <title>Distribution of local signs of modular forms and murmurations of Fourier coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we showed that global root numbers of modular forms are biased toward +1. Together with Pharis, we also showed an initial bias of Fourier coefficients towards the sign of the root number. First, we prove analogous results with respect to local root numbers.
  Second, a subtle correlation between Fourier coefficients and global root numbers, termed murmurations, was recently discovered for elliptic curves and modular forms. We conjecture murmurations in a more general context of different (possibly empty) combinations of local root numbers.
  Last, an appendix corrects a sign error in our joint paper with Pharis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of the $p$-numerical semigroup with $p$-symmetric properties has been introduced. When $p=0$, the classical numerical semigroup with symmetric properties is recovered. In this paper, we further study the $p$-numerical semigroup with $p$-almost symmetric properties. We also give $p$-generalized formulas of Watanabe and Johnson, and introduce $p$-Arf numerical semigroup and study its properties.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of representations for $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p)$ and Galois representations arising from defining ideals of modular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a geometric realization of representations for $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p)$ by the defining ideals of rational models $\mathcal{L}(X(p))$ of modular curves $X(p)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. Hence, for the irreducible representations of $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p)$, whose geometric realizations can be formulated in three different scenarios in the framework of Weil's Rosetta stone: number fields, curves over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and Riemann surfaces. In particular, we show that there exists a correspondence among the defining ideals of modular curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, reducible $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$-rational representations $\pi_p: \text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p) \rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathcal{L}(X(p)))$ of $\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb{F}_p)$, and $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_p)$-rational Galois representations $\rho_p: \text{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}) \rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathcal{L}(X(p)))$ as well as their modular and surjective realization. This leads to a new viewpoint on the last mathematical testament of Galois by Galois representations arising from the defining ideals of modular curves, which leads to a connection with Klein's elliptic modular functions. It is a nonlinear and anabelian counterpart of the global Langlands correspondence among the $\ell$-adic \'{e}tale cohomology of modular curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, i.e., Grothendieck motives ($\ell$-adic system), automorphic representations of $\text{GL}(2, \mathbb{Q})$ and $\ell$-adic representations.</description>

      <title>General effective reduction theory of integral polynomials of given non-zero discriminant and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a survey on the general effective reduction theory of integral polynomials and its applications. We concentrate on results providing the finiteness for the number of `$\mathbb{Z}$-equivalence classes' and `$GL_2(\mathbb{Z})$-equivalence classes' of polynomials of given discriminant. We present the effective finiteness results of Lagrange from 1773 and Hermite from 1848, 1851 for quadratic resp. cubic polynomials. Then we formulate the general ineffective finiteness result of Birch and Merriman from 1972, the general effective finiteness theorems of Gy\H{o}ry from 1973, obtained independently, and of Evertse and Gy\H{o}ry from 1991, and a result of Hermite from 1857 not discussed in the literature before 2023. We briefly outline our effective proofs which depend on Gy\H{o}ry's effective results on unit equations, whose proofs involve Baker's theory of logarithmic forms. Then we focus on our recent joint paper with Bhargava, Remete and Swaminathan from 2023, where Hermite's finiteness result from 1857 involving `Hermite equivalence classes' is compared with the above-mentioned modern results involving $\mathbb{Z}$-equivalence and $GL_2(\mathbb{Z})$-equivalence, and where it is confirmed that Hermite's result from 1857 is much weaker than the modern results mentioned. The results of Gy\H{o}ry from 1973 and Evertse and Gy\H{o}ry from 1991 together established a general effective reduction theory of integral polynomials with given non-zero discriminant, which has significant consequences and applications, including Gy\H{o}ry's effective finiteness theorems from the 1970's on monogenic orders and number fields. We give an overview of these in our paper. In the Appendix we discuss related topics not strictly belonging to the reduction theory of integral polynomials.</description>

      <title>On a family of arithmetic series related to the M\"obius function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P^-(n)$ denote the smallest prime factor of a natural integer $n&gt;1$. Furthermore let $\mu$ and $\omega$ denote respectively the M\"obius function and the number of distinct prime factors function. We show that, given any set ${{\scr P}}$ of prime numbers with a natural density, we have $\sum_{P^-(n)\in \scr P}\mu(n)\omega(n)/n=0$ and provide a effective estimate for the rate of convergence. This extends a recent result of Alladi and Johnson, who considered the case when ${\scr P}$ is an arithmetic progression.</description>

      <title>The entries of the Sinkhorn limit of an $m \times n$ matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Gr\"obner bases to compute the Sinkhorn limit of a positive $3 \times 3$ matrix $A$, showing that the entries are algebraic numbers with degree at most 6. The polynomial equation satisfied by each entry is large, but we show that it has a natural representation in terms of linear combinations of products of minors of $A$. We then use this representation to interpolate a polynomial equation satisfied by an entry of the Sinkhorn limit of a positive $4 \times 4$ matrix. Finally, we use the PSLQ algorithm and 1.5 years of CPU time to formulate a conjecture, up to certain signs that we have not been able to identify, for a polynomial equation satisfied by an entry of the Sinkhorn limit of a positive $m \times n$ matrix. In particular, we conjecture that the entries are algebraic numbers with degree at most $\binom{m + n - 2}{m - 1}$. This degree has a combinatorial interpretation as the number of minors of an $(m - 1) \times (n - 1)$ matrix, and the coefficients reflect new combinatorial structure on sets of minor specifications.</description>

      <title>A refined random matrix model for function field L-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a refinement of the random matrix model for a certain family of $L$-functions over $\mathbb F_q[u]$, using techniques that we hope will eventually apply to an arbitrary family of $L$-functions. This consists of a probability distribution on power series in $q^{-s}$ which combines properties of the characteristic polynomials of Haar-random unitary matrices and random Euler products over $\mathbb F_q[u]$. The support of our distribution is contained in the intersection of the supports of the two original distributions. The expectations of low-degree polynomials in the coefficients of our series approximate the expectations of the same polynomials in the coefficients of random Euler products, while the expectations of high-degree polynomials approximate the expectations of the same polynomials in the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of random matrices. Furthermore, the expectations of absolute powers of our series approximate the Conrey-Farmer-Keating-Rubinstein-Snaith/Andrade-Keating prediction for the moments of our family of $L$-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey some recent developments at the interface of algebraic geometry, surface topology, and the theory of ordinary differential equations. Motivated by "non-abelian" analogues of standard conjectures on the cohomology of algebraic varieties, we study mapping class group actions on character varieties and their algebro-geometric avatar -- isomonodromy differential equations -- from the point of view of both complex and arithmetic geometry. We then collect some open questions and conjectures on these topics. These notes are an extended version of my talk at the April 2024 Current Developments in Mathematics conference at Harvard.</description>

      <title>Universality theorems for zeros of random real polynomials with fixed coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a monic polynomial of degree $n$ whose subleading coefficients are independent, identically distributed, nondegenerate random variables having zero mean, unit variance, and finite moments of all orders, and let $m \geq 0$ be a fixed integer. We prove that such a random monic polynomial has exactly $m$ real zeros with probability $n^{-b+o(1)}$ as $n\to \infty$ through integers of the same parity as $m$, where $b \approx 0.76$ is a positive constant. More generally, we determine conditions under which a similar asymptotic formula describes the corresponding probability for families of random real polynomials with multiple fixed coefficients. Our work extends well-known universality results of Dembo, Poonen, Shao, and Zeitouni, whose considered the family of real polynomials with all coefficients random.
  As a number-theoretic consequence of these results, we deduce that an algebraic integer $\alpha$ of degree $n$ has exactly $m$ real Galois conjugates with probability $n^{-b+o(1)}$, when such $\alpha$ are ordered by the heights of their minimal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Integer matrices with a given characteristic polynomial and multiplicative dependence of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.03880v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the set $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb Z; H)$ of $n\times n$-matrices with integer elements of size at most $H$ and obtain a new upper bound on the number of matrices from $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb Z; H)$ with a given characteristic polynomial $f \in \mathbb Z[X]$, which is uniform with respect to $f$. This complements the asymptotic formula of A. Eskin, S. Mozes and N. Shah (1996) in which $f$ has to be fixed and irreducible.
  Using this result, among others, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the number of $s$-tuples of matrices from $\mathcal{M}_n(\mathbb Z; H)$, satisfying various multiplicative relations, including multiplicative dependence and bounded generation of a subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb Q)$. These problems generalise those studied in the scalar case $n=1$ by F. Pappalardi, M. Sha, I. E. Shparlinski and C. L. Stewart (2018) with an obvious distinction due to the non-commutativity of matrices.
  Motivated by these problems, we also prove various properties of the variety of complex matrices with fixed characteristic polynomial, including computing the degree of this variety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper, we extend the ADC property to the representation of quadratic lattices by quadratic lattices, which we define as $ n $-ADC-ness. We explore the relationship between $ n$-ADC-ness, $ n $-regularity and $ n $-universality for integral quadratic lattices. Also, for $ n\ge 2 $, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for an integral quadratic lattice over arbitrary non-archimedean local fields to be $ n $-ADC. Moreover, we show that over any algebraic number field $ F $, an integral $ \mathcal{O}_{F} $-lattice with rank $ n+1 $ is $n$-ADC if and only if it is $\mathcal{O}_{F}$-maximal of class number one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entropic doubling $\sigma_{\operatorname{ent}}[X]$ of a random variable $X$ taking values in an abelian group $G$ is a variant of the notion of the doubling constant $\sigma[A]$ of a finite subset $A$ of $G$, but it enjoys somewhat better properties; for instance, it contracts upon applying a homomorphism.
  In this paper we develop further the theory of entropic doubling and give various applications, including:
  (1) A new proof of a result of P\'alv\"olgyi and Zhelezov on the ``skew dimension'' of subsets of $\mathbf{Z}^D$ with small doubling;
  (2) A new proof, and an improvement, of a result of the second author on the dimension of subsets of $\mathbf{Z}^D$ with small doubling;
  (3) A proof that the Polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa conjecture over $\mathbf{F}_2$ implies the (weak) Polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa conjecture over $\mathbf{Z}$.</description>

Abstract: Consider a quartic number field $K$ generated by a root of an irreducible quadrinomial of the form $ F(x)= x^4+ax^3+bx+c \in \Z[x]$. Let $i(K)$ denote the index of $K$. Engstrom \cite{Engstrom} established that $i(K)=2^u \cdot 3^v$ with $u \le 2$ and $v \le 1$. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions on $a$, $b$ and $c$ for $i(K)$ to be divisible by $2$ or $3$, determining the exact corresponding values of $u$ and $v$ in each case.
  In particular, when $i(K) \neq 1$, $K$ cannot be monogenic. We also identify new infinite parametric families of monogenic quartic number fields generated by roots of non-monogenic quadrinomials. We illustrate our results by some computational examples. Our method is based on a theorem of Ore on the decomposition of primes in number fields \cite{Nar,O}.</description>

      <title>The power operation in the Galois cohomology of a reductive group over a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07659v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a connected reductive group $G$ over a local or global field $K$, we define a diamond (or power) operation $$(\xi,n)\mapsto \xi^{\Diamond n}\,\colon\, H^1(K,G)\times {\mathbb Z}\to H^1(K,G)$$ of raising to power $n$ in the Galois cohomology pointed set (this operation is new when $K$ is a number field).
  We show that this power operation has many functorial properties. When $G$ is a torus, the set $H^1(K,G)$ has a natural group structure, and $\xi^{\Diamond n}$ then coincides with the $n$-th power of $\xi$ in this group.
  Using this power operation, for a cohomology class $\xi$ in $H^1(K,G)$ over local or global field, we define the period ${\rm per}(\xi)$ to be the least integer $n\ge 1$ such that $\xi^{\Diamond n}=1$. We define the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite extensions $L/K$ splitting $\xi$. The period and index of a cohomology class generalize the period and index a central simple algebra over $K$. For any connected reductive group $G$ defined over a local or global field $K$, we show that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ and that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ and ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ always have the same prime factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of integral solutions to a system of diagonal equations. We obtain an asymptotic formula for the number of solutions with variables restricted to smooth numbers as well. We improve the required number of variables compared to previous results by incorporating the recent progress on Waring's problem and the resolution of the main conjecture in Vinogradov's mean value theorem.</description>

      <title>On the existence of magic squares of powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any $d \geq 2$, we prove that there exists an integer $n_0(d)$ such that there exists an $n \times n$ magic square of $d^\text{th}$ powers for all $n \geq n_0(d)$. In particular, we establish the existence of an $n \times n$ magic square of squares for all $n \geq 4$, which settles a conjecture of V\'{a}rilly-Alvarado.
  All previous approaches had been based on constructive methods and the existence of $n \times n$ magic squares of $d^\text{th}$ powers had only been known for sparse values of $n$. We prove our result by the Hardy-Littlewood circle method, which in this setting essentially reduces the problem to finding a sufficient number of disjoint linearly independent subsets of the columns of the coefficient matrix of the equations defining magic squares. We prove an optimal (up to a constant) lower bound for this quantity.</description>

      <title>Derivatives of theta functions as Traces of Partition Eisenstein series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08437v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his "lost notebook'', Ramanujan used iterated derivatives of two theta functions to define sequences of $q$-series $\{U_{2t}(q)\}$ and $\{V_{2t}(q)\}$ that he claimed to be quasimodular. We give the first explicit proof of this claim by expressing them in terms of "partition Eisenstein series'', extensions of the classical Eisenstein series $E_{2k}(q)$ defined by $$\lambda=(1^{m_1}, 2^{m_2},\dots, n^{m_n}) \vdash n \ \ \ \ \ \longmapsto \ \ \ \ \ E_{\lambda}(q):= E_2(q)^{m_1} E_4(q)^{m_2}\cdots E_{2n}(q)^{m_n}. $$ For functions $\phi : \mathcal{P}\mapsto \mathbb{C}$ on partitions, the weight $2n$ partition Eisenstein trace is $$ \text{Tr}_n(\phi;q):=\sum_{\lambda \vdash n} \phi(\lambda)E_{\lambda}(q). $$ For all $t$, we prove that $U_{2t}(q)=\text{Tr}_t(\phi_U;q)$ and $V_{2t}(q)=\text{Tr}_t(\phi_V;q),$ where $\phi_U$ and $\phi_V$ are natural partition weights, giving the first explicit quasimodular formulas for these series.</description>

      <title>Additive number theory and the Dyson transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1942 Mann solved a famous problem, the $\alpha+\beta$ conjecture, about the lower bound of the Shnirel'man density of sums of sets of positive integers. In 1945, Dyson generalized Mann's theorem and obtained a lower bound for the Shnirel'man density of rank $r$ sumsets. His proof introduced the Dyson transform, an important tool in additive number theory. This paper explains the background of Dyson's work, gives Dyson's proof of his theorem, and includes several applications of the Dyson transform, such as Kneser's inequality for sums of finite subsets of an arbitrary additive abelian group.</description>

      <title>Traces of partition Eisenstein series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study "partition Eisenstein series", extensions of the Eisenstein series $G_{2k}(\tau),$ defined by $$\lambda=(1^{m_1}, 2^{m_2},\dots, k^{m_k}) \vdash k \ \ \ \ \ \longmapsto \ \ \ \ \ G_{\lambda}(\tau):= G_2(\tau)^{m_1} G_4(\tau)^{m_2}\cdots G_{2k}(\tau)^{m_k}. $$ For functions $\phi: \mathcal{P}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ on partitions, the weight $2k$ "partition Eisenstein trace" is the quasimodular form $$ {\mathrm{Tr}}_k(\phi;\tau):=\sum_{\lambda \vdash k} \phi(\lambda)G_{\lambda}(\tau). $$ These traces give explicit formulas for some well-known generating functions, such as the $k$th elementary symmetric functions of the inverse points of 2-dimensional complex lattices $\mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}\tau,$ as well as the $2k$th power moments of the Andrews-Garvan crank function. To underscore the ubiquity of such traces, we show that their generalizations give the Taylor coefficients of generic Jacobi forms with torsional divisor.</description>

      <title>Mumford-Tate groups of 1-motives and Weil pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16301v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the geometry of a 1-motive $M$ (that is existence of endomorphisms and relations between the points defining it) determines the dimension of its motivic Galois group ${\mathcal{G}}{\mathrm{al}}_{\mathrm{mot}}(M)$. Fixing periods matrices $\Pi_M$ and $\Pi_{M^*}$ associated respectively to a 1-motive $M$ and to its Cartier dual $M^*,$ we describe the action of the Mumford-Tate group of $M$ on these matrices. In the semi-elliptic case, according to the geometry of $M$ we classify polynomial relations between the periods of $M$ and we compute exhaustively the matrices representing the Mumford-Tate group of $M$. This representation brings new light on Grothendieck periods conjecture in the case of 1-motives.</description>

      <title>Lattice sums of $I$-Bessel functions, theta functions, linear codes and heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a certain type of identities on sums of $I$-Bessel functions on lattices, previously given by G. Chinta, J. Jorgenson, A. Karlsson and M. Neuhauser. Moreover we prove that, with continuum limit, the transformation formulas of theta functions such as the Dedekind eta function can be given by $I$-Bessel lattice sum identities with characters. We consider analogues of theta functions of lattices coming from linear codes and show that sums of $I$-Bessel functions defined by linear codes can be expressed by complete weight enumerators. We also prove that $I$-Bessel lattice sums appear as solutions of heat equations on general lattices. As a further application, we obtain an explicit solution of the heat equation on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ whose initial condition is given by a linear code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an alternative derivation of $(N,N)$-isogenies between fast Kummer surfaces which complements existing works based on the theory oftheta functions. We use this framework to produce explicit formulae for the case of $N = 3$, and show that the resulting algorithms are more efficient than all prior $(3, 3)$-isogeny algorithms.</description>
