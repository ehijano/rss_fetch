      <title>SUSY Quantum Mechanics, (non)-Analyticity and $\ldots$ Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown by analyzing the $1D$ Schr\"odinger equation the discontinuities in the coupling constant can occur in both the energies and the eigenfunctions. Surprisingly, those discontinuities, which are present in the energies versus the coupling constant, are of three types only: (i) discontinuous energies (similar to the 1st order phase transitions), (ii) discontinuous first derivative in the energy while the energy is continuous (similar to the 2nd order phase transitions), (ii) the energy and all its derivatives are continuous but the functions are different below and above the point of discontinuity (similar to the infinite order phase transitions). Supersymmetric (SUSY) Quantum Mechanics provides a convenient framework to study this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>An elementary construction of the GKSL master equation for N-level systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GKSL master equation for N-level systems provides a necessary and sufficient form for the generator of a quantum dynamical semigroup in the Schrodinger picture where the underlying Hilbert space is $\mathbb{C}^N$. In this paper we provide a detailed, self-contained, and elementary construction of the GKSL master equation for an N-level system. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for forms of generators of semigroups which have some, but not all, of the defining properties of quantum dynamical semigroups. We do this in such a way to illuminate how each defining property of a quantum dynamical semigroup contributes to the form of the generators.</description>

      <title>Propagators in curved spacetimes from operator theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss two distinct operator-theoretic settings useful for describing (or defining) propagators associated with a scalar Klein-Gordon field on a Lorentzian manifold $M$. Typically, we assume that $M$ is globally hyperbolic, but we will also consider examples where it is not. Here, the term propagator refers to any Green function or bisolution of the Klein-Gordon equation pertinent to Classical or Quantum Field Theory. These include the forward, backward, Feynman and anti-Feynman propagtors, the Pauli-Jordan function and 2-point functions of Fock states. The first operator-theoretic setting is based on the Hilbert space $L^2(M)$. This setting leads to the definition of the operator-theoretic Feynman and anti-Feynman propagators, which often (but not always) coincide with the so-called out-in Feynman and in-out anti-Feynman propagator. On some special spacetimes, the sum of the operator-theoretic Feynman and anti-Feynman propagator equals the sum of the forward and backward propagator. This is always true on static stable spacetimes and, curiously, in some other cases as well. The second setting is the Krein space $\mathcal{W}_{\rm KG}$ of solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation. Each linear operator on $\mathcal{W}_{\rm KG}$ corresponds to a bisolution of the Klein-Gordon equation, which we call its Klein-Gordon kernel. In particular, the Klein-Gordon kernels of projectors onto maximal uniformly definite subspaces are 2-point functions of Fock states, and the Klein-Gordon kernel of the identity is the Pauli-Jordan function. After a general discussion, we review a number of examples: static and asymptotically static spacetimes, FLRW spacetimes (reducible by a mode decomposition to 1-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators), deSitter space and anti-deSitter space, both proper and its universal cover.</description>

      <title>Spectral properties of hexagonal lattices with the -R coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the spectrum of the hexagonal lattice graph with a vertex coupling which manifestly violates the time reversal invariance and at high energies it asymptotically decouples edges at even degree vertices; a comparison is made to the case when such a decoupling occurs at odd degree vertices. We also show that the spectral character does not change if the equilateral elementary cell of the lattice is dilated to have three different edge lengths, except that flat bands are absent if those are incommensurate.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimal transport with convex regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to settle the study of non-commutative optimal transport problems with convex regularization, in their static and finite-dimensional formulations. We consider both the balanced and unbalanced problem and show in both cases a duality result, characterizations of minimizers (for the primal) and maximizers (for the dual). An important tool we define is a non-commutative version of the classical $(c,\psi)$-transforms associated with a general convex regularization, which we employ to prove the convergence of Sinkhorn iterations in the balanced case. Finally, we show the convergence of the unbalanced transport problems towards the balanced one, as well as the convergence of transforms, as the marginal penalization parameters go to $+\infty$.</description>

      <title>The loop equations for noncommutative geometries on quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a path integral over Dirac operators that averages over noncommutative geometries on a fixed graph, as the title reveals, partially using quiver representations. We prove algebraic relations that are satisfied by the expectation value of the respective observables, computed in terms of integrals over unitary groups, with weights given by the spectral action. These equations generalise the Makeenko-Migdal equations -- the constraints of lattice gauge theory -- from lattices to arbitrary graphs. As a perspective, these constraints are combined with positivity conditions (on a matrix of parametrised by composition of Wilson loops). A simple example of this combination known as `bootstrap' is fully worked out.</description>

      <title>Quadratic algebras and idempotent braided sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Yang-Baxter algebras $A(K,X,r)$ associated to finite set-theoretic solutions $(X,r)$ of the braid relations. We introduce an equivalent set of quadratic relations $\Re\subseteq G$, where $G$ is the reduced Gr\"obner basis of $(\Re)$. We show that if $(X,r)$ is left-nondegenerate and idempotent then $\Re= G$ and the Yang-Baxter algebra is PBW. We use graphical methods to study the global dimension of PBW algebras in the $n$-generated case and apply this to Yang-Baxter algebras in the left-nondegenerate idempotent case. We study the $d$-Veronese subalgebras for a class of quadratic algebras and use this to show that for $(X,r)$ left-nondegenerate idempotent, the $d$-Veronese subalgebra $A(K,X,r)^{(d)}$ can be identified with $A(K,X,r^{(d)})$, where $(X,r^{(d)})$ are all left-nondegenerate idempotent solutions. We determined the Segre product in the left-nondegenerate idempotent setting. Our results apply to a previously studied class of `permutation idempotent' solutions, where we show that all their Yang-Baxter algebras for a given cardinality of $X$ are isomorphic and are isomorphic to their $d$-Veronese subalgebras. In the linearised setting, we construct the Koszul dual of the Yang-Baxter algebra and the Nichols-Woronowicz algebra in the idempotent case, showing that the latter is quadratic. We also construct noncommutative differentials on some of these quadratic algebras.</description>

      <title>Parameter Analysis in Continuous Data Assimilation for Various Turbulence Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct parameter estimation analysis on a data assimilation algorithm for two turbulence models: the simplified Bardina model and the Navier-Stokes-{\alpha} model. Our approach involves creating an approximate solution for the turbulence models by employing an interpolant operator based on the observational data of the systems. The estimation depends on the parameter alpha in the models. Additionally, numerical simulations are presented to validate our theoretical results</description>

      <title>From local isometries to global symmetries: bridging Killing vectors and Lie algebras through induced vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of symmetries in the realm of manifolds can be approached in two different ways. On one hand, Killing vector fields on a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold correspond to the directions of local isometries within it. On the other hand, from an algebraic perspective, global symmetries of such manifolds are associated with group elements. Although the connection between these two concepts is well established in the literature, this work aims to build an unexplored bridge between the Killing vector fields of n-dimensional maximally symmetric spaces and their corresponding isometry Lie groups, anchoring primarily on the definition of induced vector fields. As an application of our main result, we explore two specific examples: the three-dimensional Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the rotational invariance of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice we express Smirnov's edge parafermionic observable as a sum of two new edge observables. With the help of these two new edge observables we can apply the discrete harmonic analysis and conformal mapping theory to prove the convergence of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice to the trace of $SLE_6$ as the mesh size of the lattice tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Quantization of the Hamilton Equations of Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in quantum mechanics is finding the correct quantum image of a classical observable that would correspond to experimental measurements. We investigate for the appropriate quantization rule that would yield a Hamiltonian that obeys the quantum analogue of Hamilton's equations of motion, which includes differentiation of operators with respect to another operator. To give meaning to this type of differentiation, Born and Jordan established two definitions called the differential quotients of first type and second type. In this paper we modify the definition for the differential quotient of first type and establish its consistency with the differential quotient of second type for different basis operators corresponding to different quantizations. Theorems and differentiation rules including differentiation of operators with negative powers and multiple differentiation were also investigated. We show that the Hamiltonian obtained from Weyl, simplest symmetric, and Born-Jordan quantization all satisfy the required algebra of the quantum equations of motion.</description>

      <title>Generating customized field concentration via virtue surface transmission resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for generating strong customized field concentration locally around the inhomogeneous medium inclusion via surface transmission resonance. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we show that for a given inclusion embedded in an otherwise uniformly homogeneous background space, we can design an incident field to generate strong localized field concentration at any specified places around the inclusion. The aforementioned customized field concentration is crucially reliant on the peculiar spectral and geometric patterns of certain transmission eigenfunctions. Secondly, we prove the existence of a sequence of transmission eigenfunctions for a specific wavenumber and they exhibit distinct surface resonant behaviors, accompanying strong surface-localization and surface-oscillation properties. These eigenfunctions as the surface transmission resonant modes fulfill the requirement for generating the field concentration.</description>

Abstract: For a given region, and specified boundary flux and density rate of an extensive property, the optimal flux field that satisfies the balance conditions is considered. The optimization criteria are the $L^{p}$-norm and a Sobolev-like norm of the flux field. Finally, the capacity of the region to accommodate various boundary fluxes and density rates is defined and analyzed.</description>

      <title>A DNN Biophysics Model with Topological and Electrostatic Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this project, we provide a deep-learning neural network (DNN) based biophysics model to predict protein properties. The model uses multi-scale and uniform topological and electrostatic features generated with protein structural information and force field, which governs the molecular mechanics. The topological features are generated using the element specified persistent homology (ESPH) while the electrostatic features are fast computed using a Cartesian treecode. These features are uniform in number for proteins with various sizes thus the broadly available protein structure database can be used in training the network. These features are also multi-scale thus the resolution and computational cost can be balanced by the users. The machine learning simulation on over 4000 protein structures shows the efficiency and fidelity of these features in representing the protein structure and force field for the predication of their biophysical properties such as electrostatic solvation energy. Tests on topological or electrostatic features alone and the combination of both showed the optimal performance when both features are used. This model shows its potential as a general tool in assisting biophysical properties and function prediction for the broad biomolecules using data from both theoretical computing and experiments.</description>

      <title>Loop corrections for hard spheres in Hamming space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We begin with an exact expression for the entropy of a system of hard spheres within the Hamming space. This entropy relies on probability marginals, which are determined by an extended set of Belief Propagation (BP) equations. The BP probability marginals are functions of auxiliary variables which are introduced to model the effects of loopy interactions on a tree-structured interaction graph. We explore various reasonable and approximate probability distributions, ensuring they align with the exact solutions of the BP equations. Our approach is based on an ansatz of (in)homogeneous cavity marginals respecting the permutation symmetry of the problem. Through thorough analysis, we aim to minimize errors in the BP equations. Our findings support the conjecture that the maximum packing density asymptotically conforms to the lower bound proposed by Gilbert and Varshamov, further validated by the solution of the loopy BP equations.</description>

      <title>On moments of the derivative of CUE characteristic polynomials and the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of $N \times N$ Haar distributed unitary matrices. In the limit $N \to \infty$, we give a formula for general non-integer moments of the derivative for values of the spectral variable inside the unit disc. The formula we obtain is given in terms of a confluent hypergeometric function. We give an extension of this result to joint moments taken at different points, again valid for non-integer moment orders. For integer moments, our results simplify and are expressed as a single Laguerre polynomial. Using these moment formulae, we derive the mean counting function of zeros of the derivative in the limit $N \to \infty$. This motivated us to consider related questions for the derivative of the Riemann zeta function. Assuming the Lindel\"of hypothesis, we show that integer moments away from but approaching the critical line agree with our random matrix results. Within random matrix theory, we obtain an explicit expression for the integer moments, for finite matrix size, as a sum over partitions. We use this to obtain asymptotic formulae in a regime where the spectral variable approaches or is on the unit circle.</description>

      <title>Massless field equations for spin 3/2 in dimension 6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Main topic of the paper is a study of properties of massless fields of spin 3/2 in its Euclidean version. A lot of information is available already for massless fields in dimension 4. Here, we concentrate on dimension 6 and we are using the fact that the group SL(4,C) is isomorphic with the group Spin(6,C). It makes it possible to use tensor formalism for massless fields. Main problems treated in the paper are a description of fields which need to be considered in the spin 3/2 case, a suitable choice of equations they should satisfy, irreducibility of homogeneous solutions of massless field equations, the Fischer decomposition and the Howe duality for such fields.</description>

Abstract: Physical systems transition between states with finite speed that is limited by energetic costs. In this work, we derive bounds on transition times for general Langevin systems that admit a decomposition into reversible and irreversible dynamics, in terms of the Wasserstein distance between states and the energetic costs associated with respective reversible and irreversible currents. For illustration we discuss Brownian particles subject to arbitrary forcing and an RLC circuit with time-varying inductor.</description>

      <title>Adinkras and Pure Spinors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nilpotence variety for extended supersymmetric quantum mechanics is a cone over a quadric in projective space. The pure spinor correspondence, which relates the description of off-shell supermultiplets to the classification of modules over the corresponding hypersurface ring, reduces to a classical problem of linear algebra. Spinor bundles, which correspond to maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules, serve as basic building blocks. Koszul duality appears as a deformed version of the Bernstein-Gel'fand-Gel'fand correspondence that we make fully concrete. We illustrate in numerous examples the close relationship between these connections and the powerful graphical technology of Adinkras, which appear as a decategorification of special complexes on quadrics. We emphasize the role of R-symmetry for recovering higher-dimensional gauge and gravity multiplets.</description>

      <title>Causal Fermion Systems as an Effective Collapse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that, in the non-relativistic limit, causal fermion systems give rise to an effective collapse theory. The nonlinear and stochastic correction terms to the Schr\"odinger equation are derived from the causal action principle. The dynamics of the statistical operator is described by a deterministic equation of Kossakowski-Lindblad form. Moreover, the quantum state undergoes a dynamical collapse compatible with the Born rule. The effective model has similarities with the continuous spontaneous localization model, but differs from it by a conservation law for the probability integral as well as a non-locality in time on a microscopic length scale $\ell_{\min}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every operator in $L^{2}$ has an associated measure on a space of functions and prove that it can be used to find solutions to abstract Cauchy problems, including partial differential equations. We find explicit formulas to compute the integral of functions with respect to this measure and develop approximate formulas in terms of a perturbative expansion. We show that this method can be used to represent solutions of classical equations, such as the diffusion and Fokker-Plank equations, as Wiener and Martin-Siggia-Rose-Jansen-de Dominics integrals, and propose an extension to paths in infinite dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>Inevitability of knowing less than nothing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A colloquial interpretation of entropy is that it is the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of a random experiment. Conditional entropy is then interpreted as the knowledge gained upon learning the outcome of one random experiment after learning the outcome of another, possibly statistically dependent, random experiment. In the classical world, entropy and conditional entropy take only non-negative values, consistent with the intuition that one has regarding the aforementioned interpretations. However, for certain entangled states, one obtains negative values when evaluating commonly accepted and information-theoretically justified formulas for the quantum conditional entropy, leading to the confounding conclusion that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. Here, we introduce a physically motivated framework for defining quantum conditional entropy, based on two simple postulates inspired by the second law of thermodynamics (non-decrease of entropy) and extensivity of entropy, and we argue that all plausible definitions of quantum conditional entropy should respect these two postulates. We then prove that all plausible quantum conditional entropies take on negative values for certain entangled states, so that it is inevitable that one can know less than nothing in the quantum world. All of our arguments are based on constructions of physical processes that respect the first postulate, the one inspired by the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Geometrical description and Faddeev-Jackiw quantization of electrical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12252v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain (canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. We also propose a specific assignment of topology for the branch variables of energetic elements, that when used as input to the procedure gives results consistent with classical descriptions as well as with spectra of more involved quantum circuits. This work unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic implementation of multipartite quantum channels and other quantum instruments using local operations and classical communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a necessary condition that a quantum channel on a multipartite system may be approximated arbitrarily closely using local operations and classical communication (LOCC). We then extend those arguments to obtain a condition that applies to all quantum instruments, which range from the most refined case, a generalized measurement, to the most coarse-grained, which is a quantum channel. We illustrate these results by a detailed analysis of a quantum instrument that is known not to be implementable by LOCC, but which can be arbitrarily closely approximated within that framework. As one outgrowth of this analysis, we find a quantum measurement that falls into the same category: it cannot be implemented exactly by LOCC, but can be approximated by LOCC arbitrarily closely. This measurement has an infinite number of outcomes, leaving open the question as to whether or not there exists a measurement within this same category but having only a finite number of outcomes.</description>

      <title>A particle-in-Fourier method with energy conservation for non-periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel particle-in-Fourier (PIF) scheme that extends its applicability to non-periodic boundary conditions. Our method handles free space boundary conditions by replacing the Fourier Laplacian operator in PIF with a mollified Green's function as first introduced by Vico-Greengard-Ferrando. This modification yields highly accurate free space solutions to the Vlasov-Poisson system, while still maintaining energy conservation up to an error bounded by the time step size. We also explain how to extend our scheme to arbitrary Dirichlet boundary conditions via standard potential theory, which we illustrate in detail for Dirichlet boundary conditions on a circular boundary. We support our approach with proof-of-concept numerical results from two-dimensional plasma test cases to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and conservation properties of the scheme. By avoiding grid heating and finite grid instability we are able to show an order of magnitude speedup compared to the standard PIC scheme for a long time integration cyclotron simulation.</description>

      <title>A Review of Stable, Traversable Wormholes in f (R) Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proven that in standard Einstein gravity, exotic matter is required to stabilize traversable wormholes. Quantum field theory permits these violations due to the quantum coherent effects found in any quantum field. Even reasonable classical scalar fields violate the energy conditions. In the case of the Casimir effect and squeezed vacuum states, these violations have been experimentally proven. It is advantageous to investigate methods to minimize the use of exotic matter. One such area of interest is extended theories of Einstein gravity. It has been claimed that in some extended theories, stable traversable wormholes solutions can be found without the use of exotic matter. There are many extended theories of gravity, and in this review paper, we first explore modified gravity theories and then explore some wormhole solutions in such theories, including Lovelock gravity and Einstein Dilaton Gauss Bonnet gravity. For completeness, we have also reviewed other wormholes such as Casimir wormholes, dark matter halo wormholes, thin-shell wormholes, and Nonlocal Gravity wormholes, where alternative techniques are used to either avoid or reduce the amount of exotic matter that is required.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Eigenvalue Sums of Schr\"odinger Operators with Complex Radial Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider eigenvalue sums of Schr\"odinger operators $-\Delta+V$ on $L^2(\R^d)$ with complex radial potentials $V\in L^q(\R^d)$, $q&lt;d$. We prove quantitative bounds on the distribution of the eigenvlaues in terms of the $L^q$ norm of $V$. A consequence of our bounds is that, if the eigenvlaues $(z_j)$ accumulates to a point in $(0,\infty)$, then $(\im z_j)$ is summable. The key technical tools are resolvent estimates in Schatten spaces. We show that these resolvent estimates follow from spectral measure estimates by an epsilon removal argument.</description>

      <title>Dualization of ingappabilities through Hilbert-space extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typical dualities in arbitrary dimensions are understood through a Hilbert-space extension method. By these results, we rigorously dualize the quantum ingappabilities to discrete height model in one dimension which is inaccessible by earlier work such as flux-insertion arguments. It turns out that the ingappabilities of quantum discrete height model is protected by an exotic "modulating" translation symmetry, which is a combination of modulating internal symmetry transformation and the conventional lattice translation. It can be also generalize to higher-form gauge fields in arbitrary dimensions, e.g., $\mathbb{Z}$-gauge theory in two dimensions with $\mathbb{Z}$ one-form symmetry and a modulating translation symmetry.</description>
