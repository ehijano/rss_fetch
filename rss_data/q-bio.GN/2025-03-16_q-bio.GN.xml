      <title>Learnable Group Transform: Enhancing Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction for Rice Breeding with Small, Structured Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genotype-to-Phenotype (G2P) prediction plays a pivotal role in crop breeding, enabling the identification of superior genotypes based on genomic data. Rice (Oryza sativa), one of the most important staple crops, faces challenges in improving yield and resilience due to the complex genetic architecture of agronomic traits and the limited sample size in breeding datasets. Current G2P prediction methods, such as GWAS and linear models, often fail to capture complex non-linear relationships between genotypes and phenotypes, leading to suboptimal prediction accuracy. Additionally, population stratification and overfitting are significant obstacles when models are applied to small datasets with diverse genetic backgrounds. This study introduces the Learnable Group Transform (LGT) method, which aims to overcome these challenges by combining the advantages of traditional linear models with advanced machine learning techniques. LGT utilizes a group-based transformation of genotype data to capture spatial relationships and genetic structures across diverse rice populations, offering flexibility to generalize even with limited data. Through extensive experiments on the Rice529 dataset, a panel of 529 rice accessions, LGT demonstrated substantial improvements in prediction accuracy for multiple agronomic traits, including yield and plant height, compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as linear models and recent deep learning approaches. Notably, LGT achieved an R^2 improvement of up to 15\% for yield prediction, significantly reducing error and demonstrating its ability to extract meaningful signals from high-dimensional, noisy genomic data. These results highlight the potential of LGT as a powerful tool for genomic prediction in rice breeding, offering a promising solution for accelerating the identification of high-yielding and resilient rice varieties.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning the ESM2 protein language model to understand the functional impact of missense variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elucidating the functional effect of missense variants is of crucial importance, yet challenging. To understand the impact of such variants, we fine-tuned the ESM2 protein language model to classify 20 protein features at amino acid resolution. We used the resulting models to: 1) identify protein features that are enriched in either pathogenic or benign missense variants, 2) compare the characteristics of proteins with reference or alternate alleles to understand how missense variants affect protein functionality. We show that our model can be used to reclassify some variants of unknown significance. We also demonstrate the usage of our models for understanding the potential effect of variants on protein features.</description>

      <title>Proteome-wide prediction of mode of inheritance and molecular mechanism underlying genetic diseases using structural interactomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genetic diseases can be classified according to their modes of inheritance and their underlying molecular mechanisms. Autosomal dominant disorders often result from DNA variants that cause loss-of-function, gain-of-function, or dominant-negative effects, while autosomal recessive diseases are primarily linked to loss-of-function variants. In this study, we introduce a graph-of-graphs approach that leverages protein-protein interaction networks and high-resolution protein structures to predict the mode of inheritance of diseases caused by variants in autosomal genes, and to classify dominant-associated proteins based on their functional effect. Our approach integrates graph neural networks, structural interactomics and topological network features to provide proteome-wide predictions, thus offering a scalable method for understanding genetic disease mechanisms.</description>
