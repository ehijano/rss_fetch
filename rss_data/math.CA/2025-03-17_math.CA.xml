      <title>Reformulation of $q$-middle convolution and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reformulate the $q$-convolution and the $q$-middle convolution introduced by Sakai and Yamaguchi, and we introduce $q$-deformations of the addition which is related to the gauge-transformation. A merit of the reformulation is the additivity on composition of two $q$-middle convolutions. We obtain sufficient conditions that the Jackson integrals associated with the $q$-convolution converge and satisfy the $q$-difference equation associated with the $q$-convolution. We present several third-order linear $q$-difference equations and solutions of them by using the $q$-middle convolution and the $q$-deformations of the addition.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free estimates for discrete maximal functions related to normalized gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate dimension-free estimates for maximal operators of convolutions with discrete normalized Gaussians (related to the Theta function) in the context of maximal, jump and $r$-variational inequalities on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ spaces. This is the first instance of a discrete operator in the literature where $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ bounds are provided for the entire range of $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. The methods of proof rely on developing robust Fourier methods, which are combined with the fractional derivative, a tool that has not been previously applied to studying similar questions in the discrete setting.</description>

      <title>Curved Kakeya sets and Nikodym problems on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study curved Kakeya sets associated with phase functions satisfying Bourgain's condition. In particular, we show that the analysis of curved Kakeya sets arising from translation-invariant phase functions under Bourgain's condition, as well as Nikodym sets on manifolds with constant sectional curvature, can be reduced to the study of standard Kakeya sets in Euclidean space. Combined with the recent breakthrough of Wang and Zahl, our work establishes the Nikodym conjecture for three-dimensional manifolds with constant sectional curvature.
  Moreover, we consider $(d,k)$-Nikodym sets and $(s,t)$-Furstenberg sets on Riemannian manifolds. For manifolds with constant sectional curvature, we prove that these problems can similarly be reduced to their Euclidean counterparts. As a result, the Furstenberg conjecture on two-dimensional surfaces with constant Gaussian curvature follows from the work of Ren and Wang.</description>

      <title>Numerical and statistical analysis of NeuralODE with Runge-Kutta time integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NeuralODE is one example for generative machine learning based on the push forward of a simple source measure with a bijective mapping, which in the case of NeuralODE is given by the flow of a ordinary differential equation. Using Liouville's formula, the log-density of the push forward measure is easy to compute and thus NeuralODE can be trained based on the maximum Likelihood method such that the Kulback-Leibler divergence between the push forward through the flow map and the target measure generating the data becomes small. In this work, we give a detailed account on the consistency of Maximum Likelihood based empirical risk minimization for a generic class of target measures. In contrast to prior work, we do not only consider the statistical learning theory, but also give a detailed numerical analysis of the NeuralODE algorithm based on the 2nd order Runge-Kutta (RK) time integration. Using the universal approximation theory for deep ReQU networks, the stability and convergence rated for the RK scheme as well as metric entropy and concentration inequalities, we are able to prove that NeuralODE is a probably approximately correct (PAC) learning algorithm.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuous mappings, differential forms and the Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop analysis of H\"older continuous mappings with applications to geometry and topology of the Heisenberg groups. We cover the theory of distributional Jacobians of H\"older continuous mappings and pullbacks of differential forms under H\"older continuous mappings. That includes versions of the change of variables formula and the Stokes theorem for H\"older continuous mappings. The main applications are in the setting of the Heisenberg groups, where we provide a simple proof of a generalization of the Gromov non-embedding theorem, and new results about the H\"older homotopy groups of the Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <title>Assouad dimension of the Takagi function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any integer $b\geq2$ and real series $\{c_n\}$ such that $\sum_{n=0}^\infty|c_n|&lt;\infty$, the generalized Takagi function $f_{{\mathbf c},b}(x)$ is defined by $$
  f_{{\mathbf c},b}(x):=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n\phi(b^n x), \quad x\in [0,1], $$ where $\phi(x)=dist(x,\mathbb{Z})$ is the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer. The collection of functions with the form are called the Takagi class. In this paper, we show that in the case that $\varlimsup_{n \to \infty} b^n |c_n|&lt;\infty$, the Assouad dimension of the graph ${\mathcal G} f_{{\mathbf c},b}=\{(x,f_{{\mathbf c},b}(x)):x\in[0,1]\}$ for the generalized Takagi function $f_{{\mathbf c},b}(x)$ is equal to one, that is, $$ \dim_A {\mathcal G} f_{{\mathbf c},b}=1. $$ In particular, for each $0&lt;a&lt;1$ and integer $b \geq 2$, we define Takagi function $T_{a,b}$ as followed, $$
  T_{a,b}(x):=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a^n \phi(b^n x), \quad x\in [0,1]. $$ Then $
  \dim_A {\mathcal G} T_{a,b}=1 $
if and only if $0&lt;a \leq 1/b$.</description>

      <title>Compactness of commutators of rough singular integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the two-weighted off-diagonal compactness of commutators of rough singular integral operators $T_\Omega$ that are associated with a kernel $\Omega\in L^q(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$. We establish a characterisation of compactness of the commutator $[b,T_\Omega]$ in terms of the function $b$ belonging to a suitable space of functions with vanishing mean oscillation. Our results expand upon the previous compactness characterisations for Calder\'on-Zygmund operators. Additionally, we prove a matrix-weighted compactness result for $[b,T_\Omega]$ by applying the so-called matrix-weighted Kolmogorov-Riesz theorem.</description>

      <title>Interior Schauder estimates for fractional elliptic equations in nondivergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain sharp interior Schauder estimates for solutions to nonlocal Poisson problems driven by fractional powers of nondivergence form elliptic operators $(-a^{ij}(x) \partial_{ij})^s$, for $0&lt;s&lt;1$, in bounded domains under minimal regularity assumptions on the coefficients $a^{ij}(x)$. Solutions to the fractional problem are characterized by a local degenerate/singular extension problem. We introduce a novel notion of viscosity solutions for the extension problem and implement Caffarelli's perturbation methodology in the corresponding degenerate/singular Monge--Amp\`ere geometry to prove Schauder estimates in the extension. This in turn implies interior Schauder estimates for solutions to the fractional nonlocal equation. Furthermore, we prove a new Hopf lemma, the interior Harnack inequality and H\"older regularity in the Monge--Amp\`ere geometry for viscosity solutions to the extension problem.</description>

      <title>Linear Instability of the Prandtl Equations via Hypergeometric Functions and the Harmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a deep connection between the Prandtl equations linearised around a quadratic shear flow, confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind, and the Schr\"odinger operator. Our first result concerns an ODE and a spectral condition derived in [10], associated with unstable quasi-eigenmodes of the Prandtl equations. We entirely determine the space of solutions in terms of Kummer's functions. By classifying their asymptotic behaviour, we verify that the spectral condition has a unique, explicitly determined pair of eigenvalue and eigenfunction, the latter being expressible as a combination of elementary functions. Secondly, we prove that any quasi-eigenmode solution of the linearised Prandtl equations around a quadratic shear flow can be explicitly determined from algebraic eigenfunctions of the Schr\"odinger operator with quadratic potential. We show finally that the obtained analytical formulation of the velocity align with previous numerical simulations in the literature.</description>
