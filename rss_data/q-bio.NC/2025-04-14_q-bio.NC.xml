      <title>Stability Control of Metastable States as a Unified Mechanism for Flexible Temporal Modulation in Cognitive Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible modulation of temporal dynamics in neural sequences underlies many cognitive processes. For instance, we can adaptively change the speed of motor sequences and speech. While such flexibility is influenced by various factors such as attention and context, the common neural mechanisms responsible for this modulation remain poorly understood. We developed a biologically plausible neural network model that incorporates neurons with multiple timescales and Hebbian learning rules. This model is capable of generating simple sequential patterns as well as performing delayed match-to-sample (DMS) tasks that require the retention of stimulus identity. Fast neural dynamics establish metastable states, while slow neural dynamics maintain task-relevant information and modulate the stability of these states to enable temporal processing. We systematically analyzed how factors such as neuronal gain, external input strength (contextual cues), and task difficulty influence the temporal properties of neural activity sequences - specifically, dwell time within patterns and transition times between successive patterns. We found that these factors flexibly modulate the stability of metastable states. Our findings provide a unified mechanism for understanding various forms of temporal modulation and suggest a novel computational role for neural timescale diversity in dynamically adapting cognitive performance to changing environmental demands.</description>

      <title>Neural mechanisms of predictive processing: a collaborative community experiment through the OpenScope program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review synthesizes advances in predictive processing within the sensory cortex. Predictive processing theorizes that the brain continuously predicts sensory inputs, refining neuronal responses by highlighting prediction errors. We identify key computational primitives, such as stimulus adaptation, dendritic computation, excitatory/inhibitory balance and hierarchical processing, as central to this framework. Our review highlights convergences, such as top-down inputs and inhibitory interneurons shaping mismatch signals, and divergences, including species-specific hierarchies and modality-dependent layer roles. To address these conflicts, we propose experiments in mice and primates using in-vivo two-photon imaging and electrophysiological recordings to test whether temporal, motor, and omission mismatch stimuli engage shared or distinct mechanisms. The resulting dataset, collected and shared via the OpenScope program, will enable model validation and community analysis, fostering iterative refinement and refutability to decode the neural circuits of predictive processing.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Socioeconomic Status and Depression on The Neural Correlates of Error Monitoring. An Event-Related Potential Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing evidence suggests that neural responses to errors were exaggerated in individuals at risk of depression and anxiety. This phenomenon has led to the possibility that the error-related negativity (ERN), a well-known neural correlate of error monitoring could be used as a diagnostic tool for several psychological disorders. However, conflicting evidence between psychopathology and the ERN suggests that this phenomenon is modulated by variables are yet to be identified. Socioeconomic status (SES) could potentially play a role in the relationship between the ERN and psychopathological disorders, given that SES is known to be associated with depression and anxiety. In the current study, we first tested whether SES was related to ERN amplitude. Second, we examined whether the relationship between the ERN and depression was explained by differences in SES. We measured error-related negativity (ERN) from a sample of adult participants from low to high socioeconomic backgrounds while controlling their depression scores. Results show that SES correlated with variations in ERN amplitude. Specifically, we found that low-SES individuals had a larger ERN than wealthier individuals. In addition, the relationship between depression and the ERN was fully accounted for by variations in SES. Overall, our results indicate that SES predicts neural responses to errors. Findings also indicate that the link between depression and ERN may be the result of SES variations. Future research examining the links between psychopathology and error monitoring should control SES differences, and caution is needed if they are to be used as a diagnostic tool in low-income communities.</description>

      <title>Sequence models for by-trial decoding of cognitive strategies from neural data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the sequence of cognitive operations that underlie decision-making is a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. Traditional approaches often rely on group-level statistics, which obscure trial-by-trial variations in cognitive strategies. In this study, we introduce a novel machine learning method that combines Hidden Multivariate Pattern analysis with a Structured State Space Sequence model to decode cognitive strategies from electroencephalography data at the trial level. We apply this method to a decision-making task, where participants were instructed to prioritize either speed or accuracy in their responses. Our results reveal an additional cognitive operation, labeled Confirmation, which seems to occur predominantly in the accuracy condition but also frequently in the speed condition. The modeled probability that this operation occurs is associated with higher probability of responding correctly as well as changes of mind, as indexed by electromyography data. By successfully modeling cognitive operations at the trial level, we provide empirical evidence for dynamic variability in decision strategies, challenging the assumption of homogeneous cognitive processes within experimental conditions. Our approach shows the potential of sequence modeling in cognitive neuroscience to capture trial-level variability that is obscured by aggregate analyses. The introduced method offers a new way to detect and understand cognitive strategies in a data-driven manner, with implications for both theoretical research and practical applications in many fields.</description>

      <title>Measuring amount of computation done by C.elegans using whole brain neural activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many dynamical systems found in biology, ranging from genetic circuits to the human brain to human social systems, are inherently computational. Although extensive research has explored their resulting functions and behaviors, the underlying computations often remain elusive. Even the fundamental task of quantifying the \textit{amount} of computation performed by a dynamical system remains under-investigated. In this study we address this challenge by introducing a novel framework to estimate the amount of computation implemented by an arbitrary physical system based on empirical time-series of its dynamics. This framework works by forming a statistical reconstruction of that dynamics, and then defining the amount of computation in terms of both the complexity and fidelity of this reconstruction. We validate our framework by showing that it appropriately distinguishes the relative amount of computation across different regimes of Lorenz dynamics and various computation classes of cellular automata. We then apply this framework to neural activity in \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}, as captured by calcium imaging. By analyzing time-series neural data obtained from the fluorescent intensity of the calcium indicator GCaMP, we find that high and low amounts of computation are required, respectively, in the neural dynamics of freely moving and immobile worms. Our analysis further sheds light on the amount of computation performed when the system is in various locomotion states. In sum, our study refines the definition of computational amount from time-series data and highlights neural computation in a simple organism across distinct behavioral states.</description>

      <title>Selectivity gain in olfactory receptor neuron at optimal odor concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been discovered before (arXiv:2306.07676) that for the selectivity gain due to fluctuations in the process of primary odor reception by olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) there exists an optimal concentration of odors at which increased selectivity is mostly manifested. We estimate by means of numerical simulation what could be the gain value at that concentration by modeling ORN as a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with membrane populated by receptor proteins R which bind and release odor molecules randomly. Each R is modeled as a ligand-gated ion channel, and binding-releasing is modeled as a Markov stochastic process. Possible values for the selectivity gain are calculated for ORN parameters suggested by experimental data.

      <description>arXiv:2504.10053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore how the combination of synthetic biology, neuroscience modeling, and neuromorphic electronic systems offers a new approach to creating an artificial system that mimics the natural sense of smell. We argue that a co-design approach offers significant advantages in replicating the complex dynamics of odor sensing and processing. We investigate a hybrid system of synthetic sensory neurons that provides three key features: a) receptor-gated ion channels, b) interface between synthetic biology and semiconductors and c) event-based encoding and computing based on spiking networks. This research seeks to develop a platform for ultra-sensitive, specific, and energy-efficient odor detection, with potential implications for environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and security.</description>

      <title>The topology of synergy: linking topological and information-theoretic approaches to higher-order interactions in complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of irreducible higher-order interactions has become a core topic of study in complex systems. Two of the most well-developed frameworks, topological data analysis and multivariate information theory, aim to provide formal tools for identifying higher-order interactions in empirical data. Despite similar aims, however, these two approaches are built on markedly different mathematical foundations and have been developed largely in parallel. In this study, we present a head-to-head comparison of topological data analysis and information-theoretic approaches to describing higher-order interactions in multivariate data; with the aim of assessing the similarities and differences between how the frameworks define ``higher-order structures." We begin with toy examples with known topologies, before turning to naturalistic data: fMRI signals collected from the human brain. We find that intrinsic, higher-order synergistic information is associated with three-dimensional cavities in a point cloud: shapes such as spheres are synergy-dominated. In fMRI data, we find strong correlations between synergistic information and both the number and size of three-dimensional cavities. Furthermore, we find that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA preferentially represent higher-order redundancies, and largely fail to preserve both higher-order information and topological structure, suggesting that common manifold-based approaches to studying high-dimensional data are systematically failing to identify important features of the data. These results point towards the possibility of developing a rich theory of higher-order interactions that spans topological and information-theoretic approaches while simultaneously highlighting the profound limitations of more conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Contribute to balance, wire in accordance: Emergence of backpropagation from a simple, bio-plausible neuroplasticity rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) has been pivotal in advancing machine learning and remains essential in computational applications and comparative studies of biological and artificial neural networks. Despite its widespread use, the implementation of BP in the brain remains elusive, and its biological plausibility is often questioned due to inherent issues such as the need for symmetry of weights between forward and backward connections, and the requirement of distinct forward and backward phases of computation. Here, we introduce a novel neuroplasticity rule that offers a potential mechanism for implementing BP in the brain. Similar in general form to the classical Hebbian rule, this rule is based on the core principles of maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs as well as on retrograde signaling, and operates over three progressively slower timescales: neural firing, retrograde signaling, and neural plasticity. We hypothesize that each neuron possesses an internal state, termed credit, in addition to its firing rate. After achieving equilibrium in firing rates, neurons receive credits based on their contribution to the E-I balance of postsynaptic neurons through retrograde signaling. As the network's credit distribution stabilizes, connections from those presynaptic neurons are strengthened that significantly contribute to the balance of postsynaptic neurons. We demonstrate mathematically that our learning rule precisely replicates BP in layered neural networks without any approximations. Simulations on artificial neural networks reveal that this rule induces varying community structures in networks, depending on the learning rate. This simple theoretical framework presents a biologically plausible implementation of BP, with testable assumptions and predictions that may be evaluated through biological experiments.</description>

      <title>Brain states analysis of EEG predicts multiple sclerosis and mirrors disease duration and burden</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15665v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Any treatment of multiple sclerosis should preserve mental function, considering how cognitive deterioration interferes with quality of life. However, mental assessment is still realized with neuro-psychological tests without monitoring cognition on neurobiological grounds whereas the ongoing neural activity is readily observable and readable.
  Objectives: The proposed method deciphers electrical brain states which as multi-dimensional cognetoms quantitatively discriminate normal from pathological patterns in an EEG.
  Methods: Baseline recordings from a prior EEG study of 93 subjects, 37 with MS, were analyzed. Spectral bands served to compute cognetoms and categorize subsequent feature combination sets.
  Results: A significant correlation arose between brain states predictors, clinical data and disease duration. Using cognetoms and spectral bands, a cross-sectional comparison separated patients from controls with a precision of 82% while using bands alone arrived at 64%.
  Conclusions: Brain states analysis successfully distinguishes controls from patients with MS. The congruity with disease duration is a neurobiological indicator for disease accumulation over time. Our results imply that data-driven comparisons of EEG data may complement customary diagnostic methods in neurology and psychiatry. However, thinking ahead for quantitative monitoring of disease time course and treatment efficacy, we hope to have established the analytic principles applicable to longitudinal clinical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal neuroimaging modeling has becomes a widely used approach but confronts considerable challenges due to heterogeneity, which encompasses variability in data types, scales, and formats across modalities. This variability necessitates the deployment of advanced computational methods to integrate and interpret these diverse datasets within a cohesive analytical framework. In our research, we amalgamate functional magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural MRI into a cohesive framework. This integration capitalizes on the unique strengths of each modality and their inherent interconnections, aiming for a comprehensive understanding of the brain's connectivity and anatomical characteristics. Utilizing the Glasser atlas for parcellation, we integrate imaging derived features from various modalities: functional connectivity from fMRI, structural connectivity from DTI, and anatomical features from sMRI within consistent regions. Our approach incorporates a masking strategy to differentially weight neural connections, thereby facilitating a holistic amalgamation of multimodal imaging data. This technique enhances interpretability at connectivity level, transcending traditional analyses centered on singular regional attributes. The model is applied to the Human Connectome Project's Development study to elucidate the associations between multimodal imaging and cognitive functions throughout youth. The analysis demonstrates improved predictive accuracy and uncovers crucial anatomical features and essential neural connections, deepening our understanding of brain structure and function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human vision is mediated by a complex interconnected network of cortical brain areas that jointly represent visual information. While these areas are increasingly understood in isolation, their representational relationships remain elusive. Here we developed relational neural control (RNC), and used it to investigate the representational relationships for univariate and multivariate fMRI responses of areas across visual cortex. Through RNC we generated and explored in silico fMRI responses for large amounts of images, discovering controlling images that align or disentangle responses across areas, thus indicating their shared or unique representational content. This revealed a typical network-level configuration of representational relationships in which shared or unique representational content varied based on cortical distance, categorical selectivity, and position within the visual hierarchy. Closing the empirical cycle, we validated the in silico discoveries on in vivo fMRI responses from independent subjects. Together, this reveals how visual areas jointly represent the world as an interconnected network.</description>

      <title>Identifying Quantum Mechanical Statistics in Italian Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and empirical investigation of the statistical behaviour of the words in a text produced by human language. To this aim, we analyse the word distribution of various texts of Italian language selected from a specific literary corpus. We firstly generalise a theoretical framework elaborated by ourselves to identify 'quantum mechanical statistics' in large-size texts. Then, we show that, in all analysed texts, words distribute according to 'Bose--Einstein statistics' and show significant deviations from 'Maxwell--Boltzmann statistics'. Next, we introduce an effect of 'word randomization' which instead indicates that the difference between the two statistical models is not as pronounced as in the original cases. These results confirm the empirical patterns obtained in texts of English language and strongly indicate that identical words tend to 'clump together' as a consequence of their meaning, which can be explained as an effect of 'quantum entanglement' produced through a phenomenon of 'contextual updating'. More, word randomization can be seen as the linguistic-conceptual equivalent of an increase of temperature which destroys 'coherence' and makes classical statistics prevail over quantum statistics. Some insights into the origin of quantum statistics in physics are finally provided.</description>

      <title>Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08201</link>

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that large-scale, multi-animal models are powerful tools for characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior. Current large-scale approaches, however, focus exclusively on either predicting neural activity from behavior (encoding) or predicting behavior from neural activity (decoding), limiting their ability to capture the bidirectional relationship between neural activity and behavior. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multimodal, multi-task model that enables simultaneous Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale (NEDS). Central to our approach is a novel multi-task-masking strategy, which alternates between neural, behavioral, within-modality, and cross-modality masking. We pretrain our method on the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) repeated site dataset, which includes recordings from 83 animals performing the same visual decision-making task. In comparison to other large-scale models, we demonstrate that NEDS achieves state-of-the-art performance for both encoding and decoding when pretrained on multi-animal data and then fine-tuned on new animals. Surprisingly, NEDS's learned embeddings exhibit emergent properties: even without explicit training, they are highly predictive of the brain regions in each recording. Altogether, our approach is a step towards a foundation model of the brain that enables seamless translation between neural activity and behavior.</description>

      <title>COMPASS: Computational Mapping of Patient-Therapist Alliance Strategies with Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The therapeutic working alliance is a critical predictor of psychotherapy success. Traditionally, working alliance assessment relies on questionnaires completed by both therapists and patients. In this paper, we present COMPASS, a novel framework to directly infer the therapeutic working alliance from the natural language used in psychotherapy sessions. Our approach leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to analyze session transcripts and map them to distributed representations. These representations capture the semantic similarities between the dialogues and psychometric instruments, such as the Working Alliance Inventory. Analyzing a dataset of over 950 sessions spanning diverse psychiatric conditions -- including anxiety (N=498), depression (N=377), schizophrenia (N=71), and suicidal tendencies (N=12) -- collected between 1970 and 2012, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in providing fine-grained mapping of patient-therapist alignment trajectories, offering interpretable insights for clinical practice, and identifying emerging patterns related to the condition being treated. By employing various deep learning-based topic modeling techniques in combination with prompting generative language models, we analyze the topical characteristics of different psychiatric conditions and how these topics evolve during each turn of the conversation. This integrated framework enhances the understanding of therapeutic interactions, enables timely feedback for therapists on the quality of therapeutic relationships, and provides clear, actionable insights to improve the effectiveness of psychotherapy.</description>

      <title>EEG-based Decoding of Selective Visual Attention in Superimposed Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Selective attention enables humans to efficiently process visual stimuli by enhancing important elements and filtering out irrelevant information. Locating visual attention is fundamental in neuroscience with potential applications in brain-computer interfaces. Conventional paradigms often use synthetic stimuli or static images, but visual stimuli in real life contain smooth and highly irregular dynamics. We show that these irregular dynamics can be decoded from electroencephalography (EEG) signals for selective visual attention decoding. To this end, we propose a free-viewing paradigm in which participants attend to one of two superimposed videos, each showing a center-aligned person performing a stage act. Superimposing ensures that the relative differences in the neural responses are not driven by differences in object locations. A stimulus-informed decoder is trained to extract EEG components correlated with the motion patterns of the attended object, and can detect the attended object in unseen data with significantly above-chance accuracy. This shows that the EEG responses to naturalistic motion are modulated by selective attention. Eye movements are also found to be correlated to the motion patterns in the attended video, despite the spatial overlap with the distractor. We further show that these eye movements do not dominantly drive the EEG-based decoding and that complementary information exists in EEG and gaze data. Moreover, our results indicate that EEG may also capture neural responses to unattended objects. To our knowledge, this study is the first to explore EEG-based selective visual attention decoding on natural videos, opening new possibilities for experiment design.</description>

      <title>Probing Mechanical Reasoning in Large Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanical reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, defined by its ubiquitous yet irreplaceable role in human activities ranging from routine tasks to civil engineering. Embedding machines with mechanical reasoning is therefore an important step towards building human-level artificial intelligence. Here, we leveraged 155 cognitive experiments to test the understanding of system stability, gears and pulley systems, leverage principle, inertia and motion, and fluid mechanics in 26 Vision Language Models (VLMs). Results indicate that VLMs consistently perform worse than humans on all domains, while demonstrate significant difficulty in reasoning about gear systems and fluid mechanics. Notably, their performance on these tasks do not improve as number of parameters increase, suggesting that current attention-based architecture may fail to grasp certain underlying mechanisms required for mechanical reasoning, particularly those pertaining to mental simulations.</description>

      <title>Vision Language Models Know Law of Conservation without Understanding More-or-Less</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00332v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding law of conservation is a critical milestone in human cognitive development considered to be supported by the apprehension of quantitative concepts and the reversibility of operations. To assess whether this critical component of human intelligence has emerged in Vision Language Models, we have curated the ConserveBench, a battery of 365 cognitive experiments across four dimensions of physical quantities: volume, solid quantity, length, and number. The former two involve transformational tasks which require reversibility understanding. The latter two involve non-transformational tasks which assess quantity understanding. Surprisingly, we find that while Vision Language Models are generally good at transformational tasks, they tend to fail at non-transformational tasks. There is a dissociation between understanding the reversibility of operations and understanding the concept of quantity, which both are believed to be the cornerstones of understanding law of conservation in humans. $\href{https://growing-ai-like-a-child.github.io/}{Website}$</description>

      <title>CBraMod: A Criss-Cross Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07236v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.
