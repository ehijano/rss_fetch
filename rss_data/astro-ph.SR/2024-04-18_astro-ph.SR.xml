      <title>Modelling stochastic and quasi-periodic behaviour in stellar time-series: Gaussian process regression versus power-spectrum fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the hunt for an Earth-like exoplanets has intensified in recent years, so has the effort to characterise and model the stellar signals that can hide or mimic small planetary signals. Stellar variability arises from a number of sources, including granulation, supergranulation, oscillations and activity, all of which result in quasi-periodic or stochastic behaviour in photometric and/or radial velocity observations. Traditionally, the characterisation of these signals has mostly been done in the frequency domain. However, the recent development of scalable Gaussian process regression methods makes direct time-domain modelling of stochastic processes a feasible and arguably preferable alternative, obviating the need to estimate the power spectral density of the data before modelling it. In this paper, we compare the two approaches using a series of experiments on simulated data. We show that frequency domain modelling can lead to inaccurate results, especially when the time sampling is irregular. By contrast, Gaussian process regression results are often more precise, and systematically more accurate, in both the regular and irregular time sampling regimes. While this work was motivated by the analysis of radial velocity and photometry observations of main sequence stars in the context of planet searches, we note that our results may also have applications for the study of other types of astrophysical variability such as quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei variability.</description>

      <title>General non-linear fragmentation with discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust grains play a significant role in several astrophysical processes, including gas/dust dynamics, chemical reactions, and radiative transfer. Replenishment of small-grain populations is mainly governed by fragmentation during pair-wise collisions between grains. The wide spectrum of fragmentation outcomes, from complete disruption to erosion and/or mass transfer, can be modelled by the general non-linear fragmentation equation. Efficiently solving this equation is crucial for an accurate treatment of the dust fragmentation in numerical modelling. However, similar to dust coagulation, numerical errors in current fragmentation algorithms employed in astrophysics are dominated by the numerical over-diffusion problem -- particularly in 3D hydrodynamic simulations where the discrete resolution of the mass density distribution tends to be highly limited. With this in mind, we have derived the first conservative form of the general non-linear fragmentation with a mass flux highlighting the mass transfer phenomenon. Then, to address cases of limited mass density resolution, we applied a high-order discontinuous Galerkin scheme to efficiently solve the conservative fragmentation equation with a reduced number of dust bins. An accuracy of 0.1 -1% is reached with 20 dust bins spanning a mass range of 9 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>MINDS: Mid-infrared atomic and molecular hydrogen lines in the inner disk around a low-mass star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to measure the mass accretion rate, the accretion luminosity, and more generally the physical conditions of the warm emitting gas in the inner disk of the very low-mass star 2MASS-J16053215-1933159. We investigate the source mid-infrared spectrum for atomic and molecular hydrogen line emission. We present the full James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) spectrum of the protoplanetary disk around the very low-mass star 2MASS-J16053215-1933159 from the MINDS GTO program, previously shown to be abundant in hydrocarbon molecules. We analyzed the atomic and molecular hydrogen lines in this source by fitting one or multiple Gaussian profiles. We then built a rotational diagram for the H2 lines to constrain the rotational temperature and column density of the gas. Finally, we compared the observed atomic line fluxes to predictions from two standard emission models. We identify five molecular hydrogen pure rotational lines and 16 atomic hydrogen recombination lines. The spectrum indicates optically thin emission for both species. We use the molecular hydrogen lines to constrain the mass and temperature of the warm emitting gas. The HI (7-6) recombination line is used to measure the mass accretion rate and luminosity onto the central source. HI recombination lines can also be used to derive the physical properties of the gas using atomic recombination models. The JWST-MIRI MRS observations for the very low-mass star 2MASS-J16053215-1933159 reveal a large number of emission lines, many originating from atomic and molecular hydrogen because we are able to look into the disk warm molecular layer. Their analysis constrains the physical properties of the emitting gas and showcases the potential of JWST to deepen our understanding of the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks</description>

      <title>Generation of relativistic electrons at the termination shock in the solar flare region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are accompanied by an enhanced emission of electromagnetic waves from the radio up to the gamma-ray range. The associated hard X-ray (HXR) and microwave radiation is generated by energetic electrons, which carry a substantial part of the energy released during a flare. The flare is generally understood as a manifestation of magnetic reconnection in the corona. The so-called standard CSHKP model is one of the most widely accepted models for eruptive flares. The solar flare on September 10, 2017 offers a unique opportunity to study this model. The observations from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) show that 1.6x10^4 electrons with energies &gt;300 keV were generated in the flare region. There are signatures in solar radio and extreme ultraviolet observations as well as numerical simulations that a termination shock (TS) appears in the magnetic reconnection outflow region. Electrons accelerated at the TS can be considered to generate the loop-top HXR sources. In contrast to previous studies, we investigate whether the heating of the plasma at the TS provides enough relativistic electrons needed for the HXR and microwave emission observed during the X8.2 solar flare on September 10, 2017. We studied the heating of the plasma at the TS by evaluating the jump in the temperature across the shock by means of the Rankine-Hugoniot relationships under coronal circumstances measured during that event. The part of relativistic electrons was calculated in the heated downstream region. In the magnetic reconnection outflow region, the plasma is strongly heated at the TS. Thus, there are enough energetic electrons in the tail of the electron distribution function needed for the microwave and HXR emission observed during that event. The generation of relativistic electrons at the TS is a possible mechanism to explain the enhanced microwave and HXR radiation emitted during flares.</description>

      <title>Generation and annihilation of three dimensional magnetic nulls in extrapolated solar coronal magnetic field: Data-based Implicit Large Eddy Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional magnetic nulls are the points where magnetic field vanishes and are preferential sites for magnetic reconnection: a process which converts magnetic energy into heat and accelerates charged particles along with a rearrangement of magnetic field lines. In the solar corona, the reconnections manifest as coronal transients including solar flares, coronal mass ejections and coronal jets. The nulls are generally found to be collocated with complex active regions on the solar photosphere. Extrapolation of magnetic field from corresponding photospheric magnetogram indicate an abundance of these nulls in solar atmosphere. Nevertheless, their generation is still not well understood. Recently, Maurya et al. (2023) have demonstrated magnetic reconnection to be a cause for generation and annihilation of magnetic nulls through magnetohydrodynamics simulation, where the initial magnetic field is idealized to have a single radial null. This article further extends the study in a more realistic scenario where the initial magnetic field is constructed by extrapolating photospheric magnetogram data and hence, incorporates field line complexities inherent to a complex active region. For the purpose, the active region NOAA 11977 hosting a C6.6 class flare is selected. The simulation is initiated using non-force-free extrapolated magnetic field from the photospheric vector magnetogram at around 02:48:00 UT on 17 February 2014, 16 minutes before the flare peak. The generation, annihilation and dynamics of nulls are explored by a complimentary usage of trilinear null detection technique and tracing of magnetic field line dynamics. It is found that the nulls can spontaneously generate/annihilate in pairs while preserving the topological degree and can have observational implications like footpoint brightenings. Magnetic reconnection is found to be the cause of such generation and annihilation.</description>

      <title>Resolved magnetohydrodynamic wave lensing in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic wave lensing, a common physical phenomenon recognized in visible light for centuries, finds extensive applications in manipulating light in optical systems such as telescopes and cameras. Magnetohydrodynamic wave is a common perturbation phenomenon in the corona. By using high spatio-temporal resolution observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, here, we report the observation of a magnetohydrodynamic wave lensing in the highly ionized and magnetized coronal plasma, where quasi-periodic wavefronts emanated from a flare converged at a specific point after traversing a coronal hole. The entire process resembles an electromagnetic wave lensing from the source to the focus. Meanwhile, the magnetohydrodynamic wave lensing is well reproduced through a magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulation with full spatio-temporal resolution. We further investigate potential applications for coronal seismology, as the lensing process encodes information on the Alfv\'en speed, in conjunction with favorable geometric and density variations.</description>

      <title>A method for non-linear inversion of the stellar structure applied to gravity-mode pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for a non-linear asteroseismic inversion suitable for gravity-mode pulsators and apply it to slowly pulsating B-type (SPB) stars. Our inversion method is based on the iterative improvement of a parameterised static stellar structure model, which in turn is based on constraints from the observed oscillation periods. We present tests to demonstrate that the method is successful in recovering the properties of artificial targets both inside and outside the parameter space. We also present a test of our method on the well-studied SPB star KIC 7760680. We believe that this method is promising for carrying out detailed analyses of observations of SPB and $\gamma$ Dor stars and will provide complementary information to evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>A Photoionization model for the Infrared Coronal Line Emission in the Classical Nova V1716 Scorpii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A near-infrared spectrum of nova V1716 Scorpii (PNV J17224490-4137160), a recent bright (V_max = 7.3 mag), Fermi-LAT detected gamma-ray source, was modeled using the photoionization code CLOUDY. Abundances were estimated for He, C, N, O, Si, Al, Mg, Fe, Ne, S, Ca, and P. Notably, P (a factor of 120) and N (a factor of 248) are highly overabundant. It was necessary to assume the ejecta consist of two components (with a cylindrical geometry): a dense component from which the bulk of the H, He, and neutral O~I and N emission arises and a more diffuse component from which most of the coronal lines arise. Some of the coronal lines are found to originate from both the dense and diffuse components. The mass of the ejecta, including neutral and ionized gas, is ~ 4.19e-4 solar masses. Our analysis indicates that in the case of V1716 Sco (which has a carbon-oxygen white dwarf), a fraction of 25% white dwarf matter rather than 50% is favored for the mixing between white dwarf and the accreted envelope before the outburst. This mixing ratio is like that found for Oxygen-Neon novae where a 25% mixing fraction is also indicated. Helium hydride -- the first molecule to form after the Big Bang -- may have formed in the ejecta of V1716 Sco based on photoionization modeling. This prediction suggests that novae may be potential formation sites of this important molecular ion.</description>

      <title>VELOcities of CEpheids (VELOCE) I. High-precision radial velocities of Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This first VELOCE data release comprises 18,225 high-precision RV measurements of 258 bona fide classical Cepheids on both hemispheres collected mainly between 2010 and 2022, alongside 1161 additional observations of 164 other stars. The median per-observation RV uncertainty is 0.037 km/s, and some reach 0.002 km/s. Non-variable standard stars characterize RV zero-point stability and provide a base for future cross-calibrations. We determined zero-point differences between VELOCE and 31 literature data sets using template fitting and measured linear period changes of 146 Cepheids. Seventy six spectroscopic binary Cepheids and 14 candidates are identified using VELOCE data alone and are investigated in detail in a companion paper (VELOCE II). Several new insights into Cepheid pulsations were obtained, including: a) the most detailed description of the Hertzsprung progression by RVs; b) the identification of double-peaked bumps in the RV curve; c) clear evidence that virtually all Cepheids feature spectroscopic variability signals that lead to modulated RV variability. We identified 36 such stars, of which 4 also exhibit orbital motion. Linear radius variations depend strongly on pulsation period and a steep increase in slope of the $\Delta$R/p versus logP-relation is found near 10d, challenging the existence of a tight relation between Baade-Wesselink projection factors and pulsation periods. We investigated the accuracy of RV time series measurements, v$_\gamma$, and RV amplitudes published in Gaia's DR3 and determined an average offset of 0.65 \pm 0.11 km/s relative to VELOCE. We recommend adopting a single set of template correlation parameters for distinct classes of large-amplitude variable stars to avoid systematic offsets in v$_\gamma$ among stars belonging to the same class. Peak-to-peak amplitudes of Gaia RVs exhibit significant (16%) dispersion compared to VELOCE. [abridged]</description>

      <title>A Multiwavelength Survey of Nearby M dwarfs: Optical and Near-Ultraviolet Flares and Activity with Contemporaneous TESS, Kepler/K2, \textit{Swift}, and HST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive multiwavelength investigation into flares and activity in nearby M~dwarf stars. We leverage the most extensive contemporaneous dataset obtained through the Transiting Exoplanet Sky Survey (TESS), Kepler/K2, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (\textit{Swift}), and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), spanning the optical and near-ultraviolet (NUV) regimes. In total, we observed 213 NUV flares on 24 nearby M dwarfs, with $\sim$27\% of them having detected optical counterparts, and found that all optical flares had NUV counterparts. We explore NUV/optical energy fractionation in M dwarf flares. Our findings reveal a slight decrease in the ratio of optical to NUV energies with increasing NUV energies, a trend in agreement with prior investigations on G-K stars' flares at higher energies. Our analysis yields an average NUV fraction of flaring time for M0-M3 dwarfs of 2.1\%, while for M4-M6 dwarfs, it is 5\%. We present an empirical relationship between NUV and optical flare energies and compare to predictions from radiative-hydrodynamic and blackbody models. We conducted a comparison of the flare frequency distribution (FFDs) of NUV and optical flares, revealing the FFDs of both NUV and optical flares exhibit comparable slopes across all spectral subtypes. NUV flares on stars affect the atmospheric chemistry, the radiation environment, and the overall potential to sustain life on any exoplanets they host. We find that early and mid-M dwarfs (M0-M5) have the potential to generate NUV flares capable of initiating abiogenesis.</description>

      <title>On the roles of stellar rotation and binarity in NGC 2423's main-sequence turnoff region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research has shown that many young and intermediate-age clusters (younger than $\sim$2 Gyr) have extended main sequences and main-sequence turnoffs (eMSTOs), which cannot be adequately described by a single isochrone. The reason for the extended main sequences is now known, with the most probable cause being the fast rotation of stars. However, a significant fraction of slowly rotating stars form a younger stellar population than their fast-rotating counterparts, leading to speculation that they have undergone thorough rotational mixing processes internally. One speculation is that a considerable number of slowly rotating stars reside in close binary systems, where tidal forces from companion stars are the cause of their rotational deceleration. In this work, we report a relatively old open star cluster in the Milky Way, NGC 2423 ($\sim$1 Gyrs old), which exhibits an apparent eMSTO. As anticipated, many characteristics of NGC 2423 indicate that its eMSTO is driven by stellar rotations. Our calculations indicate that if slowly rotating stars commonly have a close companion star, they should exhibit significant differences in radial velocities observationally, and binary systems that can be tidally locked within the age of NGC 2423 should have a mass ratio close to 1. However, none of these predictions align with our observations. Interestingly, among the only two equal-mass binary systems in the observed region for which spectroscopic data could be obtained, we discovered that one of them is a tidally locked binary system. This further suggests the validity of our numerical simulation results.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a nearly orthogonal rotator in GX 301--2 with phase-resolved cyclotron resonant scattering features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) are the absorption features in the X-ray spectra of strongly magnetized accretion neutron stars (NSs), which are probably the most reliable probe to the surface magnetic fields of NSs. The high mass X-ray binary GX 301--2 exhibits a very wide, variable and complicated CRSF in the average spectra, which should be two absorption lines based on NuStar and Insight-HXMT observations. With the Insight-HXMT frequent observations, we performed the phase-resolved spectroscopy and confirmed two cyclotron absorption lines in the phase-resolved spectra, with their centroid energy ratio $\sim 1.6-1.7$ in the super-critical luminosity case. A major hindrance in understanding those CRSFs is the very poorly constrained magnetic inclination angle, which is also a fundamental property of a NS and key to understanding the emission characteristics of a pulsar. Comparing the phase-resolved CRSF with simulated X-ray spectra, the magnetic inclination angle is found to be $\gtrsim 70^{\circ}$, i.e., nearly orthogonal between the NS's spin and magnetic axies. The implications of an orthogonal rotator and magnetic structure evolution in the accreting X-ray binary are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Energetic particle acceleration and transport with the novel Icarus$+$PARADISE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of satellites and mankind's growing dependence on technology, there is an increasing awareness of space weather phenomena related to high-energy particles. Shock waves driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and corotating interaction regions (CIRs) occasionally act as potent particle accelerators, generating hazardous solar energetic particles (SEPs) that pose risks to satellite electronics and astronauts. Numerical simulation tools capable of modelling and predicting large SEP events are thus highly demanded. We introduce the new Icarus$+$PARADISE model as an advancement of the previous EUHFORIA$+$PARADISE model. Icarus, based on the MPI-AMRVAC framework, is a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic code that models solar wind configurations from 0.1 au onwards, encompassing transient structures like CMEs or CIRs. Differing from EUHFORIA's uniform-only grid, Icarus incorporates solution adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and grid stretching. The particle transport code PARADISE propagates energetic particles as test particles through these solar wind configurations by solving the focused transport equation in a stochastic manner. We validate our new model by reproducing EUHFORIA+PARADISE results. This is done by modelling the acceleration and transport of energetic particles in a synthetic solar wind configuration containing an embedded CIR. Subsequently, we illustrate how the simulation results vary with grid resolution by employing different levels of AMR. The resulting intensity profiles illustrate increased particle acceleration with higher levels of AMR in the shock region, better capturing the effects of the shock.</description>

      <title>Helicity oscillations in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection of liquid metal in a cell with aspect ratio 0.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present numerical and experimental results on helicity oscillations in a liquid-metal Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convection cell, with an aspect ratio of 0.5. We find that helicity oscillations occur during transitions of flow states that are characterised by significant changes in the Reynolds number. Moreover, we also observe helicity oscillations at flow conditions where the temporal gradient of the change in the Reynolds number is significantly smaller than that of the helicity. Notably, the helicity oscillations observed during the transient double-roll state exhibit characteristics remarkably similar to those associated with the Tayler Instability.</description>

      <title>Star-by-star dynamical evolution of the physical pair of the Collinder 135 and UBC 7 open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper using Gaia DR2 data, we demonstrated that the two closely situated open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 might have formed together about 50 Myr ago. In this work, we performed star-by-star dynamical modelling of the evolution of the open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 from their supposed initial state to their present-day state, reproducing observational distributions of members. Modelling of the Collinder 135 and UBC 7 dynamical evolution was done using the high-order parallel N-body code \phi-GPU with up-to-date stellar evolution. Membership and characteristics of the clusters were acquired based on Gaia DR3 data. The comparison of the present-day radial cumulative star count obtained from the N-body simulations with the current observational data gave us full consistency of the model with observational data, especially in the central 8 pc, where 80% of the stars reside. The proper motion velocity components obtained from the N-body simulations of the stars are also quite consistent with the observed distributions and error bars. These results show that our numerical modelling is able to reproduce the open clusters' current complex 6D observed phase-space distributions with a high level of confidence. Thus, the model demonstrates that the hypothesis of a common origin of Collinder 135 and UBC 7 complies with present-day observational data.</description>

      <title>Missing Metals in DQ Stars; a Compelling Clue to their Origin</title>

Abstract: White dwarf stars frequently experience external pollution by heavy elements, and yet the intrinsically carbon-enriched DQ spectral class members fail to exhibit this phenomenon, representing a decades-old conundrum. This study reports a high-resolution spectroscopic search for Ca II in classical DQ white dwarfs, finding that these stars are stunted both in pollution frequency and heavy element mass fractions, relative to the wider population. Compared to other white dwarf spectral classes, the average external accretion rate is found to be at least three orders of magnitude lower in the DQ stars. Several hypotheses are considered which need to simultaneously account for i) an apparent lack of accreted metals, ii) a dearth of circumstellar planetary material, iii) an observed deficit of unevolved companions in post-common envelope binaries, iv) relatively low helium mass fractions, and remnant masses that appear smaller than for other spectral classes, v) a high incidence of strong magnetism, and vi) modestly older disk kinematics. Only one hypothesis is consistent with all these constraints, suggesting DQ white dwarfs are the progeny of binary evolution that altered both their stellar structures and their circumstellar environments. A binary origin is already suspected for the warmer and more massive DQ stars, and is proposed here as an inclusive mechanism to expose core carbon material, in a potential evolutionary unification for the entire DQ spectral class. In this picture, DQ stars are not descended from DA or DB white dwarfs that commonly host dynamically-active planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Fast and Slow Crystallization-driven Convection in White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate crystallization-driven convection in carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. We present a version of the mixing length theory (MLT) that self-consistently includes the effects of thermal diffusion and composition gradients, and provides solutions for the convective parameters based on the local heat and composition fluxes. Our formulation smoothly transitions between the regimes of fast adiabatic convection at large Peclet number and slow thermohaline convection at low Peclet number. It also allows for both thermally-driven and compositionally-driven convection, including correctly accounting for the direction of heat transport for compositionally-driven convection in a thermally-stable background. We use the MESA stellar evolution code to calculate the composition and heat fluxes during crystallization in different models of cooling white dwarfs, and determine the regime of convection and the convective velocity. We find that convection occurs in the regime of slow thermohaline convection during most of the cooling history of the star. However, in more massive white dwarfs the composition flux is large enough at the onset of crystallization to drive fast overturning convection for a short time ($\sim 10\ \mathrm{Myr}$). We estimate the convective velocities in both of these phases and discuss the implications for explaining observed white dwarf magnetic fields with crystallization-driven dynamos.</description>

      <title>Effect of Systematic Uncertainties on Density and Temperature Estimates in Coronae of Capella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We estimate the coronal density of Capella using the O VII and Fe XVII line systems in the soft X-ray regime that have been observed over the course of the Chandra mission. Our analysis combines measures of error due to uncertainty in the underlying atomic data with statistical errors in the Chandra data to derive meaningful overall uncertainties on the plasma density of the coronae of Capella. We consider two Bayesian frameworks. First, the so-called pragmatic-Bayesian approach considers the atomic data and their uncertainties as fully specified and uncorrectable. The fully-Bayesian approach, on the other hand, allows the observed spectral data to update the atomic data and their uncertainties, thereby reducing the overall errors on the inferred parameters. To incorporate atomic data uncertainties, we obtain a set of atomic data replicates, the distribution of which captures their uncertainty. A principal component analysis of these replicates allows us to represent the atomic uncertainty with a lower-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution. A $t$-distribution approximation of the uncertainties of a subset of plasma parameters including a priori temperature information, obtained from the temperature-sensitive-only Fe XVII spectral line analysis, is carried forward into the density- and temperature-sensitive O VII spectral line analysis. Markov Chain Monte Carlo based model fitting is implemented including Multi-step Monte Carlo Gibbs Sampler and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Our analysis recovers an isothermally approximated coronal plasma temperature of $\approx$5 MK and a coronal plasma density of $\approx$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, with uncertainties of 0.1 and 0.2 dex respectively.</description>

      <title>The neutrino fog for dark matter-electron scattering experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for sub-GeV dark matter via scattering on electrons has ramped up in the last few years. Like in the case of dark matter scattering on nuclei, electron-recoil-based searches also face an ultimate background in the form of neutrinos. The so-called ``neutrino fog'' refers to the range of open dark-matter parameter space where the background of neutrinos can potentially prevent a conclusive discovery claim of a dark matter signal from being made. In this study, we map the neutrino fog for a range of electron recoil experiments based on silicon, germanium, xenon and argon targets. In analogy to the nuclear recoil case, we also calculate the ''edge'' to the neutrino fog, which can be used as a visual guide to where neutrinos become an important background -- this boundary excludes some parts of the key theory milestones used to motivate these experiments.</description>

      <title>The Kinematic and Chemical Properties of the Close-in Planet Host Star 8 UMi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent study by Hon et al. reported that a close-in planet around the red clump star, 8 UMi, should have been engulfed during the expansion phase of its parent star's evolution. They explained the survival of this exoplanet through a binary-merger channel for 8 UMi. The key to testing this formation scenario is to derive the true age of this star: is it an old "imposter" resulting from a binary merger, or a genuinely young red clump giant? To accomplish this, we derive kinematic and chemical properties for 8 UMi using astrometric data from {\it Gaia} DR3 and the element-abundance pattern measured from a high-resolution ($R \sim 75,000$) spectrum taken by SOPHIE. Our analysis shows that 8 UMi is a normal thin-disk star with orbital rotation speed of $\it{V}_\mathrm{\phi}=\mathrm{244.96 km s^{-1}}$, and possesses a Solar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= -0.05 \pm 0.07$) and $\alpha$-element abundance ratio ([$\alpha$/Fe] $= +0.01 \pm 0.03$). By adopting well-established relationships between age and space velocities/elemental abundances, we estimate a kinematic age of $3.50^{+3.00}_{-2.00}$ Gyr, and a chemical age of $3.25^{+2.50}_{-1.50}$ Gyr from [C/N] and $3.47 \pm 1.96$ Gyr from [Y/Mg] for 8 UMi, respectively. These estimates are consistent with the isochrone-fitting age ($1.90^{+1.15}_{-0.30}$ Gyr) of 8 UMi, but are all much younger than the timescale required in a binary-merger scenario. This result challenges the binary-merger model; the existence of such a closely orbiting exoplanet around a giant star remains a mystery yet to be resolved.</description>

      <title>Some Old Globular Clusters (and Stars) Inferring That the Universe Is Older Than Commonly Accepted</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has made startling discoveries regarding the early universe. It has revealed galaxies as soon as 300 million years after the Big Bang, challenging current galaxy formation models. Additionally, it has identified massive, bright galaxies in the young universe, contradicting the standard {\Lambda}CDM model's age estimate of 13.8 Gyr. This prompts a reevaluation of galaxy formation and cosmological models. There is a strong tension between JWST high-redshift galaxy observations and Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) satellite measurements. Even alternative cosmological models, including those incorporating dark matter baryon interaction, f(R) gravity, and dynamical dark have failed to resolve this tension. One possible solution is that the Universe's age exceeds predictions by the {\Lambda}CDM model. The study challenges this by introducing a method based on blue straggler stars (BSs) within GCs, comparing ages with other models. The ages obtained are compared with those of different models to certify that they are equally valid. These values are comparable within the error ranges except for the clusters: NGC104, NGC 5634, IC 4499, NGC 6273 and NGC 4833, finding their respective ages to be between 14.7 and 21.6 Gyr, surpassing the commonly accepted age of the Universe. These results inferred an age for the Universe of around 26 Gyr, close to 26.7 Gyr. This value aligns with that suggested by the cosmological model named Covarying Coupling Constants + TL (CCC+TL). Such a value is consistent with early universe observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The results of the present paper reinforce the advocating for a critical review of models encompassing dark mass, dark energy, and the dynamics of the Universe, particularly in explaining the presence of primitive massive galaxies, very old GCs, and very old and poor metallic stars.</description>
