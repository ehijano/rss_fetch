      <title>PILOT: Equivariant diffusion for pocket conditioned de novo ligand generation with multi-objective guidance via importance sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of ligands that both are tailored to a given protein pocket and exhibit a range of desired chemical properties is a major challenge in structure-based drug design. Here, we propose an in-silico approach for the $\textit{de novo}$ generation of 3D ligand structures using the equivariant diffusion model PILOT, combining pocket conditioning with a large-scale pre-training and property guidance. Its multi-objective trajectory-based importance sampling strategy is designed to direct the model towards molecules that not only exhibit desired characteristics such as increased binding affinity for a given protein pocket but also maintains high synthetic accessibility. This ensures the practicality of sampled molecules, thus maximizing their potential for the drug discovery pipeline. PILOT significantly outperforms existing methods across various metrics on the common benchmark dataset CrossDocked2020. Moreover, we employ PILOT to generate novel ligands for unseen protein pockets from the Kinodata-3D dataset, which encompasses a substantial portion of the human kinome. The generated structures exhibit predicted $IC_{50}$ values indicative of potent biological activity, which highlights the potential of PILOT as a powerful tool for structure-based drug design.</description>

      <title>ProtFAD: Introducing function-aware domains as implicit modality towards protein function perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein function prediction is currently achieved by encoding its sequence or structure, where the sequence-to-function transcendence and high-quality structural data scarcity lead to obvious performance bottlenecks. Protein domains are "building blocks" of proteins that are functionally independent, and their combinations determine the diverse biological functions. However, most existing studies have yet to thoroughly explore the intricate functional information contained in the protein domains. To fill this gap, we propose a synergistic integration approach for a function-aware domain representation, and a domain-joint contrastive learning strategy to distinguish different protein functions while aligning the modalities. Specifically, we associate domains with the GO terms as function priors to pre-train domain embeddings. Furthermore, we partition proteins into multiple sub-views based on continuous joint domains for contrastive training under the supervision of a novel triplet InfoNCE loss. Our approach significantly and comprehensively outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks, and clearly differentiates proteins carrying distinct functions compared to the competitor.</description>

      <title>Out of Many, One: Designing and Scaffolding Proteins at the Scale of the Structural Universe with Genie 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for protein design. One such pioneering model is Genie, a method that asymmetrically represents protein structures during the forward and backward processes, using simple Gaussian noising for the former and expressive SE(3)-equivariant attention for the latter. In this work we introduce Genie 2, extending Genie to capture a larger and more diverse protein structure space through architectural innovations and massive data augmentation. Genie 2 adds motif scaffolding capabilities via a novel multi-motif framework that designs co-occurring motifs with unspecified inter-motif positions and orientations. This makes possible complex protein designs that engage multiple interaction partners and perform multiple functions. On both unconditional and conditional generation, Genie 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all known methods on key design metrics including designability, diversity, and novelty. Genie 2 also solves more motif scaffolding problems than other methods and does so with more unique and varied solutions. Taken together, these advances set a new standard for structure-based protein design. Genie 2 inference and training code, as well as model weights, are freely available at: https://github.com/aqlaboratory/genie2.</description>

      <title>Compound Mutations in the Abl1 Kinase Cause Inhibitor Resistance by Shifting DFG Flip Mechanisms and Relative State Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of most proteins are central to their function. Protein tyrosine kinases such as Abl1 undergo significant conformational changes that modulate their activity in response to different stimuli. These conformational changes constitute a conserved mechanism for self-regulation that dramatically impacts kinases' affinities for inhibitors. Few studies have attempted to extensively sample the pathways and elucidate the mechanisms that underlie kinase inactivation. Seeking to bridge this knowledge gap, we present a thorough analysis of the ``DFG flip'' inactivation pathway in Abl1 kinase. By leveraging the power of the Weighted Ensemble methodology, which accelerates sampling without the use of biasing forces, we have comprehensively simulated DFG flip events in Abl1 and its inhibitor-resistant variants, revealing a rugged landscape punctuated by potentially druggable intermediate states. Through our strategy, we successfully simulated dozens of uncorrelated DFG flip events distributed along two principal pathways, identified the molecular mechanisms that govern them, and measured their relative probabilities. Further, we show that the compound Glu255Lys/Val Thr315Ile Abl1 variants owe their inhibitor resistance phenotype to an increase in the free energy barrier associated with completing the DFG flip. This barrier stabilizes Abl1 variants in conformations that can lead to loss of binding for Type-II inhibitors such as Imatinib or Ponatinib. Finally, we contrast our Abl1 observations with the relative state distributions and propensity for undergoing a DFG flip of evolutionarily-related protein tyrosine kinases with diverging Type-II inhibitor binding affinities. Altogether, we expect that our work will be of significant importance for protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor discovery.</description>

      <title>RFold: RNA Secondary Structure Prediction with Decoupled Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The secondary structure of ribonucleic acid (RNA) is more stable and accessible in the cell than its tertiary structure, making it essential for functional prediction. Although deep learning has shown promising results in this field, current methods suffer from poor generalization and high complexity. In this work, we reformulate the RNA secondary structure prediction as a K-Rook problem, thereby simplifying the prediction process into probabilistic matching within a finite solution space. Building on this innovative perspective, we introduce RFold, a simple yet effective method that learns to predict the most matching K-Rook solution from the given sequence. RFold employs a bi-dimensional optimization strategy that decomposes the probabilistic matching problem into row-wise and column-wise components to reduce the matching complexity, simplifying the solving process while guaranteeing the validity of the output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFold achieves competitive performance and about eight times faster inference efficiency than the state-of-the-art approaches. The code and Colab demo are available in \href{http://github.com/A4Bio/RFold}{http://github.com/A4Bio/RFold}.</description>
