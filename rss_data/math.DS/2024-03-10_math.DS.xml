      <title>Effective quenched linear response for random dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove ``effective'' linear response for certain classes of non-uniformly expanding random dynamical systems which are not necessarily composed in an i.i.d manner. In applications, the results are obtained for base maps with a sufficient amount of mixing. The fact that the rates are effective is then applied to obtain the differentiability of the variance in the CLT as a function of the parameter, as well as the annealed linear response. These two applications are beyond the reach of the linear response obtained in the general case, when all the random variables appearing in the bounds are only tempered. We also provide several wide examples of one-dimensional maps satisfying our conditions, as well as some higher-dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>Unifying Lyapunov exponents with probabilistic uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyaponuv exponent is well-known in deterministic dynamical systems as a measure for quantifying chaos and detecting coherent regions in physically evolving systems. In this Letter, we show how the Lyapunov exponent can be unified with stochastic sensitivity (which quantifies the uncertainty of an evolving uncertain system whose initial condition is certain) within a finite time uncertainty quantification framework in which both the dynamics and the initial condition of a continuously evolving $ n $-dimensional state variable are uncertain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{T}$ be a locally finite tree whose geometric boundary has infinitely many points. Suppose that a non-amenable group $\G$ acts isometrically and geometrically on the tree $\mathcal{T}$.
  In this paper, we show that if the length spectrum is Diophantine, then there exists a continuous function $C$ on $\mathcal{T}^2$ such that the heat kernel $p(t,x,y)$ of $\mathcal{T}$ satisfies
  $$\lim_{t\rightarrow \infty}t^{3/2}e^{\lambda_0t}p(t,x,y)=C(x,y)$$
  for any $x,y\in \mathcal{T}$. Here, $\lambda_0$ is the bottom of the spectrum of the Laplacian on $\mathcal{T}$.</description>

      <title>Entropic van der Corput's Difference Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an entropy version of van der Corput's difference theorem: the entropy of a sequence is equal to the entropy of its differences. This reveals a potential correspondence between the theory of uniform distribution mod 1 and entropy. As applications, we establish the corresponding entropy versions for several other results on uniform distribution.</description>

      <title>Multiple correlations of spectra for higher rank Anosov representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe multiple correlations of Jordan and Cartan spectra for any finite number of Anosov representations of a finitely generated group. This extends our previous work on correlations of length and displacement spectra for rank one convex cocompact representations. Examples include correlations of the Hilbert length spectra for convex projective structures on a closed surface as well as correlations of eigenvalue gaps and singular value gaps for Hitchin representations. We relate the correlation problem to the counting problem for Jordan and Cartan projections of an Anosov subgroup with respect to a family of carefully chosen truncated {\it hypertubes}, rather than in tubes as in our previous work. Hypertubes go to infinity in a linear subspace of directions, while tubes go to infinity in a single direction and this feature presents a novel difficulty in this higher rank correlation problem.</description>

      <title>The Michaelis--Menten reaction at low substrate concentrations: Pseudo-first-order kinetics and conditions for timescale separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Michaelis-Menten reaction mechanism can be accurately approximated by a linear system when the initial substrate concentration is low. This leads to pseudo-first-order kinetics, simplifying mathematical calculations and experimental analysis. Our proof utilizes a monotonicity property of the system and Kamke's comparison theorem. This linear approximation yields a closed-form solution, enabling accurate modeling and estimation of reaction rate constants even without timescale separation. Building on prior work, we establish that the sufficient condition for the validity of this approximation is $s_0 \ll K$, where $K=k_2/k_1$ is the Van Slyke-Cullen constant. This condition is independent of the initial enzyme concentration. Further, we investigate timescale separation within the linear system, identifying necessary and sufficient conditions and deriving the corresponding reduced one-dimensional equations.</description>

      <title>On discrete Routh reduction and structures on the reduced space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we work, first, with forced discrete mechanical systems on the configuration space $Q$ and construct closed $2$-forms $\omega^+$ and $\omega^-$ on $Q \times Q$, that are symplectic if and only if the system is regular. For a special type of discrete force, we prove that $\omega^+$ and $\omega^-$ are invariant by the flow of the system. We also consider the Lagrangian reduction of a discrete mechanical system by a symmetry group (using an affine discrete connection derived from the discrete momentum) and prove that, under some conditions on the action, the trajectories of the reduced system (with discrete momentum $\mu$) can be seen as trajectories of a forced discrete mechanical system, where the discrete force is of the type analyzed before. Therefore, we prove that there is a symplectic structure that is invariant by the flow of the forced reduced system; the symplectic structure can be seen as a pullback of a canonical cotangent structure plus a magnetic term. This discrete reduction process is the (discrete) Routh reduction and the behavior obtained runs parallel to the well known case for (continuous) Routh reduction.</description>

      <title>Infinite Translation Surfaces in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book explores infinite-type translation surfaces and is intended as an introductory text for graduate and PhD students, as well as a reference for more advanced researchers.
  Chapter 1 introduces the three definitions of translation surfaces and meticulously proves their equivalence. It is enriched with numerous examples that are revisited throughout the book.
  Chapter 2 provides a detailed examination of the topological classification of infinite-type surfaces, the construction of infinite coverings of finite-type translation surfaces, and the structure of points within the metric completion.
  Chapter 3 investigates the affine symmetries of infinite-type translation surfaces, with special emphasis on infinite coverings of finite-type surfaces, the Hooper-Thurston-Veech construction, and affine homeomorphisms of finite-area infinite-type translation surfaces.
  Chapter 4 introduces infinite interval exchange transformations and employs them to demonstrate that the dynamics of translation flows are significantly more complex in the infinite-type context.
  The two appendices address hyperbolic geometry and the spectra of infinite graphs, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Wrappingness and Trunkenness of Volume-Preserving Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Link invariants of long pieces of orbits of a volume-preserving flow can be used to define diffeomorphism invariants of the flow. In this paper, we extend the notions of wrapping number and trunk and define invariants of links with respect to a fibration on a 3-manifold. Extending work of Dehornoy and Rechtman, we apply this to define diffeomorphism invariants wrappingness and trunkenness of volume-preserving flows on 3-manifolds and interpret these invariants as obstructions to the existence of a global surface of section for the flow. Finally, we construct flows and show that wrappingness and trunkenness are not functions of the helicity of a flow.</description>

      <title>Strong topological Rokhlin property, shadowing, and symbolic dynamics of countable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.08145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A countable group $G$ has the strong topological Rokhlin property (STRP) if it admits a continuous action on the Cantor space with a comeager conjugacy class. We show that having the STRP is a symbolic dynamical property. We prove that a countable group $G$ has the STRP if and only if certain sofic subshifts over $G$ are dense in the space of subshifts. A sufficient condition is that isolated shifts over $G$ are dense in the space of all subshifts.
  We provide numerous applications including the proof that a group that decomposes as a free product of finite or cyclic groups has the STRP. We show that finitely generated nilpotent groups do not have the STRP unless they are virtually cyclic; the same is true for many groups of the form $G_1\times G_2\times G_3$ where each factor is recursively presented. We show that a large class of non-finitely generated groups do not have the STRP, this includes any group with infinitely generated center and the Hall universal locally finite group.
  We find a very strong connection between the STRP and shadowing, a.k.a. pseudo-orbit tracing property. We show that shadowing is generic for actions of a finitely generated group $G$ if and only if $G$ has the STRP.</description>

      <title>On Disturbance Propagation in Vehicular Platoons with Different Communication Ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the control of vehicular platoons, the disturbances acting on one vehicle can propagate and affect other vehicles. If the disturbances do not amplify along the vehicular string, then it is called string stable. However, it is usually difficult to achieve string stability with a distributed control setting, especially when a constant spacing policy is considered. This note considers the string unstable cases and studies disturbance propagation in a nonlinear vehicular platoon consisting of $n+1$ vehicles where the (virtual) leading vehicle provides the reference for a constant spacing policy. Apart from the communications between consecutive vehicles, we also assume that each vehicle can receive information from $r$ neighbors ahead, that is, the vehicular platoon has communication range $r$. For the maximal overshoot of the inter-vehicular spacing errors, we explicitly show that the effect of disturbances, including the external disturbances acting on each vehicle and the acceleration of the leading vehicle, is scaled by $O(\sqrt{ \left \lceil \frac{n}{r} \right \rceil})$ for a fixed $n$. This implies that disturbance propagation can be reduced by increasing communication range. Numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the main results.</description>

Abstract: Let $P_N$ be a trigonometric polynomial of degree $N$ and satisfy $\|P_N\|_{C^r}\leq \epsilon$. If $P_N$ destroys the Lagrangian torus with the rotation vector $\omega$ of an integrable Hamiltonian system, then {what are the relation among $\epsilon$, $N$, $r$ and the arithmetic property of $\omega$}? By addressing this, we provide quantitatively higher dimensional generalizations of the remarkable results on destruction of invariant circles for the area-preserving twist map by Herman [22] and Mather [30] in the 1980's. As an application, we give a partial answer to an open problem by Mather [30, p.212] in 1988.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness in $H^{\sigma}(\mathbb{R})$ for any $\sigma \in [0,\infty)$ of a parametrically forced nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (PFNLS) in one dimension driven by multiplicative Stratonovich noise which has spatially homogeneous statistics. The noise is white in time and correlated in space. We first construct local mild solutions via a fixed-point argument. We then formulate a blow-up criterion by showing that the equation has persistence of integrability and regularity as long as the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-norm of the solution remains finite. Afterwards we derive a pathwise estimate on the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-norm using a mild It\^o formula. Our results also apply to the standard cubic NLS equation driven by multiplicative translation-invariant Stratonovich noise.</description>

      <title>Equitable Data-Driven Facility Location and Resource Allocation to Fight the Opioid Epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06179v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The opioid epidemic is a crisis that has plagued the United States (US) for decades. One central issue is inequitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), which puts certain populations at a higher risk of opioid overdose. We integrate a predictive dynamical model and a prescriptive optimization problem to compute high-quality opioid treatment facility and treatment budget allocations for each US state. Our predictive model is a differential equation-based epidemiological model that captures opioid epidemic dynamics. We use a process inspired by neural ODEs to fit this model to opioid epidemic data for each state and obtain estimates for unknown parameters in the model. We then incorporate this epidemiological model into a mixed-integer optimization problem (MIP) that aims to minimize opioid overdose deaths and the number of people with OUD. We develop strong relaxations based on McCormick envelopes to efficiently compute approximate solutions to our MIPs with a mean optimality gap of 3.99%. Our method provides socioeconomically equitable solutions, as it incentivizes investments in areas with higher social vulnerability (from the US Centers for Disease Control's Social Vulnerability Index) and opioid prescribing rates. On average, our approach decreases the number of people with OUD by 9.03 $\pm$ 1.772%, increases the number of people in treatment by 88.75 $\pm$ 26.223%, and decreases opioid-related deaths by 0.58 $\pm$ 0.111% after 2 years compared to baseline epidemiological model predictions. Our solutions show that policy-makers should target adding treatment facilities to counties that have less facilities than their population share and are more socially vulnerable. We demonstrate that our optimization approach should help inform these decisions, as it yields population health benefits in comparison to benchmarks based solely on population and social vulnerability.</description>

      <title>Implicit Boundary Conditions in Partial Differential Equations Discretizations: Identifying Spurious Modes and Model Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of spurious modes that are sometimes encountered in partial differential equations discretizations. It is generally suspected that one of the causes for spurious modes is due to how boundary conditions are treated, and we use this as the starting point of our investigations. By regarding boundary conditions as algebraic constraints on a differential equation, we point out that any differential equation with homogeneous boundary conditions also admits a typically infinite number of hidden or implicit boundary conditions. In most discretization schemes, these additional implicit boundary conditions are violated, and we argue that this is what leads to the emergence of spurious modes. These observations motivate two definitions of the quality of computed eigenvalues based on violations of derivatives of boundary conditions on the one hand, and on the Grassmann distance between subspaces associated with computed eigenspaces on the other. Both of these tests are based on a standardized treatment of boundary conditions and do not require a priori knowledge of eigenvalue locations. The effectiveness of these tests is demonstrated on several examples known to have spurious modes. In addition, these quality tests show that in most problems, about half the computed spectrum of a differential operator is of low quality. The tests also specifically identify the low accuracy modes, which can then be projected out as a type of model reduction scheme.</description>
