      <title>Learning Scalable Temporal Representations in Spiking Neural Networks Without Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit temporal, sparse, and event-driven dynamics that make them appealing for efficient inference. However, extending these models to self-supervised regimes remains challenging because the discontinuities introduced by spikes break the cross-view gradient correspondences required by contrastive and consistency-driven objectives. This work introduces a training paradigm that enables large SNN architectures to be optimized without labeled data. We formulate a dual-path neuron in which a spike-generating process is paired with a differentiable surrogate branch, allowing gradients to propagate across augmented inputs while preserving a fully spiking implementation at inference. In addition, we propose temporal alignment objectives that enforce representational coherence both across spike timesteps and between augmented views. Using convolutional and transformer-style SNN backbones, we demonstrate ImageNet-scale self-supervised pretraining and strong transfer to classification, detection, and segmentation benchmarks. Our best model, a fully self-supervised Spikformer-16-512, achieves 70.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, demonstrating that unlabeled learning in high-capacity SNNs is feasible at modern scale</description>

      <title>Design and Validation of a Modular Smart Headband with Embroidered Electrodes for Comfortable EEG Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wearable EEG device sector is advancing rapidly, enabling fast and reliable detection of brain activity for investigating brain function and pathology. However, many current EEG systems remain challenging for users with neurological conditions due to bulky wiring, lengthy skin preparation, gel-induced discomfort, risk of irritation, and high cost, all of which limit long-term monitoring. This study presents a proof-of-concept smart modular headband incorporating adjustable, replaceable embroidered electrodes for EEG acquisition. Compared with conventional devices, the smart headband reduces wiring complexity, removes the need for skin preparation, and minimizes irritation associated with gel-based electrodes. Its modular structure allows adjustable fitting without requiring multiple size options, enhancing comfort and adaptability for everyday EEG monitoring. The smart headband prototype was tested on 10 healthy university students using three behavioral tasks: (1) eyes open/closed, (2) auditory oddball, and (3) visual oddball paradigms. The smart headband successfully captured alpha peaks during the eyes-open/closed task (p = 0.01) and reliably recorded the event-related potentials associated with the oddball effects - the auditory P300 (p = 0.014) and the visual N170 (p = 0.013) - demonstrating an equivalent performance to a commercial sponge-based EEG cap. A user survey indicated improved comfort and usability, with participants reporting that the soft, structurally designed headband enhanced wearability relative to a conventional cap. Overall, this prototype provides a comfortable, modular, and cost-effective solution to reliable EEG monitoring in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Safe Farming: Development of a Prevention System to Mitigate Vertebrates Crop Raiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main problems for farmers is the protection of their crops, before and after harvesting, from animals and birds. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes a model of safe farming in which the crops will be protected from vertebrates attack through a prevention system that is based on Wirelesses Sensors Networks. Different sensor nodes are placed around the field that detect animals or birds existence and generate required signals and information. This information is passed to the Repelling and Notifying System (RNS) that is installed at the field through a short range wireless technology, ZigBee. As RNS receives the information, it generates ultrasonic sounds that are unbearable for animals and birds, which causes them to run away from the field. These ultrasonic sounds are generated in a frequency range that only animals and birds can hear, while humans cannot notice the sound. The paper also proposes a notifying system. It will inform the farmer about animals or birds intrusion in the field through SMS, but doesn't need any action from the farmer. The low cost and power efficiency of the proposed system is a key advantage for developing countries where cost and power are major players in any system feasibility.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency in Network Slicing: Survey and Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network Slicing (NS) is a fundamental feature of 5G, 6G, and future mobile networks, enabling logically isolated virtual networks over shared infrastructure. As data demand increases and services diversify, ensuring Energy Efficiency (EE) in NS is vital (not only for operational cost savings but also to reduce the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector's environmental footprint). This survey addresses the need for a comprehensive and holistic perspective on energy-efficient NS by reviewing and classifying recent strategies across the NS life cycle. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a thorough review of state-of-the-art techniques aimed at reducing energy consumption in NS; (ii) a novel taxonomy that organizes strategies into infrastructure, path/route, and slice operation levels; and (iii) the identification of open challenges and research directions, with a focus on systemic, cross-layer, and AI-driven approaches. By consolidating insights from recent developments, our work bridges existing gaps in the literature, offering a structured foundation for researchers and practitioners to design, evaluate, and improve energy-efficient network slicing systems.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of mass-spring networks from high-level code descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural nonlinearity can be harnessed to program complex functionalities in robotic devices. However, it remains a challenge to design nonlinear systems that will accomplish a specific, desired task. The responses that we typically describe as intelligent -- such a robot navigating a maze -- require a large number of degrees of freedom and cannot be captured by traditional optimization objective functions. In this work, we explore a code-based synthesis approach to design mass-spring systems with embodied intelligence. The approach starts from a source code, written in a \emph{mechanical description language}, that details the system boundary, sensor and actuator locations, and desired behavior. A synthesizer software then automatically generates a mass-spring network that performs the described function from the source code description. We exemplify this methodology by designing mass-spring systems realizing a maze-navigating robot and a programmable lock. Remarkably, mechanical description languages can be combined with large-language models, to translate a natural-language description of a task into a functional device.</description>

      <title>Technologies to Support Self-determination for People with Intellectual Disability and ASD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on the concept of self-determination and the design and validation of digital tools intended to promote the self-determination of vulnerable people. Self-determination is an essential skill for carrying out daily activities. But in certain situations, and for certain populations, self-determination is lacking, which leads to the inability to live an independent life and in favorable conditions of well-being and health. In recent years, self-determination enhancing technologies have been developed and used to promote independent living among people with self-determination disorders. We will illustrate the main digital tools to support self-determination developed for two populations of people suffering from self-determination disorders: people with an intellectual disability and people with an autism spectrum disorder. The ability of these digital assistants to improve the comfort of life of these people will also be presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Minimizing energy dissipation during programming of resistive switching memory devices using their dynamical attractor states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under certain conditions, applying a sequence of voltage pulses of alternating polarities across a resistive switching memory device induces a finite number of fixed-point attractors, known as dynamical attractors. Remarkably, dynamical attractors can be used to program analog values into the device state without supervision. Because different pulse sequences can produce the same trajectory solution for the state in the phase space, there is strong potential for optimization, particularly in regard to the energy cost of the programming phase, which this study addresses. Without loss of generality, the proposed theory-based energy minimization strategy is applied to the voltage threshold adaptive memristor model, known for its predictive capability and adaptability to fit a large number of resistance switching memory devices. The optimization design crafts ad-hoc pulse sequences, that minimize the energy required to program the device into a desired dynamical attractor state. The theoretical approach is also extended to cover situations, where a fast programming scheme should be adopted to serve time-critical electronics applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Low-Complexity Receiver Design for Short Block Transmission Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and performance enhancement of short block length channel detection incorporating training information. The current communication systems' short block length channel detection typically consists of least squares channel estimation followed by quasi-coherent detection. By investigating the receiver structure, specifically the estimator-correlator, we show that the non-coherent term, often disregarded in conventional detection metrics, results in significant losses in performance and sensitivity in typical operating regimes of 5G and 6G systems. A comparison with the fully non-coherent receiver in multi-antenna configurations reveals substantial losses in low spectral efficiency operating areas. Additionally, we demonstrate that by employing an adaptive DMRS-data power adjustment, it is possible to reduce the performance loss gap, which is amenable to a more sensitive quasi-coherent receiver. However, both of the aforementioned ML detection strategies can result in substantial computational complexity when processing long bit-length codes. We propose an approach to tackle this challenge by introducing the principle of block or segment coding using First-Order RM Codes, which is amenable to low-cost decoding through block-based fast Hadamard transforms. The Block-based FHT has demonstrated to be cost-efficient with regards to decoding time, as it evolves from quadric to quasi-linear complexity with a manageable decline in performance. Additionally, by incorporating an adaptive DMRS-data power adjustment technique, we are able to bridge/reduce the performance gap with respect to the conventional maximum likelihood receiver and attain high sensitivity, leading to a good trade-off between performance and complexity to efficiently handle small payloads.</description>

      <title>HERP: Hardware for Energy Efficient and Realtime DB Search and Cluster Expansion in Proteomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Database search and clustering are fundamental components of many data analytics problems, such as mass spectrometry-driven proteomics. Traditional full clustering and search algorithms suffer from high resource usage and long latencies. We introduce HERP, a lightweight incremental clustering method and a highly parallelizable database (DB) search platform that utilizes 3T2MTJ SOT-MRAM based CAM in 7nm technology for in-memory acceleration. A single hardware initialization using pre-clustered proteomics data allows for continuous DB searching and local re-clustering, providing a more practical and efficient alternative to clustering from scratch. Heuristics derived from the initial pre-clustered data guide the incremental process, accelerating clustering by 20x at a cost of 0.3% increase in clustering error where DB search results overlap by 96% with SOTA algorithms validating search quality. For a 131GB human genome proteomics dataset HERP setup requires 1.19mJ for 2M spectra while 1000 query search consumes only 1.1uJ at SOTA accuracy. Bucket-wise parallelization and query scheduling provides additional 100x speedup.</description>
