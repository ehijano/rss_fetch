Abstract: We compute $\frac{1}{2}$-derivations on the deformative Schr\"{o}dinger-Witt algebra, on not-finitely graded Witt algebras $W_n(G)$, and on not-finitely graded Heisenberg-Witt algebra $HW_n(G)$. We classify all transposed Poisson structures on such algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to extend certain properties observed in $d$-ideals of rings and $d$-elements of frames to Baer elements in multiplicative lattices introduced in D. D. Anderson, C. Jayaram, and P. A. Phiri, Baer lattices, \textit{Acta Sci. Math. (Szeged)}, 59 (1994), 61--74. Additionally, we present results concerning these elements that have not been addressed in the study of $d$-ideals of rings. Furthermore, we introduce Baer closures and explore Baer maximal, prime, semiprime, and meet-irreducible elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate further properties of $z$-elements in multiplicative lattices. We utilize $z$-closure operators to extend several properties of $z$-ideals to $z$-elements and introduce various distinguished subclasses of $z$-elements, such as $z$-prime, $z$-semiprime, $z$-primary, $z$-irreducible, and $z$-strongly irreducible elements, and study their properties. We provide a characterization of multiplicative lattices where $z$-elements are closed under finite products and a representation of $z$-elements in terms of $z$-irreducible elements in $z$-Noetherian multiplicative lattices.</description>

      <title>Sweedler duality for Hom-algebras and Hom-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of Sweedler duality is an important tool in the theory of Hopf algebras over a field, which is a right adjoint to the dual algebra functor. In this paper, we study the Sweedler duality of Hom-algebras and their Hom-modules. We delve into the structure of Hom-coalgebras and derive the linear morphisms associated with them. Additionally, as an application, we present the (right) Hom-(co)module morphisms under the Sweedler duality.</description>

      <title>Categorification of based modules over the complex representation ring of $S_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex representation rings of finite groups are the fundamental class of fusion rings, categorified by the corresponding fusion categories of complex representations. The category of $\mathbb{Z}_+$-modules of finite rank over such a representation ring is also semisimple.
  In this paper, we classify the irreducible based modules of rank up to 5 over the complex representation ring $r(S_4)$ of the symmetric group $S_4$. Totally 16 inequivalent irreducible based modules are obtained. Based on such a classification result, we further discuss the categorification of based modules over $r(S_4)$ by module categories over the complex representation category ${\rm Rep}(S_4)$ of $S_4$ arisen from projective representations of certain subgroups of $S_4$.</description>

      <title>Multiplication formula for Hernandez and Leclerc's quivers with potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study multiplication formula of $F$-polynomial of representations of Hernandez and Leclerc's quivers with potentials. Since the truncated $q$-characters of some real simple modules over a quantum affine group $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ can be expressed in terms of such $F$-polynomials, one can describe the product of two simple modules over $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ using this multiplication formula.</description>

      <title>Multi-indices coproducts from ODEs to singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce explicit formulae for the coproducts at play for multi-indices in ODEs and in singular SPDEs. The two coproducts described correspond to versions of the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer and extraction/contraction coproducts with multi-indices. The main idea is to use the fact that these coproducts are the adjoints of dual products for which one has explicit simple formulae. We are able to derive the explicit formulae via an inner product defined from a symmetry factor easily computable for multi-indices.</description>

      <title>Filtration of tensor product of local Weyl modules for $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}[t]$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the tensor product of local Weyl modules for $\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}[t]$ whose highest weights are multiples of the first and $n^{th}$ fundamental weights. We determine the graded character of these tensor product modules in terms of the graded character of local Weyl modules and prove that these modules admit a filtration whose successive quotients are either truncated Weyl modules or fusion products of Demazure modules. Furthermore, we establish that the truncated Weyl modules appearing as quotients in the filtration of tensor products of local Weyl modules of $\mathfrak{sl}_3[t]$ are indeed isomorphic to fusion products of irreducible $\mathfrak{sl}_3[t]$-modules which establish the independence of a family of fusion product modules of $\mathfrak{sl}_3[t]$ from the set of its evaluation parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum-symmetric equivalence is a graded Morita invariant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if two $m$-homogeneous algebras have Morita equivalent graded module categories, then they are quantum-symmetrically equivalent, that is, there is a monoidal equivalence between the categories of comodules for their associated universal quantum groups (in the sense of Manin) which sends one algebra to the other. As a consequence, any Zhang twist of an $m$-homogeneous algebra is a 2-cocycle twist by some 2-cocycle from its Manin's universal quantum group.</description>

      <title>Algebraic groups in non-commutative probability theory revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The role of coalgebras as well as algebraic groups in non-commutative probability has long been advocated by the school of von Waldenfels and Sch\"urmann. Another algebraic approach was introduced more recently, based on shuffle and pre-Lie calculus, and results in another construction of groups of characters encoding the behaviour of states. Comparing the two, the first approach, recast recently in a general categorical language by Manzel and Sch\"urmann, can be seen as largely driven by the theory of universal products, whereas the second construction builds on Hopf algebras and a suitable algebraization of the combinatorics of noncrossing set partitions. Although both address the same phenomena, moving between the two viewpoints is not obvious. We present here an attempt to unify the two approaches by making explicit the Hopf algebraic connections between them. Our presentation, although relying largely on classical ideas as well as results closely related to Manzel and Sch\"urmann's aforementioned work, is nevertheless original on several points and fills a gap in the non-commutative probability literature. In particular, we systematically use the language and techniques of algebraic groups together with shuffle group techniques to prove that two notions of algebraic groups naturally associated with free, respectively Boolean and monotone, probability theories identify. We also obtain explicit formulas for various Hopf algebraic structures and detail arguments that had been left implicit in the literature.</description>

      <title>Quillen (co)homology of divided power algebras over an operad</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barr--Beck cohomology, put into the framework of model categories by Quillen, provides a cohomology theory for any algebraic structure, for example Andr\'e--Quillen cohomology of commutative rings. Quillen cohomology has been studied notably for divided power algebras and restricted Lie algebras, both of which are instances of divided power algebras over an operad $P$: the commutative and Lie operad respectively. In this paper, we investigate the Quillen cohomology of divided power algebras over an operad $P$, identifying Beck modules, derivations, and K\"ahler differentials in that setup. We also compare the cohomology of divided power algebras over $P$ with that of $P$-algebras, and work out some examples.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the Chen and Moore determinants of quaternion Hermitian} matrices to dual quaternion Hermitian matrices. We show the Chen determinant of dual quaternion Hermitian {matrices is invariant under addition, switching, multiplication, and unitary operations at the both hand sides. We then show the Chen and Moore determinants of dual quaternion Hermitian matrices are equal to each other, and they are also equal to the products of eigenvalues. The characteristic polynomial of a dual quaternion Hermitian matrix is also studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate metric Jordan algebras, and follow the lines of the paper (J. Milnor: Curvatures of left invariant metrics on Lie groups. Adv. Math. (1976)). Firstly, we define the Jordan-Levi-Civita connection, then we show that every metric Jordan algebra admits a unique Jordan-Levi-Civita connection. Secondly, using the Jordan-Levi-Civita connection, we introduce three natural curvature tensors on metric Jordan algebras, and obtain the corresponding curvature formulas. Thirdly, based on these curvature formulas, we prove that every formally real Jordan algebra admits both a metric of non-positive Jordan curvature, and a Jordan-Einstein metric of negative Jordan scalar curvature. Besides, for nilpotent Jordan algebras, we prove that they admit no Jordan-Einstein metrics.</description>

      <title>Pr\"ufer modules in filtration categories of semi-bricks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be an associative unitary ring. A brick in the module category $R-Mod$ is a finitely generated module with a division ring as endomorphism ring. Two non-isomorphic bricks $X,Y$ are said to be orthogonal if $Hom(X,Y)=Hom(Y,X)=0$, and a class ${\mathcal X}$ of pairwise orthogonal bricks is called a semi-brick. We consider the full subcategory $Filt({\mathcal X})$ of modules with filtration in ${\mathcal X}$ and show that this category is a wide category.
  Let ${\mathcal X}^{\perp}$ be the class of modules $M$ with $Ext^1(X, M)=0$ for all $X\in {\mathcal X}$. Then for each module $Y\in R-Mod$ there exists a ${\mathcal X}^{\perp}$-envelope $Y_{{\mathcal X}}(\infty)$ which can be constructed as the direct limit of iterated universal short exact sequences.
  Let now in addition the projective dimension of every $X\in {\mathcal X}$ be lower or equal $1$. Then we call for $Y\in {\mathcal X}$ the ${\mathcal X}^{\perp}$-envelope a Pr\"ufer module since they share many properties with Pr\"ufer groups and also with Pr\"ufer modules over tame hereditary algebras. Their endomorphism rings are complete discrete valuation rings and every injective object in $Filt{{\mathcal X}}$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of Pr\"ufer modules.
  We apply the toolset to tame hereditary algebras and give an alternative proof for the classification of divisible modules. For wild hereditary algebras we show that they have large classes of semi-bricks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the electrical Lie algebras originally introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy in several ways. To each Kac-Moody Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ we associate two types (vertex type and edge type) of the generalized electrical algebras. The electrical Lie algebras of vertex type are always subalgebras of $\mathfrak{g}$ and are flat deformations of the nilpotent Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. In many cases including $sl_n$, $so_n$, and $sp_{2n}$ we find new (edge) models for our generalized electrical Lie algebras of vertex type. Finding an edge model in general is an interesting an open problem.</description>
