      <title>Every expansive $ m $-concave operator has $ m $-isometric dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to obtain $ m $-isometric dilation of expansive $ m $-concave operator on Hilbert space. The obtained dilation is shown to be minimal. The matrix representation of this dilation is given. It is also proved that in case of 3-concave operators the assumption on expansivity is not necessary. The paper contains an example showing that minimal $ m $-isometric dilations may not be isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Square Functions and Variational Estimates for Ritt Operators on $L^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a bounded operator. We say $T$ is a Ritt operator if $\sup_n n\lVert T^n-T^{n+1}\rVert&lt;\infty$. It is know that when $T$ is a positive contraction and a Ritt operator in $L^p$, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, then for any integer $m\ge 1$, the square function
  \[\Big( \sum_n n^{2m-1} |T^n(I-T)^{m}f|^2 \Big)^{1/2}\] defines a bounded operator \cite{LeMX-Vq} in $L^p$.
  In this work, we extend the theory to the endpoint case $p=1$, showing that if $T$ is a Ritt operator on $L^1$,
  then the generalized square function \[Q_{\alpha,s,m}f=\Big( \sum_n n^{\alpha} |T^n(I-T)^mf|^s \Big)^{1/s}\] is bounded on $L^1$ for $\alpha+1&lt;sm$.
  In the specific setting where $T$ is a convolution operator of the form $T_{\mu}=\sum_k \mu(k) U^kf$, with $\mu$ a probability measure on $\mathbb Z$ and $U$ the composition operator induced by an invertible, ergodic measure preserving transformation, we provide sufficient conditions on $\mu$ under which the square function $Q_{2m-1,2,m}$ is of weak type (1,1), for all integers $m\ge 1$. We also establish bounds for variational and oscillation norms, $\lVert n^{\beta} T^n(1-T)^r\rVert_{v(s)}$ and $\lVert n^{\beta} T^n(1-T)^r\rVert_{o(s)}$, for Ritt operators, highlighting endpoint behavior.</description>

      <title>The Strong Law of Large Numbers for random semigroups on uniformly smooth Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random linear continuous operators $\Omega \to \mathcal{L}(X, X)$ on a Banach space $X$. For example, such random operators may be random quantum channels. The Law of Large Numbers is known when $X$ is a Hilbert space, in the form of the usual Law of Large Numbers for random operators, and in some other particular cases. Instead of the sum of i.i.d. variables, there may be considered the composition of random semigroups $e^{A_it/n}$. We obtain the Strong Law of Large Numbers in Strong Operator Topology for random semigroups on a uniformly smooth Banach space. We also develop another approach giving the SLLN in Weak Operator Topology for all Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>A study on preservation of parallel pairs and triangle equality attainment pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the structure and preservation of parallel pairs and triangle equality attainment (TEA) pairs in normed linear spaces. We begin by providing functional characterizations of these pairs in normed linear spaces and provide a characterization of finite-dimensional Banach spaces with numerical index one. We then study parallel pairs and TEA pairs in the $p$-direct sum of normed linear spaces. Next, we show that in finite-dimensional Banach spaces, a bijective bounded linear operator preserves TEA pairs if and only if it preserves parallel pairs, and this equivalence remains valid in finite-dimensional polyhedral spaces for operators with rank greater than one. We further explore some geometric consequences related to this preservation and provide a characterization of isometries on certain polyhedral Banach spaces as norm-one bijective operators that preserve the norm at extreme points and also preserve the parallel or TEA pairs.</description>

      <title>New properties of weighted generalized core-EP inverse in Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the generalized weighted core-EP inverse via the canonical decomposition, utilizing a weighted core-EP invertible element and a quasinilpotent. We then offer a polar-like characterization for the generalized weighted core-EP invertible element. The representations of the generalized weighted core-EP inverse by leveraging the weighted generalized Drazin inverse are thereby presented. These lead to new properties for the weighted core-EP inverse.</description>

      <title>Quantitative isoperimetric inequalities in capillarity problems and cones in strong and barycentric forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for two different perimeter-type functionals. We first consider classical capillarity functionals, which measure the perimeter of sets in a Euclidean half-space, assigning a constant weight $\lambda \in (-1, 1)$ to the portion of the boundary that lies on the boundary of the half-space. We then consider the relative perimeter of sets contained in some suitable convex cone in the Euclidean space. In both settings, we establish sharp quantitative isoperimetric inequalities in the so-called strong form. More precisely, we show that the isoperimetric deficit of a competitor not only controls the Fraenkel asymmetry, but it also controls an oscillation asymmetry that measures how much the unit normals to the boundary of a competitor deviate from those of an isoperimetric set. Our technique is also able to explicitly identify a center that can be employed to compute the asymmetries. In particular, we also derive barycentric versions of these quantitative isoperimetric inequalities (both in the classical and in the strong form). The proofs are based on the derivation of Fuglede-type estimates for graphs defined on general spherically convex domains, in combination with a new application of the selection principle that directly provides the inequalities in barycentric form.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-based time domain decomposition for optimal control of hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a time domain decomposition approach to optimal control of partial differential equations (PDEs) based on semigroup theoretic methods. We formulate the optimality system consisting of two coupled forward-backward PDEs, the state and adjoint equation, as a sum of dissipative operators, which enables a Peaceman-Rachford-type fixed-point iteration. The iteration steps may be understood and implemented as solutions of many decoupled, and therefore highly parallelizable, time-distributed optimal control problems. We prove the convergence of the state, the control, and the corresponding adjoint state in function space. Due to the general framework of $C_0$-(semi)groups, the results are particularly well applicable, e.g., to hyperbolic equations, such as beam or wave equations. We illustrate the convergence and efficiency of the proposed method by means of two numerical examples subject to a 2D wave equation and a 3D heat equation.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates of quantum covering problems via a novel trace inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a novel trace inequality involving two operators. As applications, we sharpen the one-shot achievability bound on the relative entropy error in a wealth of quantum covering-type problems, such as soft covering, privacy amplification, convex splitting, quantum information decoupling, and quantum channel simulation by removing some dimension-dependent factors. Moreover, the established one-shot bounds extend to infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces as well. The proof techniques are based on the recently developed operator layer cake theorem and an operator change-of-variable argument, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the Boundedness of Generalized Fractional Integral Operators in Morrey Spaces and Camapanato Spaces associated with the Dunkl Operator on the Real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17241v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the Dunkl-type fractional integral operator $I_\beta$ $(0 &lt; \beta &lt; 2\alpha + 2 =d_\alpha)$ is bounded from $L^p(\R,d\mu_\alpha)$ to $L^q (\R, d\mu_\alpha)$ when $1 &lt; p &lt; \frac{d_\alpha}{\beta}$ and $\frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{q} = \frac{\beta}{d_\alpha}$. In \cite{spsa} , the authors introduced the generalized Dunkl-type fractional integral operator $T_\rho^\alpha$ and it's modified version $\tilde{T}_\rho^\alpha$ and extended the above boundedness results to the generalized Dunkl-type Morrey spaces and Dunkl-type $BMO_\phi$ spaces. In this paper we investigate the boundedness of generalized Dunkl-type fractional integral operators and it's modified version mainly on the Dunkl-type Campanato space.</description>

      <title>Gr\"unbaum's inequality for probability measures with concavity properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A celebrated result in convex geometry is Gr\"unbaum's inequality, which quantifies how much volume of a convex body can be cut off by a hyperplane passing through its barycenter. In this work, we establish a series of sharp Gr\"unbaum-type inequalities - with equality characterizations - for probability measures under certain concavity assumptions. Of particular interest is the case of $s$-concave Radon measures. For such measures, we provide a simpler proof of known results and, more importantly, obtain the previously missing equality characterization. This is achieved by gaining new insight into the equality case of their Brunn-Minkowski-type inequality.
  Moreover, we show that these ``$s$-Gr\"unbaum'' inequalities can hold only when $s &gt; -1$. However, for convex measures on the real line, we prove Gr\"unbaum-type inequalities involving their cumulative distribution function. Finally, by applying the renowned Ehrhard inequality, we deduce an ``Ehrhard-Gr\"unbaum'' inequality for the Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$, which improves upon the bound derived from its log-concavity.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the decay of the Laplace-Polya integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laplace--P\'olya integral, defined by $J_n(r) = \frac1\pi\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{sinc}^n t \cos(rt) \mathrm{d} \, t$, appears in several areas of mathematics. We study this quantity by combinatorial methods; accordingly, our investigation focuses on the values at integer $r$'s. Our main result establishes a lower bound for the ratio $\frac{J_n(r+2)}{J_n(r)}$ which extends and generalises the previous estimates of Lesieur and Nicolas, and provides a natural counterpart to the upper estimate established in our previous work. We derive the statement by purely combinatorial, elementary arguments. As a corollary, we deduce that no subdiagonal central sections of the unit cube are extremal, apart from the minimal, maximal, and the main diagonal sections. We also prove several consequences for Eulerian numbers.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a class of infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the well-posedness of a class of infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation. This class includes in particular the Euler-Bernoulli beam equations and more generally 1D linear infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation as well as coupled systems. It is known, that for the Timoshenko beam models internal well-posedness implies well-posedness of the overall system. By means of an example we show that this is not true for the Euler-Bernoulli beam models. An easy verifiable equivalent condition for well-posedness of the overall system will be presented. We will conclude the paper by applying the obtained results to several Euler-Bernoulli beam models.</description>
