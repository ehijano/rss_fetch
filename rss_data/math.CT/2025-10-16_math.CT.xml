      <title>Framed Polytopes and Higher Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the early 1990s, Kapranov and Voevodsky proposed a geometric method for constructing higher-categorical pasting diagrams from generically framed convex polytopes. This work revisits their construction and identifies a convex-geometric condition that is both necessary and sufficient for the procedure to yield a well-defined pasting diagram. Our criterion, the absence of cellular loops, relates their construction to the theory of cellular strings, an active area of convex geometry originating in the Baues problem. This paper introduces higher-dimensional cellular strings and uses them to disprove the Kapranov-Voevodsky conjecture in the following strong sense. Not only do we exhibit framed polytopes admitting cellular loops, but we also construct examples for which every admissible frame produces one. As observed by these authors, Street's orientals arise from canonically framed cyclic simplices. We establish that this family is exceptional as any random $n$-simplex, canonically framed, almost surely exhibits cellular loops in the large $n$-limit.</description>

      <title>Higher presentable categories and limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stefanich generalized the notion of (locally) presentable $(\infty, 1)$-category to the notion of presentable $(\infty, n)$-category. We give a new description based on the new notion of $\kappa$-compactly generated $(\infty, n)$-category, which avoids universe enlargement.
  Using the new definition, we prove the underlying functor of a morphism between presentable $(\infty, 2)$-categories has a right adjoint. In particular, any presentable $(\infty, 2)$-category has limits. We also prove that this fails drastically when we go higher: The unit presentable $(\infty, 3)$-category, i.e., the category of presentable $(\infty, 2)$-categories, does not have limits. This settles Stefanich's conjecture in the negative.</description>

      <title>A categorification of representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We categorify the action of $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1})$ on the tensor product of its vector representations $(\mathbb{C}^{1|1})^{\otimes N}$. The generators $E$ and $F$ are represented by Fourier-Mukai functors between the derived categories of coherent sheaves on the total spaces of "semi-parabolic" vector bundles over the Grassmannians $Gr(k,N)$.</description>

      <title>Abacus bicomodule configurations and the Bergner-Osorno-Ozornova-Rovelli-Scheimbauer equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theorem of Bergner, Osorno, Ozornova, Rovelli, and Scheimbauer states an equivalence between 2-Segal spaces and certain augmented stable double Segal spaces. In this paper we establish more general equivalences, involving simplicial maps of 2-Segal spaces and abacus bicomodule configurations, extending results of Carlier. The BOORS equivalence is recovered from the special case of the identity map. One main ingredient is an analysis of the relationship between the BOORS and Carlier notions of augmentation, hitherto considered unrelated.</description>

      <title>Coverages and Grothendieck Toposes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes detail the basics of the theory of Grothendieck toposes from the viewpoint of coverages. Typically one defines a site as a (small) category equipped with a Grothendieck topology. However, it is often desirable to generate a Grothendieck topology from a smaller structure, such as a Grothendieck pretopology, but these require some pullbacks to exist in your underlying category. There is an even more light-weight structure one can generate a Grothendieck topology from called a coverage. Coverages don't require any limits or colimits to exist in the underlying category.
  We prove in detail several results about coverages, such as closing coverages under refinement and composition, to be what we call a saturated coverage, which doesn't change its category of sheaves. We show that Grothendieck topologies are in bijection with saturated coverages. We give an explicit description of the saturated coverage and the Grothendieck topology generated from a coverage.
  We furthermore give a readable account of some of the most important parts of Grothendieck topos theory, with an emphasis placed on coverages. These include constructing sheafification using the plus construction and also in ``one go,'' the equivalence between left exact localizations of presheaf toposes and saturated coverages, morphisms of sites using the fully general notion of covering flatness, points of a Grothendieck topos and Giraud's theorem. We show that Giraud's theorem is equivalent to Rezk's notion of weak descent. Also included is a section devoted to many examples of sites and Grothendieck toposes appearing in the literature, and appendices covering set theory and category theory background, localization and locally presentable categories.</description>

      <title>The algebraic small object argument as a saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the structure of left maps in algebraic weak factorization systems constructed using Garner's algebraic small object argument. We find that any left map can be constructed from generators in Bourke and Garner's double category of left maps by operations that parallel the classical cell-complex-forming operations of Quillen's small object argument (coproducts, cobase changes, transfinite composites, and retracts). Our main theorems are phrased as "saturation" principles, which express the closure conditions necessary for a given property or structure to extend from generators to all left maps. The core of the argument is an analysis of the construction of the free monad on a pointed endofunctor.</description>

      <title>Flat principal 2-group bundles and flat string structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.07571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a weak 2-group, we construct a bicategory of flat 2-group bundles over differentiable stacks as a localization of a functor bicategory. This description is amenable to explicit geometric constructions. For example, we show that flat 2-group bundles can be described in terms of ordinary $G$-bundles together with a trivialization of a certain 2-gerbe. This specializes to a characterization of flat string structures on vector bundles over differentiable stacks.</description>

      <title>A categorical account of composition methods in logic (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06664v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a categorical theory of the composition methods in finite model theory -- a key technique enabling modular reasoning about complex structures by building them out of simpler components. The crucial results required by the composition methods are Feferman--Vaught--Mostowski (FVM) type theorems, which characterize how logical equivalence behaves under composition and transformation of models.

Our results are developed by extending the recently introduced game comonad semantics for model comparison games. This level of abstraction allow us to give conditions yielding FVM type results in a uniform way. Our theorems are parametric in the classes of models, logics and operations involved. Furthermore, they naturally account for the existential and positive existential fragments, and extensions with counting quantifiers of these logics. We also reveal surprising connections between FVM type theorems, and classical concepts in the theory of monads.

We illustrate our methods by recovering many classical theorems of practical interest, including a refinement of a previous result by Dawar, Severini, and Zapata concerning the 3-variable counting logic and cospectrality. To highlight the importance of our techniques being parametric in the logic of interest, we prove a family of FVM theorems for products of structures, uniformly in the logic in question, which cannot be done using specific game arguments.

This is an extended version of the LiCS 2023 conference paper of the same name.</description>

      <title>Algebraic $K$-theory of coherent spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a description of the value of a finitary localizing invariant, such as algebraic $K$-theory, on the category of sheaves on a locally coherent space $X$. This in particular includes all spaces that arise as spectra of commutative rings. As applications we discuss the connection between scissors congruence $K$-theory and Topological Hochschild Homology of certain locally coherent spaces, as well as the algebraic $K$-theory of a measure space.</description>
