      <title>A Conceptual Framework for Human-AI Collaborative Genome Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genome annotation is essential for understanding the functional elements within genomes. While automated methods are indispensable for processing large-scale genomic data, they often face challenges in accurately predicting gene structures and functions. Consequently, manual curation by domain experts remains crucial for validating and refining these predictions. These combined outcomes from automated tools and manual curation highlight the importance of integrating human expertise with AI capabilities to improve both the accuracy and efficiency of genome annotation. However, the manual curation process is inherently labor-intensive and time-consuming, making it difficult to scale for large datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptual framework, Human-AI Collaborative Genome Annotation (HAICoGA), which leverages the synergistic partnership between humans and artificial intelligence to enhance human capabilities and accelerate the genome annotation process. Additionally, we explore the potential of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into this framework to support and augment specific tasks. Finally, we discuss emerging challenges and outline open research questions to guide further exploration in this area.</description>

      <title>Single-Cell Proteomics Using Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-cell proteomics (SCP) is transforming our understanding of biological complexity by shifting from bulk proteomics, where signals are averaged over thousands of cells, to the proteome analysis of individual cells. This granular perspective reveals distinct cell states, population heterogeneity, and the underpinnings of disease pathogenesis that bulk approaches may obscure. However, SCP demands exceptional sensitivity, precise cell handling, and robust data processing to overcome the inherent challenges of analyzing picogram-level protein samples without amplification. Recent innovations in sample preparation, separations, data acquisition strategies, and specialized mass spectrometry instrumentation have substantially improved proteome coverage and throughput. Approaches that integrate complementary omics, streamline multi-step sample processing, and automate workflows through microfluidics and specialized platforms promise to further push SCP boundaries. Advances in computational methods, especially for data normalization and imputation, address the pervasive issue of missing values, enabling more reliable downstream biological interpretations. Despite these strides, higher throughput, reproducibility, and consensus best practices remain pressing needs in the field. This mini review summarizes the latest progress in SCP technology and software solutions, highlighting how closer integration of analytical, computational, and experimental strategies will facilitate deeper and broader coverage of single-cell proteomes.</description>
