      <title>Service Placement and Trajectory Design for Heterogeneous Tasks in Multi-UAV Cooperative Computing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider deploying multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to enhance the computation service of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) through collaborative computation among UAVs. In particular, the tasks of different types and service requirements in MEC network are offloaded from one UAV to another. To pursue the goal of low-carbon edge computing, we study the problem of minimizing system energy consumption by jointly optimizing computation resource allocation, task scheduling, service placement, and UAV trajectories. Considering the inherent unpredictability associated with task generation and the dynamic nature of wireless fading channels, addressing this problem presents a significant challenge. To overcome this issue, we reformulate the complicated non-convex problem as a Markov decision process and propose a soft actor-critic-based trajectory optimization and resource allocation algorithm to implement a flexible learning strategy. Numerical results illustrate that within a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces the system energy consumption in heterogeneous tasks and services scenarios compared to other baseline solutions.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Beamforming for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-assisted MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently gained significant interest since they enable precoding in the wave domain that comes with increased processing capability and reduced energy consumption. The study of SIMs and high frequency propagation make the study of the performance in the near field of crucial importance. Hence, in this work, we focus on SIM-assisted multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in the near field region. To this end, we formulate the weighted sum rate maximisation problem in terms of the transmit power and the phase shifts of the SIM. By applying a block coordinate descent (BCD)-relied algorithm, numerical results show the enhanced performance of the SIM in the near field with respect to the far field.</description>

      <title>Beamforming for PIN Diode-Based IRS-Assisted Systems Under a Phase Shift-Dependent Power Consumption Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have been regarded as a promising enabler for future wireless communication systems. In the literature, IRSs have been considered power-free or assumed to have constant power consumption. However, recent experimental results have shown that for positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diode-based IRSs, the power consumption dynamically changes with the phase shift configuration. This phase shift-dependent power consumption (PS-DPC) introduces a challenging power allocation problem between base station (BS) and IRS. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we investigate a rate maximization problem for IRS-assisted systems under a practical PS-DPC model. For the single-user case, we propose a generalized Benders decomposition-based beamforming method to maximize the achievable rate while satisfying a total system power consumption constraint. Moreover, we propose a low-complexity beamforming design, where the powers allocated to BS and IRS are optimized offline based on statistical channel state information. Furthermore, for the multi-user case, we solve an equivalent weighted mean square error minimization problem with two different joint power allocation and phase shift optimization methods. Simulation results indicate that compared to baseline schemes, our proposed methods can flexibly optimize the power allocation between BS and IRS, thus achieving better performance. The optimized power allocation strategy strongly depends on the system power budget. When the system power budget is high, the PS-DPC is not the dominant factor in the system power consumption, allowing the IRS to turn on as many PIN diodes as needed to achieve high beamforming quality. When the system power budget is limited, however, more power tends to be allocated to the BS to enhance the transmit power, resulting in a lower beamforming quality at the IRS due to the reduced PS-DPC budget.</description>

      <title>Efficient generation of odd order de Bruijn sequence with the same complement and reverse sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental results show that, when the order $n$ is odd, there are de Bruijn sequences such that the corresponding complement sequence and the reverse sequence are the same. In this paper, we propose one efficient method to generate such de Bruijn sequences. This solves an open problem asked by Fredricksen forty years ago for showing the existence of such de Bruijn sequences when the odd order $n &gt;1$. Moreover, we refine a characterization of de Bruijn sequences with the same complement and reverse sequences and study the number of these de Bruijn sequences, as well as the distribution of de Bruijn sequences of the maximum linear complexity.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry Codes for Distributed Matrix Multiplication Using Local Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code-based Distributed Matrix Multiplication (DMM) has been extensively studied in distributed computing for efficiently performing large-scale matrix multiplication using coding theoretic techniques. The communication cost and recovery threshold (i.e., the least number of successful worker nodes required to recover the product of two matrices) are two major challenges in coded DMM research. Several constructions based on Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are known, including Polynomial codes, MatDot codes, and PolyDot codes. However, these RS-based schemes are not efficient for small finite fields because the distributed order (i.e., the total number of worker nodes) is limited by the size of the underlying finite field. Algebraic geometry (AG) codes can have a code length exceeding the size of the finite field, which helps solve this problem. Some work has been done to generalize Polynomial and MatDot codes to AG codes, but the generalization of PolyDot codes to AGcodes still remains an open problem as far as we know. This is because functions of an algebraic curve do not behave as nicely as polynomials.
  In this work, by using local expansions of functions, we are able to generalize the three DMM schemes based on RS codes to AG codes. Specifically, we provide a construction of AG-based PolyDot codes for the first time. In addition, our AG-based Polynomial and MatDot codes achieve better recovery thresholds compared to previous AG-based DMM schemes while maintaining similar communication costs. Our constructions are based on a novel basis of the Riemann-Roch space using local expansions, which naturally generalizes the standard monomial basis of the univariate polynomial space in RS codes. In contrast, previous work used the non-gap numbers to construct a basis of the Riemann-Roch space, which can cause cancellation problems that prevent the conditions of PolyDot codes from being satisfied.</description>

      <title>Channel-Aware Distributed Transmission Control and Video Streaming in UAV Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of distributed transmission control and video streaming optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in unlicensed spectrum bands. We develop a rigorous cross-layer analysis framework that jointly considers three inter-dependent factors: (i) in-band interference introduced by ground/aerial nodes at the physical (PHY) layer, (ii) limited-size queues with delay-constrained packet arrival at the medium access control (MAC) layer, and (iii) video encoding rate at the application layer. First, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the throughput by optimizing the fading threshold. To this end, we jointly analyze the queue-related packet loss probabilities (i.e., buffer overflow and time threshold event) as well as the outage probability due to the low signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). We introduce the Distributed Transmission Control (DTC) algorithm that maximizes the throughput by adjusting transmission policies to balance the trade-offs between packet drop from queues vs. transmission errors due to low SINRs. Second, we incorporate the video distortion model to develop distributed peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) optimization for video streaming. The formulated optimization incorporates two cross-layer parameters, specifically the fading threshold and video encoding rate. To tackle this problem, we develop the Joint Distributed Video Transmission and Encoder Control (JDVT-EC) algorithm that enhances the PSNR for all nodes by fine-tuning transmission policies and video encoding rates to balance the trade-offs between packet loss and lossy video compression distortions. Through extensive numerical analysis, we thoroughly examine the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that they are able to find the optimal transmission policies and video encoding rates under various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Binary $[n,(n\pm1)/2]$ cyclic codes with good minimum distances from sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, binary cyclic codes with parameters $[n,(n\pm1)/2,\geq \sqrt{n}]$ have been a hot topic since their minimum distances have a square-root bound. In this paper, we construct four classes of binary cyclic codes $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{S},0}$, $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{S},1}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{D},0}$, $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{D},1}$ by using two families of sequences, and obtain some codes with parameters $[n,(n\pm1)/2,\geq \sqrt{n}]$. For $m\equiv2\pmod4$, the code $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{S},0}$ has parameters $[2^m-1,2^{m-1},\geq2^{\frac{m}{2}}+2]$, and the code $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{D},0}$ has parameters $[2^m-1,2^{m-1},\geq2^{\frac{m}{2}}+2]$ if $h=1$ and $[2^m-1,2^{m-1},\geq2^{\frac{m}{2}}]$ if $h=2$.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for GEO-LEO Coexisting Satellite Systems: A Traffic-Aware Throughput Maximization Precoder Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The frequency coexistence between geostationary orbit (GEO) and low earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems is expected to be a promising approach for relieving spectrum scarcity. However, it is essential to manage mutual interference between GEO and LEO satellite systems for frequency coexistence. Specifically, \emph{in-line interference}, caused by LEO satellites moving near the line-of-sight path between GEO satellite and GEO users (GUs), can significantly degrade GEO system throughput. This paper put forth a novel rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) with a super-common message for GEO-LEO coexisting satellite systems (CSS). By employing a super-common message that GUs can decode, GUs can mitigate the in-line interference by successive interference cancellation (SIC). Moreover, we formulate a traffic-aware throughput maximization (TTM) problem to satisfy the heterogeneous traffic demands of users by minimizing total unmet throughput demands (or user dissatisfaction). By doing so, the TTM precoder can be flexibly adjusted according to the interference leakage from LEO satellites to GUs and target traffic demands. Numerical results confirm that our proposed method ensures seamless connectivity even in the GEO-LEO in-line interference regime under imperfect channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and receiver.</description>

      <title>Secure Semantic Communications: From Perspective of Physical Layer Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communications have been envisioned as a potential technique that goes beyond Shannon paradigm. Unlike modern communications that provide bit-level security, the eaves-dropping of semantic communications poses a significant risk of potentially exposing intention of legitimate user. To address this challenge, a novel deep neural network (DNN) enabled secure semantic communication (DeepSSC) system is developed by capitalizing on physical layer security. To balance the tradeoff between security and reliability, a two-phase training method for DNNs is devised. Particularly, Phase I aims at semantic recovery of legitimate user, while Phase II attempts to minimize the leakage of semantic information to eavesdroppers. The loss functions of DeepSSC in Phases I and II are respectively designed according to Shannon capacity and secure channel capacity, which are approximated with variational inference. Moreover, we define the metric of secure bilingual evaluation understudy (S-BLEU) to assess the security of semantic communications. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that DeepSSC achieves a significant boost to semantic security particularly in high signal-to-noise ratio regime, despite a minor degradation of reliability.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Iterative Blind Detection based on Expectation Maximization and Belief Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study iterative blind symbol detection for block-fading linear inter-symbol interference channels. Based on the factor graph framework, we design a joint channel estimation and detection scheme that combines the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and the ubiquitous belief propagation (BP) algorithm. Interweaving the iterations of both schemes significantly reduces the EM algorithm's computational burden while retaining its excellent performance. To this end, we apply simple yet effective model-based learning methods to find a suitable parameter update schedule by introducing momentum in both the EM parameter updates as well as in the BP message passing. Numerical simulations verify that the proposed method can learn efficient schedules that generalize well and even outperform coherent BP detection in high signal-to-noise scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fair Resource Allocation For Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks via Deep Reinforcement Learning with Hybrid Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has become a crucial research direction in future wireless communications due to its ubiquitous coverage, rapid and flexible deployment, and multi-layer cooperation capabilities. However, integrating hierarchical federated learning (HFL) with edge computing and SAGINs remains a complex open issue to be resolved. This paper proposes a novel framework for applying HFL in SAGINs, utilizing aerial platforms and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites as edge servers and cloud servers, respectively, to provide multi-layer aggregation capabilities for HFL. The proposed system also considers the presence of inter-satellite links (ISLs), enabling satellites to exchange federated learning models with each other. Furthermore, we consider multiple different computational tasks that need to be completed within a limited satellite service time. To maximize the convergence performance of all tasks while ensuring fairness, we propose the use of the distributional soft-actor-critic (DSAC) algorithm to optimize resource allocation in the SAGIN and aggregation weights in HFL. Moreover, we address the efficiency issue of hybrid action spaces in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) through a decoupling and recoupling approach, and design a new dynamic adjusting reward function to ensure fairness among multiple tasks in federated learning. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithm, consistently outperforming baseline approaches and offering a promising solution for addressing highly complex optimization problems in SAGINs.</description>

      <title>Massive MIMO-OTFS-Based Random Access for Cooperative LEO Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates joint device identification, channel estimation, and symbol detection for cooperative multi-satellite-enhanced random access, where orthogonal time-frequency space modulation with the large antenna array is utilized to combat the dynamics of the terrestrial-satellite links (TSLs). We introduce the generalized complex exponential basis expansion model to parameterize TSLs, thereby reducing the pilot overhead. By exploiting the block sparsity of the TSLs in the angular domain, a message passing algorithm is designed for initial channel estimation. Subsequently, we examine two cooperative modes to leverage the spatial diversity within satellite constellations: the centralized mode, where computations are performed at a high-power central server, and the distributed mode, where computations are offloaded to edge satellites with minimal signaling overhead. Specifically, in the centralized mode, device identification is achieved by aggregating backhaul information from edge satellites, and channel estimation and symbol detection are jointly enhanced through a structured approximate expectation propagation (AEP) algorithm. In the distributed mode, edge satellites share channel information and exchange soft information about data symbols, leading to a distributed version of AEP. The introduced basis expansion model for TSLs enables the efficient implementation of both centralized and distributed algorithms via fast Fourier transform. Simulation results demonstrate that proposed schemes significantly outperform conventional algorithms in terms of the activity error rate, the normalized mean squared error, and the symbol error rate. Notably, the distributed mode achieves performance comparable to the centralized mode with only two exchanges of soft information about data symbols within the constellation.</description>

Abstract: Time-triggered federated learning, in contrast to conventional event-based federated learning, organizes users into tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, this network still faces challenges due to a growing number of devices and limited wireless bandwidth, increasing issues like stragglers and communication overhead. In this paper, we apply model pruning to wireless Time-triggered systems and jointly study the problem of optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth allocation to minimize training loss under communication latency constraints. To solve this joint optimization problem, we perform a convergence analysis on the gradient $l_2$-norm of the asynchronous multi-tier federated learning (FL) model with adaptive model pruning. The convergence upper bound is derived and a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio and wireless bandwidth is defined to minimize the model training loss under a given communication latency constraint. The closed-form solutions for wireless bandwidth and pruning ratio by using KKT conditions are then formulated. As indicated in the simulation experiments, our proposed TT-Prune demonstrates a 40% reduction in communication cost, compared with the asynchronous multi-tier FL without model pruning, while maintaining the model convergence at the same level.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Information Measures: A Copula-based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate datasets are common in various real-world applications. Recently, copulas have received significant attention for modeling dependencies among random variables. A copula-based information measure is required to quantify the uncertainty inherent in these dependencies. This paper introduces a multivariate variant of the cumulative copula entropy and explores its various properties, including bounds, stochastic orders, and convergence-related results. Additionally, we define a cumulative copula information generating function and derive it for several well-known families of multivariate copulas. A fractional generalization of the multivariate cumulative copula entropy is also introduced and examined. We present a non-parametric estimator of the cumulative copula entropy using empirical beta copula. Furthermore, we propose a new distance measure between two copulas based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and discuss a goodness-of-fit test based on this measure.</description>

      <title>Explosive neural networks via higher-order interactions in curved statistical manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-order interactions underlie complex phenomena in systems such as biological and artificial neural networks, but their study is challenging due to the lack of tractable standard models. By leveraging the maximum entropy principle in curved statistical manifolds, here we introduce curved neural networks as a class of prototypical models for studying higher-order phenomena. Through exact mean-field descriptions, we show that these curved neural networks implement a self-regulating annealing process that can accelerate memory retrieval, leading to explosive order-disorder phase transitions with multi-stability and hysteresis effects. Moreover, by analytically exploring their memory capacity using the replica trick near ferromagnetic and spin-glass phase boundaries, we demonstrate that these networks enhance memory capacity over the classical associative-memory networks. Overall, the proposed framework provides parsimonious models amenable to analytical study, revealing novel higher-order phenomena in complex network systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the higher weight spectra of $q$-ary Reed-Muller codes $C_q=RM_q(2,2)$ for all prime powers $q$. This is equivalent to finding the usual weight distributions of all extension codes of $C_q$ over every field extension of $F_q$ of finite degree. To obtain our results we will utilize well-known connections between these weights and properties of the Stanley-Reisner rings of a series of matroids associated to each code $C_q$. In the process, we are able to explicitly determine all the graded Betti numbers of matroids associated to $C_q$ and its elongations.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of the Conditional Independence Implication Problem With Bounded Cardinalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the conditional independence (CI) implication problem with bounded cardinalities, which asks whether a given CI implication holds for all discrete random variables with given cardinalities, is co-NEXPTIME-hard. The problem remains co-NEXPTIME-hard if all variables are binary. The reduction goes from a variant of the tiling problem and is based on a prior construction used by Cheuk Ting Li to show the undecidability of a related problem where the cardinality of some variables remains unbounded. The CI implication problem with bounded cardinalities is known to be in EXPSPACE, as its negation can be stated as an existential first-order logic formula over the reals of size exponential with regard to the size of the input.</description>

      <title>Channel Simulation: Finite Blocklengths and Broadcast Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11666v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study channel simulation under common randomness assistance in the finite-blocklength regime and identify the smooth channel max-information as a linear program one-shot converse on the minimal simulation cost for fixed error tolerance. We show that this one-shot converse can be achieved exactly using no-signaling-assisted codes, and approximately achieved using common randomness-assisted codes. Our one-shot converse thus takes on an analogous role to the celebrated meta-converse in the complementary problem of channel coding, and we find tight relations between these two bounds. We asymptotically expand our bounds on the simulation cost for discrete memoryless channels, leading to the second-order as well as the moderate deviation rate expansion, which can be expressed in terms of the channel capacity and channel dispersion known from noisy channel coding. Our bounds imply the well-known fact that the optimal asymptotic rate of one channel to simulate another under common randomness assistance is given by the ratio of their respective capacities. Additionally, our higher-order asymptotic expansion shows that this reversibility falls apart in the second order. Our techniques extend to discrete memoryless broadcast channels. In stark contrast to the elusive broadcast channel capacity problem, we show that the reverse problem of broadcast channel simulation under common randomness assistance allows for an efficiently computable single-letter characterization of the asymptotic rate region in terms of the broadcast channel's multipartite mutual information.</description>

      <title>Reliability-Latency-Rate Tradeoff in Low-Latency Communications with Finite-Blocklength Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-latency communication plays an increasingly important role in delay-sensitive applications by ensuring the real-time information exchange. However, due to the constraint on the maximum instantaneous power, guaranteeing bounded latency is challenging. In this paper, we investigate the reliability-latency-rate tradeoff in low-latency communication systems with finite-blocklength coding (FBC). Specifically, we are interested in the fundamental tradeoff between error probability, delay-violation probability (DVP), and service rate. Based on the effective capacity (EC), we present the gain-conservation equations to characterize the reliability-latency-rate tradeoffs in low-latency communication systems. In particular, we investigate the low-latency transmissions over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and a Nakagami-$m$ fading channel. By defining the service rate gain, reliability gain, and real-time gain, we conduct an asymptotic analysis to reveal the fundamental reliability-latency-rate tradeoff of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. To analytically evaluate and optimize the quality-of-service-constrained throughput of low-latency communication systems adopting FBC, an EC-approximation method is conceived to derive the closed-form expression of that throughput. Our results may offer some insights into the efficient scheduling of low-latency wireless communications, in which statistical latency and reliability metrics are crucial.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Design of Multi-Dimensional Spatially-Coupled Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15166v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of their excellent asymptotic and finite-length performance, spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check codes that is gaining increasing attention. Multi-dimensional (MD) SC codes are constructed by connecting copies of an SC code via relocations in order to mitigate various sources of non-uniformity and improve performance in many data storage and data transmission systems. As the number of degrees of freedom in the MD-SC code design increases, appropriately exploiting them becomes more difficult because of the complexity growth of the design process. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for the MD-SC code design, which is based on the gradient-descent (GD) algorithm, to design better MD codes and address this challenge. In particular, we express the expected number of short cycles, which we seek to minimize, in the graph representation of the code in terms of entries of a probability-distribution matrix that characterizes the MD-SC code design. We then find a locally-optimal probability distribution, which serves as the starting point of a finite-length algorithmic optimizer that produces the final MD-SC code. We offer the theoretical analysis as well as the algorithms, and we present experimental results demonstrating that our MD codes, conveniently called GD-MD codes, have notably lower short cycle numbers compared with the available state-of-the-art. Moreover, our algorithms converge on solutions in few iterations, which confirms the complexity reduction as a result of limiting the search space via the locally-optimal GD-MD distributions.</description>

      <title>Molecular Arithmetic Coding (MoAC) and Optimized Molecular Prefix Coding (MoPC$^{*}$) for Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) has emerged as a promising paradigm employing molecules to transfer information at the nano-scale. In a recent paper, prefix source coding was introduced into the field, through an MC-adapted version of the Huffman coding. We first demonstrate that, although MC-adapted Huffman coding improves symbol error rates compared to Huffman coding, it does not always produce an optimal MC-adapted prefix codebook in terms of expected length and power. Accordingly, we utilise a straightforward brute-force algorithm to find an optimal MC-adapted prefix (MoPC$^{*}$) codebook for any given alphabet.
  In the context of MC source coding, the major finding of this paper is the Molecular Arithmetic Coding (MoAC) whose algorithmic implementation and code-structure is non-arbitrarily different than that of the widely-known classical arithmetic coding (AC). MoAC is designed to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI) for alphabets with known symbol probabilities through, in a highly efficient way, avoiding consecutive 1-bits. However, due to bit precision limitations, unique-decodability of MoAC is not guaranteed. Accordingly, a uniquely-decodable new coding scheme named Molecular Arithmetic with Prefix Coding (MoAPC) is introduced.
  On two exemplary nucleotide alphabets, we show that MoAPC has a better compression performance than MoPC$^{*}$. Simulation results demonstrate the highly superior word error rate (WER) and symbol error rate (SER) values of MoAPC compared to its arithmetic contenders: AC, and the Substitution Arithmetic Coding (SAC), which is introduced for the first time in this paper, and is a simple and trivial adaption of AC to molecular communication. Simulation results show that on the first alphabet, MoAPC surpasses all given methods in WER and asymptotically in SER; while on the second alphabet, MoPC$^{*}$ surpasses all in SER and WER.</description>

      <title>Towards a Theory of Pragmatic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard information theory says nothing about how much meaning is conveyed by the information. We fill this gap with a rigorously justifiable, quantitative definition of ``pragmatic information'' as the amount of meaning in a message that is relevant to a particular decision (as opposed to the {\it value} that the decision maker places on that message). We posit that such a message updates a ``state of the world'' random variable, $\omega$, that informs the decision. The pragmatic information of a single message is then defined as the Kulbach-Leibler divergence between the {\it a priori} and updated probability distributions of $\omega$; the pragmatic information of a message ensemble is defined as the expected value of the pragmatic information values of the ensemble's component messages. We then show, first, that the pragmatic information of a single message is the expected difference between the shortest binary encoding of $\omega$ under the {\it a priori} and updated distributions, and, second, that the average of the pragmatic values of individual messages, when sampled a large number of times from the ensemble, approaches its expected value.
  Pragmatic information thus defined has many hoped-for properties, such as non-negativity and additivity for independent decisions and ``pragmatically independent'' messages. We also sketch three applications: The first is the single play of a slot machine, a.k.a. ``one armed bandit'', with an unknown payout probability; the second being a characterization of the rate of biological evolution in a simple model of reproduction with mutation (the so-called ``quasi-species'' model); the third being a reformulation of the efficient market hypothesis of financial economics. We conclude by noting the importance of the computational capacity of the receiver in processing pragmatic information.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmitter and Receiver Design for Movable Antenna Enhanced Multicast Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is an emerging technology that utilizes localized antenna movement to achieve better channel conditions for enhancing communication performance. In this paper, we study the MA-enhanced multicast transmission from a base station equipped with multiple MAs to multiple groups of single-MA users. Our goal is to maximize the minimum weighted signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users by jointly optimizing the position of each transmit/receive MA and the transmit beamforming. To tackle this challenging problem, we first consider the single-group scenario and propose an efficient algorithm based on the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Particularly, when optimizing transmit or receive MA positions, we construct a concave lower bound for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each user using only the second-order Taylor expansion, which simplifies the problem-solving process compared to the existing two-step approximation method. The proposed design is then extended to the general multi-group scenario. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges faster than the existing two-step approximation method, achieving a 3.4% enhancement in max-min SNR. Moreover, it can improve the max-min SNR/SINR by up to 22.5%, 181.7%, and 343.9% compared to benchmarks employing only receive MAs, only transmit MAs, and both transmit and receive FPAs, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple-antenna technologies are advancing toward the development of extremely large aperture arrays and the utilization of extremely high frequencies, driving the progress of next-generation multiple access (NGMA). This evolution is accompanied by the emergence of near-field communications (NFC), characterized by spherical-wave propagation, which introduces additional range dimensions to the channel and enhances system throughput. In this context, a tutorial-based primer on NFC is presented, emphasizing its applications in multiuser communications and multiple access (MA). The following areas are investigated: \romannumeral1) the commonly used near-field channel models are reviewed along with their simplifications under various near-field conditions. \romannumeral2) Building upon these models, the information-theoretic capacity limits of NFC-MA are analyzed, including the derivation of sum-rate capacity and capacity region, and their upper limits for both downlink and uplink scenarios. \romannumeral3) A detailed investigation of near-field multiuser beamforming design is presented, offering low-complexity and effective NFC-MA design methodologies in both the spatial and wavenumber (angular) domains. Throughout these investigations, near-field MA is compared with its far-field counterpart to highlight its superiority and flexibility in terms of interference management, thereby laying the groundwork for achieving NGMA.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the properties of a family of polytopes that naturally arise in connection with a problem in distributed data storage, namely service rate region polytopes. The service rate region of a distributed coded system describes the data access requests that the underlying system can support. In this paper, we study the polytope structure of the service rate region with the primary goal of describing its geometric shape and properties. We achieve so by introducing various structural parameters of the service rate region and establishing upper and lower bounds for them. The techniques we apply in this paper range from coding theory to optimization. One of our main results shows that every rational point of the service rate region has a so-called rational allocation, answering an open question in the research area.</description>

      <title>On the resilience of the quadratic Littlewood-Offord problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical resilience of the anti-concentration properties of Rademacher polynomials in face of adversarial deterministic noise taking the form of sign-flips. Given a multilinear polynomial $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ and a Rademacher vector $\boldsymbol{\xi} \in \{\pm 1\}^n$ (with independent entries), our results provide probabilistic lower bound estimations on the number of sign-flips that $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ can sustain without ``inflating" the atom probability $\sup_{x \in \mathbb{R} } \mathbb{P}\{f(\boldsymbol{\xi}) = x\}$ otherwise resulting in an adversarially biased distribution. Special emphasis is put on bilinear and quadratic forms, for which strengthened estimates are attained. From a computational perspective, our results in this venue are instance-bound in such a way that allows for an efficient computation of the statistical resilience guarantees from the quadratic polynomial itself directly. All of our probabilistic lower bound resilience guarantees are asymptotically tight.
  On route, we provide a short proof for a new small-ball probability estimate fitting Rademacher multilinear polynomials $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ removeing a polylog-factor from the classical Meka-Nguyen-Vu bound provided the coefficients are independent of $n$ (dimension-free, hereafter). This removal was conjectured to be possible by Meka-Nguyen-Vu regardless of our assumption. Bilinear Rademacher forms with dimension-free coefficients arise naturally in Combinatorics and specifically in the dense case of the edge-statistics conjecture posed by Alon, Hefetz, Krivelevich, and Tyomkyn. This case of the conjecture was resolved by Kwan and Sauermann. Replacing the appeal to the Meka-Nguyen-Vu classical bound in the work of Kwan, Sudakov, and Tran with our shortly proved result attains an additional proof of the dense case of the edge-statistics conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article develops an analytical framework for studying information divergences and likelihood ratios associated with Poisson processes and point patterns on general measurable spaces. The main results include explicit analytical formulas for Kullback-Leibler divergences, R\'enyi divergences, Hellinger distances, and likelihood ratios of the laws of Poisson point patterns in terms of their intensity measures. The general results yield similar formulas for inhomogeneous Poisson processes, compound Poisson processes, as well as spatial and marked Poisson point patterns. Additional results include simple characterisations of absolute continuity, mutual singularity, and the existence of common dominating measures. The analytical toolbox is based on Tsallis divergences of sigma-finite measures on abstract measurable spaces. The treatment is purely information-theoretic and free of topological assumptions.</description>

Abstract: Use-dependent bias is a phenomenon in human sensorimotor behavior whereby movements become biased towards previously repeated actions. Despite being well-documented, the reason why this phenomenon occurs is not yet clearly understood. Here, we propose that use-dependent biases can be understood as a rational strategy for movement under limitations on the capacity to process sensory information to guide motor output. We adopt an information-theoretic approach to characterize sensorimotor information processing and determine how behavior should be optimized given limitations to this capacity. We show that this theory naturally predicts the existence of use-dependent biases. Our framework also generates two further predictions. The first prediction relates to handedness. The dominant hand is associated with enhanced dexterity and reduced movement variability compared to the non-dominant hand, which we propose relates to a greater capacity for information processing in regions that control movement of the dominant hand. Consequently, the dominant hand should exhibit smaller use-dependent biases compared to the non-dominant hand. The second prediction relates to how use-dependent biases are affected by movement speed. When moving faster, it is more challenging to correct for initial movement errors online during the movement. This should exacerbate costs associated with initial directional error and, according to our theory, reduce the extent of use-dependent biases compared to slower movements, and vice versa. We show that these two empirical predictions, the handedness effect and the speed-dependent effect, are confirmed by experimental data.</description>
