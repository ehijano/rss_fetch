      <title>Fractional-order dependent Radial basis functions meshless methods for the integral fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the numerical evaluation of the integral fractional Laplacian and its application in solving fractional diffusion equations. We derive a pseudo-spectral formula for the integral fractional Laplacian operator based on fractional order-dependent, generalized multi-quadratic radial basis functions (RBFs) to address efficient computation of the hyper-singular integral. We apply the proposed formula to solving fractional diffusion equations and design a simple, easy-to-implement and nearly integration-free meshless method. We discuss the convergence of the novel meshless method through equivalent Galerkin formulations. We carry out numerical experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach compared to the existing method using Gaussian RBFs.</description>

      <title>Finite element approximation to the non-stationary quasi-geostrophic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, C1-conforming element methods are analyzed for the stream function formulation of a single layer non-stationary quasi-geostrophic equation in the ocean circulation model. In its first part, some new regularity results are derived, which show exponential decay property when the wind shear stress is zero or exponentially decaying. Moreover, when the wind shear stress is independent of time, the existence of an attractor is established. In its second part, finite element methods are applied in the spatial direction and for the resulting semi-discrete scheme, the exponential decay property, and the existence of a discrete attractor are proved. By introducing an intermediate solution of a discrete linearized problem, optimal error estimates are derived. Based on backward-Euler method, a completely discrete scheme is obtained and uniform in time a priori estimates are established. Moreover, the existence of a discrete solution is proved by appealing to a variant of the Brouwer fixed point theorem and then, optimal error estimate is derived. Finally, several computational experiments with benchmark problems are conducted to confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Optimal convergence in finite element semi-discrete error analysis of the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model beyond 1D with a novel projection operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a finite element semi-discrete error analysis for the Doyle-Fuller-Newman model, which is the most popular model for lithium-ion batteries. Central to our approach is a novel projection operator designed for the pseudo-($N$+1)-dimensional equation, offering a powerful tool for multiscale equation analysis. Our results bridge a gap in the analysis for dimensions $2 \le N \le 3$ and achieve optimal convergence rates of $h+(\Delta r)^2$. Additionally, we perform a detailed numerical verification, marking the first such validation in this context. By avoiding the change of variables, our error analysis can also be extended beyond isothermal conditions.</description>

      <title>Directional diffusion splitting method for advection-diffusion-reaction model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose certain approach of solving two-dimensional non-stationary and stationary advection-diffusion-reaction boundary value problems through their reduction to the set of corresponding one-dimensional problems. This method leverages special splitting and interpolation schemes, providing iterative algorithm with a large degree of parallelization possibilities. We combine that algorithm with the finite element method to solve obtained one-dimensional problems, but in fact, it can be combined also with other discretization methods, like finite volume or finite difference methods.</description>

      <title>Numerical integrations of stochastic contact Hamiltonian systems via stochastic contact Hamilton-Jacobi equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic contact Hamiltonian systems are a class of important mathematical models, which can describe the dissipative properties with odd dimensions in the stochastic environment. In this article, we investigate the numerical dynamics of the stochastic contact Hamiltonian systems via structure-preserving methods. The contact structure-preserving schemes are constructed by the stochastic contact Hamilton-Jacobi equation. A general numerical approximation method of the stochastic contact Hamilton-Jacobi equation is devised, and the convergent order theorem is provided, too.
  Numerical tests are shown to confirm the theoretical results and the usability of proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modelling of the water absorption properties for historical lime-based mortars from Catania (Sicily, Italy)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a mathematical model of the capillary and permeability properties of lime-based mortars from the historic built heritage of Catania (Sicily, Italy) produced by using two different types of volcanic aggregate, i.e. ghiara and azolo. In order to find a formulation for the capillary pressure and the permeability as functions of the saturation level inside the porous medium we calibrate the numerical algorithm against imbibition data. The validation of the mathematical model was done by comparing the experimental retention curve with the one obtained by the simulation algorithm. Indeed, with the proposed approach it was possible to reproduce the main features of the experimentally observed phenomenon for both materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This project is based on the dataset "exposome_NA.RData", which contains a subcohort of 1301 mother-child pairs who were enrolled into the HELIX study during pregnancy. Several health outcomes were measured on the child at birth or at age 6-11 years, taking environmental exposures of interest and other covariates into account. This report outlines the process of obtaining the best MLR model with optimal predictive power. We first obtain three candidate models we obtained from the forward selection, backward elimination and stepwise selection, and select the optimal model using various comparison schemes including AIC, Adjusted R^2 and cross-validation for 8000 repetitions. The report ended with some additional findings revealed by the selected model, along with restrictions on the method we use in the model selection process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends deterministic notions of Strong Stability Preservation (SSP) to the stochastic setting, enabling nonlinearly stable numerical solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with pathwise solutions that remain unconditionally bounded. This approach may offer modelling advantages in data assimilation, particularly when the signal or data is a realization of an SPDE or PDE with a monotonicity property.</description>

      <title>A numerical method for scattering problems with unbounded interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of computationally tractable scattering problems in unbounded domains, which we call decomposable problems. In these decomposable problems, the computational domain can be split into a finite collection of subdomains in which the scatterer has a "simple" structure. A subdomain is simple if the domain Green's function for this subdomain is either available analytically or can be computed numerically with arbitrary accuracy by a tractable method. These domain Green's functions are then used to reformulate the scattering problem as a system of boundary integral equations on the union of the subdomain boundaries. This reformulation gives a practical numerical method, as the resulting integral equations can then be solved, to any desired degree of accuracy, by using coordinate complexification over a finite interval, and standard discretization techniques.</description>

      <title>An efficient fifth-order interpolation-based Hermite WENO scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a simple, efficient, and fifth-order finite difference interpolation-based Hermite WENO (HWENO-I) scheme for one- and two-dimensional hyperbolic conservation laws. We directly interpolate the solution and first-order derivative values and evaluate the numerical fluxes based on these interpolated values. We do not need the split of the flux functions when reconstructing numerical fluxes and there is no need for any additional HWENO interpolation for the modified derivative. The HWENO interpolation only needs to be applied one time which utilizes the same candidate stencils, Hermite interpolation polynomials, and linear/nonlinear weights for the solution and first-order derivative at the cell interface, as well as the modified derivative at the cell center. The HWENO-I scheme inherits the advantages of the finite difference flux-reconstruction-based HWENO-R scheme [Fan et al., Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg., 2023], including fifth-order accuracy, compact stencils, arbitrary positive linear weights, and high resolution. The HWENO-I scheme is simpler and more efficient than the HWENO-R scheme and the previous finite difference interpolation-based HWENO scheme [Liu and Qiu, J. Sci. Comput., 2016] which needs the split of flux functions for the stability and upwind performance for the high-order derivative terms. Various benchmark numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, high resolution, and robustness of the proposed HWENO-I scheme.</description>

      <title>Well-balanced fifth-order finite volume WENO schemes with constant subtraction technique for shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new well-balanced fifth-order finite volume WENO method for solving one- and two-dimensional shallow water equations with bottom topography. The well-balanced property is crucial to the ability of a scheme to simulate perturbation waves over the ``lake-at-rest'' steady state such as waves on a lake or tsunami waves in the deep ocean. We adopt the constant subtraction technique such that both the flux gradient and source term in the new pre-balanced form vanish at the lake-at-rest steady state, while the well-balanced WENO method by Xing and Shu [Commun. Comput. Phys., 2006] uses high-order accurate numerical discretization of the source term and makes the exact balance between the source term and the flux gradient, to achieve the well-balanced property. The scaling positivity-preserving limiter is used for the water height near the dry areas. The fifth-order WENO-AO reconstruction is used to construct the solution since it has better resolution than the WENO-ZQ and WENO-MR reconstructions for the perturbation of steady state flows. Extensive one- and two-dimensional numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the well-balanced, fifth-order accuracy, non-oscillatory, and positivity-preserving properties of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Symplectic QTT-FEM solution of the one-dimensional acoustic wave equation in the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured Finite Element Methods (FEMs) based on low-rank approximation in the form of the so-called Quantized Tensor Train (QTT) decomposition (QTT-FEM) have been proposed and extensively studied in the case of elliptic equations. In this work, we design a QTT-FE method for time-domain acoustic wave equations, combining stable low-rank approximation in space with a suitable conservative discretization in time. For the acoustic wave equation with a homogeneous source term in a single space dimension as a model problem, we consider its reformulation as a first-order system in time. In space, we employ a low-rank QTT-FEM discretization based on continuous piecewise linear finite elements corresponding to uniformly refined nested meshes. Time integration is performed using symplectic high-order Gauss-Legendre Runge-Kutta methods. In our numerical experiments, we investigate the energy conservation and exponential convergence of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Hadamard Langevin dynamics for sampling sparse priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Priors with non-smooth log densities have been widely used in Bayesian inverse problems, particularly in imaging, due to their sparsity inducing properties. To date, the majority of algorithms for handling such densities are based on proximal Langevin dynamics where one replaces the non-smooth part by a smooth approximation known as the Moreau envelope. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for sampling densities with $\ell_1$-priors based on a Hadamard product parameterization. This builds upon the idea that the Laplace prior has a Gaussian mixture representation and our method can be seen as a form of overparametrization: by increasing the number of variables, we construct a density from which one can directly recover the original density. This is fundamentally different from proximal-type approaches since our resolution is exact, while proximal-based methods introduce additional bias due to the Moreau-envelope smoothing. For our new density, we present its Langevin dynamics in continuous time and establish well-posedness and geometric ergodicity. We also present a discretization scheme for the continuous dynamics and prove convergence as the time-step diminishes.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for electrical impedance tomography using quasi-Monte Carlo methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical development of quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for uncertainty quantification of partial differential equations (PDEs) is typically centered around simplified model problems such as elliptic PDEs subject to homogeneous zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this paper, we present a theoretical treatment of the application of randomly shifted rank-1 lattice rules to electrical impedance tomography (EIT). EIT is an imaging modality, where the goal is to reconstruct the interior conductivity of an object based on electrode measurements of current and voltage taken at the boundary of the object. This is an inverse problem, which we tackle using the Bayesian statistical inversion paradigm. As the reconstruction, we consider QMC integration to approximate the unknown conductivity given current and voltage measurements. We prove under moderate assumptions placed on the parameterization of the unknown conductivity that the QMC approximation of the reconstructed estimate has a dimension-independent, faster-than-Monte Carlo cubature convergence rate. Finally, we present numerical results for examples computed using simulated measurement data.</description>

Abstract: We present a finite volume scheme for modeling the diffusion of charged particles, specifically ions, in constrained geometries using a degenerate Poisson-Nernst-Planck system with size exclusion yielding cross-diffusion. Our method utilizes a two-point flux approximation and is part of the exponentially fitted scheme framework. The scheme is shown to be thermodynamically consistent, as it ensures the decay of some discrete version of the free energy. Classical numerical analysis results -- existence of discrete solution, convergence of the scheme as the grid size and the time step go to $0$ -- follow. We also investigate the long-time behavior of the scheme, both from a theoretical and numerical point of view. Numerical simulations confirm our findings, but also point out some possibly very slow convergence towards equilibrium of the system under consideration.</description>

      <title>Attraction-Repulsion Swarming: A Generalized Framework of t-SNE via Force Normalization and Tunable Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method for data visualization based on attraction-repulsion swarming (ARS) dynamics, which we call ARS visualization. ARS is a generalized framework that is based on viewing the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique as a swarm of interacting agents driven by attraction and repulsion. Motivated by recent developments in swarming, we modify the t-SNE dynamics to include a normalization by the \emph{total influence}, which results in better posed dynamics in which we can use a data size independent time step (of $h=1$) and a simple iteration, without the need for the array of optimization tricks employed in t-SNE. ARS also includes the ability to separately tune the attraction and repulsion kernels, which gives the user control over the tightness within clusters and the spacing between them in the visualization.
  In contrast with t-SNE, our proposed ARS data visualization method is not gradient descent on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and can be viewed solely as an interacting particle system driven by attraction and repulsion forces. We provide theoretical results illustrating how the choice of interaction kernel affects the dynamics, and experimental results to validate our method and compare to t-SNE on the MNIST and Cifar-10 data sets.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odingerization based Quantum Circuits for Maxwell's Equation with time-dependent source terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odingerisation method combined with the autonomozation technique in \cite{cjL23} converts general non-autonomous linear differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of autonomous Schr\"odinger-type equations, via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the equation into two higher dimension. Despite the success of Schr\"odingerisation techniques, they typically require the black box of the sparse Hamiltonian simulation, suitable for continuous-variable based analog quantum simulation. For qubit-based general quantum computing one needs to design the quantum circuits for practical implementation.
  This paper explicitly constructs a quantum circuit for Maxwell's equations with perfect electric conductor (PEC) boundary conditions and time-dependent source terms, based on Schr\"odingerization and autonomozation, with corresponding computational complexity analysis. Through initial value smoothing and high-order approximation to the delta function, the increase in qubits from the extra dimensions only requires minor rise in computational complexity, almost $\log\log {1/\varepsilon}$ where $\varepsilon$ is the desired precision. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum algorithms constructed using Schr\"odingerisation exhibit polynomial acceleration in computational complexity compared to the classical Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) format.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Approximations for Stationary Distributions of McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the development of unbiased estimators, to approximate the stationary distribution of Mckean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MVSDEs). These are an important class of processes, which frequently appear in applications such as mathematical finance, biology and opinion dynamics. Typically the stationary distribution is unknown and indeed one cannot simulate such processes exactly. As a result one commonly requires a time-discretization scheme which results in a discretization bias and a bias from not being able to simulate the associated stationary distribution. To overcome this bias, we present a new unbiased estimator taking motivation from the literature on unbiased Monte Carlo. We prove the unbiasedness of our estimator, under assumptions. In order to prove this we require developing ergodicity results of various discrete time processes, through an appropriate discretization scheme, towards the invariant measure. Numerous numerical experiments are provided, on a range of MVSDEs, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our unbiased estimator. Such examples include the Currie-Weiss model, a 3D neuroscience model and a parameter estimation problem.</description>

      <title>Review on vortex dynamics in the left ventricle as an early diagnosis marker for heart diseases and its treatment outcomes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heart is the central part of the cardiovascular network. Its role is to pump blood to various body organs. Many cardiovascular diseases occur due to an abnormal functioning of the heart. A diseased heart leads to severe complications and in some cases death of an individual. The medical community believes that early diagnosis and treatment of heart diseases can be controlled by referring to numerical simulations of image-based heart models. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a commonly used tool for patient-specific simulations in the cardiac flows, and it can be equipped to allow a better understanding of flow patterns. In this paper, we review the progress of CFD tools to understand the flow patterns in healthy and dilated cardiomyopathic (DCM) left ventricles (LV). The formation of an asymmetric vortex in a healthy LV shows an efficient way of blood transport. The vortex pattern changes before any change in the geometry of LV is noticeable. This flow change can be used as a marker of DCM progression. We can conclude that understanding vortex dynamics in LV using various vortex indexes coupled with data-driven approaches can be used as an early diagnosis tool and improvement in DCM treatment.</description>

      <title>Multigrid reduction-in-time convergence for advection problems: A Fourier analysis perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A long-standing issue in the parallel-in-time community is the poor convergence of standard iterative parallel-in-time methods for hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), and for advection-dominated PDEs more broadly. Here, a local Fourier analysis (LFA) convergence theory is derived for the two-level variant of the iterative parallel-in-time method of multigrid reduction-in-time (MGRIT). This closed-form theory allows for new insights into the poor convergence of MGRIT for advection-dominated PDEs when using the standard approach of rediscretizing the fine-grid problem on the coarse grid. Specifically, we show that this poor convergence arises, at least in part, from inadequate coarse-grid correction of certain smooth Fourier modes known as characteristic components, which was previously identified as causing poor convergence of classical spatial multigrid on steady-state advection-dominated PDEs. We apply this convergence theory to show that, for certain semi-Lagrangian discretizations of advection problems, MGRIT convergence using rediscretized coarse-grid operators cannot be robust with respect to CFL number or coarsening factor. A consequence of this analysis is that techniques developed for improving convergence in the spatial multigrid context can be re-purposed in the MGRIT context to develop more robust parallel-in-time solvers. This strategy has been used in recent work to great effect; here, we provide further theoretical evidence supporting the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

Abstract: We propose some finite element schemes to solve a class of fourth-order nonlinear PDEs, which include the vector-valued Landau--Lifshitz--Baryakhtar equation, the Swift--Hohenberg equation, and various Cahn--Hilliard-type equations with source and convection terms, among others. The proposed numerical methods include a spatially semi-discrete scheme and two linearised fully-discrete $C^1$-conforming schemes utilising a semi-implicit Euler method and a semi-implicit BDF method. We show that these numerical schemes are stable in $\mathbb{H}^2$. Error analysis is performed which shows optimal convergence rates in each scheme. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the boundedness of the \( H^\infty \)-calculus for the negative discrete Laplace operator, subject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The negative discrete Laplace operator is implemented using the finite element method, and we establish that its \(H^\infty\)-calculus is uniformly bounded with respect to the spatial mesh size. Using this finding, we derive a discrete stochastic maximal \(L^p\)-regularity estimate for a spatial semidiscretization. Furthermore, we provide a nearly optimal pathwise uniform convergence estimate for this spatial semidiscretization under a wide range of spatial \(L^q\)-norms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spectral Element Method for the Euler Equations on Unbounded Domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mitigating the impact of waves leaving a numerical domain has been a persistent challenge in numerical modeling. Reducing wave reflection at the domain boundary is crucial for accurate simulations. Absorbing layers, while common, often incur significant computational costs. This paper introduces an efficient application of a Legendre-Laguerre basis for absorbing layers for two-dimensional non-linear compressible Euler equations. The method couples a spectral-element bounded domain with a semi-infinite region, employing a tensor product of Lagrange and scaled Laguerre basis functions. Semi-infinite elements are used in the absorbing layer with Rayleigh damping. In comparison to existing methods with similar absorbing layer extensions, this approach, a pioneering application to the Euler equations of compressible and stratified flows, demonstrates substantial computational savings. The study marks the first application of semi-infinite elements to mitigate wave reflection in the solution of the Euler equations, particularly in nonhydrostatic atmospheric modeling. A comprehensive set of tests demonstrates the method's versatility for general systems of conservation laws, with a focus on its effectiveness in damping vertically propagating mountain gravity waves, a benchmark for atmospheric models. Across all tests, the model presented in this paper consistently exhibits notable performance improvements compared to a traditional Rayleigh damping approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a multilevel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for the Bayesian inference of random field parameters in PDEs using high-resolution data. Compared to existing multilevel MCMC methods, we additionally consider level-dependent data resolution and introduce a suitable likelihood scaling to enable consistent cross-level comparisons. We theoretically show that this approach attains the same convergence rates as when using level-independent treatment of data, but at significantly reduced computational cost. The convergence analysis focuses on Lipschitz continuous transformations of Gaussian random fields with Mat\'ern covariance structure. These results are illustrated using numerical experiments for a 2D plane stress problem, where the Young's modulus is estimated from discretisations of the displacement field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze schemes based on a general Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) time discretization for the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics, showing that they are asymptotic-preserving (AP) in the low Mach number limit. The analysis is carried out for a general equation of state (EOS). We consider both a single asymptotic length scale and two length scales. We then show that, when coupling these time discretizations with a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) space discretization with appropriate fluxes, a numerical method effective for a wide range of Mach numbers is obtained. A number of benchmarks for ideal gases and their non-trivial extension to non-ideal EOS validate the performed analysis.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel way to study numerical methods for ordinary differential equations in one dimension via the notion of multi-indice. The main idea is to replace rooted trees in Butcher's B-series by multi-indices. The latter were introduced recently in the context of describing solutions of singular stochastic partial differential equations. The combinatorial shift away from rooted trees allows for a compressed description of numerical schemes. Furthermore, such multi-indices B-series uniquely characterize the Taylor expansion of one-dimensional local and affine equivariant maps.</description>

      <title>Sixth-order parabolic equation on an interval: Eigenfunction expansion, Green's function, and intermediate asymptotics for a finite thin film with elastic resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A linear sixth-order partial differential equation (PDE) of ``parabolic'' type describes the dynamics of thin liquid films beneath surfaces with elastic bending resistance when deflections from the equilibrium film height are small. On a finite domain, the associated sixth-order eigenvalue problem is self-adjoint for the boundary conditions corresponding to a thin film in a closed trough, and the eigenfunctions form a complete orthonormal set. Using these eigenfunctions, we derive the Green's function for the governing sixth-order PDE on a finite interval and compare it to the known infinite-line solution. Further, we propose a Galerkin spectral method based on the constructed sixth-order eigenfunctions and their derivative expansions. The system of ordinary differential equations for the time-dependent expansion coefficients is solved by standard numerical methods. The numerical approach is applied to versions of the governing PDE with a second-order spatial derivative (in addition to the sixth-order one), which arises from gravity acting on the film. In the absence of gravity, we demonstrate the self-similar intermediate asymptotics of initially localized disturbances on the film surface, at least until the disturbances ``feel'' the finite boundaries, and show that the derived Green's function is an attractor for such solutions. In the presence of gravity, we use the proposed Galerkin numerical method to demonstrate that self-similar behavior persists, albeit for shortened intervals of time, even for large values of the gravity-to-bending ratio.\\[1mm]</description>

      <title>An iterative method for the solution of Laplace-like equations in high and very high space dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00682v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the equation $-\Delta u+\mu u=f$ on high-dimensional spaces $\mathbb{R}^m$, where the right-hand side $f(x)=F(Tx)$ is composed of a separable function $F$ with an integrable Fourier transform on a space of a dimension $n&gt;m$ and a linear mapping given by a matrix $T$ of full rank and $\mu\geq 0$ is a constant. For example, the right-hand side can explicitly depend on differences $x_i-x_j$ of components of $x$. We show that the solution of this equation can be expanded into sums of functions of the same structure and develop in this framework an equally simple and fast iterative method for its computation. The method is based on the observation that in almost all cases and for large problem classes the expression $\|T^ty\|^2$ deviates on the unit sphere $\|y\|=1$ the less from its mean value the higher the dimension $m$ is, a concentration of measure effect. The higher the dimension $m$, the faster the iteration converges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the multivariate integration problem for periodic functions from the weighted Korobov space in the randomized setting. We introduce a new randomized rank-1 lattice rule with a randomly chosen number of points, which avoids the need for component-by-component construction in the search for good generating vectors while still achieving nearly the optimal rate of the randomized error. Our idea is to exploit the fact that at least half of the possible generating vectors yield nearly the optimal rate of the worst-case error in the deterministic setting. By randomly choosing generating vectors $r$ times and comparing their corresponding worst-case errors, one can find one generating vector with a desired worst-case error bound with a very high probability, and the (small) failure probability can be controlled by increasing $r$ logarithmically as a function of the number of points. Numerical experiments are conducted to support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>On solution of tropical discrete best approximation problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16337v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a discrete best approximation problem formulated in the framework of tropical algebra, which deals with the theory and applications of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. Given a set of samples of input and output of an unknown function, the problem is to construct a generalized tropical Puiseux polynomial that best approximates the function in the sense of a tropical distance function. The construction of an approximate polynomial involves the evaluation of both unknown coefficient and exponent of each monomial in the polynomial. To solve the approximation problem, we first reduce the problem to an equation in unknown vector of coefficients, which is given by a matrix with entries parameterized by unknown exponents. We derive a best approximate solution of the equation, which yields both vector of coefficients and approximation error parameterized by the exponents. Optimal values of exponents are found by minimization of the approximation error, which is transformed into minimization of a function of exponents over all partitions of a finite set. We solve this minimization problem in terms of max-plus algebra (where addition is defined as maximum and multiplication as arithmetic addition) by using a computational procedure based on the agglomerative clustering technique. This solution is extended to the minimization problem of finding optimal exponents in the polynomial in terms of max-algebra (where addition is defined as maximum). The results obtained are applied to develop new solutions for conventional problems of discrete best Chebyshev approximation of real functions by piecewise linear functions and piecewise Puiseux polynomials. We discuss computational complexity of the proposed solution and estimate upper bounds on the computational time. We demonstrate examples of approximation problems solved in terms of max-plus and max-algebra.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a local discontinuous Galerkin scheme for fractional Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18069v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method for the fractional Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, involving the fractional Laplacian with exponent $\alpha \in (1,2)$ in one and multiple space dimensions. By decomposing the fractional Laplacian into first-order derivatives and a fractional integral, we prove the $L^2$-stability of the semi-discrete LDG scheme incorporating suitable interface and boundary fluxes. We derive the optimal error estimate for linear flux and demonstrate an error estimate with an order of convergence $\mathcal{O}(h^{k+\frac{1}{2}})$ for general nonlinear flux utilizing the Gauss-Radau projections. Moreover, we extend the stability and error analysis to the multiple space dimensional case. Additionally, we discretize time using the Crank-Nicolson method to devise a fully discrete stable LDG scheme, and obtain a similar order error estimate as in the semi-discrete scheme. Numerical illustrations are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the scheme, confirming an optimal order of convergence.</description>

      <title>Stability of fully Discrete Local Discontinuous Galerkin method for the generalized Benjamin-Ono equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08360v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to design a fully discrete local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) scheme for the generalized Benjamin-Ono equation. First, we analyze the stability for the semi-discrete LDG scheme and we prove that the scheme is $L^2$-stable for general nonlinear flux. We develop a fully discrete LDG scheme using the Crank-Nicolson (CN) method and fourth-order fourth-stage Runge-Kutta (RK) method in time. Adapting the methodology established for the semi-discrete scheme, we demonstrate the stability of the fully discrete CN-LDG scheme for general nonlinear flux. Additionally, we consider the fourth-order RK-LDG scheme for higher order convergence in time and prove that it is strongly stable under an appropriate time step constraint by establishing a \emph{three-step strong stability} estimate for linear flux. Numerical examples are provided to validate the efficiency and optimal order of accuracy for both the methods.</description>

      <title>A Coupled Diffusion Approximation for Spatiotemporal Hemodynamic Response and Deoxygenated Blood Volume Fraction in Microcirculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background and Objective: This proof of concept study investigates mathematical modelling of blood flow and oxygen transport in cerebral microcirculation, focusing on understanding hemodynamic responses. By coupling oxygen transport models and blood flow dynamics, the research aims to predict spatiotemporal hemodynamic responses and their impact on blood oxygenation levels, particularly in the context of deoxygenated and total blood volume (DBV and TBV) fractions. Methods: A coupled spatiotemporal model is developed using Fick's law for diffusion, combined with the hemodynamic response function derived from a damped wave equation. The diffusion coefficient in Fick's law is based on Hagen-Poiseuille flow, and arterial blood flow is approximated numerically through pressure-Poisson equation (PPE). The equations are then numerically solved with the finite element method (FEM). Numerical experiments are performed on a high-resolution 7-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) dataset for head segmentation, which facilitates the differentiation of arterial blood vessels and various brain tissue compartments. Results: The applicability of the model is further demonstrated through numerical experiments utilizing a 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset for head segmentation, which facilitates the differentiation of arterial blood vessels and various brain tissue compartments. By simulating hemodynamical responses and analyzing their impact on volumetric DBV and TBV, this study offers valuable insights into spatiotemporal modelling of brain tissue and blood flow. Conclusions: This study utilizes spatiotemporal modelling with high-resolution 7 Tesla-MRI head data to explore cerebral blood flow, oxygen transport, and brain dynamics. It enhances understanding of cardiovascular conditions, improves simulation accuracy, and offers potential clinical applications for targeted interventions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove convergence of piecewise polynomial collocation methods applied to periodic boundary value problems for functional differential equations with state-dependent delays. The state dependence of the delays leads to nonlinearities that are not locally Lipschitz continuous preventing the direct application of general abstract discretization theoretic frameworks. We employ a weaker form of differentiability, which we call mild differentiability, to prove that a locally unique solution of the functional differential equation is approximated by the solution of the discretized problem with the expected order.</description>

      <title>Fast Sound Error Bounds for Mixed-Precision Real Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating real-valued expressions to high precision is a key building block in computational mathematics, physics, and numerics. A typical implementation uses a uniform precision for each operation, and doubles that precision until the real result can be bounded to some sufficiently narrow interval. However, this is wasteful: usually only a few operations really need to be performed at high precision, and the bulk of the expression could use much lower precision. Uniform precision can also waste iterations discovering the necessary precision and then still overestimate by up to a factor of two. We propose to instead use mixed-precision interval arithmetic to evaluate real-valued expressions. A key challenge is deriving the mixed-precision assignment both soundly and quickly. To do so, we introduce a sound variation of error Taylor series and condition numbers, specialized to interval arithmetic, that can be evaluated with minimal overhead thanks to an "exponent trick". Our implementation, Reval, achieves an average speed-up of 1.47x compared to the state-of-the-art Sollya tool, with the speed-up increasing to 4.92x on the most difficult input points. An examination of the precisions used with and without precision tuning shows that the speed-up results come from quickly assigning lower precisions for the majority of operations.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Lanczos Method for Matrix Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.07788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ubiquitous Lanczos method can approximate $f(A)x$ for any symmetric $n \times n$ matrix $A$, vector $x$, and function $f$. In exact arithmetic, the method's error after $k$ iterations is bounded by the error of the best degree-$k$ polynomial uniformly approximating $f(x)$ on the range $[\lambda_{min}(A), \lambda_{max}(A)]$. However, despite decades of work, it has been unclear if this powerful guarantee holds in finite precision.
  We resolve this problem, proving that when $\max_{x \in [\lambda_{min}, \lambda_{max}]}|f(x)| \le C$, Lanczos essentially matches the exact arithmetic guarantee if computations use roughly $\log(nC\|A\|)$ bits of precision. Our proof extends work of Druskin and Knizhnerman [DK91], leveraging the stability of the classic Chebyshev recurrence to bound the stability of any polynomial approximating $f(x)$.
  We also study the special case of $f(A) = A^{-1}$, where stronger guarantees hold. In exact arithmetic Lanczos performs as well as the best polynomial approximating $1/x$ at each of $A$'s eigenvalues, rather than on the full eigenvalue range. In seminal work, Greenbaum gives an approach to extending this bound to finite precision: she proves that finite precision Lanczos and the related CG method match any polynomial approximating $1/x$ in a tiny range around each eigenvalue [Gre89].
  For $A^{-1}$, this bound appears stronger than ours. However, we exhibit matrices with condition number $\kappa$ where exact arithmetic Lanczos converges in $polylog(\kappa)$ iterations, but Greenbaum's bound predicts $\Omega(\kappa^{1/5})$ iterations. It thus cannot offer significant improvement over the $O(\kappa^{1/2})$ bound achievable via our result. Our analysis raises the question of if convergence in less than $poly(\kappa)$ iterations can be expected in finite precision, even for matrices with clustered, skewed, or otherwise favorable eigenvalue distributions.</description>

      <title>Multicellular simulations with shape and volume constraints using optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many living and physical systems such as cell aggregates, tissues or bacterial colonies behave as unconventional systems of particles that are strongly constrained by volume exclusion and shape interactions. Understanding how these constraints lead to macroscopic self-organized structures is a fundamental question in e.g. developmental biology. To this end, various types of computational models have been developed. Here, we introduce a new framework based on optimal transport theory to model particle systems with arbitrary dynamical shapes and deformability properties. Our method builds upon the pioneering work of Brenier on incompressible fluids and its recent applications to materials science. It lets us specify the shapes and volumes of individual cells and supports a wide range of interaction mechanisms, while automatically taking care of the volume exclusion constraint at an affordable numerical cost. We showcase the versatility of this approach by reproducing several classical systems in computational biology.

      <title>Localized Schr\"odinger Bridge Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from an unknown distribution for which only a sufficiently large number of training samples are available. In this paper, we build on previous work combining Schr\"odinger bridges and plug &amp; play Langevin samplers. A key bottleneck of these approaches is the exponential dependence of the required training samples on the dimension, $d$, of the ambient state space. We propose a localization strategy which exploits conditional independence of conditional expectation values. Localization thus replaces a single high-dimensional Schr\"odinger bridge problem by $d$ low-dimensional Schr\"odinger bridge problems over the available training samples. In this context, a connection to multi-head self attention transformer architectures is established. As for the original Schr\"odinger bridge sampling approach, the localized sampler is stable and geometric ergodic. The sampler also naturally extends to conditional sampling and to Bayesian inference. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme through experiments on a high-dimensional Gaussian problem, on a temporal stochastic process, and on a stochastic subgrid-scale parametrization conditional sampling problem. We also extend the idea of localization to plug &amp; play Langevin samplers using kernel-based denoising in combination with Tweedie's formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Sketch 'n Solve, an open-source Python package that implements efficient randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA) techniques for solving large-scale least squares problems. While sketch-and-solve algorithms have demonstrated theoretical promise, their practical adoption has been limited by the lack of robust, user-friendly implementations. Our package addresses this gap by providing an optimized implementation built on NumPy and SciPy, featuring both dense and sparse sketching operators with a clean API. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that our implementation achieves up to 50x speedup over traditional LSQR while maintaining high accuracy, even for ill-conditioned matrices. The package shows particular promise for applications in machine learning optimization, signal processing, and scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Crack opening calculation in phase-field modeling of fluid-filled fracture: A robust and efficient strain-based method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase-field method has become popular for the numerical modeling of fluid-filled fractures, thanks to its ability to represent complex fracture geometry without algorithms. However, the algorithm-free representation of fracture geometry poses a significant challenge in calculating the crack opening (aperture) of phase-field fracture, which governs the fracture permeability and hence the overall hydromechanical behavior. Although several approaches have been devised to compute the crack opening of phase-field fracture, they require a sophisticated algorithm for post-processing the phase-field values or an additional parameter sensitive to the element size and alignment. Here, we develop a novel method for calculating the crack opening of fluid-filled phase-field fracture, which enables one to obtain the crack opening without additional algorithms or parameters. We transform the displacement-jump-based kinematics of a fracture into a continuous strain-based version, insert it into a force balance equation on the fracture, and apply the phase-field approximation. Through this procedure, we obtain a simple equation for the crack opening which can be calculated with quantities at individual material points. We verify the proposed method with analytical and numerical solutions obtained based on discrete representations of fractures, demonstrating its capability to calculate the crack opening regardless of the element size or alignment.</description>

      <title>On the longest increasing subsequence and number of cycles of butterfly permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One method to generate random permutations involves using Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP) on a random matrix $A$ and storing the permutation matrix factor $P$ from the resulting GEPP factorization $PA=LU$. We are interested in exploring properties of random butterfly permutations, which are generated using GEPP on specific random butterfly matrices. Our paper highlights new connections among random matrix theory, numerical linear algebra, group actions of rooted trees, and random permutations. We address the questions of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and number of cycles for particular uniform butterfly permutations, with full distributional descriptions and limit theorems for simple butterfly permutations. We also establish scaling limit results and limit theorems for nonsimple butterfly permutations, which include certain $p$-Sylow subgroups of the symmetric group of $N=p^n$ elements for prime $p$. For the LIS, we establish power law bounds on the expected LIS of the form $N^{\alpha_p}$ and $N^{\beta_p}$ where $\frac12 &lt; \alpha_p &lt; \beta_p &lt; 1$ for each $p$ with $\alpha_p = 1 - o_p(1)$, showing distinction from the typical $O(N^{1/2})$ expected LIS frequently encountered in the study of random permutations (e.g., uniform permutations). For the number of cycles scaled by $(2-1/p)^n$, we establish a full CLT to a new limiting distribution depending on $p$ with positive support we introduce that is uniquely determined by its positive moments that satisfy explicit recursive formulas; this thus determines a CLT for the number of cycles for any uniform $p$-Sylow subgroup of $S_{p^n}$.</description>

      <title>A preconditioned second-order convex splitting algorithm with a difference of varying convex functions and line search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a preconditioned convex splitting algorithm enhanced with line search techniques for nonconvex optimization problems. The algorithm utilizes second-order backward differentiation formulas (BDF) for the implicit and linear components and the Adams-Bashforth scheme for the nonlinear and explicit parts of the gradient flow in variational functions. The proposed algorithm, resembling a generalized difference-of-convex-function approach, involves a changing set of convex functions in each iteration. It integrates the Armijo line search strategy to improve performance. The study also discusses classical preconditioners such as symmetric Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, and Richardson within this context. The global convergence of the algorithm is established through the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz properties, ensuring convergence within a finite number of preconditioned iterations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed second-order convex splitting with line search over conventional difference-of-convex-function algorithms.</description>
