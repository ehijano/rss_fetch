      <title>Network Contagion in Financial Labor Markets: Predicting Turnover in Hong Kong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employee turnover is a critical challenge in financial markets, yet little is known about the role of professional networks in shaping career moves. Using the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) public register (2007-2024), we construct temporal networks of 121,883 professionals and 4,979 firms to analyze and predict employee departures. We introduce a graph-based feature propagation framework that captures peer influence and organizational stability. Our analysis shows a contagion effect: professionals are 23% more likely to leave when over 30% of their peers depart within six months. Embedding these network signals into machine learning models improves turnover prediction by 30% over baselines. These results highlight the predictive power of temporal network effects in workforce dynamics, and demonstrate how network-based analytics can inform regulatory monitoring, talent management, and systemic risk assessment.</description>

      <title>A New Dataset and Benchmark for Grounding Multimodal Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of online misinformation videos poses serious societal risks. Current datasets and detection methods primarily target binary classification or single-modality localization based on post-processed data, lacking the interpretability needed to counter persuasive misinformation. In this paper, we introduce the task of Grounding Multimodal Misinformation (GroundMM), which verifies multimodal content and localizes misleading segments across modalities. We present the first real-world dataset for this task, GroundLie360, featuring a taxonomy of misinformation types, fine-grained annotations across text, speech, and visuals, and validation with Snopes evidence and annotator reasoning. We also propose a VLM-based, QA-driven baseline, FakeMark, using single- and cross-modal cues for effective detection and grounding. Our experiments highlight the challenges of this task and lay a foundation for explainable multimodal misinformation detection.</description>

      <title>The Game is the Game: Dynamic network analysis and shifting roles in criminal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: This paper incorporates time as a crucial variable to identify key players in criminal networks and explores how actors' positions change over time. It then assesses the accuracy of the results against the uncertainty around network data collected from criminal justice records.
  Methods: Network data are from a judicial document for a two-year investigation targeting a drug trafficking and distribution network. We use Katz centrality in its dynamic version to explore changes in relationships and relative importance of network actors. We then use a novel method of introducing new edges to the network using Bernoulli random trials to simulate missing data and assess the extent to which node rankings based on Katz centrality change or remain the same when introducing some level of uncertainty to our observed network.
  Results: We identify actors who consistently held a central role over the course of the two-year investigation and differentiate them from actors who provided key contributions to the group's activities, but only for a limited period. We show that compared to centrality measures commonly used in criminal network analysis, dynamic Katz centrality is helpful to differentiate individual contributions even among central nodes and explore individual trajectories over time, even when data are incomplete.
  Conclusions: This paper demonstrates the value of key player identification using temporal network data and offers an additional analytical tool to both organised crime scholars trying to capture the complex nature of criminal collaboration and law enforcement agencies aiming at identifying appropriate targets and disrupting criminal groups.</description>

      <title>Signals in the Noise: Decoding Unexpected Engagement Patterns on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms offer users multiple ways to engage with content--likes, retweets, and comments--creating a complex signaling system within the attention economy. While previous research has examined factors driving overall engagement, less is known about why certain tweets receive unexpectedly high levels of one type of engagement relative to others. Drawing on Signaling Theory and Attention Economy Theory, we investigate these unexpected engagement patterns on Twitter (now known as "X"), developing an "unexpectedness quotient" to quantify deviations from predicted engagement levels. Our analysis of over 600,000 tweets reveals distinct patterns in how content characteristics influence unexpected engagement. News, politics, and business tweets receive more retweets and comments than expected, suggesting users prioritize sharing and discussing informational content. In contrast, games and sports-related topics garner unexpected likes and comments, indicating higher emotional investment in these domains. The relationship between content attributes and engagement types follows clear patterns: subjective tweets attract more likes while objective tweets receive more retweets, and longer, complex tweets with URLs unexpectedly receive more retweets. These findings demonstrate how users employ different engagement types as signals of varying strength based on content characteristics, and how certain content types more effectively compete for attention in the social media ecosystem. Our results offer valuable insights for content creators optimizing engagement strategies, platform designers facilitating meaningful interactions, and researchers studying online social behavior.</description>

      <title>A Cycle Walk for Sampling Measures on Spanning Forests for Redistricting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new Markov Chain called the Cycle Walk for sampling measures of graph partitions where the partition elements have roughly equal size. Such Markov Chains are of current interest in the generation and evaluation of political districts. We present numerical evidence that this chain can efficiently sample target distributions that have been difficult for existing sampling Markov chains.</description>

      <title>Echo Chambers and Information Brokers on Truth Social: A Study of Network Dynamics and Political Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the structural dynamics of Truth Social, a politically aligned social media platform, during two major political events: the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade and the FBI's search of Mar-a-Lago. Using a large-scale dataset of user interactions based on re-truths (platform-native reposts), we analyze how the network evolves in relation to fragmentation, polarization, and user influence. Our findings reveal a segmented and ideologically homogenous structure dominated by a small number of central figures. Political events prompt temporary consolidation around shared narratives, followed by rapid returns to fragmented, echo-chambered clusters. Centrality metrics highlight the disproportionate role of key influencers, particularly @realDonaldTrump, in shaping visibility and directing discourse. These results contribute to research on alternative platforms, political communication, and online network behavior, demonstrating how infrastructure and community dynamics together reinforce ideological boundaries and limit cross-cutting engagement.</description>

      <title>Optimization of geometric hypergraph embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of embedding the nodes of a hypergraph into Euclidean space under the assumption that the interactions arose through closeness to unknown hyperedge centres. In this way, we tackle the inverse problem associated with the generation of geometric random hypergraphs. We propose two new spectral algorithms; both of these exploit the connection between hypergraphs and bipartite graphs. The assumption of an underlying geometric structure allows us to define a concrete measure of success that can be used to optimize the embedding via gradient descent. Synthetic tests show that this approach accurately reveals geometric structure that is planted in the data, and tests on real hypergraphs show that the approach is also useful for the downstream tasks of detecting spurious or missing data and node clustering.</description>

      <title>Extended Version: Security and Privacy Perceptions of Pakistani Facebook Matrimony Group Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Pakistan, where dating apps are subject to censorship, Facebook matrimony groups -- also referred to as marriage groups -- serve as alternative virtual spaces for members to search for potential life partners. To participate in these groups, members often share sensitive personal information such as photos, addresses, and phone numbers, which exposes them to risks such as fraud, blackmail, and identity theft. To better protect users of Facebook matrimony groups, we need to understand aspects related to user safety, such as how users perceive risks, what influences their trust in sharing personal information, and how they navigate security and privacy concerns when seeking potential partners online. In this study, through 23 semi-structured interviews, we explore how Pakistani users of Facebook matrimony groups perceive and navigate risks of sharing personal information, and how cultural norms and expectations influence their behavior in these groups.
  We find elevated privacy concerns among participants, leading them to share limited personal information and creating mistrust among potential partners. Many also expressed concerns about the authenticity of profiles and major security risks, such as identity theft, harassment, and social judgment. Our work highlights the challenges of safely navigating Facebook matrimony groups in Pakistan and offers recommendations for such as implementing stronger identity verification by group admins, enforcing stricter cybersecurity laws, clear platform guidelines to ensure accountability, and technical feature enhancements -- including restricting screenshots, picture downloads, and implementing anonymous chats -- to protect user data and build trust.</description>

      <title>Scaling Truth: The Confidence Paradox in AI Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of misinformation underscores the need for scalable and reliable fact-checking solutions. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise in automating fact verification, yet their effectiveness across global contexts remains uncertain. We systematically evaluate nine established LLMs across multiple categories (open/closed-source, multiple sizes, diverse architectures, reasoning-based) using 5,000 claims previously assessed by 174 professional fact-checking organizations across 47 languages. Our methodology tests model generalizability on claims postdating training cutoffs and four prompting strategies mirroring both citizen and professional fact-checker interactions, with over 240,000 human annotations as ground truth. Findings reveal a concerning pattern resembling the Dunning-Kruger effect: smaller, accessible models show high confidence despite lower accuracy, while larger models demonstrate higher accuracy but lower confidence. This risks systemic bias in information verification, as resource-constrained organizations typically use smaller models. Performance gaps are most pronounced for non-English languages and claims originating from the Global South, threatening to widen existing information inequalities. These results establish a multilingual benchmark for future research and provide an evidence base for policy aimed at ensuring equitable access to trustworthy, AI-assisted fact-checking.</description>

      <title>Whose Name Comes Up? Auditing LLM-Based Scholar Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b, llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender, ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist, replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance), under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars. Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly recommendations.</description>
