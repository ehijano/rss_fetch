      <title>A new graph-directed construction of nonlocal energies on the unit interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytic construction of nonlocal energies on the unit interval. The energies are defined using a new graph-directed construction of discrete energies on dyadic approximations of the interval. When the discrete jump kernels are comparable to the kernel of the fractional discrete Laplacian, we prove that the discrete energies Mosco converge and the limiting energy is equivalent to the fractional Gagliardo seminorm.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions describing very slow layer oscillations in a shadow reaction-diffusion system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show in a rigorous way that a stable internal single-layer stationary solution is destabilized by the Hopf bifurcation as the time constant exceeds a certain critical value. Moreover, the exact critical value and the exact period of oscillatory solutions can be obtained. The exact period indicates that the oscillation is very slow, i.e., the period is of order $O(e^{C/\varepsilon})$. We also rigorously prove that Hopf bifurcations from multi-layer stationary solutions occur. In this case anti-phase horizontal oscillations of layers are shown by formal calculations. Numerical experiments show that the exact period agrees with the numerical period of a nearly periodic solution near the Hopf bifurcation point. Anti-phase (out of phase) horizontal oscillations of layers are numerically observed.</description>

      <title>Sharp well-posedness and ill-posedness of the stationary quasi-geostrophic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stationary problem for the quasi-geostrophic equation on the whole plane and investigate its well-posedness and ill-posedness. In[Fujii, Ann. PDE 10, 10 (2024)], it was shown that the two-dimensional stationary Navier--Stokes equations are ill-posed in the critical Besov spaces $\dot B_{p,1}^{\frac{2}{p}-1}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with $1 \leq p \leq 2$. Although the quasi-geostrophic equation has the same invariant scale structure as the Navier--Stokes equations, we reveal that the quasi-geostrophic equation is well-posed in the scaling critical Besov spaces $\dot B_{p,q}^{\frac{2}{p}-1}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with $(p,q) \in [1,4) \times [1,\infty]$ or $(p,q)=(4,2)$ due to the better properties of the nonlinear structure of the quasi-geostrophic equation compared to that of the Navier--Stokes equations. Moreover, we also prove the optimality for the above range of $(p,q)$ ensuring the well-posedness in the sense that the stationary quasi-geostrophic equation is ill-posed for all the other cases.</description>

      <title>Stationary solutions to the critical and super-critical quasi-geostrophic equation in the scaling critical Sobolev space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stationary problem for the quasi-geostrophic equation with the critical and super-critical dissipation and prove the unique existence of small solutions for given small external force in the scaling critical Sobolev spaces framework. Moreover, we also show that the data-to-solution map is continuous. Since the critical and super-critical case involves the derivative loss, which affects the class of the continuity of the data-to-solution map, we reveal that the map is no longer uniform continuous, in contrast to the sub-critical case, where the Lipschitz continuity holds.</description>

      <title>On stability of one-dimensional Hughes' dynamics with affine costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate stability issues for the one-dimensional variant of the celebrated Hughes model for pedestrian evacuation. The cost function is assumed to be affine, which is a setting where existence of solutions with BV loc in space regularity, away from the so-called turning curve, was recently established. We provide a uniqueness result for solutions having the special property that agents never cross the turning curve (which implies that they are BV globally). In the same setting, continuous dependence of solutions on the cost parameter is highlighted. On the other hand, numerical simulations using the manyparticle approximation of the model, with more general initial conditions that allow the support of the solutions to intersect the turning curve, demonstrate the strong sensitivity of the evacuation time to the same cost parameter; this instability arises from interactions between agents and the turning curve.</description>

      <title>Artefact Analysis of Multistatic Three-Dimensional SAR Imaging with Two Linear Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, radar technology has seen much improvement, making multistatic Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensing a realistic possibility, for example in satellite constellations or unmanned aircraft systems. With such systems, there then comes the requirement to investigate useful multistatic SAR geometries. We provide a microlocal analysis of a multistatic data acquisition geometry for three-dimensional SAR imaging, where the transmitter and receiver move independently along two straight lines covering a region of interest (ROI). Using microlocal techniques, we show how the data acquisition geometry influences whether artefacts are likely to be present in the resultant image and how they can be avoided. Our main contribution is to provide a time-gating condition on the data which ensures that artefacts are not present in the ROI. As an independent verification, we provide several numerical simulations which follow a time-independent formulation.</description>

      <title>Front propagation into unstable states for periodic monotone reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the invasion fronts of spatially periodic monotone reaction-diffusion systems in a multi-dimensional setting. We study the pulsating traveling waves that connect the trivial equilibrium, for which all components of the state variable are identically equal to zero, to a uniformly persistent stationary state, for which all components are uniformly positive. When the trivial equilibrium is linearly unstable, we show that all pulsating traveling waves have a speed that is greater than the speed of the linearized system at the equilibrium, in any given direction. If moreover the nonlinearity is sublinear, then we can construct a pulsating traveling wave that travels at any super-linear speed in any given direction (i.e. the minimal speed is linearly determined). We also show that pulsating traveling waves are monotonic in time as soon as the nonlinearity is sub-homogeneous. Beyond these general qualitative properties, the main focus of the paper is to derive sufficient conditions for the existence and nonexistence of pulsating waves propagating in any given direction. Our proof of the existence part relies upon a new level of understanding of the multi-dimensional pulsating waves observed from a direction-dependent coordinate system.</description>

      <title>Energy-variational structure in evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider different measure-valued solvability concepts from the literature and show that they could be simplified by using the energy-variational structure of the underlying system of partial differential equations. In the considered examples, we prove that a certain class of improved measure-valued solutions can be equivalently expressed as an energy-variational solution. The first concept represents the solution as a high-dimensional Young measure, whether for the second concept, only a scalar auxiliary variable is introduced and the formulation is relaxed to an energy-variational inequality. We investigate four examples: the two-phase Navier--Stokes equations, a quasilinear wave equation, a system stemming from polyconvex elasticity, and the Ericksen--Leslie equations equipped with the Oseen--Frank energy. The wide range of examples suggests that this is a recurrent feature in evolution equations in general.</description>

      <title>Travelling breather solutions in waveguides for cubic nonlinear Maxwell equations with retarded material laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Maxwell's equations with nonlinear polarization we prove the existence of time-periodic breather solutions travelling along slab or cylindrical waveguides. The solutions are TE-modes which are localized in space directions orthogonal to the direction of propagation. We assume a magnetically inactive and electrically nonlinear material law with a linear $\chi^{(1)}$- and a cubic $\chi^{(3)}$-contribution to the polarization. The $\chi^{(1)}$-contribution may be retarded in time or instantaneous whereas the $\chi^{(3)}$-contribution is always assumed to be retarded in time. We consider two different cubic nonlinearities which provide a variational structure under suitable assumptions on the retardation kernels. By choosing a sufficiently small propagation speed along the waveguide the second order formulation of the Maxwell system becomes essentially elliptic for the $\mathbf{E}$-field so that solutions can be constructed by the mountain pass theorem. The compactness issues arising in the variational method are overcome by either the cylindrical geometry itself or by extra assumptions on the linear and nonlinear parts of the polarization in case of the slab geometry. Our approach to breather solutions in the presence of time-retardation is systematic in the sense that we look for general conditions on the Fourier-coefficients in time of the retardation kernels. Our main existence result is complemented by concrete examples of coefficient functions and retardation kernels.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a coupled nonlocal PDE-ODE system with spatial memory: well-posedness, stability, and bifurcation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal aggregation-diffusion models, when coupled with a spatial map, can capture cognitive and memory-based influences on animal movement and population-level patterns. In this work, we study a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion-aggregation system in which a population's spatiotemporal dynamics are tightly linked to a separate, dynamically updating map. Depending on the local population density, the map amplifies and suppresses certain landscape regions and contributes to directed movement through a nonlocal spatial kernel. After establishing the well-posedness of the coupled PDE-ODE system, we perform a linear stability analysis to identify critical aggregation strengths. We then perform a rigorous bifurcation analysis to determine the precise solution behavior at a steady state near these critical thresholds, deciding whether the bifurcation is sub- or supercritical and the stability of the emergent branch. Based on our analytical findings, we highlight several interesting biological consequences. First, we observe that whether the spatial map functions as attractive or repulsive depends precisely on the map's relative excitation rate versus adaptory rate: when the excitatory effect is larger (smaller) than the adaptatory effect, the map is attractive (repulsive). Second, in the absence of growth dynamics, populations can only form a single aggregate. Therefore, the presence of intraspecific competition is necessary to drive multi-peaked aggregations, reflecting higher-frequency spatial patterns. Finally, we show how subcritical bifurcations can trigger abrupt shifts in average population abundance, suggesting a tipping-point phenomenon in which moderate changes in movement parameters can cause a sudden population decline.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the Navier-Stokes equations for small initial data in frequency localized Koch-Tataru's space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct global smooth solutions to the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for initial data in $L^2$ satisfying some smallness condition. The high-frequency part is assumed to be small in $BMO^{-1}$, while the low-frequency part is assumed to be small only in $\dot B^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}$. Since $BMO^{-1}$ is strictly embedded in $\dot B^{-1}_{\infty,\infty}$, our assumption is weaker than that of Koch and Tataru (2001), which we also demonstrate with an example of finite energy divergence-free initial data. Also, our solutions attain the initial data in the strong $L^2$ sense, and hence satisfy the energy balance for all time.</description>

      <title>Analysis and numerical analysis of the Helmholtz-Korteweg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Helmholtz--Korteweg and nematic Helmholtz--Korteweg equations, variants of the classical Helmholtz equation for time-harmonic wave propagation for Korteweg and nematic Korteweg fluids. Korteweg fluids are ones where the stress tensor depends on density gradients; nematic Korteweg fluids further depend on a nematic director describing the orientation of the (anisotropic) molecules. We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions to these equations for suitable (nonresonant) wave numbers and propose convergent discretizations for their numerical solution. The discretization of these equations is nontrivial as they demand high regularity and involve unfamiliar boundary conditions; we address these challenges by using high-order conforming finite elements, and enforcing the boundary conditions with Nitsche's method. We illustrate our analysis with numerical simulations in two dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if we start from a symmetric lower semi-bounded Schr\"odinger operator $\mathcal{H}$ on finitely supported functions on a discrete weighted graph (satisfying certain conditions), apply the Friedrichs construction to get a self-adjoint extension $H$, and then perturb $H$ by a non-negative function $W$, then the resulting form-sum $H\widetilde{+}W$ coincides with the Friedrichs extension of $\mathcal{H}+W$. Additionally, we consider a non-negative perturbation of an essentially self-adjoint lower semi-bounded Schr\"odinger operator $H$ on a discrete weighted graph. We show that, under certain conditions on the graph and the perturbation, the essential self-adjointness of $H$ remains stable under the given perturbation.</description>

Abstract: Under suitable assumptions on $\beta:\mathbb{R}\!\to\!\mathbb{R}, \,D:\mathbb{R}^d\!\to\!\mathbb{R}^d$ and $b:\mathbb{R}^d\!\to\!\mathbb{R}$, the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation $u_t-\Delta\beta(u)+{\rm div}(Db(u)u)=0$, in $(0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^d$ where $D=-\nabla\Phi$, can be identified as a smooth gradient flow $\frac{d^+}{dt}\,u(t)+\nabla E_{u(t)}=0$, $\forall t&gt;0$. Here, $E:\mathcal{P}^*\cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)\to\mathbb{R}$ is the energy function associated to the equation, where $\mathcal{P}^*$ is a certain convex subset of the space of probability densities. $\mathcal{P}^*$ is invariant under the flow and $\nabla E_u$ is the gradient of $E$, that is, the tangent vector field to $\mathcal{P}$ at $u$ defined by $\left&lt;\nabla E_u,z_u\right&gt;_u={\rm diff}\,E_u\cdot z_u$ for all vector fields $z_u$ on $\mathcal{P}^*$, where $\left&lt;\cdot,\cdot\right&gt;_u$ is a scalar product on a suitable tangent space $\mathcal{T}_u(\mathcal{P}^*)\subset\mathcal{D}'(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

Abstract: We develop a functional-analytical machinery for studying the quadratic regulator problem arising from spectra perturbations of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. In particular, we are interested in applications to inertial manifolds theory. For certain nonautonomous Hamiltonian systems associated with such problems, we show the existence and uniform nonoscillation of stable Lagrangian bundles. This is done within the context of the classical frequency condition for stationary problems, as well as for nonstationary problems arising under the conditions of the Spatial Averaging Principle of J. Mallet-Paret and G.R. Sell.</description>

      <title>Linear, decoupled and positivity-preserving staggered mesh schemes for general dissipative systems with arbitrary energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel staggered mesh (SM) approach for general nonlinear dissipative systems with arbitrary energy distributions (including cases with known or unknown energy lower bounds). Based on this framework, we propose several second-order semi-discrete schemes that maintain linearity, computational decoupling, and unconditional energy stability. Firstly, for dissipative systems with known energy lower bounds, we introduce a positive auxiliary variable $V(t)$ to substitute the total energy functional, subsequently discretizing it on staggered temporal meshes to ensure that the energy remains non-increasing regardless of the size of time step. The newly developed schemes achieve full computational decoupling, maintaining essentially the same computational expense as conventional implicit-explicit methods while demonstrating significantly improved accuracy. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the positivity preservation of the discrete variable $V^{n+1/2}$ which is a crucial property ensuring numerical stability and accuracy. Theoretical analysis confirms second-order temporal convergence for the proposed SM schemes. Secondly, for dissipative systems lacking well-defined energy lower bounds, we devise an alternative auxiliary variable formulation and extend the SM framework to maintain unconditional energy stability while preserving numerical effectiveness and accuracy. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments, including benchmark problem simulations, validate the proposed schemes' efficacy and demonstrate their superior performance characteristics.</description>

      <title>How close is too close for singular mean curvature flows?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $(M^i_t)_{t\in [0,T)}$, $i=1,2$, are two mean curvature flows in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ encountering a multiplicity one compact singularity at time $T$, in such a manner that for every $k$, the Hausdorff distance between the two flows, $d_H$, satisfies $d_{H}(M^1_t,M^2_t)/(T-t)^k \rightarrow 0$. We demonstrate that $M^1_t=M^2_t$ for every $t$. This generalizes a result of Martin-Hagemayer and Sesum, who proved the case where $M^1_t$ is itself a self-similarly shrinking flow.</description>

      <title>On strong convergence of an elliptic regularization with the Neumann boundary condition applied to a stationary advection equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a boundary value problem of a stationary advection equation with the homogeneous inflow boundary condition in a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary, and consider its perturbation by $\epsilon \Delta$, where $\epsilon$ is a positive parameter and $\Delta$ is the Laplacian. In this article, we show the $L^2$ strong convergence of solutions as the parameter $\epsilon$ tends to $0$, and discuss its convergence rates assuming $H^1$ or $H^2$ regularity for original solutions. A key observation is that the convergence rate depends on the regularity of original solutions and a relation between the boundary and the advection vector field. Some numerical computations support optimality of our convergence estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we establish a gradient bound and Liouville-type theorems for solutions to Quasi-linear elliptic equations on compact Riemannian Manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Also, we provide a local splitting theorem when the inequality in the gradient bound becomes equality at some point. Moreover, we prove a Harnack-type inequality and an ABP estimate for the gradient of solutions in domains contained in the manifold.</description>

      <title>Interior Schauder estimates for fractional elliptic equations in nondivergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain sharp interior Schauder estimates for solutions to nonlocal Poisson problems driven by fractional powers of nondivergence form elliptic operators $(-a^{ij}(x) \partial_{ij})^s$, for $0&lt;s&lt;1$, in bounded domains under minimal regularity assumptions on the coefficients $a^{ij}(x)$. Solutions to the fractional problem are characterized by a local degenerate/singular extension problem. We introduce a novel notion of viscosity solutions for the extension problem and implement Caffarelli's perturbation methodology in the corresponding degenerate/singular Monge--Amp\`ere geometry to prove Schauder estimates in the extension. This in turn implies interior Schauder estimates for solutions to the fractional nonlocal equation. Furthermore, we prove a new Hopf lemma, the interior Harnack inequality and H\"older regularity in the Monge--Amp\`ere geometry for viscosity solutions to the extension problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a broad class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations on Hermitian manifolds. On one hand, under the optimal structural assumptions we derive $C^{2,\alpha}$-estimate for solutions of the equations on closed Hermitian manifolds. On the other hand, we treat the Dirichlet problem. In both cases, we prove the existence theorems with unbounded condition.</description>

      <title>On a 3D Stokes eigenvalue problem under Navier slip-with-friction boundary conditions and applications to Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider, by means of a precise spectral analysis, the 3D Navier-Stokes equations endowed with Navier slip-with-friction boundary conditions. We study the problem in a very simple geometric situation as the region between two parallel planes, with periodicity along the two planes. This setting, which is often used in the theory of boundary layers, requires some special treatment for what concerns the functional setting and allows us to characterize in a rather explicit manner eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the associated Stokes problem. These, will be then used in order to identify infinite dimensional classes of data leading to global strong solutions for the corresponding evolution Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Weighted Poincar\'e inequality and Hardy improvements related to some degenerate elliptic differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the sharp constant and maximizing functions for weighted Poincar\'e inequalities. These results lead to refinements of Hardy's inequality obtained by adding remainder terms involving \(L^p\) norms. We use techniques that avoid symmetric rearrangement argument, simplifying the analysis of these inequalities in both Euclidean and non-Euclidean contexts. Specifically, this method applies to a variety of settings, such as the Heisenberg group, various Carnot groups and operators expressed as sums of squares of vector fields. Significant examples include the Heisenberg-Greiner operator and the Baouendi-Grushin operator.</description>

      <title>On multidimensional nonlocal conservation laws with BV kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish local-in-time existence and uniqueness results for nonlocal conservation laws in several space dimensions under weak (that is, Sobolev or BV) differentiability assumptions on the convolution kernel. In contrast to the case of a smooth kernel, in general the solution experiences finite-time blow-up. We provide an explicit example showing that solutions corresponding to different smooth approximations of the convolution kernel in general converge to different measures after the blow-up time. This rules out a fairly natural strategy for extending the notion of solution of the nonlocal conservation law after the blow-up time.</description>

      <title>Growth of Sobolev norms for completely resonant quantum harmonic oscillators on $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider time dependently perturbed quantum harmonic oscillators in $\mathbb{R}^2$: $$ {\rm i} \partial_t u=\frac12(-\partial_{x_1}^2-\partial_{x_2}^2 + x_1^2+x_2^2)u +V(t, x, D)u, \qquad \ x \in \mathbb{R}^2, $$ where $V(t, x, D)$ is a selfadjoint pseudodifferential operator of degree zero, $2\pi$ periodic in time. We identify sufficient conditions on the principal symbol of the potential $V(t, x, D)$ that ensure existence of solutions exhibiting unbounded growth in time of their positive Sobolev norms and we show that the class of symbols satisfying such conditions is generic in the Fr\'echet space of classical $2\pi$- time periodic symbols of order zero. To prove our result we apply the abstract Theorem of arXiv:2101.09055v1 : the main difficulty is to find a conjugate operator $A$ for the resonant average of $V(t,x, D)$. We construct explicitly the symbol of the conjugate operator $A$, called escape function, combining techniques from microlocal analysis, dynamical systems and contact topology.</description>

      <title>On some Sobolev and P\'olya-Szeg\"o type inequalities with weights and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are motivated by studying a boundary-value problem for a class of semilinear degenerate elliptic equations
  \begin{align}\tag{P}\label{P}
  \begin{cases}
  - \Delta_x u - |x|^{2\alpha} \dfrac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = f(x,y,u), &amp; \textrm{in } \Omega,
  u = 0, &amp; \textrm{on } \partial \Omega,
  \end{cases}
  \end{align}
  where $x = (x_1, x_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2$, $\Omega$ is a bounded smooth domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$, $(0,0,0) \in \Omega $, and $\alpha &gt; 0$.
  In this paper, we will study this problem by establishing embedding theorems for weighted Sobolev spaces. To this end, we need a new P\'olya-Szeg\"o type inequality, which can be obtained by studying an isoperimetric problem for the corresponding weighted area. Our results then extend the existing ones in \cite{nga, Luyen2} to the three-dimensional context.</description>

      <title>Linear Instability of the Prandtl Equations via Hypergeometric Functions and the Harmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a deep connection between the Prandtl equations linearised around a quadratic shear flow, confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind, and the Schr\"odinger operator. Our first result concerns an ODE and a spectral condition derived in [10], associated with unstable quasi-eigenmodes of the Prandtl equations. We entirely determine the space of solutions in terms of Kummer's functions. By classifying their asymptotic behaviour, we verify that the spectral condition has a unique, explicitly determined pair of eigenvalue and eigenfunction, the latter being expressible as a combination of elementary functions. Secondly, we prove that any quasi-eigenmode solution of the linearised Prandtl equations around a quadratic shear flow can be explicitly determined from algebraic eigenfunctions of the Schr\"odinger operator with quadratic potential. We show finally that the obtained analytical formulation of the velocity align with previous numerical simulations in the literature.</description>

      <title>A normalized Ricci flow on surfaces with boundary towards the complete hyperbolic metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\overline{M},g_0)$ be a $2$-D compact surface with boundary $\partial M$ and its interior $M$. We show that for a large class of initial and boundary data, the initial-boundary value problem of the normalized Ricci flow $(1.10)-(1.12)$, with prescribed geodesic curvature $\psi$ on $\partial M$, has a unique solution for all $t&gt;0$, and it converges to the complete hyperbolic metric locally uniformly in $M$. Here the natural condition that $\psi&gt;0$ causes the main difficulty in the a priori estimates in the corresponding initial-boundary problem $(1.15)-(1.17)$ of the parabolic equations, for which an auxiliary Cauchy-Dirichlet problem is introduced. We also provide examples of the boundary data $\psi$ which fits well with the natural asymptotic behavior of the geodesic curvature, but the solution to $(1.10)-(1.12)$ fails to converge to the complete hyperbolic metric.</description>
