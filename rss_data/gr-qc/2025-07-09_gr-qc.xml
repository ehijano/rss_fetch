      <title>On the stability of de Sitter inflationary solution in the Starobinsky-Bel-Robinson gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will present the way to derive a de Sitter inflationary solution within the so-called Starobinsky-Bel-Robinson gravity. Then, we will show by using the dynamical system method whether the obtained solution is stable or not. According to the stability of the de Sitter inflationary solution, we could judge which phase of our universe, among the two early and late-time phases, is more appropriate for this solution.</description>

      <title>Canonical Electrodynamics in Ashtekar-Barbero variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the full Hamiltonian analysis of electrodynamics, including fermions, photons, and their interaction, on a general curved spacetime in Ashtekar-Barbero variables. No gauge fixing is performed and the theory is background independent. The details of the constraints of the theory for both Weyl and Dirac fermions are presented. Moreover, the equations of motion are derived and it is shown that they reduce to the equations of motion of the standard QFT in curved or flat spacetime in the appropriate limits. Finally, the behavior of the theory under parity transformation is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Kilohertz Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Full Spectrum Analyses and High-density Constraints on Neutron Star Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate Bayesian analyses of the complete gravitational-wave spectrum of binary neutron star mergers events with the next-generation detector Einstein Telescope. Our mock analyses are performed for 20 different signals using the TEOBResumSPA_NRPMw waveform that models gravitational-waves from the inspiral to the postmerger phase. They are employed to validate a pipeline for neutron star's extreme matter constraints with prospective detections and under minimal hypotheses on the equation of state. The proposed analysis stack delivers inferences for the mass-radius curve, the mass dependence of the quadrupolar tidal polarizability parameter, the neutron star's maximum density, the maximum mass and the relative radius, and the pressure-density relation itself. We show that a single event at a signal-to-noise ratio close to the minimum threshold for postmerger detection is sufficient to tightly constrain all the above relations as well as quantities like the maximum mass (maximum density) to precision of ${\sim}6$% (${\sim}10$%) at 90% credibility level. We also revisit inferences of prompt black hole formation with full spectrum signals and find that the latter can be robustly identified, even when the postmerger is not detectable due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. New results on the impact of the initial signal frequency and of the detector configuration (triangular vs. two-L) on the source's parameters estimation are also reported. An improvement of approximately one order of magnitude in the precision of the chirp mass and mass ratio can be achieved by lowering the initial frequency from 20 Hz to 2 Hz. The two-L configuration shows instead significant improvements on the inference of the source declination, due to geographical separation of the two detectors.</description>

      <title>A flexible, GPU-accelerated approach for the joint characterization of LISA instrumental noise and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LISA data analysis represents one of the most challenging tasks ahead for the future of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. Characterizing the instrument's noise properties while fitting for all the other detectable sources is a key requirement of any robust inference pipeline. Noise estimation will also play a crucial role in searches and parameter estimation of cosmological and astrophysical stochastic signals. Previous studies have tackled this topic by assuming perfect knowledge of the spectral shape of the instrumental noise and of different possible types of GW Stochastic Backgrounds (SGWBs), usually resorting to parametrized templates. Recently, various works that employ template-agnostic methods have been presented. In this work, we take an additional step further, introducing flexible spectral shapes in both the instrumental noise and the stochastic signals. We account for the lack of knowledge of the exact shape of the individual contributions to the overall power spectral density by using splines to represent arbitrary perturbations of the noise and signal spectral densities. We implement a data-driven Reversible Jump MCMC algorithm to fit different components simultaneously and to infer the level of flexibility required under different scenarios. We test this approach on simulated LISA data produced under different assumptions. We investigate the impact of this increased flexibility on the reconstruction of both the injected signal and the noise level, and we discuss the prospects for claiming a successful SGWB detection.</description>

      <title>A Breathing Universe is Consistent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a toy FRW universe with the exotic topology $S^1 \times S^3$. We show that for a specific choice of quantum field content, the semi-classical Friedman equations are consistent with temporal periodicity as required by the $S^1$ timelike factor. A straightforward consequence is that entropy reversals occur during each cycle, consistent with Hawking's proposed connection between the thermodynamic and cosmological arrows of time.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics in curved spacetime: Gravitationally-induced constitutive equations and the spacetime index of refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies on spacetime index of refraction are mostly restricted to the static spacetimes. In this study we fill this gap by introducing the refractive index for full stationary spacetimes, employing three different approaches. These include applying Fermat's principle, employing the classical definition of refractive index, and using gravitationally-induced constitutive equations. These calculations are carried out in both threading and slicing spacetime decomposition formalisms, and their equivalence is stablished. We discuss possible applications of the spacetime index of refraction, specially in the study of light trajectories and their characteristics in stationary spacetimes. More specifically we show that there is a gravitational analog of a toroidal moment, and discuss possible gravitational analog of nonreciprocal refraction in materials with a toroidal domain wall.</description>

      <title>A proposal for the role of higher spin fields in Conformal Cyclic Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a research program into how the special properties of the cubic chiral higher spin gravity theory may play a role in conformal cyclic cosmology and black hole physics, in particular for the black hole information paradox. The paper is qualitative, raising a number of questions and connections, that may be interesting to pursue in more detail. The proposal is based on a new -- at least not so commonly expressed -- view on the presumptive role of higher spin gauge fields in fundamental physics. In short, it is proposed that the non-unitary time evolution of the cubic chiral higher spin gravity theory is precisely what is needed for bridging the very large entropy gap between aeons in Roger Penrose's cosmological theory CCC.</description>

      <title>On the third law of black hole mechanics for supersymmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it has been shown that the third law of black hole mechanics can be violated: an exactly extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole can form in finite time in gravitational collapse of matter with a large charge to mass ratio. However, it has also been proved that this cannot happen if the matter satisfies a ``supersymmetric'' lower bound on its energy in terms of its charge. This paper proves an analogous result for black holes with a negative cosmological constant. The result states that a supersymmetric Kerr-Newman-anti de Sitter black hole cannot form in gravitational collapse of charged matter satisfying the supersymmetric bound. The results for zero or negative cosmological constant are extended to apply to two-sided black holes: it is proved that an initially non-extremal black hole cannot evolve to a supersymmetric black hole in finite time, irrespective of whether or not the initial black hole was formed in gravitational collapse.</description>

      <title>Post-adiabatic waveforms from extreme mass ratio inspirals in the presence of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a solar mass compact object is whirling around a supermassive black hole, act as precise tracers of the spacetime geometry and astrophysical environment around the supermassive black hole. These systems are highly sensitive to even the smallest deviations from the vacuum general relativity scenario. However, detecting these signals requires highly accurate waveform modeling up to the first post-adiabatic order, incorporating self-force effects, system parameters, and environmental influences. In this paper, we focus on the impact of dark matter on gravitational waveforms. Cold dark matter in galactic centers can be redistributed by the gravitational pull of a supermassive black hole, forming a dense, spike-like profile. When an EMRI evolves in such an environment, the interaction between the binary and the surrounding dark matter can leave distinctive imprints on the emitted waveform, and thus offer a novel way to probe the nature and distribution of dark matter. We specifically examine how dark matter modifies the background spacetime. By treating these modifications perturbatively, we present a framework to incorporate dark matter environmental effects into gravitational waveform modeling at the first post-adiabatic order.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological behavior associated to a U(N)-symmetry reduced sector of the loop-quantum-gravity truncation known as the two-vertex model is further explored in this work. We construct convenient frame bases that encode the whole classical phase space of the twisted geometry associated to the graph. We show that the polyhedra of the twisted geometry suffer under evolution an homothetic expansion, which strengthens the correspondence to the Robertson-Walker geometry.</description>

      <title>Early Warning From Eccentric Compact Binaries: Template Initialization And Sub-dominant Mode Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early warning of gravitational waves (GWs) is essential for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star merger events. In this study, we investigate early warning prospects from eccentric compact binaries, whose mergers are expected to comprise a significant fraction of detected GW events in the future. Eccentric binaries exhibit oscillatory frequency evolution, causing GW frequencies to recur multiple times through their coalescence. Consequently, generating eccentric waveform templates for early warning requires specification of initial conditions. While the standard approach involves initiating waveform generation when the orbit-averaged frequency enters the detector band, we compare this with an alternative approach that uses the periastron frequency as the starting point. Our analysis shows that initializing at the periastron frequency yields an improved signal-to-noise ratio and sky localization. Additionally, including subdominant modes alongside the dominant $(2,2)$ mode leads to further improvements in sky localization. We explore the parameter space of primary mass $m_1 \in [1.4, 15] \, M_\odot$, spin $\chi_1 \in [0, 0.8]$, and eccentricity $e \leq 0.4$ across three detector configurations: O5, Voyager, and 3G. We find that in the O5 (Voyager) configuration, including eccentricity and subdominant modes, the sky localization area can be reduced by $2-80\% (2-85\%)$ at 1000 sq. deg. with increasing eccentricity from $e_5 = 0.1$ to $e_5 = 0.4$, yielding up to $41$ seconds (1 minute) of extra early warning time. For NSBH systems, subdominant modes contribute up to $70$ $(94)\%$ reduction for O5 (Voyager) scenario. In the 3G detector scenario, the sky area reduction due to eccentricity reaches $80\%$ (from $e_{2.5} = 0.1$ to $e_{2.5} = 0.4$) at 100 sq. deg., and subdominant modes enhance the reduction up to $98\%$ for NSBH systems.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Dark Energy with Bright Standard Sirens from Future Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature and evolution of dark energy (DE) is a central challenge in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the constraining power of bright standard sirens -- gravitational wave (GW) events with electromagnetic counterparts - for probing the DE equation of state as function of redshift. Focusing on future GW observations from next-generation ground-based GW detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, we perform a comprehensive analysis using simulated binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) events over five years of observation with a $75\%$ duty cycle. We consider three broad classes of DE models: (i) phenomenological parametrizations, specifically the Barboza-Alcaniz extension to the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model; (ii) physically motivated scalar field scenarios, specifically hilltop quintessence; and (iii) evolving dark matter setup in which the matter density evolves as $(1+z)^{3+\alpha}$. For each case, we jointly infer the Hubble constant $H_0$ and model-specific DE parameters from the observed GW luminosity distances and spectroscopic redshifts. Our results demonstrate that bright sirens alone can yield competitive and independent constraints on the time evolution of DE indicating that multi-messenger cosmology has the potential to test a wide range of DE theories, bridging phenomenological and physically motivated models, and paving the way for precision cosmology in the era of GW astronomy.</description>

Abstract: We prove a splitting theorem for globally hyperbolic, weighted spacetimes with metrics and weights of regularity $C^1$ by combining elliptic techniques for the negative homogeneity $p$-d'Alembert operator from our recent work in the smooth setting with the concept of line-adapted curves introduced here. Our results extend the Lorentzian splitting theorem proved for smooth globally hyperbolic spacetimes by Galloway -- and variants of its weighted counterparts by Case and Woolgar--Wylie -- to this low regularity setting.</description>

      <title>Measuring cosmic baryon density with FRB and GW data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measure (DM) analysis of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) has accounted for all cosmic baryons but remains limited by systematic uncertainties from various parameter degeneracies. We show that the prominent degeneracy between the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$) and the Hubble constant ($H_0$) can be disentangled through an independent $H_0$ value uniquely inferred from the absolute luminosity distance measurements of gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens. By combining $104$ localized FRBs with $47$ GW events, we obtain a robust, late-Universe measurement of \ob $=0.0488\pm0.0064$ ($1\sigma$), in concordance with early-Universe observations of CMB + BBN. Notably, incorporating GW data helps not only avoid biases induced by the $H_0$ tension, but also mitigate those from the parameters of diffuse baryon fraction and DM distribution models. Although the current precision ($\sim 13\%$) is limited by sample size, the growing detections of both FRBs and GWs will make their synergy a powerful probe of low-redshift cosmology.</description>

      <title>Constraints on cosmological gravitational waves from CMB and BAO in light of dynamical dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive upper limits on the physical energy-density fraction today of cosmological gravitational waves, denoted by $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}$, by combining \emph{Planck} \&amp; ACT \&amp; SPT CMB data with DESI BAO data. In the standard cosmological model, we establish 95\% CL upper limits of $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ for adiabatic initial conditions and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.7 \times 10^{-7}$ for homogeneous initial conditions. In light of dynamical dark energy, we get $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 7.2 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous). We also project the sensitivity achievable with LiteBIRD \&amp; CMB Stage-IV measurements of CMB and CSST observations of BAO, forecasting 68\% CL uncertainties of $\sigma = 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\sigma = 0.9 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous) for ${\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}}$. The constraints provide critical benchmarks for exploring the cosmological origins of gravitational waves within the frequency band $f \gtrsim 10^{-15}$\,Hz and potentially enable joint analysis with direct gravitational-wave detection sensitive to this regime.</description>

      <title>Classical double copy in the black hole mini-superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09374v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a novel formulation of classical double copy in the mini-superspace of static, spherically symmetric black holes where the map between the solutions of general relativity and Maxwell's theory can be realized in Boyer-Lindsquit coordinates. By employing the reduced action principle, we show that the double copy structure can be generalized to Lovelock gravities and quasi-topological gravities. However, the gravitational solutions are mapped to the purely electric solutions of Maxwell's theory with a difference: instead of a direct match between the Kerr-Schild scalar in the gravity side and the scalar potential in the gauge theory side, the scalar potential becomes a polynomial in the Kerr-Schild scalar, giving rise to a generalization of the Kerr-Schild double copy. We calculate the Regge-Teitelboim surface charges and prove that the mass of the black hole solution is identified with the electric charge corresponding to the Coulomb part of the gauge theory solution in the same way it does in the case of general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the exact values of the quasinormal frequencies for massless perturbations with spin $s\leq2$ moving in pure accelerating spacetime. We use two different methods to transfer the perturbation equations into the form of hypergeometric differential equations and obtain the same quasinormal frequencies. These purely imaginary spectra are shown to be independent of the spin of the perturbation and match those of the so-called acceleration modes of accelerating black holes after taking the Minkowski limit. This implies that the acceleration modes actually originate from the pure accelerating spacetime and the appearance of black holes would deform the spectra. In addition, we calculate the quasinormal frequencies of scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of $D$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime and compare them with previous results to verify the validity of our method.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave signatures of non-violent non-locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement of gravitational waves can provide precision tests of the nature of black holes and compact objects. In this work, we test Giddings' non-violent non-locality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range -- up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from non-violent non-locality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in non-violent non-locality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third-generation network.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic dynamics of eccentric black-hole binaries in post-Newtonian theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eccentric black-hole binaries are among the most awaited sources of gravitational waves, yet their dynamics lack a consistent framework that provides a detailed and physically robust evolutionary description due to gauge issues. We present a new set of non-orbit-averaged equations, free from radiation-reaction gauge ambiguities, that accurately describe the evolution of orbital elements for eccentric, non-spinning black-hole binaries. We derive these equations by mapping the Keplerian orbital elements to a new set of characteristic parameters using energy and angular momentum definitions combined with near-identity transformations. The resulting framework is valid for arbitrary eccentricities, including parabolic and hyperbolic limits. Using this framework, we demonstrate the strictly observable effects of the non-adiabatic emission of gravitational waves -- characteristic of eccentric binaries -- on the orbital parameters. Furthermore, we assess the regime of validity of the widely used orbit-averaged equations first derived by Peters in 1964. Importantly, their breakdown becomes evident at the first pericenter passage, implying that the validity of the orbit-averaged approximation cannot be inferred solely from binary initial conditions. The formalism we introduce, accurate up to 2.5 post-Newtonian order, aims to provide a robust tool for making reliable astrophysical predictions and accurately interpreting current and future gravitational wave data, paving the way for deeper insights into the dynamics of eccentric black hole binaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars are compact, relativistic bodies that host several extremes of modern physics. An exciting development in recent years has been the opportunity to probe this exotic physics by observing compact-binary coalescences using sensitive gravitational-wave and electromagnetic instruments. To maximise the science inferred from these measurements, we require models that accurately represent the physics. In this study, we consider the post-Newtonian approximation to general relativity for the modelling of neutron-star dynamics, with a particular view to model dynamical tides at the late stages of binary inspiral. We develop the post-Newtonian perturbation equations for a non-rotating star and show that the perturbation problem is Hermitian and therefore derives from a fundamental Lagrangian. Establishing this Lagrangian system leads to a conserved symplectic product and canonical energy for the perturbations. We determine the orthogonality condition for the post-Newtonian oscillation modes, which in turn forms the foundation of a mode-sum representation often used for dynamical tides. Finally, we demonstrate that the perturbation formulation is unique.</description>

      <title>Non-commutativity in Hayward spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new black hole solution, namely, a Hayward-like metric incorporating corrections due to non-commutativity by taking into account $\partial_r\wedge\partial_\theta$ Moyal twist. We begin by deriving this solution using the non-commutative gauge theory framework. The general properties of the metric are then analyzed, including the event horizon structure and the Kretschmann scalar. Analogous to the standard Hayward solution, the modified black hole remains regular, provided that additional dependence on the angle $\theta$. Next, we examine the thermodynamic properties, computing the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. From the temperature profile, we verify that there is no physical remnant mass when $T^{(\Theta,l)} \to 0$, indicating a complete evaporation process. Quantum radiation is analyzed by considering both bosonic and fermionic particle modes, with an estimation of the particle creation density provided for each case. The effective potential is evaluated perturbatively to accomplish the analysis of quasinormal modes and the time-domain response for scalar perturbations. The study of null geodesics is explored to enable the characterization of the photon sphere and black hole shadows. Additionally, constraints on the shadows are estimated based on EHT (Event Horizon Telescope) data. Furthermore, the Gaussian curvature is determined to assess the stability of critical orbits, followed by an analysis of gravitational lensing using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Finally, the constraints (bounds) on the parameters $\Theta$ (non-commutativity) and $l$ (``Hayward parameter'') are derived based on solar system tests, including the perihelion precession of Mercury, light deflection, and the Shapiro time delay effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the extreme densities in neutron stars, a phase transition to deconfined quark matter is anticipated. Yet masses, radii and tidal deformabilities offer only indirect measures of a first-order phase transition, requiring many detections to resolve or being ineffective observables if the discontinuity exists at lower densities. We report on a smoking-gun gravitational-wave signature of a first-order transition: the resonant tidal excitation of an interface mode. Using relativistic perturbation theory with an equation-of-state family informed by chiral effective field theory, we show that such a resonance may be detectable with next-generation interferometers and possibly already with LIGO A+ for sufficiently loud events.</description>

      <title>Approximating neutron-star radii using gravitational-wave only measurements with symbolic regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron-star inspirals carry information on components' masses and tidal deformabilities, but not directly radii, which are measured by electromagnetic observations of neutron stars. To improve the multi-messenger astronomy studies of neutron stars, an expression for neutron-star radii as a function of gravitational-wave only data would be advantageous, as it would allow to compare information from two different channels. In order to do so, a symbolic regression method, pySR, is trained on TOV solutions to piecewise polytropic EOS input to discover an approximate symbolic expression for the neutron-star radius as a function of gravitational-wave measurements only. The approximation is tested on piecewise polytropic EOS NS data, as well as on NS sequences based on selected realistic (non-polytropic) dense-matter theory EOSs, achieving consistent agreement between the ground truth values and the symbolic approximation for a broad range of NS parameters covering current astrophysical observations, with average radii differences of few hundred meters. Additionally, the approximation is applied to the GW170817 gravitational-wave mass and tidal deformability posteriors, and compared to reported inferred radius distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regular and spherically symmetric black holes that solve the singularity problems of the Schwarzschild solution are phenomenologically viable at large distance but usually suffer from the Cauchy horizon instability. To overcome this drawback, we extended the analysis to include hyperbolic and toroidal horizon topologies within the framework of static, topologically maximally symmetric spacetimes. We show that both hyperbolic and toroidal black holes can be constructed without Cauchy horizons and without curvature singularities, thereby avoiding the mass inflation instability. These solutions exhibit asymptotic flatness in a generalized quasi-Minkowskian sense. The phenomenological aspects of these solutions are also studied by examining their thermodynamical properties, the photon sphere, and the effective potentials, ensuring consistency with observable properties such as black hole shadows. Lastly, we investigate a reconstruction technique within a scalar-tensor gravity framework, illustrating how the discussed metrics can arise from well-defined scalar field dynamics. Our investigation presents a viable pathway for constructing physically realistic, regular black holes in both General Relativity and modified gravity, broadening the landscape of singularity-free spacetimes and offering models that may better reflect the nature of strong gravitational fields in astrophysical and cosmological settings.</description>

      <title>Optical appearance of Schwarzschild black holes with optically thin and thick accretion disks at various inclination angles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the optical appearance of a Schwarzschild black hole illuminated by three geometrically thin accretion disk models under varying observational inclination angles. Based on the geometric relationship between the black hole and observer, we first divide the accretion disk into co-side and counter-side semi-disks. We then analyze light ray trajectories, and calculate the total number of orbits and transfer functions for both semi-disks. The results reveal distinct inclination-dependence of lensed regions on different semi-disks: as inclination increases, the lensed region contracts for the counter-side semi-disk while expanding for the co-side one. Furthermore, through explicit specification of the emission profiles of the three models, we present optical images for both optically thin and thick disk scenarios at different inclinations. The results demonstrate that: (i) the bright rings in all three models become progressively compressed and deviate from circularity as inclination increases; (ii) for thick disks, partial rings are obscured and the overall intensity is lower than thin disks. These results may advance our understanding of general black hole imaging processes and provide a new approach to test gravitational theories through optical morphology studies.</description>

Abstract: We study two-point functions of symmetric traceless local operators in the bulk of de Sitter spacetime. We derive the K\"all\'en-Lehmann spectral decomposition for any spin and show that unitarity implies its spectral densities are nonnegative. In addition, we recover the K\"all\'en-Lehmann decomposition in Minkowski space by taking the flat space limit. Using harmonic analysis and the Wick rotation to Euclidean Anti de Sitter, we derive an inversion formula to compute the spectral densities. Using the inversion formula, we relate the analytic structure of the spectral densities to the late-time boundary operator content. We apply our technical tools to study two-point functions of composite operators in free and weakly coupled theories. In the weakly coupled case, we show how the K\"all\'en-Lehmann decomposition is useful to find the anomalous dimensions of the late-time boundary operators. We also derive the K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation of two-point functions of spinning primary operators of a Conformal Field Theory on de Sitter.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Background and Source Clustering from Supermassive Binary Black Holes Based on Cosmological Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05043v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several pulsar timing array (PTA) groups have recently claimed the detection of nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB), but the origin of this gravitational wave (GW) signal remains unclear. Nanohertz GWs generated by supermassive binary black holes (SMBBHs) are one of the most important GW sources in the PTA band. Utilizing data from cosmological simulation, we generate multiple realizations of a mock observable universe that self-consistently incorporates the cosmic large-scale structure, enabling a robust statistical analysis of SMBBH populations and their GW signatures. We systematically investigate the merger event distributions and both the isotropic and anisotropic properties of the resulting GWB signals under different hardening timescales. Specifically, we calculate the characteristic amplitude of the GWB signal, and the angular power spectrum for both the total energy density and energy density in different frequency bins accounting for cosmic variance through different realizations. We also study the clustering pattern of the positional distribution of SMBBHs to examine whether they can reproduce the large-scale structure of galaxies. Furthermore, for the upcoming Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) and Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-PTA, we predict the numbers and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distributions of resolvable individual GW sources that may be detected with SNR$&gt;$8. We finally investigated the impact of weak lensing effects and found that their influence on the basic characteristics of the GWB signal and individual sources is rather limited.</description>

      <title>True and apparent motion of optomechanical resonators, with applications to feedback cooling of gravitational wave detector test masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern optomechanical systems employ increasingly sophisticated quantum-mechanical states of light to probe and manipulate mechanical motion. Squeezed states are now used routinely to enhance the sensitivity of gravitational-wave interferometers to small external forces, and they are also used in feedback-based trapping and damping experiments on the same interferometers to enhance the achievable cooling of fluctuations in the differential test mass mode (arXiv:2102.12665). In this latter context, an accurate accounting of the true test mass motion, incorporating all sources of loss, the effect of feedback control, and the influence of classical force and sensing noises, is paramount. We work within the two-photon formalism to provide such an accounting, which extends a previously described decomposition of the quantum-mechanical noise of the light field (arxiv:2105.12052). This decomposition provides insight, rooted in physically motivated parameters, into the optimal squeezed state and feedback control configuration that should be employed to achieve the lowest fluctuations. We apply this formalism to feedback damping experiments in current and possible future gravitational-wave interferometers -- LIGO A+, LIGO Voyager, Cosmic Explorer (CE), and CE Voyager -- and discuss how these multi-degree-of-freedom systems might be compared to a single degree-of-freedom oscillator. We find that, for the oscillator definition used most commonly in the literature so far, occupation numbers below 1 are possible in these interferometers over a frequency range comparable to the bandwidth of the trapped and cooled oscillator.

      <title>Cosmological Zoom-In Simulations of Milky Way Host Mass Dark Matter Halos with a Blue-Tilted Primordial Power Spectrum</title>

Abstract: Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed a surprisingly large number of galaxies at high redshift, challenging the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology with a power-law primordial power spectrum. Previous studies alleviated this tension with a blue tilted primordial power spectrum ($P(k)\propto k^{m_s}$ with $m_s&gt;1$ at small scales $&gt;1~{\rm cMpc}^{-1}$). In this study, we examine whether the blue tilted model can boost dark matter substructures especially at low redshift, thereby addressing other potential challenges to the standard cosmology. First, substructures in the standard cosmological model may not be sufficient to explain the anomalous flux ratio problem observed in strong gravitational lensing. Second, the number of observed nearby satellite galaxies could be higher than the theoretical predictions of the standard cosmology, after completeness correction and tidal stripping by baryonic disks. To study the impact of a blue tilted primordial power spectrum on substructures, we perform high-resolution cosmological zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of Milky Way host mass halos, evolving to redshift $z=0$. At $z=0$, we find that the blue-tilted subhalo mass functions can be enhanced by more than a factor of two for subhalo masses $M_{\rm sub} \lesssim 10^{10} ~M\odot$, whereas the subhalo $V_{\rm max}$ functions can be enhanced by a factor of four for maximum circular velocities $V_{\rm max}\lesssim 30 ~{\rm km/s}$. The blue-tilted scaled cumulative substructure fraction can be an order of magnitude higher at $\sim$10\% of the virial radius. The blue-tilted subhalos also have higher central densities, since the blue-tilted subhalos reach the same $V_{\rm max}$ at a smaller distance $R_{\rm max}$ from the center. We have also verified these findings with higher-resolution simulations.</description>

      <title>VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Option Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is intended to be the premier centimeter-wavelength facility for astronomy and astrophysics, building on the substantial scientific legacies of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). The ngVLA would open a new window on the Universe through ultra-sensitive imaging of thermal line and continuum emission to milliarcsecond resolution, while delivering unprecedented broad-band continuum imaging and polarimetry of non-thermal emission. The ngVLA would provide a critical electromagnetic complement to a suite of particle detectors and gravitational-wave observatories, as well as space- and ground-based telescopes operating from infrared to gamma-ray wavelengths, hence enabling multi-messenger and multi-band astronomy and astrophysics. Current construction plans call for the ngVLA to leverage some of the physical infrastructure of both the VLA and the VLBA, potentially drawing on overlapping personnel and information infrastructure. Multiple options can be envisioned for a VLA+VLBA to ngVLA transition. In order to assess risks and benefits of possible transition plans, the ngVLA project established the VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Advisory Group (TAG). The primary deliverable from the TAG is a ``VLA+VLBA to ngVLA Transition Option Concepts'' report (this report) that includes a prioritized list of transition options.</description>

      <title>Path to an exact WKB analysis of black hole quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate black hole quasinormal modes using the exact WKB method. We perform an analytic continuation from the horizon to infinity along the positive real axis of the radial coordinate and impose appropriate boundary conditions at these asymptotic positions. We clarify the role of previously overlooked logarithmic spirals of Stokes curves and branch cuts emerging from the horizon. We carefully reformulate the derivation of the quasinormal mode conditions using the exact WKB analysis, incorporating the contributions from these features into the calculation. We successfully derive correct results for both solvable model examples and the Schwarzschild spacetime. Our formulation enjoys straightforward extensions to other background geometries as well as a wide range of other physical systems.</description>

      <title>Dependence of postmerger properties on the thermal heating efficiency in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically perform numerical-relativity simulations for equal-mass binary neutron star mergers for the models varying the thermal index $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ with three different equations of state (EOSs) of the neutron stars (NSs), which are consistent with current multimessenger observational data and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, and two different binary total mass ($m_0=2.7\ \text{and}\ 2.9~M_\odot$). By varying the value of $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ within the hybrid EOS framework, we investigate the thermal effects on the merger dynamics, gravitational waves (GWs), and the dynamical mass ejection process. We find that the choice of the constant $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ can change the outcome of the remnant for specific EOSs and $m_0$. We also show that the dynamical ejecta mass is affected by the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ value in a different way for different EOSs: for a stiff EOS the ejecta mass is high when $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ is small, while for softer EOSs the largest ejecta is achieved when $\Gamma_{\rm th} = 1.3$--$1.4$. While the inspiral motion does not depend on the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ value, the postmerger phase evolution is highly affected by that. We show that the dominant peak frequency $f_2$ of the postmerger GW spectrum monotonically decreases as the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ increases. We find that the universal relations between NS macroscopic properties and postmerger GW frequencies are subject to non-negligible thermal uncertainties, which can obscure the universal relation between the tidal deformability and $f_2$.</description>
