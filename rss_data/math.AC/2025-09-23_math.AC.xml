      <title>Low-degree minimal generating sets of polynomial ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain tight bounds for the minimal number of generators of an ideal with bounded-degree generators in a polynomial ring $K[X_1,\dots,X_n],$ as well as a sharp quantification of the maximum possible size of a minimal generating set of bounded degree. Our bounds are sharp for all fields of size greater than the degree. Moreover, we provide explicit constructions reaching the tightness constraints for all fields of characteristic 0, and for all sufficiently large fields in the one- and two-variable case. Additionally, we fully solve the one-variable case, and conjecture the asymptotics in the multivariate case, for all finite fields.</description>

      <title>Quasihomogeneous isolated singularities in terms of syzygies and foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One considers quasihomogeneous isolated singularities of hypersurfaces in arbitrary dimensions through the lenses of three apparently quite apart themes: syzygies, singularity invariants, and foliations. In the first of these, one adds to the well-known result of Saito's a syzygy-theoretic characterization of a quasihomogeneous singularity affording an effective computational criterion. In the second theme, one explores the Milnor-Tjurina difference number from a commutative algebra viewpoint. Building on the Briancon-Skoda theorem and exponent, we extend previously known inequalities by Dimca and Greuel to arbitrary dimension and provide algebraic formulas involving the syzygy-theoretic part and reduction exponents. In the last theme one recovers and bring up to an algebraic light a result of Camacho and Movasati by establishing a couple of characterizations of quasihomogeneous isolated singularities in terms of the generators of the module of invariant vector fields.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article discusses a way for uniquely setting up the valuations for the minimal generators of the maximal ideal of a one dimensional complete reduced and irreducible local algebra over an algebraically closed field, when treated as a subring of its integral closure. Our observations are a generalization of the more well-studied case of a numerical semigroup ring. These results provide completion to some missing arguments in certain proofs present in the existing literature, including some results concerning a long-standing conjecture of R. Berger.</description>

      <title>Rees algebras of complementary edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the Rees algebras of squarefree monomial ideals $I \subset S=K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ generated in degree $n-2$, where $K$ is a field. Every such ideal arises as the complementary edge ideal $I_c(G)$ of a finite simple graph $G$. We describe the defining equations of the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(I_c(G))$ in terms of the combinatorics of $G$. When $G$ is a bipartite or a connected unicyclic graph, we show that $\mathcal{R}(I_c(G))$ is a normal Cohen-Macaulay domain. If $G$ is a tree or a unicyclic graph whose unique induced cycle has length $3$ or $4$, we further prove that $\mathcal{R}(I_c(G))$ is Koszul. We also determine the asymptotic depth of the powers of $I_c(G)$, proving that $\lim_{k \to \infty}\text{depth}\, S/I_c(G)^k=b(G)$, where $b(G)$ is the number of bipartite connected components of $G$. Finally, we show that the index of depth stability of $I_c(G)$ is at most $n-2$, and equality holds when $G$ is a path graph.</description>

      <title>Commutativity of operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We call an operator algebra A reversible if A with reversed multiplication is also an abstract operator algebra (in the modern operator space sense). This class of operator algebras is intimately related to the symmetric operator algebras: the subalgebras of B(H) on which the transpose map is a complete isometry. In previous work we studied the unital case, where reversibility is equivalent to commutativity. We give many sufficient conditions under which a nonunital reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative. We also give many complementary results of independent interest, and solve a few open questions from previous papers. Not every reversible or symmetric operator algebra is commutative, however we show that they all are 3-commutative. That is, order does not matter in the product of three or more elements from A. The proof of this relies on a rather technical analysis involving the injective envelope. Indeed nonunital algebras are often enormously more complicated than unital ones in regard to the topics we consider. On the positive side, our considerations raise very many questions even for low dimensional matrix algebras, some of which are of a computational nature and might be suitable for undergraduate research. The canonical anticommutation relation from mathematical physics plays a significant role.</description>

      <title>On depth of modules in an ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative Noetherian ring, $I$ an ideal of $R$ and $M$ a finitely generated $R$-module with $\dim_R(M)=d$. Denote by $\depth_R(I,M)$ the depth of $M$ in $I$. In \cite{HT}, C. Huneke and V. Trivedi proved that if $R$ is a quotient of a regular ring then there exists a finite subset $\Lambda_M $ of $\Spec(R)$ such that
  $$\depth_R(I,M)=\underset{\p\in \Lambda_M}{\min} \big\{ \depth_{R_{\p}}(M_{\p})+ \docao\big((I+\p)/\p\big) \big\}.$$
  Denote by $\Psupp^i_R(M)=\{\frak p\in\Spec(R)\mid H^{i-\dim(R/\frak p)}_{\frak p R_{\frak p}}(M_{\frak p})\neq 0\}$ the $i$-th pseudo support of $M$ defined by M. Brodmann and R. Y. Sharp \cite{BS1}. In this paper, we prove that if $\Psupp^i_R(M)$ is closed for all $i\leq d$ then the above formula of $\depth_R(I,M)$ holds true, where $\Lambda_M =\underset{0\leq i\leq d}{\bigcup} \min \Psupp^i_R(M)$. In particular, if $R$ is a quotient of a Cohen-Macaulay local ring then $\Lambda_M =\underset{0\leq i\leq d}{\bigcup}\min\Var\big(\Ann_R(H_{\m}^i(M))\big)$. We also give some examples to clarify the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ be a Noetherian local ring and $M$ a finitely generated $R$-module. We study the relations of the index of reducibility and the irreducible multiplicity of an $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideal of $R$ and these of $\mathfrak{m} \times M$-primary ideal of the idealization. This generalizes one of the main results of S.Goto et al. (see \cite[Theorem 2.2]{GKL}).</description>

      <title>Divisibility relation between the number of certain surjective group and ring homomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we identify the existence of a divisibility relationship between the number of ring homomorphisms and surjective group homomorphisms. We demonstrate that for finite cyclic structures, the number of ring homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a divisor of the number of surjective group homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Z}_m$ to $\mathbb{Z}_n$, where $n$ is not of the form $2 \cdot \alpha$, where each prime factor $p$ of $\alpha$ satisfies $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$. We further extend this result for finite abelian structures.</description>

      <title>The Serre depth of Stanley-Reisner rings and the depth of their symbolic powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an invariant, called the Serre depth, from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra. In this paper, we establish several properties of an analogue of the depth of Stanley-Reisner rings. In particular, we relate the Serre depth both to the minimal free resolution of a Stanley-Reisner ring and to that of its Alexander dual. Also, we establish an analogue of a known result that describes the depth of Stanley-Reisner rings in terms of skeletons. Moreover, we study the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ and the depth on the symbolic powers of Stanley--Reisner ideals. It had been an open question whether the depth of the symbolic powers of Stanley-Reisner ideals satisfies a non-increasing property, but Nguyen and Trung provided a negative answer. We construct an example that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ and the depth do not satisfy this property and its second symbolic power is Cohen-Macaulay. Moreover, we prove that the sequence of the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on the symbolic powers is convergent and that its limit coincides with the minimum value. Finally, we study the Serre depth on edge and cover ideals. Whether the depth on symbolic powers of edge ideals satisfies a non-increasing property has remained an open question. We address a related problem and show that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on edge ideals of any well-covered graph satisfies a non-increasing property. In addition, we prove that the Serre depth for $(S_{2})$ on the cover ideals of any graph also satisfies a non-increasing property. Moreover, we determine the Serre depth on edge ideals of very well-covered graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To, say, a proper algebraic or holomorphic space $X/S$, and a coherent sheaf ${\mathcal F}$ on $X$ we identify a functorial ideal, the fitted flatifier, blowing up sequentially in which leads to a flattening of the proper transform of ${\mathcal F}$. As such, this is a variant on theorems of Raynaud \&amp; Hironaka, but it's functorial nature allows its application to a flattening theorem for formal algebraic spaces or Artin champs, where we apply it to prove close to optimal algebraisation theorems for formal deformations. En passant, contrary to what is asserted in EGA-3 Remarque 5.4.6, we give an example of an adic Noetherian formal scheme whose nil radical is not coherent and establish the equivalence conjectured therein between arbitrary algebraisability and that of the reduction.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical filtrations of line bundles and optimal algebraic geometry codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce \emph{hierarchical depth}, a new invariant of line bundles and divisors, defined via maximal chains of effective sub-line bundles. This notion gives rise to \emph{hierarchical filtrations}, refining the structure of the Picard group and providing new insights into the geometry of algebraic surfaces. We establish fundamental properties of hierarchical depth, derive inequalities through intersection theory and the Hodge index theorem, and characterize filtrations that are Hodge-tight.
  Using this framework, we develop a theory of \emph{hierarchical algebraic geometry codes}, constructed from evaluation spaces along these filtrations. This approach produces nested families of codes with controlled growth of parameters and identifies an optimal intermediate code maximizing a utility function balancing rate and minimum distance. Hierarchical depth thus provides a systematic method to construct AG codes with favorable asymptotic behavior, linking geometric and coding-theoretic perspectives.
  Our results establish new connections between line bundle theory, surface geometry, and coding theory, and suggest applications to generalized Goppa codes and higher-dimensional evaluation codes.</description>
