      <title>Revisiting tea-leaf paradox with a deformable spoon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tea-leaf paradox refers to the migration of tea leaves toward the center of a tea cup when the water is put in rotation by a spoon. Although much attention has been given to liquid and particle transport generated by a spoon, the back-action of the generated flow on a deformable spoon has not been considered. In this work, we therefore propose to revisit the tea-leaf paradox with a deformable stirrer consisting of a floating ball attached to a soft string. The later is set in rotation and the ball trajectory results from the balance between string tension and the back action of the surrounding flow, leading to surprising effects. At low rotation speeds, we show that the circular trajectory of the ball shrinks when we stir faster, which contradicts common intuition based on inertia. For higher rotation rates, the ball is either suddenly attracted toward the center, or is repulsed away from it, depending on the string length. A model explaining these observations is proposed, and validated using experimental measurements of the generated flow. Interestingly, the system exhibits strong hysteretic behavior, leading to a modified version of the tea-leaf paradox in which the spoon itself can be trapped at the center in the flow generated by its past motion.</description>

      <title>Singular viscoelastic perturbation to soft lubrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft lubrication has been shown to drastically affect the mobility of an object immersed in a viscous fluid in the vicinity of a purely elastic wall. In this theoretical study, we develop a minimal model incorporating  viscoelasticity, carrying out a  perturbation analysis in both the elastic deformation of the wall and its viscous damping. Our approach reveals the singular-perturbation nature of viscoelasticity to soft lubrication. Numerical resolution of the resulting non-linear, singular and coupled equations of motion reveals  peculiar effects of viscoelasticity on confined colloidal mobility, opening the way towards the description of complex migration scenarios near realistic polymeric substrates and biological membranes.</description>

      <title>Progresses on some open problems related to infinitely many symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00208</link>

Abstract: The quest to reveal the physical essence of the infinitely many symmetries and conservation laws that are intrinsic to integrable systems has historically posed a significant challenge at the confluence of physics and mathematics. This scholarly investigation delves into five open problems related to these boundless symmetries within integrable systems by scrutinizing their multi-wave solutions, employing a fresh analytical methodology. For a specified integrable system, there exist various categories of $n$-wave solutions. Each sub-wave comprising the $n$-wave solution may possess free parameters, including center, width, and periodic parameters. It is evident that these solutions are translation invariant with respect to all these free parameters. We postulate that the entirety of the recognized infinite symmetries merely constitute linear combinations of these finite wave parameter translation symmetries. The conjecture intimates that the currently known infinitely many symmetries are not exhaustive, and an indeterminate number of symmetries remain to be discovered. This conjecture further indicates that by imposing an infinite array of symmetry constraints, it becomes feasible to derive exact multi-wave solutions. By considering the renowned KdV equation and the Burgers equation as simple examples, the conjecture is substantiated for the $n$-soliton solutions. It is unequivocal that any linear combination of the wave parameter translation symmetries retains its status as a symmetry associated with the particular solution. This observation suggests that by introducing a ren-variable and a ren-symmetric derivative which serve as generalizations of the Grassmann variable and the super derivative, it may be feasible to unify classical integrable systems, supersymmetric integrable systems, and ren-symmetric integrable systems within a cohesive hierarchical framework.</description>
