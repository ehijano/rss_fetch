      <title>ADAF: An Artificial Intelligence Data Assimilation Framework for Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forecasting skill of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models critically depends on the accurate initial conditions, also known as analysis, provided by data assimilation (DA). Traditional DA methods often face a trade-off between computational cost and accuracy due to complex linear algebra computations and the high dimensionality of the model, especially in nonlinear systems. Moreover, processing massive data in real-time requires substantial computational resources. To address this, we introduce an artificial intelligence-based data assimilation framework (ADAF) to generate high-quality kilometer-scale analysis. This study is the pioneering work using real-world observations from varied locations and multiple sources to verify the AI method's efficacy in DA, including sparse surface weather observations and satellite imagery. We implemented ADAF for four near-surface variables in the Contiguous United States (CONUS). The results indicate that ADAF surpasses the High Resolution Rapid Refresh Data Assimilation System (HRRRDAS) in accuracy by 16% to 33% for near-surface atmospheric conditions, aligning more closely with actual observations, and can effectively reconstruct extreme events, such as tropical cyclone wind fields. Sensitivity experiments reveal that ADAF can generate high-quality analysis even with low-accuracy backgrounds and extremely sparse surface observations. ADAF can assimilate massive observations within a three-hour window at low computational cost, taking about two seconds on an AMD MI200 graphics processing unit (GPU). ADAF has been shown to be efficient and effective in real-world DA, underscoring its potential role in operational weather forecasting.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Low-Cost Sensors to Monitor Indoor Air Quality in Mongolian Gers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air quality has important climate and health effects. There is a need, therefore, to monitor air quality both indoors and outdoors. Methods of measuring air quality should be cost-effective if they are to be used widely, and one such method is low-cost sensors (LCS). This study reports on the use of LCSs in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, to measure $\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ concentrations inside yurts or "gers." Some of these gers were part of a non-government agency (NGO) initiative to improve the insulating properties of these housing structures. The goal of the NGO was to decrease particulate emissions inside the gers; a secondary result was to lower the use of coal and other biomass material. LCSs were installed in gers heated primarily by coal, and interior air quality was measured. Gers that were modified by increasing their insulating capacities showed a 17.5% reduction in $\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ concentrations, but these concentrations remained higher than levels recommended by health organizations. Gers that were insulated and used a combination of both coal and electricity showed a 19.1% reduction in $\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ concentrations. Insulated gers that used electricity for both heating and cooking showed a 48% reduction in $\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$, though concentrations were still 6.4 times higher than those recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Nighttime and daytime trends followed similar patterns in $\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ concentrations with slight variations. It was found that, at nighttime, the outside $\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ concentrations were generally higher than the inside concentrations of the gers in this study. This suggests that $\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ would flow into the gers whenever the doors were opened, causing spikes in $\mathrm{PM_{2.5}}$ concentrations.</description>

      <title>Ensemble reliability and the signal-to-noise paradox in large-ensemble subseasonal forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have suggested the existence of a `signal-to-noise paradox' (SNP) in ensemble forecasts that manifests as situations where the correlation between the forecast ensemble mean and the observed truth is larger than the correlation between the forecast ensemble mean and individual forecast members. A perfectly reliable ensemble, in which forecast members and observations are drawn from the same underlying probability distribution, will not exhibit an SNP if sample statistics can be evaluated using a sufficiently large ensemble size ($N$) over a sufficiently large number of independent cases ($M$). However, when $M$ is finite, an apparent SNP will sometimes occur as a natural consequence of sampling uncertainty, even in a perfectly reliable ensemble with many members. In this study, we evaluate the forecast skill, reliability characteristics, and signal-to-noise properties of three large-scale atmospheric circulation indices in 100-member subseasonal reforecasts. Consistent with recent studies, this reforecast dataset exhibits an apparent SNP in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) at subseasonal lead times. However, based on several lines of evidence, we conclude that the apparent paradox in this dataset is a consequence of large observational sampling uncertainties that are insensitive to ensemble size and common to all model comparisons over the same period. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this apparent SNP can be eliminated by application of an unbiased reliability calibration. However, this is achieved through overfitting such that sample statistics from calibrated forecasts inherit the large sampling uncertainties present in the observations and thus exhibit unphysical variations with lead time. Finally, we make several recommendations for the robust and unbiased evaluation of reliability and signal-to-noise properties in the presence of large sampling uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Maximizing the Impact of Deep Learning on Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Climate Forecasting: The Essential Role of Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather and climate forecasting is vital for sectors such as agriculture and disaster management. Although numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems have advanced, forecasting at the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) scale, spanning 2 to 6 weeks, remains challenging due to the chaotic and sparse atmospheric signals at this interval. Even state-of-the-art deep learning models struggle to outperform simple climatology models in this domain. This paper identifies that optimization, instead of network structure, could be the root cause of this performance gap, and then we develop a novel multi-stage optimization strategy to close the gap. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that our multi-stage optimization approach significantly improves key skill metrics, PCC and TCC, while utilizing the same backbone structure, surpassing the state-of-the-art NWP systems (ECMWF-S2S) by over \textbf{19-91\%}. Our research contests the recent study that direct forecasting outperforms rolling forecasting for S2S tasks. Through theoretical analysis, we propose that the underperformance of rolling forecasting may arise from the accumulation of Jacobian matrix products during training. Our multi-stage framework can be viewed as a form of teacher forcing to address this issue. Code is available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Baguan-S2S-23E7/}</description>
