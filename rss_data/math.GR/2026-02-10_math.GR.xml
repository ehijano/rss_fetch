      <title>Proof of the Noferini-Williams conjecture for Gilbert-Howie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gilbert-Howie groups $H(n,m)$ form a notable subclass within the broader family of Fibonacci-type cyclically presented groups $G_n(m,k)$. Noferini and Williams conjectured that the abelianization $H(n,m)^{ab}$ is torsion-free with $\mathbb{Z}$-rank $2$ if and only if $n\equiv 0\pmod{6}$ and $m\equiv 2\pmod{n}$. We confirm this conjecture by proving that $\mathrm{Res}(F,G)=\pm1$, where $F=(1+t^m-t)/\Phi_6$ and $G=(t^n-1)/\Phi_6$, with $\Phi_6$ denoting the sixth cyclotomic polynomial. The proof uses a minimality argument, reducing the general problem to three cases: $m=2+n/3$, $m=2+n/2$, and $m=2+2n/3$. These cases are handled using polynomial resultant analysis and field-theoretic methods. As a consequence, we complete the classification of all $G_n(m,k)$ that arise as labelled oriented graph groups.</description>

      <title>Some Remarks on Super $M_{p}$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $p$ be a prime divisor of $|G|$. An irreducible $p$-Brauer character $\varphi$ of $G$ is called super-monomial if every primitive $p$-Brauer character inducing $\varphi$ is linear. The group $G$ is said to be a super $M_{p}$-group if every irreducible $p$-Brauer character of $G$ is super-monomial. In this note, we investigate the conditions under which a finite group $G$ qualifies as a super $M_{p}$-group. We demonstrate that every normal subgroup of a super $M_{p}$-group of odd order is an $M_{p}$-group.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Perfect Prishchepov Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Prishchepov groups $P(r,n,k,s,q)$, a unifying family of cyclically presented groups that encompasses many classical cases. For $n$ coprime to $6$, we prove a conjecture essentially characterizing when these groups are perfect: namely, $n$ divides either $2(k-1)-q$ (if $r \geq s$) or $q(r+s)$. This settles the classification of perfect Prishchepov groups under the co-primality condition.</description>

      <title>Stable Extensions of Complete Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group is said to be stable if it is isomorphic to its automorphism group. Centerless groups are naturally embedded in their automorphism groups via the map sending an element to conjugation by that element, partially constraining the structure of their automorphisms. As such, it is natural to ask if we can use centerless groups to construct stable groups with nontrivial centers. To this end, we classify all finite stable groups arising as central extensions of centerless groups. Furthermore, all finite stable groups arising as extensions of centerless groups by groups of nilpotency class two with trivial induced outer action on the kernel are classified. Finally, it is shown that there are infinitely many stable groups of each of the above two types. As a corollary we show that there are infinitely many non-stable finite groups equinumerous with their automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>Tree Pairs for Algebraic Bieri-Strebel Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reintroduce a previously discovered method for constructing tree pair representations for Algebraic Bieri-Strebel groups, as well as demonstrate a class of higher order groups that cannot have a tree pair representation. In doing so, we demonstrate that there is no maximum degree such that for all polynomials of higher degree, the associated Algebraic Bieri Strebel group must have a tree-pair representation.</description>

      <title>Which $F_3$-by-$\mathbb{Z}$s are CAT(0)?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we point out a mistake in theorem 4.4 of [Sam06], which states that a semidirect product $F_3\rtimes_\phi\mathbb{Z}$ whose defining automorphism $\phi$ is unipotent-polynomially-growing and fixes a free factor of rank $2$ is a CAT(0) group. We give and prove the corrected statement: such a group is CAT(0), if and only if $\phi$ is the identity or if the element of $F_2$ twisting the non-fixed generator is not in the commutator subgroup of $F_2$. This gives new examples of free-by-cyclic groups that cannot act properly by semisimple isometries on a CAT(0) space, that are similar to {Gersten}'s examples [Ger94]. We also construct CAT(0) structures for new examples of $F_3$-by-$\mathbb{Z}$s by thickening the strips in Bridson's tree of spaces construction [BH99].</description>

      <title>On medial Latin quandles and affine modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that the category of Latin (resp. commutative) medial quandles is equivalent to the category of affine modules over a certain Laurent polynomial ring (resp. the dyadic rationals). As applications, we describe free objects in these categories and obtain a structure theorem for finitely generated medial commutative quandles. We also characterize racks whose duals are commutative. Collectively, this solves two open problems of Bardakov and Elhamdadi (arXiv:2601.07057v2).</description>

      <title>Topological fundamental groups of locally finite infinite configuration spaces and infinite braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topological fundamental groups of the locally finite infinite ordered configuration space \(Conf^{lf}_\infty(\C)\) in the plane and the homotopy quotient of $Conf^{lf}_\infty$ by the canonical action of the infinite permutation group $\Aut(\N)$: \[ H^{lf}(\infty):=\pi_1^{\mathrm{top}}(Conf^{lf}_\infty(\C),\widetilde{\N}), \qquad B^{lf}(\infty):=\pi_1^{\mathrm{top}}\!\bigl(Conf^{lf}_\infty(\C)\!/\!/\Aut(\N),[e_0,\widetilde{\N}]\bigr). \] We prove that \(H^{lf}(\infty)\) and \(B^{lf}(\infty)\) are non-discrete and complete topological groups. A main structural theorem identifies \(H^{lf}(\infty)\) with a canonical locally finite inverse-limit model built from finite pure braid groups, and we construct a complete left-invariant ultrametric compatible with the quotient topology from the loop space of $\Conf$. The direct limit of finite pure braid groups admits a dense embedding into \(H^{lf}(\infty)\), and we show that \(H^{lf}(\infty)\) is the Ra\u{\i}kov completion of this subgroup. Moreover, the direct limit of finite braid groups embeds into \(B^{lf}(\infty)\) and is dense in the finitary subgroup \(B^{lf}_{\mathrm{fin}}(\infty)\subseteq B^{lf}(\infty)\).</description>

      <title>Certain topological indices and spectral properties of SGB-graphs of finite cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $L(G)$ be the set of all subgroups of a group $G$. The subgroup generating bipartite graph $\mathcal{B}(G)$ defined on $G$ is a bipartite graph whose vertex set is the union of two sets $G \times G$ and $L(G)$, and two vertices $(a, b) \in G \times G$ and $H \in L(G)$ are adjacent if $H$ is generated by $a$ and $b$. In this paper, we realize the structures of $\mathcal{B}(G)$ for cyclic groups of order $pq, p^2q$ and $p^2q^2$, where $p$ and $q$ are primes and $p \neq q$. We also deduce expressions for first and second Zagreb indices of these graphs and check the validity of Hansen-Vuki{\v{c}}evi{\'c} conjecture [Hansen, P. and Vuki{\v{c}}evi{\'c}, D. Comparing the Zagreb indices, {\em Croatica Chemica Acta}, \textbf{80}(2), 165-168, 2007]. Expressions of certain other degree-based topological indices of these graphs are also computed. We further compute various spectra and their corresponding energies of $\mathcal{B}(G)$ if $G$ is any cyclic group of order $p^n, pq, p^2q$ and $p^2q^2$, where $p$ and $q$ are two distinct primes and $n \geq 1$. We conclude the paper showing that $\mathcal{B}(G)$ satisfies E-LE conjecture [Gutman, I., Abreu, N. M. M., Vinagre, C. T. M., Bonifacioa, A. S. and Radenkovic, S. Relation between energy and Laplacian energy, {\em MATCH Communications in Mathematical and in Computer Chemistry}, \textbf{59}, 343--354, 2008] for these groups.</description>

      <title>On representations of the triplet group and some of its extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the representations of the triplet group $L_n$, where $n$ is a positive integer, and its extensions to the virtual and welded triplet groups $VL_n$ and $WL_n$, respectively. We first introduce $L_n$, its extensions, and its pure subgroup. We then investigate several representations, proving the irreducibility of the classical Tits representation $\Theta: L_n \to \mathrm{GL}_{n-1}(\mathbb{C})$ over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ and constructing a new representation $\mu: L_n \to \mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_n)$, where $\mathbb{F}_n$ is the free group of rank $n$. For the representation $\mu$, we determine its matrix form, faithfulness, and irreducibility. We also classify all complex homogeneous $2$-local representations of $L_n$ for $n \ge 3$ and all non-homogeneous $2$-local representations of $L_3$, establishing connections with the complex specialization of the representation $\mu$. Finally, we examine extensions of $L_n$ representations to $VL_n$ and $WL_n$, proving their existence, classifying non-trivial complex homogeneous $2$-local representations, and analyzing their faithfulness and irreducibility. The paper concludes with an open question regarding further extension of representation of $L_n$ to $VL_n$ and $WL_n$.</description>

      <title>The Banach-Tarski paradox in complete discretely valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove some results related to the classical Banach--Tarski paradox in the setting of a field $\mathbb{K}$ that is complete with respect to a discrete non-Archimedean valuation (e.g., when $\mathbb{K}$ is the field $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $p$-adic numbers for a prime $p$). Namely, the field $\mathbb{K}$, as well as all balls and spheres in $\mathbb{K}$, admit a paradoxical decomposition with respect to the isometry group of $\mathbb{K}$. Such decompositions can be realized using pieces with the Baire property if $\mathbb{K}$ is separable. Under the additional assumption of local compactness of $\mathbb{K}$ (e.g., when $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{Q}_p$), any two bounded subsets of $\mathbb{K}$ with nonempty interiors are equidecomposable with respect to the isometry group of $\mathbb{K}$.
  Our results complete the study of paradoxical decompositions in the non-Archimedean setting, addressing the one-dimensional case and building on earlier work for higher-dimensional normed spaces over $\mathbb{K}$ with respect to groups of affine isometries.</description>

      <title>Betti Numbers of Negatively Curved Orbifolds with Coefficients in Arbitrary Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Betti numbers of finite-volume negatively curved orbifolds grow at most linearly with the volume, with coefficients in an arbitrary field. In particular, this gives a linear bound for the Betti numbers of finite-volume hyperbolic orbifolds over $\mathbb{F}_p$. This extends a theorem of Gromov from manifolds to orbifolds in negative curvature, and answers a question of Samet, by strengthening his theorem from characteristic $0$ to arbitrary characteristic. The key new input is a quantitative bound on the homology of spherical quotients.</description>

      <title>Reidemeister numbers for arithmetic Borel subgroups in type A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Reidemeister number $R(\varphi)$ of a group automorphism $\varphi \in \mathrm{Aut}(G)$ encodes the number of orbits of the $\varphi$-twisted conjugation action of $G$ on itself, and the Reidemeister spectrum of $G$ is defined as the set of Reidemeister numbers of all of its automorphisms. We obtain a sufficient criterion for some groups of triangular matrices over integral domains to have property $R_\infty$, which means that their Reidemeister spectrum equals $\{\infty\}$. Using this criterion, we show that Reidemeister numbers for certain soluble $S$-arithmetic groups behave differently from their linear algebraic counterparts -- contrasting with results of Steinberg, Bhunia, and Bose.</description>

Abstract: We establish property $R_\infty$ for Artin groups of spherical type $D_n$, $n\ge6$, their central quotients, and also for large hyperbolic-type free-of-infinity Artin groups and some other classes of large-type Artin groups. The key ingredients are recent descriptions of the automorphism groups for these Artin groups and their action on suitable Gromov-hyperbolic spaces. We also provide a detailed proof of Delzant's Lemma, an important technical tool used in our work and in several other papers on the $R_\infty$ property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming G\"odel's axiom of constructibility $V=L$, we construct a $\chi$-free abelian group $G$ of singular cardinality for some suitable cardinal $\chi$ which is regular and uncountable, equipped with the property that for every nontrivial subgroup $G' \subseteq G$ of smaller cardinality, $Hom(G',\mathbb{Z}) \neq 0$, while $Hom(G,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. This provides a consistent counterexample to the singular compactness of nontrivial duality with respect to the functor $Hom(-,\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>On multiplicities in length spectra of semi-arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that semi-arithmetic surfaces of arithmetic dimension two which admit a modular embedding have exponential growth of mean multiplicities in their length spectrum. Prior to this work large mean multiplicities were rigorously confirmed only for the length spectra of arithmetic surfaces. We also discuss the relation of the degeneracies in the length spectrum and quantization of the Hamiltonian mechanical system on the surface.</description>

      <title>The Burness-Giudici Conjecture on Some Primitive Groups with Socle PSU(3,q)</title>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group on $\Omega$ with two points $\alpha, \beta\in\Omega$ such that $G_{\alpha}\cap G_{\beta}=1$. The Saxl graph $\Sigma(G)$ of the pair $(G,\Omega)$ is the graph with vertex set $\Omega$, while two vertices $\alpha', \beta'$ are adjacent if and only if $G_{\alpha'}\cap G_{\beta'}=1$. It was conjectured by Burness and Giudici that the Saxl graph $\Sigma(G)$ of any primitive permutation group $G$ has the property that any two vertices have a common neighbor. We focused on proving the conjecture for all primitive groups $G$ whose socle is a simple group of Lie-type of rank $1$, that is, those with $soc(G)\in \{PSL(2,q), PSU(3,q), Ree(q), Sz(q)\}$. The case of $soc(G)=PSL(2,q)$ has been published in two papers. This paper will address most cases where $soc(G)=PSU(3,q)$, with the exception of a particularly intricate configuration in which the point stabilizer contains $PSO(3,q)$. That specific configuration has been treated in a separate paper.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group on $\Omega$ containing two points $\alpha, \beta$ such that $G_{\alpha}\cap G_{\beta}=1$. The Saxl graph $\Sigma(G)$ of $(G, \Omega)$ is defined as the graph with vertex set $\Omega$, where two vertices $\alpha', \beta'$ are adjacent if and only if $G_{\alpha'}\cap G_{\beta'}=1$. Burness and Giudici conjectured that for any primitive permutation group $G$, its Saxl graph $\Sigma(G)$ satisfies the property that any two vertices share a common neighbor. We focused on proving this conjecture for all primitive groups $G$ whose socle is a simple group of Lie-type of rank $1$; that is, groups with $soc(G)\in \{PSL(2,q), PSU(3,q), Ree(q), Sz(q)\}$. The case $soc(G)=PSL(2,q)$ has been published in two papers. In this paper, we treat the cases where $soc(G)\in\{Ree(q), Sz(q)\}$.</description>

      <title>Conjugator Length in Finitely Presented Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conjugator length function of a finitely generated group is the function $f$ so that $f(n)$ is the minimal upper bound on the length of a word realizing the conjugacy of two words of length at most $n$. We study herein the spectrum of functions which can be realized as the conjugator length function of a finitely presented group, showing that it contains every function that can be realized as the Dehn function of a finitely presented group. In particular, given a real number $\alpha\geq2$ which is computable in double-exponential time, we show there exists a finitely presented group whose conjugator length function is asymptotically equivalent to $n^\alpha$. This yields a substantial refinement to results of Bridson and Riley. We attain this result through the computational model of $S$-machines, achieving the more general result that any sufficiently large function which can be realized as the time function of an $S$-machine can also be realized as the conjugator length function of a finitely presented group. Finally, we use the constructed groups to explore the relationship between the conjugator length function, the Dehn function, and the annular Dehn function in finitely presented groups.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum: Group-Theoretic Approach to Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently simulating quantum circuits on classical computers is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. This paper presents a novel theoretical approach that achieves substantial speedups over existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique leverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum circuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation. Several fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical foundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem. The potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and preliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the boundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for quantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further research at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The findings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction, and the development of more efficient quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Packing sets under finite groups via algebraic incidence structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05377v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group acting on a vector space $V = \mathbb{F}_p^n$ over a prime field. Given finite sets $S \subset G$ and $E \subset V$, we study the restricted orbit union $S(E) = \bigcup_{g\in S} g(E)$ and establish quantitative lower bounds for $|S(E)|$ in terms of $|S|$, $|E|$, and natural structural conditions. This finite field packing problem has connections to distance geometry, configuration counting, and expanding graphs. For $G = SL_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ acting on $\mathbb{F}_p^2$, we prove that $$|S(E)| \gg \min\left\lbrace p^2, \frac{|S||E|}{p^2}\right\rbrace,$$ which is sharp. Under geometric non-concentration conditions on $E$ and subgroup-avoidance hypotheses on $S$, we obtain a power-saving improvement of the form $$|S(E)|\gg \min \left\lbrace p^2, ~\max\left\lbrace\frac{|S||E|}{pk}, ~\frac{|S|^{\frac{1}{2}}|E|}{p^{\frac{1-\epsilon}{2}}k^{\frac{1}{2}}}\right\rbrace \right\rbrace,$$ where $k$ bounds the radial multiplicity of $E$. For small sets $|E| \leq p$, we establish optimal bounds using weighted incidence theory. Analogous results are proved for the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_1(\mathbb{F}_p)$ acting on $\mathbb{F}_p^3$. Our approach reformulates the problem as an incidence question in a bipartite action graph. The proofs combine Fourier analytic techniques, energy estimates, point-line incidence bounds, and area-energy inequalities for skew dot products. The methods extend classical sum-product type problems and incidence theory to noncommutative group actions.</description>

      <title>Permutation twisted cohomology, remixed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00954v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each endotrivial complex arising from Bredon homology of a representation sphere, we construct $p$-local quasi-isomorphisms, called forerunners, enabling us to extend Balmer--Gallauer's results in arXiv:2307.04398 Part II concerning the tensor-triangular geometry of permutation modules for elementary abelian $p$-groups to all $p$-groups. We construct an open cover of the Balmer spectrum under which all endotrivials are line bundles, that is, every endotrivial is locally isomorphic to a shifted tensor unit. We define a 'remixed' permutation twisted cohomology ring for which the canonical comparison map from the Balmer spectrum to the homogeneous spectrum of the twisted cohomology ring is injective. If the twisted cohomology ring is Noetherian, the comparison map is an open immersion, and the open cover endows the Balmer spectrum with Dirac scheme structure. We prove Noetherianity holds for Dedekind groups and all $p$-groups of order at most $p^3$, and conjecture Noetherianity holds for all finite $p$-groups.</description>

      <title>Fractal closures of geodesic planes in Hitchin manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ratner's theorem implies topological rigidity of immersed totally geodesic subspaces of noncompact type in finite-volume locally symmetric spaces. In higher rank and infinite volume, however, counterexamples to this rigidity have remained elusive.
  We construct the first such examples using {\em floating geodesic planes}. Specifically, we exhibit a Zariski dense Hitchin surface group $\Gamma&lt;\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ such that the Hitchin manifold $\Gamma\backslash \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/ \mathrm{SO}(3)$ contains immersed floating geodesic planes whose closures are fractal, with non-integer Hausdorff dimensions accumulating at $2$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ can be chosen inside $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$.
  The construction uses Goldman's bulging deformations and exploits geometric features specific to higher rank. In contrast to rank one, where geodesics orthogonal to a hyperplane diverge uniformly, floating planes interact through higher-dimensional flats, requiring control of nearest point projections and a delicate analysis of Hausdorff dimension both at the group level and in the ambient symmetric space, where $\Gamma$-translates may intersect.</description>

      <title>Linear sofic approximations of amenable algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of linear sofic approximations for algebras, analogous to the concept of sofic approximations for groups. We prove that for a finitely generated amenable $K$-algebra with no zero divisors, all linear sofic approximations are conjugate. This provides an algebraic analogue to Elek and Szab\'o's theorem for amenable groups. The proof relies on a "linear monotiling" technique, constructed using a theorem by Bre\v{s}ar, Meshulam and \v{S}emrl on locally linearly dependent operators. Finally, we apply this uniqueness result to the problem of weak stability in the rank metric, showing that the group algebra of an amenable group is weakly stable if and only if the group is residually finite.</description>
