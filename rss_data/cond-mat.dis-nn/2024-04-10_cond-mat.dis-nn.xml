      <title>Multifractal phase in the weighted adjacency matrices of random Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix in the giant connected component of Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, with average connectivity $p$ and randomly distributed hopping amplitudes. By solving the self-consistent cavity equations satisfied by the matrix elements of the resolvent, we compute the probability distribution of the local density of states, which governs the scaling with the system size of the moments of the eigenvectors' amplitudes, as well as several other observables related to the spectral statistics. For small values of $p&gt;1$ above the percolation threshold, we unveil the presence of an exotic delocalized but (weakly) multifractal phase in a broad region of the parameter space, which separates the localized phase found for $p\le1$ from the fully-delocalized GOE-like phase expected for $p\to \infty$. We explore the fundamental physical mechanism underlying the emergence of delocalized multifractal states, rooted in the pronounced heterogeneity in the topology of the graph. This heterogeneity arises from the interplay between strong fluctuations in local degrees and hopping amplitudes, and leads to an effective fragmentation of the graph. We further support our findings by characterizing the level statistics and the two-point spatial correlations within the multifractal phase, and address the ensuing anomalous transport and relaxation properties affecting the quantum dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>A random matrix model for the density of states of jammed soft spheres with applied stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the addition of applied stress to a random block matrix model introduced by Parisi to study the Hessian matrix of soft spheres near the jamming point. In the infinite dimensional limit the applied stress translates the spectral distribution to the left, leading to a stability constraint. With negative stress, as in the case of a random network of stretched elastic springs, the spectral distribution is translated to the right, and the density of states has a peak before the plateau.</description>

      <title>Solvable models of two-level systems coupled to itinerant electrons: Robust non-Fermi liquid and quantum critical pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strange metal behavior is traditionally associated with an underlying putative quantum critical point at zero temperature. However, in many correlated metals, e.g., high-Tc cuprate superconductors, strange metallicity persists at low temperatures over an extended range of microscopic parameters, suggesting the existence of an underlying quantum critical phase, whose possible physical origins remain poorly understood. Systematic investigations of physical scenarios giving rise to such a critical, non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase are therefore crucial to better understand this puzzling behavior. In a previous work [Bashan et al. arXiv:2310.07768], we considered a solvable large-N model consisting of itinerant electrons coupled to local two-level systems (TLSs) via spatially random interactions, inspired by the possibility of emergent metallic glassiness due to frustrated competing orders, and found that the system hosts an NFL phase with tunable exponents at intermediate couplings. In this work, we expand our investigation to the following: (i) We study the extent to which this NFL phase is generic by considering various deformations of our theory, including coupling of electrons to multiple operators of the TLSs and arbitrarily directed TLS-fields. We find that the physical picture obtained in Bashan et al. qualitatively persist in a wide region of parameter space, showcasing the robustness of the NFL phase; (ii) We analyze the superconducting instability due to coupling of TLSs to electrons, and find a rich structure, including quantum critical pairing associated with the NFL phase and conventional BCS pairing in the weak and strong coupling limits; (iii) We elaborate on the analysis of Bashan et al., including single-particle, transport and thermodynamic properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum graph models for transport in filamentary switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of metallic nanofilaments bridging two electrodes across an insulator is a mechanism for resistive switching. Examples of such phenomena include atomic synapses, which constitute a distinct class of memristive devices whose behavior is closely tied to the properties of the filament. Until recently, experimental investigation of the low-temperature regime and quantum transport effects has been limited. However, with growing interest in understanding the true impacts of the filament on device conductance, comprehending quantum effects has become crucial for quantum neuromorphic hardware. We discuss quantum transport resulting from filamentary switching in a narrow region where the continuous approximation of the contact is not valid, and only a few atoms are involved. In this scenario, the filament can be represented by a graph depicting the adjacency of atoms and the overlap between atomic orbitals. Using quantum graphs, we calculate the scattering amplitude of charge carriers on this graph and explore the interplay between filamentary formation and quantum transport effects.</description>

      <title>Proposed modified computational model for the amoeba-inspired combinatorial optimization machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single-celled amoeba can solve the traveling salesman problem through its shape-changing dynamics. In this paper, we examine roles of several elements in a previously proposed computational model of the solution-search process of amoeba and three modifications towards enhancing the solution-search preformance. We find that appropriate modifications can indeed significantly improve the quality of solutions. It is also found that a condition associated with the volume conservation can also be modified in contrast to the naive belief that it is indispensable for the solution-search ability of amoeba. A proposed modified model shows much better performance.</description>

      <title>Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2's strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2 based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model based small molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on protein kinases and their inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.</description>

      <title>Ground state-based quantum feature maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum data embedding protocol based on the preparation of a ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. We analyze the corresponding quantum feature map, recasting it as an adiabatic state preparation procedure with Trotterized evolution. We compare the properties of underlying quantum models with ubiquitous Fourier-type quantum models, and show that ground state embeddings can be described effectively by a spectrum with degree that grows rapidly with the number of qubits, corresponding to a large model capacity. We observe that the spectrum contains massive frequency degeneracies, and the weighting coefficients for the modes are highly structured, thus limiting model expressivity. Our results provide a step towards understanding models based on quantum data, and contribute to fundamental knowledge needed for building efficient quantum machine learning (QML) protocols. As non-trivial embeddings are crucial for designing QML protocols that cannot be simulated classically, our findings guide the search for high-capacity quantum models that can largely outperform classical models.</description>

      <title>From latent dynamics to meaningful representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.00905v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While representation learning has been central to the rise of machine learning and artificial intelligence, a key problem remains in making the learned representations meaningful. For this, the typical approach is to regularize the learned representation through prior probability distributions. However, such priors are usually unavailable or are ad hoc. To deal with this, recent efforts have shifted towards leveraging the insights from physical principles to guide the learning process. In this spirit, we propose a purely dynamics-constrained representation learning framework. Instead of relying on predefined probabilities, we restrict the latent representation to follow overdamped Langevin dynamics with a learnable transition density - a prior driven by statistical mechanics. We show this is a more natural constraint for representation learning in stochastic dynamical systems, with the crucial ability to uniquely identify the ground truth representation. We validate our framework for different systems including a real-world fluorescent DNA movie dataset. We show that our algorithm can uniquely identify orthogonal, isometric and meaningful latent representations.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phase Transition due to Feedback-induced Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The traditional dynamical phase transition refers to the appearance of singularities in an observable with respect to a control parameter for a late-time state or singularities in the rate function of the Loschmidt echo with respect to time. Here, we study the many-body dynamics in a continuously monitored free fermion system with conditional feedback under open boundary conditions. We surprisingly find a novel dynamical phase transition from a logarithmic scaling of the entanglement entropy to an area-law scaling as time evolves. The transition, which is noticeably different from the conventional dynamical phase transition, arises from the competition between the bulk dynamics and boundary skin effects. In addition, we find that while quasidisorder or disorder cannot drive a transition for the steady state, a transition occurs for the maximum entanglement entropy during the time evolution, which agrees well with the entanglement transition for the steady state of the dynamics under periodic boundary conditions.</description>
