      <title>Persistent-variable thermal compositional simulation of multiphase flow with phase separation in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal compositional multiphase flow in porous media with phase transitions involves complex nonlinear interactions among flow, transport, and phase equilibrium. This paper presents a persistent-variable formulation for thermal compositional flow using enthalpy to formulate the energy balance and the local equilibrium problem. Equilibrium conditions are derived from a thermodynamically consistent minimization problem using a persistent set of variables, allowing for seamless integration of equilibrium calculations into a fully coupled flow and transport model. This formulation does not require phase stability tests and provides a continuous and full mathematical description of the multiphysics system, suitable for challenging non-isothermal scenarios. To tackle the nonlinearities arising from phase transitions, we embed a local solver for the thermodynamic subproblem within a global Newton solver for the fully implicit system. The local solver exploits the locality of the subproblem for parallelization and leverages the modularity of the persistent-variable formulation for both isothermal and isenthalpic equilibrium conditions locally. We demonstrate the capability of our approach to simulate complex high-enthalpy systems, including narrow-boiling phenomena. The impact of the embedded local solver is analyzed through numerical experiments, demonstrating a reduction in global nonlinear iterations of up to 23 \% with increased use of the local solver. The number of local iterations is controlled with a local solver tolerance and no significant impact on the global iteration number was observed for local residual tolerances as high as $1e-3$. The persistent-variable approach using enthalpy and the modularity of the embedded local solver advance the usage of equilibrium calculations in multiphase flow simulations and are suitable for high-enthalpy applications.</description>

      <title>Bessel Functions and Analysis of Circular Waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of circularly coiled optical slab waveguides, which is also applicable to acoustical waveguides. We use a change of variables and the classical Frobenius method to compute Bessel functions of complex order and complex argument, and combine it with a perfectly matched layer technique to solve the relevant Bessel eigenvalue problem and deliver accurate loss factors for eigensolutions to the three-layer optical slab waveguide problem. The solutions provide a benchmark for verifying model implementations of this problem and allow for a numerical verification of the Glazman criterion that provides a foundation for the well-posedness and stability analysis of homogeneous circular waveguides with impedance boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>GPU-Portable Real-Space Density Functional Theory Implementation on Unified-Memory Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a GPU-portable implementation of a real-space density functional theory (DFT) code ``QUMASUN'' and benchmark it on the new Plasma Simulator featuring Intel Xeon 6980P CPUs, and AMD MI300A GPUs. Additional tests were performed on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. In particular MI300A supports unified memory and GH200 supports coherent memory interconnect, simplifying GPU porting. A lightweight C++ lambda-based layer enables CPU, CUDA, and HIP execution without OpenMP/OpenACC preprocessor directives. For diamond (216 atoms) and tungsten (128 atoms) systems, MI300A and GH200 achieve 2.0-2.8 $\times$ and 2.3-2.4 $\times$ speedups over a 256-core Xeon node. The compute-bound kernels, which are fast Fourier transforms (FFT), dense matrix-matrix multiplications (GEMM) and eigenvalue solver, show substantial acceleration on both GPUs, indicating that the present GPU-portable approach can benefit a wide range of plasma-fusion simulation codes beyond DFT.</description>

      <title>On the Construction of High-Order and Exact Pressure Equilibrium Schemes for Arbitrary Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical fully conservative discretizations of the Euler compressible single or multi-component fluid equations governed by a real-fluid equation of state exhibit spurious pressure oscillations due to the nonlinearity of the thermodynamic relation between pressure, density, and internal energy. A fully conservative, pressure-equilibrium preserving method and a high-order, fully conservative, approximate pressure-equilibrium preserving method are presented. Both methods are general and can handle an arbitrary equation of state and arbitrary number of species. Unlike existing approaches to discretize the multi-component Euler equations, we do not introduce non conservative updates, overspecified equations, or design for a specific equation of state. The proposed methods are demonstrated on inviscid smooth interface advection problems governed by three equations of state: ideal-gas, stiffened-gas, and van der Waals where we show orders of magnitude reductions in spurious pressure oscillations compared to existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Density Functional Theory Through the Lens of Multilevel Monte Carlo Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic density functional theory (sDFT) has exhibited advantages over the standard Kohn-Sham DFT method and has become an attractive approach for large-scale electronic structure calculations. The sDFT method avoids the expensive matrix diagonalization by introducing a set of random orbitals and approximating the density matrix via Chebyshev expansion of a matrix-valued function. In this work, we study the sDFT with a plane-wave discretization, and discuss variance reduction algorithms in the framework of multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods. In particular, we show that the density matrix evaluation in sDFT can be decomposed into many levels by increasing the plane-wave cutoffs or the Chebyshev polynomial orders. This decomposition renders the computational cost independent of the discretization size or temperature. To demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm, we provide rigorous analysis of the statistical errors and present numerical experiments on some material systems.</description>

      <title>PENCO: A Physics-Energy-Numerical-Consistent Operator for 3D Phase Field Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient solutions of spatio-temporal partial differential equations (PDEs), such as phase-field models, are fundamental for understanding interfacial dynamics and microstructural evolution in materials science and fluid mechanics. Neural Operators (NOs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven alternatives to traditional solvers; however, existing architectures often accumulate temporal errors, struggle to generalize in long-horizon simulations, and require large training datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose PENCO (Physics-Energy-Numerical-Consistent Operator), a hybrid operator-learning framework that integrates physical laws and numerical structure within a data-driven architecture. The formulation introduces an enhanced L^2 Gauss-Lobatto collocation residual around the temporal midpoint that robustly enforces the governing dynamics and significantly improves accuracy, a Fourier-space numerical consistency term that captures the balanced behavior of semi-implicit discretizations, and an energy-dissipation constraint that ensures thermodynamic consistency. Additional low-frequency spectral anchoring and teacher-consistency mechanisms further stabilize learning and suppress long-term error growth. This hybrid design enables PENCO to preserve governing physics while mitigating long-term error growth. Through extensive three-dimensional phase-field benchmarks covering phase ordering, crystallization, epitaxial growth, and complex pattern formation, PENCO demonstrates superior accuracy, stability, and data efficiency compared to state-of-the-art neural operators, including Multi-Head Neural Operator (MHNO) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO-4D), while maintaining physically consistent evolution. The associated dataset and implementation are available at github.com/MBamdad/PENCO.</description>

      <title>VNS Tokamak OpenMC-Serpent Validation for Medical Isotope Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Volumetric Neutron Source (VNS) tokamak is a proposed fusion reactor for testing and qualification of reactor components for future use in a fusion power facility, and has potential use for radioisotope production. The VNS geometry is modeled in the Serpent and OpenMC neutronics codes. Analog neutron-photon coupled simulations are carried out to compare the model's vacuum vessel and blanket components across codes. In the vacuum vessel, neutron and photon flux maps are calculated, while in the blanket region, neutron and photon spectra, (n,T), and (n,2n) reaction rates are calculated and compared between models. The detector response comparisons found the following: neutron flux and (n,T) reactions achieved excellent agreement, the (n,2n) detector response had good agreement, and photon flux had regional discrepancies depending on Serpent tracking used. Hybrid tracking lead to a relative difference of about 20% in the outboard side blanket, where as employment of delta tracking resulted in less than 1% relative difference. On an HPC cluster, Serpent was found to have shorter computation time than OpenMC in neutron photon coupled simulations using both hybrid tracking and delta tracking, but longer in neutron only simulations. An exemplary radioisotope production case is presented for the demonstration of additional VNS capabilities.</description>

      <title>LEDDS: Portable LBM-DEM simulations on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic formulations of GPU programs provide a high-level alternative to device-specific code by expressing computations as compositions of well-defined parallel primitives (e.g., map, sort, reduce), rather than through handcrafted GPU kernels. In this work, we demonstrate that this paradigm can be extended to complex and challenging problems in computational physics: the simulation of granular flows and fluid-particle interactions.
  LEDDS, our open-source framework, performs fully coupled Lattice Boltzmann -- Discrete Element Method (LBM-DEM) simulations using only algorithmic primitives, and runs efficiently on single-GPU platforms. The entire workflow, including neighbor search, collision detection, and fluid-particle coupling, is expressed as a sequence of portable primitives. While the current implementation illustrates these principles primarily through algorithms from the C++ Standard Library, with selective use of Thrust primitives for performance, the underlying concept is compatible with any HPC environment offering a rich set of parallel algorithms and is therefore applicable across a wide range of modern GPU systems and future accelerators.
  LEDDS is validated through benchmarks spanning both DEM and LBM-DEM configurations, including sphere and ellipsoid collisions, wall friction tests, single-particle settling, Jeffery's orbits, and particle-laden shear flows. Despite its high level of abstraction, LEDDS achieves performances comparable to those of hand-tuned CUDA solvers, while maintaining portability and code clarity. These results show that high-performance LBM-DEM coupling can be achieved without sacrificing generality or readability, establishing LEDDS as a blueprint for portable multiphysics frameworks based on algorithmic primitives.</description>

      <title>Engineered Inclined Energy Landscapes Enabling Free Flow of Magnetic Microstructures for Artificial Neuron Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronic-based brain-inspired neuromorphic computing has recently attracted significant attention due to the exceptional properties of magnetic microstructures, including nanoscale dimensions, high stability, and low energy consumption. Despite these advantages, the practical integration of such microstructures into functional devices remains challenging. Fabrication processes are often complex and prone to stochastic effects, such as unwanted pinning and thermal-induced instabilities, which limit device reliability and scalability. Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing spintronic neuromorphic architectures toward real-world applications. Thus, to reduce these effects we have proposed a design which is experimentally feasible and require less energy as compared to existing one. By engineering the system anisotropy into a sawtooth-type energy landscape, we have achieved free flow of these microstructures and successfully emulated integrate and fire (IF) function of biological neuron. Thus, proposed design presents an experimentally reliable and energy efficient external stimuli approach for tailoring magnetic microstructures dynamic behaviours, resulting in low energy consumption of 23.66 fJ per spike paving the way for the development of skyrmion-based futuristic neuromorphic computing device applications.</description>

      <title>Double Perovskites K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6 from First-Principles: Towards Efficient Materials for Green Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural flexibility and multifunctional nature of double perovskite oxides make them attractive for applications requiring coupled optical, mechanical, and thermal performance. Using first-principles computations, this study examines the structural, electronic, elastic, optical, and thermoelectric stability of K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6. The two compounds combine to form a cubic double perovskite structure with ordered Nb$^{5+}$ and Ta$^{5+}$ cations. The calculated elastic constants satisfy the Born stability criteria, confirming mechanical stability; however, both K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6 exhibit brittle behavior according to Pugh's ratio, reflecting limited ductility. Semiconducting behavior is revealed by band structure analysis with energy gaps of 2.79 eV for K2NbTaO6 and 2.63 eV for Rb2NbTaO6. Optical spectra show noticeable absorption in the high-energy region near the UV, indicating relevance for theoretical studies of optoelectronic and photocatalytic processes, without implying practical device efficiency.

      <title>NORi: An ML-Augmented Ocean Boundary Layer Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NORi is a machine-learned (ML) parameterization of ocean boundary layer turbulence that is physics-based and augmented with neural networks. NORi stands for neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) Richardson number (Ri) closure. The physical parameterization is controlled by a Richardson number-dependent diffusivity and viscosity. The NODEs are trained to capture the entrainment through the base of the boundary layer, which cannot be represented with a local diffusive closure. The parameterization is trained using large-eddy simulations in an "a posteriori" fashion, where parameters are calibrated with a loss function that explicitly depends on the actual time-integrated variables of interest rather than the instantaneous subgrid fluxes, which are inherently noisy. NORi is designed for the realistic nonlinear equation of state of seawater and demonstrates excellent prediction and generalization capabilities in capturing entrainment dynamics under different convective strengths, oceanic background stratifications, rotation strengths, and surface wind forcings. NORi is numerically stable for at least 100 years of integration time in large-scale simulations, despite only being trained on 2-day horizons, and can be run with time steps as long as one hour. The highly expressive neural networks, combined with a physically-rigorous base closure, prove to be a robust paradigm for designing parameterizations for climate models where data requirements are drastically reduced, inference performance can be directly targeted and optimized, and numerical stability is implicitly encouraged during training.</description>

      <title>Numerical model for pellet rocket acceleration in PELOTON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A direct numerical simulation model for the rocket acceleration of pellets in thermonuclear fusion devices has been developed for PELOTON, a 3D Lagrangian particle pellet code [R. Samulyak et al, Nuclear Fusion 61 (4), 046007 (2021)], and validated using shattered pellet injection (SPI) experiments in JET. The pellet rocket acceleration is driven by grad-B drift of the ablation cloud that creates asymmetry and non-uniform heating of the cloud. The model accounts for non-uniform charging of the ablation cloud by hot plasma electrons as well as local plasma gradients. The increased pressure on the high-field-side compared to the low-field-side leads to pellet (fragment) rocket acceleration. Pure deuterium and deuterium-neon mixture models have been implemented. The background plasma states have been obtained by using a new plasma cooling model for PELOTON. The cooling model distributes the ablated material within the corresponding flux volumes and accounts for ionization and other energy losses, Ohmic heating by toroidal currents, and the energy exchange between ions and electrons. Plasma profiles predicted by PELOTON cooling model have been compared with JOREK and INDEX simulations. PELOTON simulations of rocket acceleration and the corresponding trajectories of deuterium fragments are consistent with experimentally measured trajectories in JET. We show that composite deuterium-neon pellets containing 0.5% of neon experienced smaller deviation of their trajectories compared to the pure deuterium case. We simulate various spatial configurations of pellet fragments and demonstrate the cloud overlap impact on rocket acceleration. Additionally, we demonstrate the effect of plasma state gradients on the rocket acceleration. Future work will focus on the rocket acceleration of SPI in projected ITER plasmas and the development of the corresponding scaling law for the rocket acceleration.</description>

      <title>A hybrid Green-Kubo (hGK) framework for calculating viscosity from short MD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Viscosity calculation from equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations relies on the traditional Green-Kubo (GK) framework, which integrates the stress autocorrelation function (SACF) over time. While the formalism is exact in the linear response regime, the traditional approach often suffers from poor convergence and requires extensive phase space sampling, which is computationally demanding for soft matter and polymer systems. In this Letter, we introduce a hybrid Green-Kubo (hGK) framework that alleviates these limitations by partitioning the SACF into two physically meaningful regimes: (i) a short time ballistic component extracted directly from short MD simulations, and (ii) a long time relaxation tail represented using analytically motivated functions, $\phi(\tau)$, fitted only to short trajectories. This strategy bypasses the need for extensive sampling while preserving physical rigor. Benchmarking against SPC/E water confirms excellent agreement with established results, and we further demonstrate the efficacy of the method for challenging electrolyte systems (EC-LiTFSI and PEO-LiTFSI), for which the GK framework fails to converge. The computational savings are substantial, with reductions of several orders of magnitude in required sampling, achieved without compromising predictive accuracy. We also discuss the limitations of the hGK framework and outline clear avenues for refinement, including optimal tail selection and robust identification of relaxation regimes in noisy stress data. The hGK framework presented in this Letter provides a conceptually simple, broadly applicable, and computationally efficient route for viscosity prediction in molecular liquids, polymer melts, and ionically conducting soft materials.</description>

Abstract: In modern artificial intelligence, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become a cornerstone for visual and perceptual tasks. However, their implementation on conventional electronic hardware faces fundamental bottlenecks in speed and energy efficiency due to resistive and capacitive losses. Photonic alternatives offer a promising route, yet the difficulty of realizing optical nonlinearities has prevented the realization of all-optical CNNs capable of end-to-end image classification. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical CNN that bypasses the need for explicit optical nonlinear activations. Our architecture comprises a single spatial-differentiation convolutional stage--using 24 directional kernels spanning 360{\deg}, along with a mean-filtering kernel--followed by a diffractive fully-connected layer. The directional convolution enhances feature selectivity, suppresses noise and crosstalk, and simplifies the classification task, allowing the weak nonlinearity inherent in optical diffraction to achieve high accuracy. We report experimentally classification accuracies of 86.8% on handwritten digits (MNIST) and 94.8% on a ten-class gesture dataset. The system delivers a computational throughput of 1.13X10^5 tera-operations per second (TOPS) and an energy efficiency of 1.51X10^3 TOPS/W--the highest reported among CNN hardware--with the potential to improve by a further 5-6 orders of magnitude using nanosecond-scale detectors. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward ultralow-latency, ultralow-energy vision processing for real-time intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Stable self-adaptive timestepping for Reduced Order Models for incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces RedEigCD, the first self-adaptive timestepping technique specifically tailored for reduced-order models (ROMs) of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Building upon linear stability concepts, the method adapts the timestep by directly bounding the stability function of the employed time integration scheme using exact spectral information of matrices related to the reduced operators. Unlike traditional error-based adaptive methods, RedEigCD relies on the eigenbounds of the convective and diffusive ROM operators, whose computation is feasible at reduced scale and fully preserves the online efficiency of the ROM. A central theoretical contribution of this work is the proof, based on the combined theorems of Bendixson and Rao, that, under linearized assumptions, the maximum stable timestep for projection-based ROMs is shown to be larger than or equal to that of their corresponding full-order models (FOMs). Numerical experiments for both periodic and non-homogeneous boundary conditions demonstrate that RedEigCD yields stable timestep increases up to a factor 40 compared to the FOM, without compromising accuracy. The methodology thus establishes a new link between linear stability theory and reduced-order modeling, offering a systematic path towards efficient, self-regulating ROM integration in incompressible flow simulations.</description>

      <title>Fermionic neural Gibbs states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce fermionic neural Gibbs states (fNGS), a variational framework for modeling finite-temperature properties of strongly interacting fermions. fNGS starts from a reference mean-field thermofield-double state and uses neural-network transformations together with imaginary-time evolution to systematically build strong correlations. Applied to the doped Fermi-Hubbard model, a minimal lattice model capturing essential features of strong electronic correlations, fNGS accurately reproduces thermal energies over a broad range of temperatures, interaction strengths, even at large dopings, for system sizes beyond the reach of exact methods. These results demonstrate a scalable route to studying finite-temperature properties of strongly correlated fermionic systems beyond one dimension with neural-network representations of quantum states.</description>

      <title>Amortized Inference of Multi-Modal Posteriors using Likelihood-Weighted Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel technique for amortized posterior estimation using Normalizing Flows trained with likelihood-weighted importance sampling. This approach allows for the efficient inference of theoretical parameters in high-dimensional inverse problems without the need for posterior training samples. We implement the method on multi-modal benchmark tasks in 2D and 3D to check for the efficacy. A critical observation of our study is the impact of the topology of the base distributions on the modelled posteriors. We find that standard unimodal base distributions fail to capture disconnected support, resulting in spurious probability bridges between modes. We demonstrate that initializing the flow with a Gaussian Mixture Model that matches the cardinality of the target modes significantly improves reconstruction fidelity, as measured by some distance and divergence metrics.</description>

      <title>Convergence of sample-based quantum diagonalization on a variable-length cuprate chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) is an algorithm for hybrid quantum-classical molecular simulation that has been of broad interest for application with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, SQD does not always converge on a practical timescale. Here, we explore scaling of the algorithm for a variable-length molecule made up of 2 to 6 copper oxide plaquettes with a minimal molecular orbital basis. The results demonstrate that enabling all-to-all connectivity, instituting a higher expansion order for the SQD algorithm, and adopting a non-Hartree-Fock molecular orbital basis can all play significant roles in overcoming sampling bottlenecks, though with tradeoffs that need to be weighed against the capabilities of quantum and classical hardware. Additionally, we find that noise on a real quantum computer, the Quantinuum H2 trapped ion device, can improve energy convergence beyond expectations based on noise-free statevector simulations.</description>

Abstract: While Transformer-based and standard Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven to be the best performers in classifying different types of jets, they require substantial computational power. We explore the scope of using a lightweight and scalable version of the EfficientNet architecture, along with global features of the jet. The end product is computationally inexpensive but is capable of competitive performance. We showcase the efficacy of our network for tagging top-quark jets in a sea of other light-quark and gluon jets.</description>

      <title>Structured Light at the Extreme: Harnessing Spatiotemporal Control for High-Field Laser-Matter Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review charts the emerging paradigm of intelligent structured light for high-field laser-matter interactions, where the precise spatiotemporal and vectorial control of light is a critical degree of freedom. We outline a transformative framework built upon three synergistic pillars. First, we survey the advanced electromagnetic toolkit, moving beyond conventional spatial light modulators to include robust static optics and the promising frontier of plasma light modulators. Second, we detail the optimization engine for this high-dimensional design space, focusing on physics-informed digital twins and AI-driven inverse design to automate the discovery of optimal light structures. Finally, we explore the groundbreaking applications enabled by this integrated approach, including programmable electron beams, orbital-angular-momentum-carrying {\gamma}-rays, compact THz accelerators, and robust communications. The path forward necessitates overcoming grand challenges in material science, real-time adaptive control at MHz rates, and the extension of these principles to the quantum realm. This review serves as a call to action for a coordinated, interdisciplinary effort to command, rather than merely observe, light-matter interactions at the extreme.</description>

      <title>Nested Sampling for Exploring Lennard-Jones Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lennard-Jones clusters, while an easy system, have a significant number of non equivalent configurations that increases rapidly with the number of atoms in the cluster. Here, we aim at determining the cluster partition function; we use the nested sampling algorithm, which transforms the multidimensional integral into a one-dimensional one, to perform this task. In particular, we use the nested_fit program, which implements slice sampling as search algorithm. We study here the 7-atom and 36-atom clusters to benchmark nested_fit for the exploration of potential energy surfaces. We find that nested_fit is able to recover phase transitions and find different stable configurations of the cluster. Furthermore, the implementation of the slice sampling algorithm has a clear impact on the computational cost.</description>

      <title>MCP-Enabled LLM for Meta-optics Inverse Design: Leveraging Differentiable Solver without LLM Expertise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation (AD) enables powerful metasurface inverse design but requires extensive theoretical and programming expertise. We present a Model Context Protocol (MCP) assisted framework that allows researchers to conduct inverse design with differentiable solvers through large language models (LLMs). Since LLMs inherently lack knowledge of specialized solvers, our proposed solution provides dynamic access to verified code templates and comprehensive documentation through dedicated servers. The LLM autonomously accesses these resources to generate complete inverse design codes without prescribed coordination rules. Evaluation on the Huygens meta-atom design task with the differentiable TorchRDIT solver shows that while both natural language and structured prompting strategies achieve high success rates, structured prompting significantly outperforms in design quality, workflow efficiency, computational cost, and error reduction. The minimalist server design, using only 5 APIs, demonstrates how MCP makes sophisticated computational tools accessible to researchers without programming expertise, offering a generalizable integration solution for other scientific tasks.</description>

      <title>One-shot acceleration of transient PDE solvers via online-learned preconditioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven acceleration of scientific computing workflows has been a high-profile aim of machine learning (ML) for science, with numerical simulation of transient partial differential equations (PDEs) being one of the main applications. The focus thus far has been on methods that require classical simulations to train, which when combined with the data-hungriness and optimization challenges of neural networks has caused difficulties in demonstrating a convincing advantage against strong classical baselines. We consider an alternative paradigm in which the learner uses a classical solver's own data to accelerate it, enabling a one-shot speedup of the simulation. Concretely, since transient PDEs often require solving a sequence of related linear systems, the feedback from repeated calls to a linear solver such as preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) can be used by a bandit algorithm to online-learn an adaptive sequence of solver configurations (e.g. preconditioners). The method we develop, PCGBandit, is implemented directly on top of the popular open source software OpenFOAM, which we use to show its effectiveness on a set of fluid and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting repeated matrix block structures for more efficient CFD on modern supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06710v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are often constrained by the memory-bound nature of sparse matrix-vector operations, which eventually limits performance on modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. This work introduces a novel approach to increase arithmetic intensity in CFD by leveraging repeated matrix block structures. The method transforms the conventional sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) into a sparse matrix-matrix product (SpMM), enabling simultaneous processing of multiple right-hand sides. This shifts the computation towards a more compute-bound regime by reusing matrix coefficients. Additionally, an inline mesh-refinement strategy is proposed: simulations initially run on a coarse mesh to establish a statistically steady flow, then refine to the target mesh. This reduces the wall-clock time to reach transition, leading to faster convergence with equivalent computational cost. The methodology is evaluated using theoretical performance bounds and validated through three test cases: a turbulent channel flow, Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, and an industrial airfoil simulation. Results demonstrate substantial speed-ups - from modest improvements in basic configurations to over 50% in the mesh-refinement setup - highlighting the benefits of integrating SpMM across all CFD operators, including divergence, gradient, and Laplacian.</description>

      <title>MORPH: PDE Foundation Models with Arbitrary Data Modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a modality-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data modality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, and multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorize full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from the heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning. The source code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/lanl/MORPH.</description>
