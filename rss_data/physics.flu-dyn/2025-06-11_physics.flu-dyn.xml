      <title>Nonlinear input-output analysis of transitional shear flows using small-signal finite-gain $\mathcal{L}_p$ stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Input-output analysis has been widely used to predict the transition to turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows, but it typically does not capture the full nonlinear effects involved. This work employs the Small-Signal Finite-Gain (SSFG) Lp stability theorem to assess nonlinear input-output amplification and demonstrates its applicability using a nine-mode shear flow model with a random body force. Our analysis employs Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) and Sum-of-Squares (SOS) as the primary tools to search for a quadratic Lyapunov function of an unforced nonlinear system certifying the SSFG Lp stability of a nonlinear input-output system. The predicted nonlinear input-output Lp gain (amplification) is consistent with numerical simulations; the Lp norm of the output from numerical simulations remains bounded by the theoretical prediction from the SSFG Lp stability theorem, with the gap between simulated and theoretical bounds narrowing as p approaches infinity. The input-output gain obtained from the nonlinear SSFG Lp stability theorem is higher than the linear Lp gain, which suggests that nonlinearity can significantly amplify small disturbances. The SSFG Lp stability theorem requires the input forcing to be smaller than a permissible forcing amplitude to maintain finite input-output gain, which is an inherently nonlinear behavior that cannot be predicted by linear input-output analysis. We also identify such permissible forcing amplitude using numerical simulations and bisection search, where below such forcing amplitude, the output norm at any time will be lower than a given threshold value. The permissible forcing amplitude identified from the SSFG Lp stability theorem is conservative but also consistent with that obtained by numerical simulations and bisection search.</description>

      <title>Large-eddy simulations of heat transfer from iced surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of ice accretion is important for the safe and efficient design of aircraft and wind turbine systems. Heat transfer predictions obtained from the fluid flow solvers are used as input in ice accretion codes. In glaze ice conditions, the freezing rates and resulting ice shapes are highly sensitive to the input values of the heat transfer coefficient. Hence, an accurate prediction of heat transfer on iced airfoils is crucial for correctly predicting the ice accretion process [1, 2]. In this study, we perform conjugate heat transfer (CHT) simulations using wall-modeled large eddy simulation (WMLES) over surfaces characterized by ice roughness. The results show that WMLES with CHT accurately captures surface temperature distributions and heat fluxes across a range of roughness geometries. For the cases considered, large roughness-to-boundary-layer thickness ratios disrupt outer-layer similarity, leading to substantial errors in estimating equivalent sandgrain roughness when applying traditional empirical models based on surface statistics. The simulations further show that local heat fluxes vary significantly across roughness elements due to the low thermal conductivity of the solid; in particular, roughness crests exhibit reduced fluxes in contrast to slopes and valleys. These effects are not captured in isothermal wall simulations, which overestimate the Stanton number, especially at roughness peaks. By enabling the calculation of Stanton number using heat flux distributions, not directly available in the experiments, the present simulations augment experimental results and highlight the importance of including solid conduction effects for accurately modeling heat transfer over rough, low-conductivity surfaces such as ice.</description>

      <title>Evidence on the incompatibility of modern SPH methods and eddy viscosity models for scale-resolved incompressible turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we will present evidence for the incompatibility of modern SPH methods and eddy viscosity models. Taking a coarse-graining perspective, we physically argue that modern SPH methods operate intrinsically as Lagrangian Large Eddy Simulations for turbulent flows with strongly overlapping discretization elements. However, these overlapping elements in combination with numerical errors cause a significant amount of implicit subfilter stresses (SFS). Considering a Taylor-Green flow at $\text{Re}=10^4$, the SFS will be shown to be relevant where turbulent fluctuations are created, explaining why turbulent flows are challenging even for modern SPH methods. Although one might hope to mitigate the implicit SFS using eddy viscosity models, we show a degradation of the turbulent transition process, which is rooted in the non-locality of these methods.</description>

      <title>FlowBERT: Prompt-tuned BERT for variable flow field prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a universal flow field prediction framework based on knowledge transfer
  from large language model (LLM), addressing the high computational costs of traditional
  computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods and the limited cross-condition transfer capability
  of existing deep learning models. The framework innovatively integrates Proper Orthogonal
  Decomposition (POD) dimensionality reduction with fine-tuning strategies for pretrained LLM,
  where POD facilitates compressed representation of flow field features while the fine-tuned model
  learns to encode system dynamics in state space. To enhance the model's adaptability to flow field
  data, we specifically designed fluid dynamics-oriented text templates that improve predictive
  performance through enriched contextual semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate
  that our framework outperforms conventional Transformer models in few-shot learning scenarios while
  exhibiting exceptional generalization across various inflow conditions and airfoil geometries.
  Ablation studies reveal the contributions of key components in the FlowBERT architecture. Compared
  to traditional Navier-Stokes equation solvers requiring hours of computation, our approach reduces
  prediction time to seconds while maintaining over 90% accuracy. The developed knowledge transfer
  paradigm establishes a new direction for rapid fluid dynamics prediction, with potential
  applications extending to aerodynamic optimization, flow control, and other engineering domains.</description>

      <title>The Riemann problem for three-phase foam flow in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gas injection in the context of the three-phase flow in porous media appears in applications such as Enhanced Oil Recovery, aquifer remediation, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). In general, this technique suffers from a difficulty related to excessive gas mobility, which can be circumvented by using foam. This study addresses the non-linear system of differential equations describing the three-phase foam flow based on Corey relative permeability functions. A major obstacle is an umbilic point, where the characteristic wave velocities for different families coincide, complicating the identification of stable wave structures.
  We developed a methodology to solve the Riemann problem describing the three-phase foam displacement in the case when the gas viscosity exceeds that of oil and water. To allow the analysis, we assume foam in local equilibrium (or maximum foam texture), resulting in a constant mobility reduction factor (MRF). These simplifications allowed the classification of possible solutions for the injection of foamed gas and water mixtures under a wide range of initial conditions within the framework of non-classical Conservation Law Theory. As a relevant industrial application of the proposed solution, we investigate the conditions resulting in oil bank formation. Besides improving the general physical understanding of foam flow in a porous medium, this analysis can be applied to calibrate numerical simulators and perform uncertainty quantification. Our analytical estimates were validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>The interplay of the parametric instability and MRI in oscillatory shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of warped disks is governed by internal, oscillatory shear flows driven by their distorted geometry. However, these flows are known to be vigorously unstable to a hydrodynamic parametric instability. In many warped systems this might coexist and compete with the magnetorotational instability. The interplay of these phenomena and their combined impact on the internal flows has not been studied. To this end we perform three-dimensional, magneto+hydrodynamic unstratified shearing box simulations with an oscillatory radial forcing function, to mimic the effects of a warped disk. In the hydrodynamic study we find that the parametric instability manifests as strong, vertical `elevator' flows which resist the sloshing motion. Above a critical forcing amplitude, these also emerge in our magnetized runs and dominate the vertical stress, although they are partially weakened by the MRI and hence the system equilibrates with larger radial sloshing flows. Below this critical forcing, the MRI effectively quenches the parametric instability. In all cases we find that the internal stresses are anisotropic in character and better described by a viscoelastic relationship with the shearing flows. Unfortunately, these important effects are typically unresolved in global simulations of warped disks and are simplified in analytically tractable models. The incorporation of such complex, warp-amplitude-dependent, viscoelastic stresses will sensitively regulate the laminar flow response, and inevitably modify the detailed spatio-temporal evolution of warped systems.</description>

      <title>Mixing and ventilation in a living laboratory due to fast and slow response modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and analyse observational data from a highly instrumented classroom computer laboratory and develop a multizone model to describe its mechanical ventilation and mixing regime. The laboratory houses 70 workstations that are used heterogeneously in time and space, in a manner similar to a generic office environment. Our model predicts CO2 concentration in the laboratory, accounting for air exchange between the occupied classroom and its ceiling plenum and by parametrising irreversible mixing in each zone. Applying the model to our measurements helps identify critical components in the ventilation network, as highlighted by a strong separation of the time scales characterising the flow response. On the one hand, this time scale separation leads to a simplified model describing the CO2 transport. On the other hand, it suggests that the forced exchange of volume between the room and the plenum is 'overdriven' in that reduced energy operation could be achieved without compromising air quality. More generally, our modelling approach offers a systematic method to enhance energy efficient ventilation of multi-zone systems.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Galerkin Reduced-Order Models for Turbulent Flows with Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galerkin-based reduced-order models (G-ROMs) offer efficient and accurate approximations for laminar flows but require hundreds to thousands of modes $N$ to capture the complex dynamics of turbulent flows. This makes standard G-ROMs computationally expensive due to the third-order advection tensor contraction, requiring the storage of $N^3$ entries and the computation of $2N^3$ operations per timestep. As a result, such ROMs are impractical for realistic applications like turbulent flow control. In this work, we consider problems that demand large $N$ values for accurate G-ROMs and propose a novel approach that accelerates G-ROMs by utilizing the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition to approximate the advection tensor as a sum of $R$ rank-1 tensors. We also leverage the partial skew-symmetry property of the advection tensor and derive two conditions for the CP decomposition to preserve this property. Moreover, we investigate the low-rank structure of the advection tensor using singular value decomposition (SVD) and compare the performance of G-ROMs accelerated by CP (CPD-ROM) and SVD (SVD-ROM). Demonstrated on problems from 2D periodic to 3D turbulent flows, the CPD-ROM achieves at least a $10$-fold speedup and a $16.7$-fold reduction in nonlinear term evaluation costs compared to the standard G-ROM. The skew-symmetry preserving CPD-ROM demonstrates improved stability in both the reproduction and predictive regimes, and enables the use of smaller rank $R$. Singular value analysis reveals a persistent low-rank structure in the $H^1_0$-based advection tensor, and CP decomposition achieves at least an order of magnitude higher compression ratio than SVD.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the hydrodynamic modulation of short surface waves by longer waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic modulation of short ocean surface waves by longer ambient waves significantly influences remote sensing, interpretation of in situ wave measurements, and numerical wave forecasting. This paper revisits the wave crest and action conservation laws and derives steady, nonlinear, analytical solutions for the change of short-wave wavenumber, action, and gravitational acceleration due to the presence of longer waves. We validate the analytical solutions with numerical simulations of the full crest and action conservation equations. The nonlinear analytical solutions of short-wave wavenumber, amplitude, and steepness modulation significantly deviate from the linear analytical solutions of Longuet-Higgins &amp; Stewart (1960), and are similar to the nonlinear numerical solutions by Longuet-Higgins (1987) and Zhang &amp; Melville (1990). The short-wave steepness modulation is attributed 5/8 to wavenumber, 1/4 due to wave action, and 1/8 due to effective gravity. Examining the homogeneity and stationarity requirements for the conservation of wave action reveals that stationarity is a stronger requirement and is generally not satisfied for very steep long waves. We examine the results of Peureux et al. (2021) who found through numerical simulations that the short-wave modulation grows unsteadily with each long-wave passage. We show that this unsteady growth only occurs for homogeneous initial conditions as a special case and not generally. The proposed steady solutions are a good approximation of the nonlinear crest-action conservation solutions in long-wave steepness $\lesssim$ 0.2. Except for a subset of initial conditions, the solutions to the non-linearised crest-action conservation equations are mostly steady in the reference frame of the long waves.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Circulation Control Jet Bi-Stability at Transonic Speeds via Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenon of a periodic jet detachment occurring on an elliptic airfoil utilizing circulation control at transonic speeds was evaluated using numerical simulations. As the momentum of the jet increases beyond a prescribed magnitude, the jet begins to detach periodically from the surface of the trailing-edge. The effect was analyzed by both URANS calculations as well as by data-driven methods such as the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). The results of the investigation showed that the effect, termed jet-buffet, is decoupled from the dominant shockwave located upstream, indicating that the jet can no longer augment the wing's circulation, and thus the termination of circulation control. Furthermore, it was found that the governing mechanism of the bi-stability originated from a feedback of pressure propagating between the trailing-edge shockwave and the downstream separation bubble produced by the jet, as well as a secondary feedback governing the pressure redistribution due to the detachment cycle. It was concluded that the bi-stability can not only be captured by URANS effectively but also approximated using a Reduced Order Model via 2% of the total modes, which encapsulate 25% of the modal influence as well as reconstructing the pressure field with 98% accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate thermal convection in a two-dimensional square box using the no-slip condition on all boundaries, and isothermal bottom and top walls and adiabatic sidewalls. We choose 0.1 and 1 for the Prandtl number $Pr$ and vary the Rayleigh number $Ra$ between $10^6$ and $10^{12}$. We particularly study the temporal evolution of integral transport quantities towards their steady states. Perhaps not surprisingly, the velocity field evolves more slowly than the thermal field, and its steady state -- which is nominal in the sense that large-amplitude low-frequency oscillations persist around plausible averages -- is reached exponentially. We study these oscillation characteristics. The transient time for the velocity field to achieve its nominal steady state increases almost linearly with the Reynolds number. For large $Ra$, the Reynolds number itself scales almost as $Ra^{2/3} Pr^{-1}$, and the Nusselt number as $Ra^{2/7}$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced oil recovery in reservoirs via diffusion-driven $\text{CO}_{2}$ flooding: Experimental insights and material balance modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\text{CO}_{2}$ flooding is central to carbon utilization technologies, yet conventional waterflooding models fail to capture the complex interactions between CO$_2$ and formation fluids. In this study, one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiments reveal that $\text{CO}_{2}$ markedly enhances crude oil mobility during miscible displacement via multiple synergistic mechanisms, yielding a recovery factor of $60.97\%$, which surpasses that of immiscible displacement (maximum $57.53\%$). Guided by these findings, we propose a convection-diffusion model that incorporates the diffusion coefficient ($D$) and porosity ($\phi$) as key parameters. This model captures the spatiotemporal evolution of the $\text{CO}_{2}$ front and addresses a key limitation of conventional formulations-the omission of diffusion effects. It improves predictions of gas breakthrough time and enables optimized injection design for low-permeability reservoirs. Extending classical material balance theory, we develop an enhanced $\text{CO}_{2}$ flooding equation that integrates critical transport phenomena. This formulation incorporates $\text{CO}_{2}$ diffusion, oil phase expansion, reservoir adsorption, and gas compressibility to describe the dynamic transport and mass compensation of injected $\text{CO}_{2}$. Validation through experimental and numerical data confirms the model's robustness and applicability under low-permeability conditions. The proposed framework overcomes limitations of physical experiments under extreme environments and offers theoretical insight into oil recovery enhancement and $\text{CO}_{2}$ injection strategy optimization.</description>
