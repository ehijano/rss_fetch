      <title>Quantitative Verification of Omega-regular Properties in Probabilistic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic programming provides a high-level framework for specifying statistical models as executable programs with built-in randomness and conditioning. Existing inference techniques, however, typically compute posterior distributions over program states at fixed time points, most often at termination, thereby failing to capture the temporal evolution of probabilistic behaviors. We introduce temporal posterior inference (TPI), a new framework that unifies probabilistic programming with temporal logic by computing posterior distributions over execution traces that satisfy omega-regular specifications, conditioned on possibly temporal observations. To obtain rigorous quantitative guarantees, we develop a new method for computing upper and lower bounds on the satisfaction probabilities of omega-regular properties. Our approach decomposes Rabin acceptance conditions into persistence and recurrence components and constructs stochastic barrier certificates that soundly bound each component. We implement our approach in a prototype tool, TPInfer, and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, demonstrating effective and efficient inference over rich temporal properties in probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>OGRe: An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Mathematica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.04193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present OGRe, a modern Mathematica package for tensor calculus, designed to be both powerful and user-friendly. The package can be used in a variety of contexts where tensor calculations are needed, in both mathematics and physics, but it is especially suitable for general relativity. By implementing an object-oriented design paradigm, OGRe allows calculating arbitrarily complicated tensor formulas easily, and automatically transforms between index configurations and coordinate systems behind the scenes as needed, eliminating user errors by making it impossible for the user to combine tensors in inconsistent ways. Other features include displaying tensors in various forms, automatic calculation of curvature tensors and geodesic equations, easy importing and exporting of tensors between sessions, optimized algorithms and parallelization for improved performance, and more.</description>

      <title>Error Detection and Constraint Recovery in Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification without Prior Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Hierarchical Multi-label Classification (HMC), particularly neurosymbolic-based approaches, have demonstrated improved consistency and accuracy by enforcing constraints on a neural model during training. However, such work assumes the existence of such constraints a-priori. In this paper, we relax this strong assumption and present an approach based on Error Detection Rules (EDR) that allow for learning explainable rules about the failure modes of machine learning models. We show that these rules are not only effective in detecting when a machine learning classifier has made an error but also can be leveraged as constraints for HMC, thereby allowing the recovery of explainable constraints even if they are not provided. We show that our approach is effective in detecting machine learning errors and recovering constraints, is noise tolerant, and can function as a source of knowledge for neurosymbolic models on multiple datasets, including a newly introduced military vehicle recognition dataset.</description>

      <title>OGRePy: An Object-Oriented General Relativity Package for Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: OGRePy is a modern, open-source Python package designed to perform symbolic tensor calculations, with a particular focus on applications in general relativity. Built on an object-oriented architecture, OGRePy encapsulates tensors, metrics, and coordinate systems as self-contained objects, automatically handling raising and lowering of indices, coordinate transformations, contractions, partial or covariant derivatives, and all tensor operations. By leveraging the capabilities of SymPy and Jupyter Notebook, OGRePy provides a robust, user-friendly environment that facilitates both research and teaching in general relativity and differential geometry. This Python package reproduces the functionality of the popular Mathematica package OGRe, while greatly improving upon it by making use of Python's native object-oriented syntax. In this paper, we describe OGRePy's design and implementation, and discuss its potential for reuse across research and education in mathematics and physics.</description>
