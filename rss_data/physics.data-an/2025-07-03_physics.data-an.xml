      <title>Functional Renormalization for Signal Detection: Dimensional Analysis and Dimensional Phase Transition for Nearly Continuous Spectra Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal detection is one of the main challenges of data science. According to the nature of the data, the presence of noise may corrupt measurements and hinder the discovery of significant patterns. A wide range of techniques aiming at extracting the relevant degrees of freedom from data has been thus developed over the years. However, signal detection in almost continuous spectra, for small signal-to-noise ratios, remains a known difficult issue. This paper develops over recent advancements proposing to tackle this issue by analysing the properties of the underlying effective field theory arising as a sort of maximal entropy distribution in the vicinity of universal random matrix distributions. Nearly continuous spectra provide an intrinsic and non-conventional scaling law for field and couplings, the scaling dimensions depending on the energy scale. The coarse-graining over small eigenvalues of the empirical spectrum defines a specific renormalization group, whose characteristics change when the collective behaviour of "informational" modes become significant, that is, stronger than the intrinsic fluctuations of noise. This paper pursues three different goals. First, we propose to quantify the real effects of fluctuations relative to what can be called "signal", while improving the robustness of the results obtained in our previous work. Second, we show that quantitative changes in the presence of a signal result in a counterintuitive modification of the distribution of eigenvectors. Finally, we propose a method for estimating the number of noise components and define a limit of detection in a general nearly continuous spectrum using the renormalization group. The main statements of this paper are essentially numeric, and their reproducibility can be checked using the associated code.</description>

      <title>Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH), a model for generating realistic time-varying hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-varying group interactions constitute the building blocks of many complex systems. The framework of temporal hypergraphs makes it possible to represent them by taking into account the higher-order and temporal nature of the interactions. However, the corresponding datasets are often incomplete and/or limited in size and duration, and surrogate time-varying hypergraphs able to reproduce their statistical features constitute interesting substitutions, especially to understand how dynamical processes unfold on group interactions. Here, we present a new temporal hypergraph model, the Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH), which can be fed by parameters measured in a dataset and create synthetic datasets with similar properties. In the model, each node has an independent underlying activity dynamic and the overall system activity emerges from the nodes dynamics, with temporal group interactions resulting from both the activity of the nodes and memory mechanisms. We first show that the EATH model can generate surrogate hypergraphs of several empirical datasets of face-to-face interactions, mimicking temporal and topological properties at the node and hyperedge level. We also showcase the possibility to use the resulting synthetic data in simulations of higher-order contagion dynamics, comparing the outcome of such process on original and surrogate datasets. Finally, we illustrate the flexibility of the model, which can generate synthetic hypergraphs with tunable properties: as an example, we generate "hybrid" temporal hypergraphs, which mix properties of different empirical datasets. Our work opens several perspectives, from the generation of synthetic realistic hypergraphs describing contexts where data collection is difficult to a deeper understanding of dynamical processes on temporal hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>LOMS.cz: A computational platform for high-throughput Classical and Combinatorial Judd-Ofelt analysis and rare-earth spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LOMS.cz (Luminescence, Optical and Magneto-optical Software), an open-source computational platform that addresses the long-standing challenge of standardizing Judd-Ofelt (JO) calculations in rare-earth spectroscopy. Despite JO theory's six-decade history as the fundamental framework for understanding $4f\leftrightarrow4f$ transitions, the field lacks standardized computational methodologies for precise and reproducible parameter determination. LOMS integrates three key innovations: (1) automated computation of JO parameters, transition probabilities, branching ratios, and theoretical radiative lifetimes, (2) a dynamically expanding database of experimentally validated parameters enabling direct comparison between computed and empirical results, and (3) a novel Combinatorial JO (C-JO) analysis algorithm that systematically identifies optimal absorption band combinations to ensure reliable parameter extraction. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate how this computational framework enables rapid screening of spectroscopic parameters, allowing researchers to predict optical properties with enhanced reliability. By combining automated analysis with experimental validation through its integrated database, LOMS.cz establishes a standardized platform for accelerating the discovery and optimization of rare-earth-based photonic and optoelectronic materials.</description>

      <title>Tunnelling Through Time Series: A Probabilistic Visibility Graph for Local and Global Pattern Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing availability of high-resolution, long-term time series data has highlighted the need for methods capable of capturing both local and global patterns. To address this, we introduce the Probabilistic Visibility Graph (PVG), a novel approach inspired by the quantum tunnelling phenomenon. The PVG extends the classical Visibility Graph (VG) by introducing probabilistic connections between time points that are obstructed in the VG due to intermediate values. We demonstrate the PVG's effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies through simulations of amplitude-modulated signals and analysis of electrocorticography (ECoG) data under rest and anesthesia conditions. Key results show that the PVG presents distinct network properties between rest and anesthesia, with rest exhibiting stronger small-worldness and scale-free behavior, reflecting a hub-dominated, centralized connectivity structure, compared to anesthesia. These findings highlight the PVG's potential for analyzing complex signals with interacting temporal scales, offering new insights into neural dynamics and other real-world phenomena.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Large Portfolio Optimization for Variance Minimization with Neural Networks through Covariance Cleaning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a rotation-invariant neural network that provides the global minimum-variance portfolio by jointly learning how to lag-transform historical returns and how to regularise both the eigenvalues and the marginal volatilities of large equity covariance matrices. This explicit mathematical mapping offers clear interpretability of each module's role, so the model cannot be regarded as a pure black-box. The architecture mirrors the analytical form of the global minimum-variance solution yet remains agnostic to dimension, so a single model can be calibrated on panels of a few hundred stocks and applied, without retraining, to one thousand US equities-a cross-sectional jump that demonstrates robust out-of-sample generalisation. The loss function is the future realized minimum portfolio variance and is optimized end-to-end on real daily returns. In out-of-sample tests from January 2000 to December 2024 the estimator delivers systematically lower realised volatility, smaller maximum drawdowns, and higher Sharpe ratios than the best analytical competitors, including state-of-the-art non-linear shrinkage. Furthermore, although the model is trained end-to-end to produce an unconstrained (long-short) minimum-variance portfolio, we show that its learned covariance representation can be used in general optimizers under long-only constraints with virtually no loss in its performance advantage over competing estimators. These gains persist when the strategy is executed under a highly realistic implementation framework that models market orders at the auctions, empirical slippage, exchange fees, and financing charges for leverage, and they remain stable during episodes of acute market stress.</description>

      <title>A new approach to handling factorial moment correlations through principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermittency analysis of factorial moments is a promising method used for the detection of power-law scaling in high-energy collision data. In particular, it has been employed in the search of fluctuations characteristic of the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter. However, intermittency analysis has been hindered by the fact that factorial moments measurements corresponding to different scales are correlated, since the same data are conventionally used to calculate them. This invalidates many assumptions involved in fitting data sets and determining the best fit values of power-law exponents. We present a novel approach to intermittency analysis, employing the well-established statistical and data science tool of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This technique allows for the proper handling of correlations between scales without the need for subdividing the data sets available.</description>

      <title>PhyLiNO: A Forward-Folding Likelihood-Fit Framework for Neutrino Oscillation Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for the analysis of data from neutrino oscillation experiments. The framework performs a profile likelihood fit and employs a forward-folding technique to optimize its model with respect to the oscillation parameters. It is capable of simultaneously handling multiple datasets from the same or different experiments and their correlations. The code of the framework is optimized for performance and allows for convergence times of a few seconds handling hundreds of fit parameters, thanks to multi-threading and usage of GPUs. The framework was developed in the context of the Double Chooz experiment, where it was successfully used to fit three- and four-flavor models to the data, as well as in the measurement of the energy spectrum of reactor neutrinos. We demonstrate its applicability to other experiments by applying it to a study of the oscillation analysis of a medium baseline reactor experiment similar to JUNO.</description>

      <title>Inherited or produced? Inferring protein production kinetics when protein counts are shaped by a cell's division history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring protein production kinetics for dividing cells is complicated due to protein inheritance from the mother cell. For instance, fluorescence measurements -- commonly used to assess gene activation -- may reflect not only newly produced proteins but also those inherited through successive cell divisions. In such cases, observed protein levels in any given cell are shaped by its division history. As a case study, we examine activation of the glc3 gene in yeast involved in glycogen synthesis and expressed under nutrient-limiting conditions. We monitor this activity using snapshot fluorescence measurements via flow cytometry, where GFP expression reflects glc3 promoter activity. A na\"ive analysis of flow cytometry data ignoring cell division suggests many cells are active with low expression. Explicitly accounting for the (non-Markovian) effects of cell division and protein inheritance makes it impossible to write down a tractable likelihood -- a key ingredient in physics-inspired inference, defining the probability of observing data given a model. The dependence on a cell's division history breaks the assumptions of standard (Markovian) master equations, rendering traditional likelihood-based approaches inapplicable. Instead, we adapt conditional normalizing flows (a class of neural network models designed to learn probability distributions) to approximate otherwise intractable likelihoods from simulated data. In doing so, we find that glc3 is mostly inactive under stress, showing that while cells occasionally activate the gene, expression is brief and transient.</description>
