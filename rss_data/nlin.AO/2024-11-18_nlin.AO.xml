      <title>Phase and gain stability for adaptive dynamical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In adaptive dynamical networks, the dynamics of the nodes and the edges influence each other. We show that we can treat such systems as a closed feedback loop between edge and node dynamics. Using recent advances on the stability of feedback systems from control theory, we derive local, sufficient conditions for steady states of such systems to be linearly stable. These conditions are local in the sense that they are written entirely in terms of the (linearized) behavior of the edges and nodes. We apply these conditions to the Kuramoto model with inertia written in adaptive form, and the adaptive Kuramoto model. For the former we recover a classic result, for the latter we show that our sufficient conditions match necessary conditions where the latter are available, thus completely settling the question of linear stability in this setting. The method we introduce can be readily applied to a vast class of systems. It enables straightforward evaluation of stability in highly heterogeneous systems.</description>

      <title>Self-Propelled Agents and Group Social Force</title>

Abstract: Brownian motion have long been studied on a diversity of fields, not only in physics of statistical mechanics, but also in biological models, finance and economic process, and social systems. In the past twenty years, there has been a growing interest in studying the model in self-propelled feature and interaction force such that the model also fits into study of social phenomenon of many individuals. This article will continue with this research trend and especially investigate the model in paradigms for a quantitative description of social and economic process. We mainly discuss a class of collective decision process of Brownian agent/particles, where the stochastic process does not exist in the fluctuation in the traditional Brownian motion, but in selection among several discrete choices. Their decisions interacts with each other in a given social topology. To simply our discussion the binary choice problem is particularly discussed where each agent only takes an alternative of two choices. Mathematically, we introduce a set of arrays to describe social relationship of agents in a quantitative manner, and the arrays deduce the group social force and opinion dynamics, which are useful to study complex social movement and self-organization phenomena including discrete-choice activities, social groups and de-individualization effect. Such agent-based simulation symbolizes a variety of collective activities in human society, especially in the field of economics and social science.</description>

      <title>The central role of metabolism in vascular morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.04657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As nutrients travel through microcirculation and are absorbed, their availability continuously decreases. However, a uniform nutrient distribution is critical, as it prevents tissue death in poorly supplied areas. How, then, do vascular networks achieve equi-perfusion? Given the extensive number of vessels in animal vascular systems, the structure of smaller vessels cannot be fully genetically predetermined and thus relies on a self-organizing developmental mechanism. We propose a simple, optimization-based adaptation rule to control vessel radii, aiming to equalize perfusion while minimizing flow resistance and material cost. This adaptation balances three competing factors: perfusion efficiency, energy dissipation, and material expenditure, which together drive complex network morphologies. These morphologies range from hierarchical architectures optimized for minimal resistance and material cost to dense networks that achieve efficient perfusion. Notably, metabolic demand is the primary factor modulating the transition between these contrasting structures. By applying our adaptation rule to networks in the rat mesentery and comparing the resulting optimal perfusion architectures with the experimental data, we can estimate the biologically relevant parameters, such as the oxygen absorption rate, for which the optimization and experimental networks align the most. Surprisingly, the optimal absorption rate we derive matches independent in vivo measurements. This suggests that reduced-order models like ours can provide valuable insights into the development and function of real vascular networks.</description>

      <title>An "Opinion Reproduction Number" for Infodemics in a Bounded-Confidence Content-Spreading Process on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spreading dynamics of content on networks. To do this, we use a model in which content spreads through a bounded-confidence mechanism. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, the agents of a network have continuous-valued opinions, which they adjust when they interact with agents whose opinions are sufficiently close to theirs. The employed content-spreading model introduces a twist into BCMs by using bounded confidence for the content spread itself. We define an analogue of the basic reproduction number from disease dynamics that we call an \emph{opinion reproduction number}. A critical value of the opinion reproduction number indicates whether or not there is an ``infodemic'' (i.e., a large content-spreading cascade) of content that reflects a particular opinion. By determining this critical value, one can determine whether or not an opinion dies off or propagates widely as a cascade in a population of agents. Using configuration-model networks, we quantify the size and shape of content dissemination by calculating a variety of summary statistics, and we illustrate how network structure and spreading-model parameters affect these statistics. We find that content spreads most widely when the agents have a large expected mean degree or a large receptiveness to content. When the spreading process slightly exceeds the infodemic threshold, there can be longer dissemination trees than when the expected mean degree or receptiveness are larger, even though the total number of content shares is smaller.</description>
