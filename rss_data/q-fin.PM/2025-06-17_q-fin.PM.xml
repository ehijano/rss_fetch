      <title>Introducing the PIT-plot -- a new tool in the portfolio manager's toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Project portfolio management is an essential process for organizations aiming to optimize the value of their R&amp;D investments. In this article, we introduce a new tool designed to support the prioritization of projects within project portfolio management. We label this tool the PIT-plot, an acronym for Project Impact Tornado plot, with reference to the similarity to the Tornado plot often used for sensitivity analyses. Many traditional practices in portfolio management focus on the properties of the projects available to the portfolio. We are with the PIT-plot changing the perspective and focus not on the properties of the projects themselves, but on the impact that the projects may have on the portfolio. This enables the strategic portfolio management to identify and focus on the projects of largest impact to the portfolio, either for the purpose of risk mitigation or for the purpose of value-adding efforts.</description>

      <title>Dynamic allocation: extremes, tail dependence, and regime Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By capturing outliers, volatility clustering, and tail dependence in the asset return distribution, we build a sophisticated model to predict the downside risk of the global financial market. We further develop a dynamic regime switching model that can forecast real-time risk regime of the market. Our GARCH-DCC-Copula risk model can significantly improve both risk- and alpha-based global tactical asset allocation strategies. Our risk regime has strong predictive power of quantitative equity factor performance, which can help equity investors to build better factor models and asset allocation managers to construct more efficient risk premia portfolios.</description>

      <title>Multi-period Mean-Buffered Probability of Exceedance in Defined Contribution Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate multi-period mean-risk portfolio optimization for long-horizon Defined Contribution plans, focusing on buffered Probability of Exceedance (bPoE), a more intuitive, dollar-based alternative to Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). We formulate both pre-commitment and time-consistent Mean-bPoE and Mean-CVaR portfolio optimization problems under realistic investment constraints (e.g., no leverage, no short selling) and jump-diffusion dynamics. These formulations are naturally framed as bilevel optimization problems, with an outer search over the shortfall threshold and an inner optimization over rebalancing decisions. We establish an equivalence between the pre-commitment formulations through a one-to-one correspondence of their scalarization optimal sets, while showing that no such equivalence holds in the time-consistent setting. We develop provably convergent numerical schemes for the value functions associated with both pre-commitment and time-consistent formulations of these mean-risk control problems.
  Using nearly a century of market data, we find that time-consistent Mean-bPoE strategies closely resemble their pre-commitment counterparts. In particular, they maintain alignment with investors' preferences for a minimum acceptable terminal wealth level-unlike time-consistent Mean-CVaR, which often leads to counterintuitive control behavior. We further show that bPoE, as a strictly tail-oriented measure, prioritizes guarding against catastrophic shortfalls while allowing meaningful upside exposure, making it especially appealing for long-horizon wealth security. These findings highlight bPoE's practical advantages for Defined Contribution investment planning.</description>
