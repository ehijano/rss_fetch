      <title>Deterministic fabrication of graphene hexagonal boron nitride moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic properties of moir\'e heterostructures depend sensitively on the relative orientation between layers of the stack. For example, near-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) commonly shows superconductivity, yet a TBG sample with one of the graphene layers rotationally aligned to a hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) cladding layer provided the first experimental observation of orbital ferromagnetism. To create samples with aligned graphene/hBN, researchers often align edges of exfoliated flakes that appear straight in optical micrographs. However, graphene or hBN can cleave along either zig-zag or armchair lattice directions, introducing a 30 degree ambiguity in the relative orientation of two flakes. By characterizing the crystal lattice orientation of exfoliated flakes prior to stacking using Raman and second-harmonic generation for graphene and hBN, respectively, we unambiguously align monolayer graphene to hBN at a near-0 degree, not 30 degree, relative twist angle. We confirm this alignment by torsional force microscopy (TFM) of the graphene/hBN moir\'e on an open-face stack, and then by cryogenic transport measurements, after full encapsulation with a second, non-aligned hBN layer. This work demonstrates a key step toward systematically exploring the effects of the relative twist angle between dissimilar materials within moir\'e heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Spin-to-Charge Current Conversion Mechanism and Charge Transfer Dynamics at Interface of Graphene/WS$_2$ Heterostructures at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report experimental investigations of spin-to-charge current conversion and charge transfer dynamics (CT) at the interface of graphene/WS$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure. Pure spin current was produced by the spin precession in the microwave-driven ferromagnetic resonance of a permalloy film (Py-Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$) and injected into the graphene/WS$_2$ heterostructure through the spin pumping process. The observed spin-to-charge current conversion in the heterostructure is attributed to inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect (IREE) at the graphene/WS$_2$ interface. Interfacial CT dynamics in this heterostructure was investigated based on the framework of core-hole-clock (CHC) approach. The results obtained from spin pumping and CHC studies show that the spin-to-charge current conversion and charge transfer process are more efficient in the graphene/WS$_2$ heterostructure compared to isolated WS2 and graphene films. The results show that the presence of WS$_2$ flakes improves the current conversion efficiency. These experimental results are corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal (i) Rashba spin-orbit splitting of graphene orbitals and (ii) electronic coupling between graphene and WS$_2$ orbitals. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing the design and performance of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Chiral magnon-polaron edge states in Heisenberg-Kitaev magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of spin and lattice fluctuations in two-dimensional magnets without inversion symmetry is investigated. We find a general form for the magnetoelastic coupling between magnons and existing chiral phonons based on the symmetries of the crystalline lattice. We show that in hexagonal lattices, the coupling of magnons and chiral phonons derives from an anisotropic exchange spin model containing topological phases of magnons. Using the Heisenberg-Kitaev-$\Gamma$ model, we show how magnon-polaron edge states with circular polarization arise from this interaction. Our findings exploit the polarization degrees of freedom in spin-lattice systems, thus setting the ground for the transfer of angular momentum between chiral phonons and magnons.</description>

      <title>Light-induced topological phase transition with tunable layer Hall effect in axion antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intricate interplay between light and matter provides effective tools for manipulating topological phenomena. Here, we theoretically propose and computationally show that circularly polarized light hold the potential to transform the axion insulating phase into quantum anomalous Hall state in MnBi2Te4 thin films, featuring tunable Chern numbers (ranging up to 2). In particular, we reveal the spatial rearrangement of the hidden layer-resolved anomalous Hall effect under light driven Floquet-engineering. Notably, upon Bi2Te3 layer intercalation, the anomalous Hall conductance predominantly localizes in the nonmagnetic Bi2Te3 layers that hold zero Berry curvature in the intact state, suggesting significant magnetic proximity effect. Additionally, we estimate variations in the magneto-optical Kerr effect, giving a contactless method for detecting topological transitions. Our work not only presents a strategy to investigate emergent topological phases, but also sheds light on the possible applications of the layer Hall effect in topological antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>DFT+U+V Study of Magnetic Ordering in Single-Layer Pentahexoctite: Implications for Magnetic Device Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the electronic and magnetic properties of single-layer pentahexoctite, a two-dimensional carbon allotrope patterned by pentagons, hexagons, and octagons. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations incorporating on-site and intersite Coulomb interactions, we find that type-II Dirac Fermions are formed by a nearly flat band intersecting with a dispersive band at the Fermi level. We further examine the physical origin of nearly flat bands of pentahexoctite. Constructing ab initio tight-binding Hamiltonian based on Wannier functions, we reveal that nearly flat bands of pentahexoctite originate from quantum-mechanical destructive interference. Remarkably, our DFT calculations including extended Hubbard interactions show that hole doping induces a ferrimagnetic phase transition driven by the enhanced density of states in the nearly flat band. This finding highlights that monolayer pentahexoctite is a promising candidate for pristine all-carbon magnetic materials to serve as a platform for future magnetic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of nonreciprocal diffraction of surface acoustic wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rectification phenomenon caused by the simultaneous breaking of time reversal and spatial inversion symmetries has been extended to a wide range of (quasi)particles and waves; however, the nonreciprocal diffraction, which is the imbalance of upward and downward deflections, was previously observed only for photons and remained to be extended to other (quasi)particles. In this study, we present evidence of the nonreciprocal diffraction of surface acoustic wave (SAW) utilizing a magnetoelastic grating on a SAW device. Asymmetric diffraction intensities were observed when the ferromagnetic resonance was acoustically excited. Based on a theoretical model, we attribute the microscopic origin of this phenomenon to the resonant scattering involving ferromagnetic resonance excitations. The novel property may pave an avenue to further development of SAW devices for various purposes, including microwave communications and quantum engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Exact results, transient generalized Gibbs ensembles, and analytic approximations for spacetime propagators of massive, real scalar fields in one spatial dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive, real scalar field described by the Klein-Gordon equation in one spatial dimension is the most elementary example of a bosonic quantum field theory, and has been investigated for many decades either as a simple academic theory or as a realistic emergent many-body theory in low-dimensional systems. Despite this, the space and time behavior of its propagators have rarely been in the foreground, and although exact results are known, there remain gaps in the description and a lack of an in-depth physical analysis. The aim of this paper is to address the deficits by providing a comprehensive discussion of the results, and to show that this old theory still allows for several new results and insights. To start, known results are rederived in full detail, with an added discussion on how exactly space and time variables need to be extended to complex values to ensure analyticity throughout spacetime. This procedure shows also how singularities on the lightcone need to be regularized to remain compatible with the analyticity and the physical limit of a vanishing mass. An extension to nonzero temperatures is provided by considering the contact of the field to a nonrelativistic thermal reservoir, such as is necessary for emerging field theories in condensed matter systems. Subsequently, it is shown that the transient, short spacetime propagation can be understood in the context of the modern development of a generalized Gibbs ensemble, which describes a massless theory with an effective temperature that is set by the Klein-Gordon mass and the physical temperature. Finally, an approximation scheme is presented that captures the non-trivial mass dependence of the propagators throughout all spacetime but involves only elementary functions.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian theory of valley excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-hole exchange interaction in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is extremely strong due to the dimension reduction, which promises valley-superposed excitonic states with linearly polarized optical emissions. However, strong circular polarization reflecting valley-polarized excitonic states is commonly observed in helicity-resolved optical experiments. Here we present a non-Hermitian theory of valley excitons by incorporating optical pumping and intrinsic decay, which unveils an anomalous valley-polarized excitonic state with elliptically polarized optical emission. This novel state arises from the non-Hermiticity induced parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetry breaking, which impedes the experimental observation of intervalley excitonic coherence effect. At large excitonic center-of-mass momenta, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is restored and the excitonic states recover their valley coherence. Interestingly, the linear polarization directions in optical emissions from these valley-superposed excitonic states are non-orthogonal and even become parallel at exceptional points. Our non-Hermitian theory also predicts a non-zero Berry curvature for valley excitons, which admits a topological excitonic Hall transport beyond the Hermitian predictions.</description>

      <title>Identification of defects and the origins of surface noise on hydrogen-terminated (100) diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-surface nitrogen-vacancy centres are critical to many diamond-based quantum technologies such as information processors and nanosensors. Surface defects play an important role in the design and performance of these devices. The targeted creation of defects is central to proposed bottom-up approaches to nanofabrication of quantum diamond processors, and uncontrolled surface defects may generate noise and charge trapping which degrade shallow NV device performance. Surface preparation protocols may be able to control the production of desired defects and eliminate unwanted defects, but only if their atomic structure can first be conclusively identified. This work uses a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) imaging and first-principles simulations to identify several surface defects on H:C(100)-2x1 surfaces prepared using chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The atomic structure of these defects is elucidated, from which the microscopic origins of magnetic noise and charge trapping is determined based on modelling of their paramagnetic properties and acceptor states. Rudimentary control of these deleterious properties is demonstrated through STM tip-induced manipulation of the defect structure. Furthermore, the results validate accepted models for CVD diamond growth by identifying key adsorbates responsible for nucleation of new layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a technique for integrating ultraclean carbon nanotubes into superconducting circuits, aiming to realize Josephson junctions based on one-dimensional elementary quantum conductors. This technique primarily involves depositing the nanotube in the final step, thus preserving it from the inherent contaminations of nanofabrication and maintaining contact solely with superconducting electrodes and a crystalline hBN substrate. Through transport measurements performed in both the normal and superconducting states, we demonstrate that our method yields high-quality junctions with Josephson energies suitable for quantum device applications, such as carbon nanotube-based superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Photonic bilayer Chern insulator with corner states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic Chern insulators can be implemented in gyromagnetic photonic crystals with broken time-reversal (TR) symmetry. They exhibit gapless chiral edge states (CESs), enabling unidirectional propagation and demonstrating exceptional resilience to localization even in the presence of defects or disorders. However, when two Chern insulators with opposite Chern numbers are stacked together, this one-way nature can be nullified, causing the originally gapless CESs to become gapped. Recent theoretical works have proposed achieving such a topological phase transition in condensed matter systems using antiferromagnetic thin films such as MnBi2Te4 or by coupling two quantum spin/anomalous Hall insulators, but these approaches have yet to be realized experimentally. In a bilayer gyromagnetic photonic crystal arranged in an antiferromagnetic layer configuration, our experimental observations reveal that interlayer coupling initiates a transition from a Chern insulating phase to a higher-order topological phase. This transition results in the gapping of CESs and triggers the emergence of corner states within the bandgap. The corner mode energy within the gap can be attributed to CESs interaction, forming a Jackiw-Rebbi topological domain wall mode at the corner. These states exhibit heightened resilience against defects, setting them apart from their time-reversal symmetric counterparts.</description>

      <title>Genuine topological Anderson insulator from impurity induced chirality reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a model of Dirac fermions with Haldane type mass impurities which open a global topological gap even in the dilute limit. Surprisingly, we find that the chirality of this mass term, i.e., the sign of the Chern number, can be reversed by tuning the magnitude of the single-impurity scattering. Consequently, the disorder induces a phase disconnected from the clean topological phase, i.e., a genuine topological Anderson insulator. In seeming contradiction to the expectation that mass disorder is an irrelevant perturbation to the clean integer quantum Hall transition, the tri-critical point separating these two Chern insulating phases and a thermal metal phase is located at zero impurity density and connected to the appearance of a zero energy bound state in the continuum corresponding to a divergent Haldane mass impurity. Our conclusions based on the T-matrix expansion are substantiated by large scale Chebyshev-Polynomial-Green-Function numerics. We discuss possible experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the microscopic origins of topology in twisted molybdenum ditelluride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In moir\'e materials with flat electronic bands and suitable quantum geometry, strong correlations can give rise to novel topological states of matter. The nontrivial band topology of twisted molybdenum ditelluride (tMoTe$_2$) -- responsible for its fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states -- is predicted to arise from a layer-pseudospin skyrmion lattice. Tracing the layer polarization of wavefunctions within the moir\'e unit cell can thus offer crucial insights into the band topology. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) to probe the layer-pseudospin skyrmion textures of tMoTe$_2$. We do this by simultaneously visualizing the moir\'e lattice structure and the spatial localization of its electronic states. We find that the wavefunctions associated with the topological flat bands exhibit a spatially-dependent layer polarization within the moir\'e unit cell. This is in excellent agreement with our theoretical modeling, thereby revealing a direct microscopic connection between the structural properties of tMoTe$_2$ and its band topology. Our work enables new pathways for engineering FQAH states with strain, as well as future STM studies of the intertwined correlated and topological states arising in gate-tunable devices.</description>

      <title>Strong Chirality Suppression in 1-D correlated Weyl Semimetal (TaSe4)2I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of light with correlated Weyl semimetals (WSMs) provides a unique platform for exploring non-equilibrium phases and fundamental properties such as chirality. Here, we investigate the structural chirality of (TaSe4)2I, a correlated WSM, under weak optical pumping using Circular Photogalvanic Effect (CPGE) measurements and Raman spectroscopy. Surprisingly, we find that there is a loss of chirality in (TaSe4)2I above a threshold light intensity. We suggest that the loss of chirality is due to an optically driven phase transition into an achiral structure distinct from the ground state. This structural transformation is supported by fluence-dependent Raman spectra, revealing a new peak at low pump fluences that disappears above the threshold fluence. The loss of chirality even at low optical powers suggests that the system quickly transitions into a non WSM phase, and also highlights the importance of considering light-induced structural interactions in understanding the behavior of correlated systems. These studies showcase that even low excitation powers can be used to control the properties of correlated topological systems, opening up new avenues for low power optical devices.</description>

      <title>Shot noise in a metal close to Mott transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SrIrO$_3$ is a metallic complex oxide with unusual electronic and magnetic properties believed to originate from electron correlations due to its proximity to Mott metal-insulator transition. However, the nature of its electronic state and the mechanism of metallic conduction remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that shot noise produced by nanoscale SrIrO$_3$ junctions is strongly suppressed, inconsistent with diffusive quasiparticle transport. Analysis of thermal effects and scaling with the junction length reveals that conduction is mediated by collective hopping of electrons almost localized by correlations. Our results provide insight into the non-Fermi liquid state close to Mott transition, and advance shot noise measurements as a powerful technique for the studies of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>2D hydrodynamic simulation of TeraFETs beyond the gradual-channel approximation for transient, large-signal or ultrahigh-frequency simulations</title>

Abstract: In the past decade, detection of THz radiation by plasma-wave-assisted frequency mixing in antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) -- implemented in various semiconductor material systems (Si CMOS, GaN/AlGaN, GaAs/AlGaAs, graphene, etc.) -- has matured and led to a practically applied detector technology. This has been supported by the development of powerful device simulation tools which take into account relevant collective carrier dynamics and mixing processes in various approximations. These tools mostly model carrier transport in 1D and they are usually geared towards continuous-wave illumination of the device and small-signal response. Depending on their implementation, it may not be possible readily to simulate large-signal and pulsed operation. Another approximation which may lead to unsatisfactory results is the 1D restriction to calculate only the longitudinal electric field components. Especially at the edges of the gate electrode, solving of the 2D Poisson equation promises better results. This contribution introduces a stable way to solve the 2D Poisson equation self-consistently with the hydrodynamic transport equations including the numerically challenging convection term. We employ a well-balanced approximate Harten-Lax-van-Leer-Contact Riemann solver. The approach is well suited for a future treatment of transient and large-signal cases as well as the Dyakonov-Shur instability. The 2D treatment also generically extends the model beyond the gradual-channel approximation and allows to calculate the FET's response at high THz frequencies where the gate-to-channel potential acquires a non-local character. Model calculations are performed for the exemplary case of a 65-nm Si CMOS TeraFET in the isothermal approximation.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Control of Molecular Charge State in a Single-Component 2D Organic Nanoarray</title>

Abstract: Quantum dots (QD) with electric-field-controlled charge state are promising for electronics applications, e.g., digital information storage, single-electron transistors and quantum computing. Inorganic QDs consisting of semiconductor nanostructures or heterostructures often offer limited control on size and composition distribution, as well as low potential for scalability and/or nanoscale miniaturization. Owing to their tunability and self-assembly capability, using organic molecules as building nano-units can allow for bottom-up synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) nanoarrays of QDs. However, 2D molecular self-assembly protocols are often applicable on metals surfaces, where electronic hybridization and Fermi level pinning can hinder electric-field control of the QD charge state. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of a single-component self-assembled 2D array of molecules [9, 10-dicyanoanthracene (DCA)] that exhibit electric-field-controlled spatially periodic charging on a noble metal surface, Ag(111). The charge state of DCA can be altered (between neutral and negative), depending on its adsorption site, by the local electric field induced by a scanning tunneling microscope tip. Limited metal-molecule interactions result in an effective tunneling barrier between DCA and Ag(111) that enables electric-field-induced electron population of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and hence charging of the molecule. Subtle site-dependent variation of the molecular adsorption height translates into a significant spatial modulation of the molecular polarizability, dielectric constant and LUMO energy level alignment, giving rise to a spatially dependent effective molecule-surface tunneling barrier and likelihood of charging. This work offers potential for high-density 2D self-assembled nanoarrays of identical QDs whose charge states can be addressed individually with an electric field.</description>

      <title>Predicting Many Properties of Crystals by a Single Deep Learning Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning methods for predicting the properties of crystalline materials encounters significant challenges, primarily related to input encoding, output versatility, and interpretability. Here, we introduce CrystalBERT, an adaptable transformer-based framework with novel structure that integrates space group, elemental, and unit cell information. The method's adaptability lies not only in its ability to seamlessly combine diverse features but also in its capability to accurately predict a wide range of physically important properties, including topological properties, superconducting transition temperatures, dielectric constants, and more. CrystalBERT also provides insightful physical interpretations regarding the features that most significantly influence the target properties. Our findings indicate that space group and elemental information are more important for predicting topological and superconducting properties, in contrast to some properties that primarily depend on the unit cell information. This underscores the intricate nature of topological and superconducting properties. By incorporating all these features, we achieve a high accuracy of 91% in topological classification, surpassing prior studies and identifying previously misclassified topological materials, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our model.</description>

      <title>Cephalo: Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models for Bio-Inspired Materials Analysis and Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Cephalo, a series of multimodal vision large language models (V-LLMs) designed for materials science applications, integrating visual and linguistic data for enhanced understanding and interaction within human-AI and multi-agent AI frameworks. A key innovation of Cephalo is its advanced dataset generation method, which employs a sophisticated algorithm to accurately detect and separate images and their corresponding textual descriptions from PDF documents, such as scientific papers. The method includes a careful refinement of image-text pairs through integrated vision and language processing, ensuring high-quality, contextually relevant, and well reasoned training data. Cephalo is trained on integrated image and text data extracted from thousands of scientific papers and science-focused Wikipedia pages demonstrates can interpret complex visual scenes, generate precise language descriptions, and answer queries about images effectively. The combination of a vision encoder with an autoregressive transformer supports complex natural language understanding in an integrated model, which can be coupled with other generative methods to create an image-to-text-to-image or image-to-text-to-3D pipeline. To explore the development of larger models from smaller ones, we merge sets of layers that originate from different pre-trained source models. This hybrid approach allows us to leverage the domain-specific expertise and general conversational capabilities to harness the strengths of multiple models. We examine the models in diverse use cases that incorporate biological materials, fracture and engineering analysis, protein biophysics, and bio-inspired design based on insect behavior. Generative applications include bio-inspired designs, including pollen-inspired architected materials, as well as the synthesis of bio-inspired material microstructures from a photograph of a solar eclipse.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking topological insulator-based photodetector: Photo-induced excess noise and role of barrier height inhomogeneity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) with symmetry-protected surface states, offer exciting opportunities for next-generation photonic and optoelectronic device applications. The heterojunctions of TIs and semiconductors (e.g. Si, Ge) have been observed to excellent photo-responsive characteristics. However, the realization of high-frequency operations in these heterojunctions can be hindered by unwanted 1/f (or Flicker) noise and phase noise. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of 1/f noise figures becomes paramount for the effective utilization of such materials.Here we report optoelectronic response and 1/f noise characteristics of a p-n diode fabricated using topological insulator, Bi2Se3 and silicon for potential photo-detector. Through meticulous temperature-dependent current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements, we ascertain crucial parameters like barrier height, ideality factor, and reverse saturation current of the photodetector. The low-frequency 1/f conductance noise spectra suggest a significant presence of trap states influencing the optoelectronic transport properties. The forward noise characteristics exhibit typical 1/f features, having a uni-slope across four decades of frequency, suggesting a homogeneous distribution of barrier height. The spectral and photocurrent-dependent responses show the power law behavior of noise level on photon flux. The hybrid heterojunction demonstrates excellent photo-response and reasonably low noise level, promising signatures for the room-temperature visible photodetector applications.</description>

Abstract: Spatial structuring of materials at subwavelength scales underlies the concept of metamaterials possessing exotic properties beyond those of the constituent media. Temporal modulation of material parameters enables further functionalities. Here, we show that high-frequency oscillations of spatially uniform magnetization generate an effective dynamic axion field embedding the amplitude and phase of magnetization oscillations. This allows one to map ultrafast magnetization dynamics using a probe signal with much lower frequency.</description>

      <title>ACE: A general-purpose non-Markovian open quantum systems simulation toolkit based on process tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a general-purpose computational toolkit for simulating open quantum systems, which provides numerically exact solutions for composites of zero-dimensional quantum systems that may be strongly coupled to multiple, quite general non-Markovian environments. It is based on process tensor matrix product operators (PT-MPOs), which efficiently encapsulate environment influences. The code features implementations of several PT-MPO algorithms, in particular, Automated Compression of Environments (ACE) for general environments comprised of independent modes as well as schemes for generalized spin boson models. The latter includes a divide-and-conquer scheme for periodic PT-MPOs, which enable million time step simulations for realistic models. PT-MPOs can be precalculated and reused for efficiently probing different time-dependent system Hamiltonians. They can also be stacked together and combined to provide numerically complete solutions of small networks of open quantum systems. The code is written in C++ and is fully controllable by configuration files, for which we have developed a versatile and compact human-readable format.</description>

      <title>Engineering complete delocalization of single particle states in a class of one dimensional aperiodic lattices: a quantum dynamical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum dynamics of a wave packet on a class of one dimensional decorated aperiodic lattices, described within a tight binding formalism. We look for the possibility of finding extended single particle states even in the absence of any translational periodicity. The chosen lattices are stubbed with one or more atoms, tunnel coupled to the backbone, thereby introducing a minimal quasi-one dimensionality. It is seen that, for a group of such lattices a certain correlation between the numerical values of the hopping amplitudes leads to a complete delocalization of single particle states. In some other cases, a special value of a magnetic flux trapped in the loops present in the geometries delocalize the states, leading to a flux driven insulator to metal transition. The mean square displacement, temporal autocorrelation function, the time dependence of the inverse participation ratio, or the information entropy - the so-called hallmarks of studying localization based on dynamics - all of them indicate such a complete turnover in the nature of the single particle states and the character of the energy spectrum under suitable conditions. The results shown in this work using quasiperiodic lattices of the Fibonacci family are much more general and hold good even for a randomly disordered arrangement of the building blocks of the systems considered, and indicate a subtle universality class under which these lattices can be grouped.</description>

      <title>Tunneling-like wave transmission in non-Hermitian lattices with mirrored nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a peculiar tunneling phenomenon that occurs in lattices with nonreciprocal inter-site couplings. The nonreciprocity holds for an inner portion of the lattice, constituting a non-Hermitian interface between outer Hermitian sections. The couplings are mirrored about the interface center, with the smaller strength directed outwards. As a standalone system that was widely studied in recent years, each section of the interface supports the non-Hermitian skin effect, in which modes are accumulated at the boundary of the weaker coupling. Here, we investigate what happens to a wave that propagates along the lattice and hits the interface. The skin mode accumulation, which effectively constitutes a barrier, forbids wave penetration into the interface, but surprisingly, under certain conditions the wave is transmitted to the other side, keeping the interface dark, as if the wave invisibly tunneled through it. Remarkably, the tunneling is independent of the interface length. We derive the phenomenon both for quantum and classical systems, and realize it experimentally in an active topoelectric metamaterial. Our study fosters the research of wave tunneling through other types of non-Hermitian interfaces, which may also include nonlinearities, time-dependence and more.</description>

      <title>Anyonic statistics and slow quasiparticle dynamics in a graphene fractional quantum Hall interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anyons are two dimensional particles with fractional exchange statistics that emerge as elementary excitations of fractional quantum Hall phases. Experimentally, anyonic statistics manifest directly in the edge-state Fabry-P\'erot interferometer geometry, where the presence of $N_{qp}$ localized anyons in the interferometer bulk contributes a phase $N_{qp} \theta_a$ to the observed interference pattern, where $\theta_a$ is twice the statistical exchange phase. Here, we report a measurement of $\theta_a$ in a monolayer graphene Fabry-P\'erot interferometer at $\nu$ = 1/3. We find a preponderance of phase slips with magnitudes $\Delta \theta \approx 2 \pi / 3$, confirming the result of past experiments in GaAs quantum wells and consistent with expectations for the tunneling of Abelian anyons into the interferometer bulk. In contrast to prior work, however, single anyon tunneling events manifest as instantaneous and irreversible phase slips, indicative of quasiparticle equilibration times exceeding 20 minutes in some cases. We use the discrepancy between the quasiparticle equilibration rate and our measurement speed to vary the interferometer area and $N_{qp}$ independently, allowing us to precisely determine the interferometer phase and monitor the entry and exit of individual anyons to the interferometer loop in the time domain. Besides providing a replication of previous interferometric measurements sensitive to $\theta_a$ in GaAs, our results bring anyon dynamics into the experimental regime and suggest that the average `topological charge' of a mesoscopic quantum Hall device can be held constant over hour long timescales.</description>

Abstract: Monolayer graphene absorbs 2.3 percent of the incident visible light. This 'small' absorption has been used to emphasize the visual transparency of graphene, but it in fact means that multilayer graphene absorbs a sizable fraction of incident light, which causes non-negligible fluorescence. In this paper, we formulate the light emission properties of multilayer graphene composed of tens to hundreds of layers using a transfer matrix method and confirm the method's validity experimentally. We could quantitatively explain the measured contrasts of multilayer graphene on SiO$_2$/Si substrates and found sizable corrections, which cannot be classified as incoherent light emissions, to the reflectance of visible light. The new component originates from coherent emission caused by absorption at each graphene layer. Multilayer graphene thus functions as a partial coherent light source of various wavelengths, and it may have surface-emitting laser applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentz spacetime symmetry represents a unifying feature of the fundamental forces, typically manifest at sufficiently high energies, while in quantum materials it emerges in the deep low-energy regime. However, its fate in quantum materials coupled to an environment thus far remained unexplored. We here introduce a general framework of constructing symmetry-protected Lorentz invariant non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac semimetals (DSMs), realized by invoking masslike anti-Hermitian Dirac operators to its Hermitian counterpart. Such NH DSMs feature purely real or imaginary isotropic linear band dispersion, yielding a vanishing density of states. Dynamic mass orderings in NH DSMs thus take place for strong Hubbardlike local interactions through a quantum phase transition, hosting a non-Fermi liquid, beyond which the system becomes an insulator. We show that depending on the internal Clifford algebra between the NH Dirac operator and candidate mass order-parameter, the resulting quantum-critical fluid either remains coupled with the environment or recovers full Hermiticity by decoupling from the bath, while always enjoying an emergent Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry in terms of a unique terminal velocity. We showcase the competition between such mass orderings, their hallmarks on quasiparticle spectra in the ordered phases, and the relevance of our findings for correlated designer NH Dirac materials.</description>

Abstract: Transport in open quantum systems can be explored through various theoretical frameworks, including the quantum master equation, scattering matrix, and Heisenberg equation of motion. The choice of framework depends on factors such as the presence of interactions, the coupling strength between the system and environment, and whether the focus is on steady-state or transient regimes. Existing literature treats these frameworks independently, lacking a unified perspective. Our work addresses this gap by clarifying the role and status of these approaches using a minimal single-level quantum dot model in a two-terminal setup under voltage and temperature biases. We derive analytical expressions for particle and energy currents and their fluctuations in both steady-state and transient regimes. Exact results from the Heisenberg equation are shown to align with scattering matrix and master equation approaches within their respective validity regimes. Crucially, we establish a protocol for the weak-coupling limit, bridging the applicability of master equations at weak-coupling with Heisenberg or scattering matrix approaches at arbitrary coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Nanofluidic platform for studying the first-order phase transitions in superfluid helium-3</title>

Abstract: The symmetry-breaking first-order phase transition between superfluid phases $^3$He-A and $^3$He-B can be triggered extrinsically by ionising radiation or heterogeneous nucleation arising from the details of the sample cell construction. However, the role of potential homogeneous intrinsic nucleation mechanisms remains elusive. Discovering and resolving the intrinsic processes may have cosmological consequences, since an analogous first-order phase transition, and the production of gravitational waves, has been predicted for the very early stages of the expanding Universe in many extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Here we introduce a new approach for probing the phase transition in superfluid $^3$He. The setup consists of a novel stepped-height nanofluidic sample container with close to atomically smooth walls. The $^3$He is confined in five tiny nanofabricated volumes and assayed non-invasively by NMR. Tuning of the state of $^3$He by confinement is used to isolate each of these five volumes so that the phase transitions in them can occur independently and free from any obvious sources of heterogeneous nucleation. The small volumes also ensure that the transitions triggered by ionising radiation are strongly suppressed. Here we present the preliminary measurements using this setup, showing both strong supercooling of $^3$He-A and superheating of $^3$He-B, with stochastic processes dominating the phase transitions between the two. The objective is to study the nucleation as a function of temperature and pressure over the full phase diagram, to both better test the proposed extrinsic mechanisms and seek potential parallel intrinsic mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Quantum state preparation of topological chiral spin liquids via Floquet engineering</title>

Abstract: In condensed matter, Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) are quantum spin analogs of electronic Fractional Quantum Hall states (in the continuum) or Fractional Chern Insulators (on the lattice). As the latter, CSL are remarquable states of matter, exhibiting topological order and chiral edge modes. Preparing CSL on quantum simulators like cold atom platforms is still an open challenge. Here we propose a simple setup on a finite cluster of spin-1/2 located at the sites of a square lattice. Using a Resonating Valence Bond (RVB) non-chiral spin liquid as initial state on which fast time-modulations of strong nearest-neighbor Heisenberg couplings are applied, following different protocols (out-of-equilibrium quench or semi-adiabatic ramping of the drive), we show the slow emergence of such a CSL phase. An effective Floquet dynamics, obtained from a high-frequency Magnus expansion of the drive Hamiltonian, provides a very accurate and simple framework fully capturing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics. An analysis of the resulting prepared states in term of Projected Entangled Pair states gives further insights on the topological nature of the chiral phase. Finally, we discuss possible applications to quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$qvist quantum geometric tensor of finite-temperature mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) reveals local geometric properties and associated topological information of quantum states. Here a generalization of the QGT to mixed quantum states at finite temperatures based on the Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$qvist distance is developed. The resulting Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$qvist QGT is invariant under gauge transformations of individual spectrum levels of the density matrix. A Pythagorean-like relation connects the distances and gauge transformations, which clarifies the role of the parallel-transport condition. The real part of the QGT naturally decomposes into a sum of the Fisher-Rao metric and Fubini-Study metric, allowing a distinction between different contributions to the quantum distance. The imaginary part of the QGT is proportional to a weighted summation of the Berry curvatures, which leads to a geometric phase for mixed states under certain conditions. We present three examples of different dimensions to illustrate the temperature dependence of the QGT and a discussion on possible implications.</description>

      <title>Electric and magnetic waveguides in graphene: quantum and classical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric and magnetic waveguides are considered in planar Dirac materials like graphene as well as their classical version for relativistic particles of zero mass and electric charge. In order to solve the Dirac-Weyl equation analytically, we have assumed the displacement symmetry of the system along a direction. In these conditions we have examined the rest of symmetries relevant each type, magnetic or electric system, which will determine their similarities and differences. We have worked out waveguides with square profile in detail to show up some of the most interesting features also in quantum and classical complementary contexts. All the results have been visualized along a series of representative graphics showing explicitly the main properties for both types of waveguides.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced symmetry breaking in a system of two parametrically driven Kerr-Duffing oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of a system comprising a pair of Kerr-Duffing nonlinear oscillators, which are coupled through a nonlinear interaction and subjected to a parametric drive. Using the rotating wave approximation (RWA), we analyze the steady-state solutions for the amplitudes of the two oscillators. For the case of almost identical oscillators, we investigate separately the cases in which only one oscillator is parametrically driven and in which both oscillators are simultaneously driven. In the latter regime, we demonstrate that even when the parametric drives acting on the two oscillators are identical, the system can transition from a stable symmetric solution to a broken-symmetry solution as the detuning is varied.</description>
