      <title>Online Price Competition under Generalized Linear Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10718v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sequential price competition among $N$ sellers, each influenced by the pricing decisions of their rivals. Specifically, the demand function for each seller $i$ follows the single index model $\lambda_i(\mathbf{p}) = \mu_i(\langle \boldsymbol{\theta}_{i,0}, \mathbf{p} \rangle)$, with known increasing link $\mu_i$ and unknown parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{i,0}$, where the vector $\mathbf{p}$ denotes the vector of prices offered by all the sellers simultaneously at a given instant. Each seller observes only their own realized demand -- unobservable to competitors -- and the prices set by rivals. Our framework generalizes existing approaches that focus solely on linear demand models. We propose a novel decentralized policy, PML-GLUCB, that combines penalized MLE with an upper-confidence pricing rule, removing the need for coordinated exploration phases across sellers -- which is integral to previous linear models -- and accommodating both binary and real-valued demand observations. Relative to a dynamic benchmark policy, each seller achieves $O(N^{2}\sqrt{T}\log(T))$ regret, which essentially matches the optimal rate known in the linear setting. A significant technical contribution of our work is the development of a variant of the elliptical potential lemma -- typically applied in single-agent systems -- adapted to our competitive multi-agent environment.</description>

      <title>Optimal Welfare in Noncooperative Network Formation under Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication networks are essential for our economy and our everyday lives. This makes them lucrative targets for attacks. Today, we see an ongoing battle between criminals that try to disrupt our key communication networks and security professionals that try to mitigate these attacks. However, today's networks, like the Internet or peer-to-peer networks among smart devices, are not controlled by a single authority, but instead consist of many independently administrated entities that are interconnected. Thus, both the decisions of how to interconnect and how to secure against potential attacks are taken in a decentralized way by selfish agents.
  This strategic setting, with agents that want to interconnect and potential attackers that want to disrupt the network, was captured via an influential game-theoretic model by Goyal, Jabbari, Kearns, Khanna, and Morgenstern (WINE 2016). We revisit this model and show improved tight bounds on the achieved robustness of networks created by selfish agents. As our main result, we show that such networks can resist attacks of a large class of potential attackers, i.e., these networks maintain asymptotically optimal welfare post attack. This improves several bounds and resolves an open problem. Along the way, we show the counter-intuitive result, that attackers that aim at minimizing the social welfare post attack do not actually inflict the greatest possible damage.</description>

      <title>Playing with Peaks: A Game-Theoretic Comparison of Electricity Pricing Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As electricity consumption grows, reducing peak demand--the maximum load on the grid--has become critical for preventing infrastructure strain and blackouts. Pricing mechanisms that incentivize consumers with flexible loads to shift consumption away from high-demand periods have emerged as effective tools, yet different mechanisms are used in practice with unclear relative performance. This work compares two widely implemented approaches: anytime peak pricing (AP), where consumers pay for their individual maximum consumption, and coincident peak pricing (CP), where consumers pay for their consumption during the system-wide peak period. To compare these mechanisms, we model the electricity market as a strategic game and characterize the peak demand in equilibrium under both AP and CP. Our main result demonstrates that with perfect information, equilibrium peak demand under CP never exceeds that under AP; on the other hand, with imperfect information, the coordination introduced by CP can backfire and induce larger equilibrium peaks than AP. These findings demonstrate that potential gains from coupling users' costs (as done in CP) must be weighed against these miscoordination risks. We conclude with preliminary results indicating that progressive demand cost structures--rather than per-unit charges--may mitigate these risks while preserving coordination benefits, achieving desirable performance in both deterministic and stochastic settings.</description>

      <title>Fair Incentives for Early Arrival in 0-1 Cooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incentives for early arrival (I4EA) was recently proposed for studying online cooperative games. In an online cooperative game, players arrive in an unknown order, and the value increase after each player arrived should be distributed immediately among all the arrived players. Although there is only one arriving order in the game, we also hope that the value distribution is equal to their Shapley value in expectation. To achieve these goals, the early solutions ignored the fairness in each single arriving order. More specifically, an important player may receive nothing in a game, which seems unfair in reality. To combat this, we propose refined fairness in this paper and design new solutions in 0-1 value games. Specifically, we compute the distance of the distribution in each order to the Shapley value and aim to minimize it. We propose a new mechanism called Egalitarian Value-Sharing (EVS) to do so. We also show that the mechanism can maximize the egalitarian welfare among all the players who made contributions.</description>

      <title>{\epsilon}-Optimally Solving Two-Player Zero-Sum POSGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for {\epsilon}-optimally solving two-player zero-sum partially observable stochastic games (zs-POSGs). These games pose a major challenge due to the absence of a principled connection with dynamic programming (DP) techniques developed for two-player zero-sum stochastic games (zs-SGs). Prior attempts at transferring solution methods have lacked a lossless reduction, defined here as a transformation that preserves value functions, equilibrium strategies, and optimality structure, thereby limiting generalisation to ad-hoc algorithms. This work introduces the first lossless reduction from zs-POSGs to transition-independent zs-SGs, enabling the principled application of a broad class of DP-based methods. We show empirically that point-based value iteration (PBVI) algorithms, applied via this reduction, produce {\epsilon}-optimal strategies across a range of benchmark domains, consistently matching or outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Our results open a systematic pathway for algorithmic and theoretical transfer from SGs to partially observable settings.</description>

      <title>Computing Equilibrium Nominations in Presidential Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strategic candidate nomination by parties in elections decided by Plurality voting. Each party selects a nominee before the election, and the winner is chosen from the nominated candidates based on the voters' preferences. We introduce a new restriction on these preferences, which we call party-aligned single-peakedness: all voters agree on a common ordering of the parties along an ideological axis, but may differ in their perceptions of the positions of individual candidates within each party. The preferences of each voter are single-peaked with respect to their own axis over the candidates, which is consistent with the global ordering of the parties. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a preference profile satisfies party-aligned single-peakedness. In this domain, we give polynomial-time algorithms for deciding whether a given party can become the winner under some (or all) nominations, and whether this can occur in some pure Nash equilibrium. We also prove a tight result about the guaranteed existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria for elections with up to three parties for single-peaked and party-aligned single-peaked preference profiles.</description>

      <title>Nucleolus, Happy Nucleolus, and Vehicle Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the recently introduced fair division concept of the happy nucleolus for cost allocation among players in a cooperative game, with special focus on its computation. The happy nucleolus applies the same fairness criterion as the well-established nucleolus but with reduced total value. Still, we show that the relation between the two concepts is quite involved, and intuitive properties do not hold - e.g., the entry of a player in the happy nucleolus can be larger than the entry of the same player in the nucleolus, even for monotone and subadditive games. This refutes conjectures of Meir, Rosenschein and Malizia (2011).
  Further, we study the separation problem of the linear programs appearing in the MPS scheme for computing the (happy) nucleolus. It includes linear subspace avoidance constraints, which can be handled efficiently for problems with a certain dynamic programming formulation due to K\"ohnemann and Toth (2020). We show how to get rid of these constraints for all monotone games if we allow for an arbitrarily small error of epsilon, thus conserving known approximation guarantees for the same problem without subspace avoidance.
  Finally, we focus on practical results at the example of vehicle routing games by designing an efficient heuristic based on our previous insights and past work, and demonstrate its power.</description>

      <title>Public Goods Games in Directed Networks with Constraints on Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a public goods game, every player chooses whether or not to buy a good that all neighboring players will have access to. We consider a setting in which the good is indivisible, neighboring players are out-neighbors in a directed graph, and there is a capacity constraint on their number, k, that can benefit from the good. This means that each player makes a two-pronged decision: decide whether or not to buy and, conditional on buying, choose which k out-neighbors to share access. We examine both pure and mixed Nash equilibria in the model from the perspective of existence, computation, and efficiency. We perform a comprehensive study for these three dimensions with respect to both sharing capacity (k) and the network structure (the underlying directed graph), and establish sharp complexity dichotomies for each.</description>

      <title>Deviation Dynamics in Cardinal Hedonic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing stable partitions in hedonic games is a challenging task because there exist games in which stable outcomes do not exist. Even more, these No-instances can often be leveraged to prove computational hardness results. We make this impression rigorous in a dynamic model of cardinal hedonic games by providing meta theorems. These imply hardness of deciding about the possible or necessary convergence of deviation dynamics based on the mere existence of No-instances. Our results hold for additively separable, fractional, and modified fractional hedonic games (ASHGs, FHGs, and MFHGs). Moreover, they encompass essentially all reasonable stability notions based on single-agent deviations. In addition, we propose dynamics as a method to find individually rational and contractually individual stable (CIS) partitions in ASHGs. In particular, we find that CIS dynamics from the singleton partition possibly converge after a linear number of deviations but may require an exponential number of deviations in the worst case.</description>

      <title>Incremental Data-Driven Policy Synthesis via Game Abstractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the synthesis of control policies for unknown discrete-time stochastic dynamical systems to satisfy temporal logic objectives. We present a data-driven, abstraction-based control framework that integrates online learning with novel incremental game-solving. Under appropriate continuity assumptions, our method abstracts the system dynamics into a finite stochastic (2.5-player) game graph derived from data. Given a requirement over time on this graph, we compute the winning region -- i.e., the set of initial states from which the objective is satisfiable -- in the resulting game, together with a corresponding control policy.
  Our main contribution is the construction of abstractions, winning regions and control policies incrementally, as data about the system dynamics accumulates. Concretely, our algorithm refines under- and over-approximations of reachable sets for each state-action pair as new data samples arrive. These refinements induce structural modifications in the game graph abstraction -- such as the addition or removal of nodes and edges -- which in turn modify the winning region. Crucially, we show that these updates are inherently monotonic: under-approximations can only grow, over-approximations can only shrink, and the winning region can only expand.
  We exploit this monotonicity by defining an objective-induced ranking function on the nodes of the abstract game that increases monotonically as new data samples are incorporated. These ranks underpin our novel incremental game-solving algorithm, which employs customized gadgets (DAG-like subgames) within a rank-lifting algorithm to efficiently update the winning region. Numerical case studies demonstrate significant computational savings compared to the baseline approach, which resolves the entire game from scratch whenever new data samples arrive.</description>

      <title>Who Gets the Reward, Who Gets the Blame? Evaluation-Aligned Training Signals for Multi-LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise for complex tasks, yet current training methods lack principled ways to connect system-level evaluation with agent-level and message-level learning. We propose a theoretical framework that unifies cooperative game-theoretic attribution with process reward modeling to transform system evaluation into agent credit and then into response-level signals. Unlike prior approaches that rely only on attribution (e.g., Shapley) or step-level labels (e.g., PRM), our method produces local, signed, and credit-conserving signals. In success cases, Shapley-based credit assignment fairly allocates outcomes across agents and is refined into per-message rewards that promote cooperation while discouraging redundancy or sabotage. In failure cases, first-error localization yields repair-aware preferences that penalize harmful steps while rewarding corrective attempts. The resulting signals are bounded, cooperative, and directly compatible with reinforcement-based or preference-based post-training, providing a unified and auditable pathway from global evaluation to local supervision in LLM multi-agent training. Our contribution is conceptual: we present a theoretical foundation and training signals, leaving empirical validation for future work.</description>

      <title>Picking a Representative Set of Solutions in Multiobjective Optimization: Axioms, Algorithms, and Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.</description>

      <title>Peer Selection with Friends and Enemies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A planner wants to select one agent out of n agents on the basis of a binary characteristic that is commonly known to all agents but is not observed by the planner. Any pair of agents can either be friends or enemies or impartials of each other. An individual's most preferred outcome is that she be selected. If she is not selected, then she would prefer that a friend be selected, and if neither she herself or a friend is selected, then she would prefer that an impartial agent be selected. Finally, her least preferred outcome is that an enemy be selected. The planner wants to design a dominant strategy incentive compatible mechanism in order to be able choose a desirable agent. We derive sufficient conditions for existence of efficient and DSIC mechanisms when the planner knows the bilateral relationships between agents. We also show that if the planner does not know these relationships, then there is no efficient and DSIC mechanism and we compare the relative efficiency of two ``second-best'' DSIC mechanisms. Finally, we obtain sharp characterization results when the network of friends and enemies satisfies structural balance.</description>

      <title>Totally mixed conditional independence equilibria of generic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper further develops the algebraic--geometric foundations of conditional independence (CI) equilibria, a refinement of dependency equilibria that integrates conditional independence relations from graphical models into strategic reasoning and thereby subsumes Nash equilibria. Extending earlier work on binary games, we analyze the structure of the associated Spohn CI varieties for generic games of arbitrary format. We show that for generic games the Spohn CI variety is either empty or has codimension equal to the sum of the players' strategy dimensions minus the number of players in the parametrized undirected graphical model. When non-empty, the set of totally mixed CI equilibria forms a smooth manifold for generic games. For cluster graphical models, we introduce the class of Nash CI varieties, prove their irreducibility, and describe their defining equations, degrees, and conditions for the existence of totally mixed CI equilibria for generic games.</description>

Abstract: Game-theoretic approaches and Nash equilibrium have been widely applied across various engineering domains. However, practical challenges such as disturbances, delays, and actuator limitations can hinder the precise execution of Nash equilibrium strategies. This work investigates the impact of such implementation imperfections on game trajectories and players' costs in the context of a two-player finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) nonzero-sum game. Specifically, we analyze how small deviations by one player, measured or estimated at each stage, affect the state and cost function of the other player. To mitigate these effects, we propose an adjusted control policy that optimally compensates for the deviations under the stated information structure and can, under certain conditions, exploit them to improve performance. Rigorous mathematical analysis and proofs are provided, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a representative numerical example.</description>

      <title>Cautious Optimism: A Meta-Algorithm for Near-Constant Regret in General Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05005</link>

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Optimism, a framework for substantially faster regularized learning in general games. Cautious Optimism, as a variant of Optimism, adaptively controls the learning pace in a dynamic, non-monotone manner to accelerate no-regret learning dynamics. Cautious Optimism takes as input any instance of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and outputs an accelerated no-regret learning algorithm (COFTRL) by pacing the underlying FTRL with minimal computational overhead. Importantly, it retains uncoupledness, that is, learners do not need to know other players' utilities. Cautious Optimistic FTRL (COFTRL) achieves near-optimal $O_T(\log T)$ regret in diverse self-play (mixing and matching regularizers) while preserving the optimal $O_T(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial scenarios. In contrast to prior works (e.g., Syrgkanis et al. [2015], Daskalakis et al. [2021]), our analysis does not rely on monotonic step sizes, showcasing a novel route for fast learning in general games. Moreover, instances of COFTRL achieve new state-of-the-art regret minimization guarantees in general convex games, exponentially improving the dependence on the dimension of the action space $d$ over previous works [Farina et al., 2022a].</description>

      <title>When the Correct Model Fails: The Optimality of Stackelberg Equilibria with Follower Intention Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a two-player dynamic Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower whose intention is unknown to the leader. Classical formulations of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) assume that the follower's best response (BR) function is known to the leader. However, this is not always true in practice. We study a setting in which the leader receives updated beliefs about the follower BR before the end of the game, such that the update prompts the leader and subsequently the follower to re-optimize their strategies. We characterize the optimality guarantees of the SE solutions under this belief update for both open loop and feedback information structures. Interestingly, we prove that in general, assuming an incorrect follower's BR can lead to more optimal leader costs over the entire game than knowing the true follower's BR. We support these results with numerical examples in a linear quadratic (LQ) Stackelberg game, and use Monte Carlo simulations to show that the instances of incorrect BR achieving lower leader costs are non-trivial in collision avoidance LQ Stackelberg games.</description>
