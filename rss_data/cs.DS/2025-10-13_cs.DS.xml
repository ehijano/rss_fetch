      <title>Distributed clustering in partially overlapping feature spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and address a novel distributed clustering problem where each participant has a private dataset containing only a subset of all available features, and some features are included in multiple datasets. This scenario occurs in many real-world applications, such as in healthcare, where different institutions have complementary data on similar patients. We propose two different algorithms suitable for solving distributed clustering problems that exhibit this type of feature space heterogeneity. The first is a federated algorithm in which participants collaboratively update a set of global centroids. The second is a one-shot algorithm in which participants share a statistical parametrization of their local clusters with the central server, who generates and merges synthetic proxy datasets. In both cases, participants perform local clustering using algorithms of their choice, which provides flexibility and personalized computational costs. Pretending that local datasets result from splitting and masking an initial centralized dataset, we identify some conditions under which the proposed algorithms are expected to converge to the optimal centralized solution. Finally, we test the practical performance of the algorithms on three public datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In online combinatorial allocation, agents arrive sequentially and items are allocated in an online manner. The algorithm designer only knows the distribution of each agent's valuation, while the actual realization of the valuation is revealed only upon her arrival. Against the offline benchmark, Feldman, Gravin, and Lucier (SODA 2015) designed an optimal $0.5$-competitive algorithm for XOS agents. An emerging line of work focuses on designing approximation algorithms against the (computationally unbounded) optimal online algorithm. The primary goal is to design algorithms with approximation ratios strictly greater than $0.5$, surpassing the impossibility result against the offline optimum. Positive results are established for unit-demand agents (Papadimitriou, Pollner, Saberi, Wajc, MOR 2024), and for $k$-demand agents (Braun, Kesselheim, Pollner, Saberi, EC 2024).
  In this paper, we extend the existing positive results for agents with submodular valuations by establishing a $0.5 + \Omega(1)$ approximation against a newly constructed online configuration LP relaxation for the combinatorial allocation setting. Meanwhile, we provide negative results for agents with XOS valuations by providing a $0.5$ integrality gap for the online configuration LP, showing an obstacle of existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Simple Length-Constrained Expander Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Length-constrained expander decompositions are a new graph decomposition that has led to several recent breakthroughs in fast graph algorithms. Roughly, an $(h, s)$-length $\phi$-expander decomposition is a small collection of length increases to a graph so that nodes within distance $h$ can route flow over paths of length $hs$ while using each edge to an extent at most $1/\phi$. Prior work showed that every $n$-node and $m$-edge graph admits an $(h, s)$-length $\phi$-expander decomposition of size $\log n \cdot s n^{O(1/s)} \cdot \phi m$.
  In this work, we give a simple proof of the existence of $(h, s)$-length $\phi$-expander decompositions with an improved size of $s n^{O(1/s)}\cdot \phi m$. Our proof is a straightforward application of the fact that the union of sparse length-constrained cuts is itself a sparse length-constrained cut. In deriving our result, we improve the loss in sparsity when taking the union of sparse length-constrained cuts from $\log ^3 n\cdot s^3 n^{O(1/s)}$ to $s\cdot n^{O(1/s)}$.</description>

      <title>Explicit Min-wise Hash Families with Optimal Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study explicit constructions of min-wise hash families and their extension to $k$-min-wise hash families. Informally, a min-wise hash family guarantees that for any fixed subset $X\subseteq[N]$, every element in $X$ has an equal chance to have the smallest value among all elements in $X$; a $k$-min-wise hash family guarantees this for every subset of size $k$ in $X$. Min-wise hash is widely used in many areas of computer science such as sketching, web page detection, and $\ell_0$ sampling.
  The classical works by Indyk and P\u{a}tra\c{s}cu and Thorup have shown $\Theta(\log(1/\delta))$-wise independent families give min-wise hash of multiplicative (relative) error $\delta$, resulting in a construction with $\Theta(\log(1/\delta)\log N)$ random bits. Based on a reduction from pseudorandom generators for combinatorial rectangles by Saks, Srinivasan, Zhou and Zuckerman, Gopolan and Yehudayoff improved the number of bits to $O(\log N\log\log N)$ for polynomially small errors $\delta$. However, no construction with $O(\log N)$ bits (polynomial size family) and sub-constant error was known before.
  In this work, we continue and extend the study of constructing ($k$-)min-wise hash families from pseudorandomness for combinatorial rectangles and read-once branching programs. Our main result gives the first explicit min-wise hash families that use an optimal (up to constant) number of random bits and achieve a sub-constant (in fact, almost polynomially small) error, specifically, an explicit family of $k$-min-wise hash with $O(k\log N)$ bits and $2^{-O(\log N/\log\log N)}$ error. This improves all previous results for any $k=\log^{O(1)}N$ under $O(k \log N)$ bits. Our main techniques involve several new ideas to adapt the classical Nisan-Zuckerman pseudorandom generator to fool min-wise hashing with a multiplicative error.</description>

      <title>Information-Computation Tradeoffs for Noiseless Linear Regression with Oblivious Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the task of noiseless linear regression under Gaussian covariates in the presence of additive oblivious contamination. Specifically, we are given i.i.d.\ samples from a distribution $(x, y)$ on $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}$ with $x \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I}_d)$ and $y = x^\top \beta + z$, where $z$ is drawn independently of $x$ from an unknown distribution $E$. Moreover, $z$ satisfies $\mathbb{P}_E[z = 0] = \alpha&gt;0$. The goal is to accurately recover the regressor $\beta$ to small $\ell_2$-error. Ignoring computational considerations, this problem is known to be solvable using $O(d/\alpha)$ samples. On the other hand, the best known polynomial-time algorithms require $\Omega(d/\alpha^2)$ samples. Here we provide formal evidence that the quadratic dependence in $1/\alpha$ is inherent for efficient algorithms. Specifically, we show that any efficient Statistical Query algorithm for this task requires VSTAT complexity at least $\tilde{\Omega}(d^{1/2}/\alpha^2)$.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Streaming Algorithms for Correlation Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study streaming algorithms for Correlation Clustering. Given a graph as an arbitrary-order stream of edges, with each edge labeled as positive or negative, the goal is to partition the vertices into disjoint clusters, such that the number of disagreements is minimized. In this paper, we give the first learning-augmented streaming algorithms for the problem on both complete and general graphs, improving the best-known space-approximation tradeoffs. Based on the works of Cambus et al. (SODA'24) and Ahn et al. (ICML'15), our algorithms use the predictions of pairwise distances between vertices provided by a predictor. For complete graphs, our algorithm achieves a better-than-$3$ approximation under good prediction quality, while using $\tilde{O}(n)$ total space. For general graphs, our algorithm achieves an $O(\log |E^-|)$ approximation under good prediction quality using $\tilde{O}(n)$ total space, improving the best-known non-learning algorithm in terms of space efficiency. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed algorithms over their non-learning counterparts.</description>

      <title>Crane Scheduling Problem with Energy Saving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During loading and unloading steps, energy is consumed when cranes lift containers, while energy is often wasted when cranes drop containers. By optimizing the scheduling of cranes, it is possible to reduce energy consumption, thereby lowering operational costs and environmental impacts. In this paper, we introduce a single-crane scheduling problem with energy savings, focusing on reusing the energy from containers that have already been lifted and reducing the total energy consumption of the entire scheduling plan. We establish a basic model considering a one-dimensional storage area and provide a systematic complexity analysis of the problem. First, we investigate the connection between our problem and the semi-Eulerization problem and propose an additive approximation algorithm. Then, we present a polynomial-time Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm for the case of bounded energy buffer and processing lengths. Next, adopting a Hamiltonian perspective, we address the general case with arbitrary energy buffer and processing lengths. We propose an exact DP algorithm and show that the variation of the problem is polynomially solvable when it can be transformed into a path cover problem on acyclic interval digraphs. We introduce a paradigm that integrates both the Eulerian and Hamiltonian perspectives, providing a robust framework for addressing the problem.</description>

      <title>Online Allocation with Concave, Diminishing-Returns Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online resource allocation problems are central challenges in economics and computer science, modeling situations in which $n$ items arriving one at a time must each be immediately allocated among $m$ agents. In such problems, our objective is to maximize a monotone reward function $f(\mathbf{x})$ over the allocation vector $\mathbf{x} = (x_{ij})_{i, j}$, which describes the amount of each item given to each agent. In settings where $f$ is concave and has "diminishing returns" (monotone decreasing gradient), several lines of work over the past two decades have had great success designing constant-competitive algorithms, including the foundational work of Mehta et al. (2005) on the Adwords problem and many follow-ups. Notably, while a greedy algorithm is $\frac{1}{2}$-competitive in such settings, these works have shown that one can often obtain a competitive ratio of $1-\frac{1}{e} \approx 0.632$ in a variety of settings when items are divisible (i.e. allowing fractional allocations). However, prior works have thus far used a variety of problem-specific techniques, leaving open the general question: Does a $(1-\frac{1}{e})$-competitive fractional algorithm always exist for online resource allocation problems with concave, diminishing-returns objectives?
  In this work, we answer this question affirmatively, thereby unifying and generalizing prior results for special cases. Our algorithm is one which makes continuous greedy allocations with respect to an auxiliary objective $U(\mathbf{x})$. Using the online primal-dual method, we show that if $U$ satisfies a "balanced" property with respect to $f$, then one can bound the competitiveness of such an algorithm. Our crucial observation is that there is a simple expression for $U$ which has this balanced property for any $f$, yielding our general $(1-\frac{1}{e})$-competitive algorithm.</description>

      <title>An $O(n\log n)$ Algorithm for Single-Item Capacitated Lot Sizing with a One-Breakpoint All-Units Discount and Non-Increasing Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the single-item capacitated lot sizing problem with a 1-breakpoint all-units quantity discount in a monotonic setting where the purchase prices are non-increasing over the planning horizon. For this case, we establish several novel properties of the optimal solution and develop a hybrid dynamic programming approach that maintains a compact representation of the solution space by storing only essential information about the states and using linear equations for intermediate values. Our algorithm runs in \(O(n\log n)\) time, where \(n\) denotes the number of periods. Our result is an improvement over the previous state-of-the-art algorithm, which has an \(O(n^2)\) time complexity.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Algorithms for Estimating Single-Linkage Clustering Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-linkage clustering is a fundamental method for data analysis. Algorithmically, one can compute a single-linkage $k$-clustering (a partition into $k$ clusters) by computing a minimum spanning tree and dropping the $k-1$ most costly edges. This clustering minimizes the sum of spanning tree weights of the clusters. This motivates us to define the cost of a single-linkage $k$-clustering as the weight of the corresponding spanning forest, denoted by $\mathrm{cost}_k$. Besides, if we consider single-linkage clustering as computing a hierarchy of clusterings, the total cost of the hierarchy is defined as the sum of the individual clusterings, denoted by $\mathrm{cost}(G) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \mathrm{cost}_k$.
  In this paper, we assume that the distances between data points are given as a graph $G$ with average degree $d$ and edge weights from $\{1,\dots, W\}$. Given query access to the adjacency list of $G$, we present a sampling-based algorithm that computes a succinct representation of estimates $\widehat{\mathrm{cost}}_k$ for all $k$. The running time is $\tilde O(d\sqrt{W}/\varepsilon^3)$, and the estimates satisfy $\sum_{k=1}^{n} |\widehat{\mathrm{cost}}_k - \mathrm{cost}_k| \le \varepsilon\cdot \mathrm{cost}(G)$, for any $0&lt;\varepsilon &lt;1$. Thus we can approximate the cost of every $k$-clustering upto $(1+\varepsilon)$ factor \emph{on average}. In particular, our result ensures that we can estimate $\cost(G)$ upto a factor of $1\pm \varepsilon$ in the same running time.
  We also extend our results to the setting where edges represent similarities. In this case, the clusterings are defined by a maximum spanning tree, and our algorithms run in $\tilde{O}(dW/\varepsilon^3)$ time. We futher prove nearly matching lower bounds for estimating the total clustering cost and we extend our algorithms to metric space settings.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Metric Steiner Forest via Maximal Independent Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the Metric Steiner Forest problem in the sublinear time model. Given a set $V$ of $n$ points in a metric space where distances are provided by means of query access to an $n\times n$ distance matrix, along with a set of $k$ terminal pairs $(s_1,t_1), \dots, (s_k,t_k)\in V\times V$, the goal is to find a minimum-weight subset of edges that connects each terminal pair. Although sublinear time algorithms have been studied for estimating the weight of a minimum spanning tree in both general and metric settings, as well as for the metric Steiner Tree problem, no sublinear time algorithm was known for the metric Steiner Forest problem.
  Here, we give an $O(\log k)$-approximation algorithm for the problem that runs in time $\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2})$. Along the way, we provide the first sublinear-time algorithm for estimating the size of a Maximal Independent Set (MIS). Our algorithm runs in time $\widetilde{O}(n^{3/2}/\varepsilon^2)$ under the adjacency matrix oracle model and obtains a purely multiplicative $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation. Previously, sublinear-time algorithms for MIS were only known for bounded-degree graphs.</description>

      <title>Continual Release of Densest Subgraphs: Privacy Amplification &amp; Sublinear Space via Subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sublinear space continual release model for edge-differentially private (DP) graph algorithms, with a focus on the densest subgraph problem (DSG) in the insertion-only setting. Our main result is the first continual release DSG algorithm that matches the additive error of the best static DP algorithms and the space complexity of the best non-private streaming algorithms, up to constants. The key idea is a refined use of subsampling that simultaneously achieves privacy amplification and sparsification, a connection not previously formalized in graph DP. Via a simple black-box reduction to the static setting, we obtain both pure and approximate-DP algorithms with $O(\log n)$ additive error and $O(n\log n)$ space, improving both accuracy and space complexity over the previous state of the art. Along the way, we introduce graph densification in the graph DP setting, adding edges to trigger earlier subsampling, which removes the extra logarithmic factors in error and space incurred by prior work [ELMZ25]. We believe this simple idea may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit for Quantum Fourier Transform for Arbitrary Qubit Connectivity Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the paper, we consider quantum circuits for the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) algorithm. The QFT algorithm is a very popular technique used in many quantum algorithms. We present a generic method for constructing quantum circuits for this algorithm implementing on quantum devices with restrictions. Many quantum devices (for example, based on superconductors) have restrictions on applying two-qubit gates. These restrictions are presented by a qubit connectivity graph. Typically, researchers consider only the linear nearest neighbor (LNN) architecture of the qubit connection, but current devices have more complex graphs. We present a method for arbitrary connected graphs that minimizes the number of CNOT gates in the circuit for implementing on such architecture.
  We compare quantum circuits built by our algorithm with existing quantum circuits optimized for specific graphs that are Linear-nearest-neighbor (LNN) architecture, ``sun'' (a cycle with tails, presented by the 16-qubit IBMQ device) and ``two joint suns'' (two joint cycles with tails, presented by the 27-qubit IBMQ device). Our generic method gives similar results with existing optimized circuits for ``sun'' and ``two joint suns'' architectures, and a circuit with slightly more CNOT gates for the LNN architecture. At the same time, our method allows us to construct a circuit for arbitrary connected graphs.</description>

Abstract: In this column, we overview recent progress by many authors on understanding the approximability of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) in low-space streaming models. Inspired by this recent progress, we collate nine conjectural lower bounds against streaming algorithms for CSPs, some of which appear here for the first time.</description>

      <title>List Decoding Reed--Solomon Codes in the Lee, Euclidean, and Other Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reed--Solomon error-correcting codes are ubiquitous across computer science and information theory, with applications in cryptography, computational complexity, communication and storage systems, and more. Most works on efficient error correction for these codes, like the celebrated Berlekamp--Welch unique decoder and the (Guruswami--)Sudan list decoders, are focused on measuring error in the Hamming metric, which simply counts the number of corrupted codeword symbols. However, for some applications, other metrics that depend on the specific values of the errors may be more appropriate.
  This work gives a polynomial-time algorithm that list decodes (generalized) Reed--Solomon codes over prime fields in $\ell_p$ (semi)metrics, for any $0 &lt; p \leq 2$. Compared to prior algorithms for the Lee ($\ell_1$) and Euclidean ($\ell_2$) metrics, ours decodes to arbitrarily large distances (for correspondingly small rates), and has better distance-rate tradeoffs for all decoding distances above some moderate thresholds. We also prove lower bounds on the $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ minimum distances of a certain natural subclass of GRS codes, which establishes that our list decoder is actually a unique decoder for many parameters of interest. Finally, we analyze our algorithm's performance under random Laplacian and Gaussian errors, and show that it supports even larger rates than for corresponding amounts of worst-case error in $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ (respectively).</description>

      <title>Robust Online Sampling from Possibly Moving Target Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suppose we are given a list of points $x_1, \dots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}$, a target probability measure $\mu$ and are asked to add additional points $x_{n+1}, \dots, x_{n+m}$ so that $x_1, \dots, x_{n+m}$ is as close as possible to the distribution of $\mu$; additionally, we want this to be true uniformly for all $m$. We propose a simple method that achieves this goal. It selects new points in regions where the existing set is lacking points and avoids regions that are already overly crowded. If we replace $\mu$ by another measure $\mu_2$ in the middle of the computation, the method dynamically adjusts and allows us to keep the original sampling points. $x_{n+1}$ can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ steps and we obtain state-of-the-art results. It appears to be an interesting dynamical system in its own right; we analyze a continuous mean-field version that reflects much of the same behavior.</description>

      <title>A Fast-Converging Decentralized Approach to the Weighted Minimum Vertex Cover Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of computing a Minimum Weighted Vertex Cover (MWVC) in a decentralized network. MWVC, a classical NP-hard problem, is foundational in applications such as network monitoring and resource placement. We propose a fully decentralized protocol where each node makes decisions using only local knowledge and communicates with its neighbors. The method is adaptive, communication-efficient, and avoids centralized coordination. We evaluate the protocol on real-world and synthetic graphs, comparing it to both centralized and decentralized baselines. Our results demonstrate competitive solution quality with reduced communication overhead, highlighting the feasibility of MWVC computation in decentralized environments.</description>

      <title>Computing Vertex and Edge Connectivity of Graphs Embedded with Crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertex connectivity and edge connectivity are fundamental concepts in graph theory that have been widely studied from both structural and algorithmic perspectives. The focus of this paper is on computing these two parameters for graphs embedded on the plane with crossings. For planar graphs -- which can be embedded on the plane without any crossings -- it has long been known that vertex and edge connectivity can be computed in linear time. Recently, the algorithm for vertex connectivity was extended from planar graphs to 1-plane graphs (where each edge is crossed at most once) without $\times$-crossings -- these are crossings whose endpoints induce a matching. The key insight, for both these classes of graphs, is that any two vertices/edges of a minimum vertex/edge cut have small face-distance (distance measured by number of faces) in the embedding. In this paper, we attempt at a comprehensive generalization of this idea to a wider class of graphs embedded on the plane. Our method works for all those embedded graphs where every pair of crossing edges is connected by a path whose vertices and edges have a small face-distance from the crossing point. Important examples of such graphs include optimal 2-planar and optimal 3-planar graphs, $d$-map graphs, $d$-framed graphs, graphs with bounded crossing number, and $k$-plane graphs with bounded number of $\times$-crossings. For all these graph classes, we get a linear-time algorithm for computing vertex and edge connectivity.</description>

      <title>Local Gibbs sampling beyond local uniformity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local samplers are algorithms that generate random samples based on local queries to high-dimensional distributions, ensuring the samples follow the correct induced distributions while maintaining time complexity that scales locally with the query size. These samplers have broad applications, including deterministic approximate counting [He, Wang, Yin, SODA '23; Feng et.al., FOCS '23], sampling from infinite or high-dimensional Gibbs distributions [Anand, Jerrum, SICOMP '22; He, Wang, Yin, FOCS '22], and providing local access to large random objects [Biswas, Rubinfield, Yodpinyanee, ITCS '20]. In this work, we present local samplers for Gibbs distributions of spin systems.
  Specifically, we design linear-time local samplers for:
  - permissive spin systems, including the first local sampler for the Ising model in near-critical regimes;
  - truly repulsive spin systems, represented by the first local sampler for uniform proper $q$-colorings, with $q=O(\Delta)$ colors on graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$.
  These local samplers are efficient beyond the "local uniformity" threshold, which imposes unconditional marginal lower bounds -- a key assumption required by all prior local samplers. Our results show that, in general, local sampling is not significantly harder than global sampling for spin systems. As an application, our results also imply local algorithms for probabilistic inference in the same near-critical regimes.</description>

      <title>On Deterministically Finding an Element of High Order Modulo a Composite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a deterministic algorithm that, given a composite number $N$ and a target order $D \ge N^{1/6}$, runs in time $D^{1/2+o(1)}$ and finds either an element $a \in \mathbb{Z}_N^*$ of multiplicative order at least $D$, or a nontrivial factor of $N$. Our algorithm improves upon an algorithm of Hittmeir (arXiv:1608.08766), who designed a similar algorithm under the stronger assumption $D \ge N^{2/5}$. Hittmeir's algorithm played a crucial role in the recent breakthrough deterministic integer factorization algorithms of Hittmeir and Harvey (arXiv:2006.16729, arXiv:2010.05450, arXiv:2105.11105). When $N$ is assumed to have an $r$-power divisor with $r\ge 2$, our algorithm provides the same guarantees assuming $D \ge N^{1/6r}$.</description>

Abstract: We develop a new characterization of potential maximal cliques of a triconnected planar graph and, using this characterization, give a polynomial delay algorithm generating all potential maximal cliques of a given triconnected planar graph. Combined with the dynamic programming algorithms due to Bouchitt{\'e} and Todinca, this algorithm leads to a treewidth algorithm for general planar graphs that runs in time linear in the number of potential maximal cliques and polynomial in the number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Low Recourse Arborescence Forests Under Uniformly Random Arcs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study how to maintain a forest of arborescences of maximum arc cardinality under arc insertions while minimizing recourse -- the total number of arcs changed in the maintained solution. This problem is the "arborescence version'' of max cardinality matching.
  On the impossibility side, we observe that even in this insertion-only model, it is possible for $m$ adversarial arc arrivals to necessarily incur $\Omega(m \cdot n)$ recourse, matching a trivial upper bound of $O(m \cdot n)$. On the possibility side, we give an algorithm with expected recourse $O(m \cdot \log^2 n)$ if all $m$ arcs arrive uniformly at random.</description>

      <title>Fast-Convergent Proximity Graphs for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high-dimensional metric spaces is a fundamental problem with many applications. Over the past decade, proximity graph (PG)-based indexes have demonstrated superior empirical performance over alternatives. However, these methods often lack theoretical guarantees regarding the quality of query results, especially in the worst-case scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the {\alpha}-convergent graph ({\alpha}-CG), a new PG structure that employs a carefully designed edge pruning rule. This rule eliminates candidate neighbors for each data point p by applying the shifted-scaled triangle inequalities among p, its existing out-neighbors, and new candidates. If the distance between the query point q and its exact nearest neighbor v* is at most {\tau} for some constant {\tau} &gt; 0, our {\alpha}-CG finds the exact nearest neighbor in poly-logarithmic time, assuming bounded intrinsic dimensionality for the dataset; otherwise, it can find an ANN in the same time. To enhance scalability, we develop the {\alpha}-convergent neighborhood graph ({\alpha}-CNG), a practical variant that applies the pruning rule locally within each point's neighbors. We also introduce optimizations to reduce the index construction time. Experimental results show that our {\alpha}-CNG outperforms existing PGs on real-world datasets. For most datasets, {\alpha}-CNG can reduce the number of distance computations and search steps by over 15% and 45%, respectively, when compared with the best-performing baseline.</description>

      <title>Overlay Network Construction: Improved Overall and Node-Wise Message Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing distributed overlay networks, where nodes in a reconfigurable system can create or sever connections with nodes whose identifiers they know. Initially, each node knows only its own and its neighbors' identifiers, forming a local channel, while the evolving structure is termed the global channel. The goal is to reconfigure any connected graph into a desired topology, such as a bounded-degree expander graph or a well-formed tree (WFT) with a constant maximum degree and logarithmic diameter, minimizing the total number of rounds and message complexity. This problem mirrors real-world peer-to-peer network construction, where creating robust and efficient systems is desired.
  We study the overlay reconstruction problem in a network of $n$ nodes in two models: \textsf{GOSSIP-reply}{} and \textsf{HYBRID}{}. In the \textsf{GOSSIP-reply}{} model, each node can send a message and receive a corresponding reply message in one round. In the \textsf{HYBRID}{} model, a node can send $O(1)$ messages to each neighbor in the local channel and a total of $O(\log n)$ messages in the global channel.
  In both models, we propose protocols for WFT construction with $O\left(n \log n\right)$ message complexities using messages of $O(\log n)$ bits. In the \textsf{GOSSIP-reply}{} model, our protocol takes $O(\log n)$ rounds while in the \textsf{HYBRID} model, our protocol takes $O(\log^2 n)$ rounds. Both protocols use $O\left(n \log^2 n\right)$ bits of communication.</description>

      <title>Provably faster randomized and quantum algorithms for $k$-means clustering via uniform sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $k$-means algorithm (Lloyd's algorithm) is a widely used method for clustering unlabeled data. A key bottleneck of the $k$-means algorithm is that each iteration requires time linear in the number of data points, which can be expensive in big data applications. This was improved in recent works proposing quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms to approximate the $k$-means algorithm locally, in time depending only logarithmically on the number of data points (along with data dependent parameters) [q-means: A quantum algorithm for unsupervised machine learning, Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash, NeurIPS 2019; Do you know what $q$-means?, Cornelissen, Doriguello, Luongo, Tang, QTML 2025]. In this work, we describe a simple randomized mini-batch $k$-means algorithm and a quantum algorithm inspired by the classical algorithm. We demonstrate that the worst case guarantees of these algorithms can significantly improve upon the bounds for algorithms in prior work. Our improvements are due to a careful use of uniform sampling, which preserves certain symmetries of the $k$-means problem that are not preserved in previous algorithms that use data norm-based sampling.</description>

      <title>Exact Causal Attention with 10% Fewer Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Exact Causal Attention (ECA), a Strassen-style algorithm that computes exact Causal Attention using 10\% fewer operations. ECA improves a special class of matrix multiplications where either one operand or the output matrix is upper- or lower-triangular. This includes all matrix multiplication operations in the forward and backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product $\mathrm{Mask}(QK^{T})$. ECA is built upon algebraic identities discovered via machine learning and combinatorial search. We note that ECA cannot accelerate fused kernels such as FlashAttention on GPU. This is because ECA requires materialization of large intermediate expressions in the memory, while FlashAttention does not. However, it provides an alternative approach for compute-bound applications and can potentially be useful in scenarios with FLOPs considerations.</description>
