      <title>UP2D: Uncertainty-aware Progressive Pseudo-label Denoising for Source-Free Domain Adaptive Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation models face severe performance drops under domain shifts, especially when data sharing constraints prevent access to source images. We present a novel Uncertainty-aware Progressive Pseudo-label Denoising (UP2D) framework for source-free domain adaptation (SFDA), designed to mitigate noisy pseudo-labels and class imbalance during adaptation. UP2D integrates three key components: (i) a Refined Prototype Filtering module that suppresses uninformative regions and constructs reliable class prototypes to denoise pseudo-labels, (ii) an Uncertainty-Guided EMA (UG-EMA) strategy that selectively updates the teacher model based on spatially weighted boundary uncertainty, and (iii) a quantile-based entropy minimization scheme that focuses learning on ambiguous regions while avoiding overconfidence on easy pixels. This single-stage student-teacher framework progressively improves pseudo-label quality and reduces confirmation bias. Extensive experiments on three challenging retinal fundus benchmarks demonstrate that UP2D achieves state-of-the-art performance across both standard and open-domain settings, outperforming prior UDA and SFDA approaches while maintaining superior boundary precision.</description>

      <title>R3GAN-based Optimal Strategy for Augmenting Small Medical Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image analysis often suffers from data scarcity and class imbalance, limiting the effectiveness of deep learning models in clinical applications. Using human embryo time-lapse imaging (TLI) as a case study, this work investigates how generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be optimized for small datasets to generate realistic and diagnostically meaningful images. Based on systematic experiments with R3GAN, we established effective training strategies and designed an optimized configuration for 256x256-resolution datasets, featuring a full burn-in phase and a low, gradually increasing gamma range (5 -&gt; 40). The generated samples were used to balance an imbalanced embryo dataset, leading to substantial improvement in classification performance. The recall and F1-score of t3 increased from 0.06 to 0.69 and 0.11 to 0.60, respectively, without compromising other classes. These results demonstrate that tailored R3GAN training strategies can effectively alleviate data scarcity and improve model robustness in small-scale medical imaging tasks.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Driven Generation of Minimally Preprocessed Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to present and compare three denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) that generate 3D $T_1$-weighted MRI human brain images. Three DDPMs were trained using 80,675 image volumes from 42,406 subjects spanning 38 publicly available brain MRI datasets. These images had approximately 1 mm isotropic resolution and were manually inspected by three human experts to exclude those with poor quality, field-of-view issues, and excessive pathology. The images were minimally preprocessed to preserve the visual variability of the data. Furthermore, to enable the DDPMs to produce images with natural orientation variations and inhomogeneity, the images were neither registered to a common coordinate system nor bias field corrected. Evaluations included segmentation, Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and qualitative inspection. Regarding results, all three DDPMs generated coherent MR brain volumes. The velocity and flow prediction models achieved lower FIDs than the sample prediction model. However, all three models had higher FIDs compared to real images across multiple cohorts. In a permutation experiment, the generated brain regional volume distributions differed statistically from real data. However, the velocity and flow prediction models had fewer statistically different volume distributions in the thalamus and putamen. In conclusion this work presents and releases the first 3D non-latent diffusion model for brain data without skullstripping or registration. Despite the negative results in statistical testing, the presented DDPMs are capable of generating high-resolution 3D $T_1$-weighted brain images.

      <title>A fragile zero-watermarking method based on dual quaternion matrix decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical images play a crucial role in assisting diagnosis, remote consultation, and academic research. However, during the transmission and sharing process, they face serious risks of copyright ownership and content tampering. Therefore, protecting medical images is of great importance. As an effective means of image copyright protection, zero-watermarking technology focuses on constructing watermarks without modifying the original carrier by extracting its stable features, which provides an ideal approach for protecting medical images. This paper aims to propose a fragile zero-watermarking model based on dual quaternion matrix decomposition, which utilizes the operational relationship between the standard part and the dual part of dual quaternions to correlate the original carrier image with the watermark image, and generates zero-watermarking information based on the characteristics of dual quaternion matrix decomposition, ultimately achieving copyright protection and content tampering detection for medical images.</description>

      <title>Towards robust quantitative photoacoustic tomography via learned iterative methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a medical imaging modality that can provide high-resolution tissue images based on the optical absorption. Classical reconstruction methods for quantifying the absorption coefficients rely on sufficient prior information to overcome noisy and imperfect measurements. As these methods utilize computationally expensive forward models, the computation becomes slow, limiting their potential for time-critical applications. As an alternative approach, deep learning-based reconstruction methods have been established for faster and more accurate reconstructions. However, most of these methods rely on having a large amount of training data, which is not the case in practice. In this work, we adopt the model-based learned iterative approach for the use in Quantitative PAT (QPAT), in which additional information from the model is iteratively provided to the updating networks, allowing better generalizability with scarce training data. We compare the performance of different learned updates based on gradient descent, Gauss-Newton, and Quasi-Newton methods. The learning tasks are formulated as greedy, requiring iterate-wise optimality, as well as end-to-end, where all networks are trained jointly. The implemented methods are tested with ideal simulated data as well as against a digital twin dataset that emulates scarce training data and high modeling error.</description>

      <title>Combined fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging of tozuleristide in muscle tissue in vitro -- toward optically-guided solid tumor surgery: feasibility studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) can deliver high-contrast, video-rate, non-contact imaging of tumor-targeted contrast agents with the potential to guide surgeries excising solid tumors. However, it has been met with skepticism for wide-margin excision due to sensitivity and resolution limitations at depths larger than ~5 mm in tissue. To address this limitation, fast-sweep photoacoustic-ultrasound (PAUS) imaging is proposed to complement NIRF. In an exploratory in vitro feasibility study using dark-red bovine muscle tissue, we observed that PAUS scanning can identify tozuleristide, a clinical stage investigational imaging agent, at a concentration of 20 uM from the background at depths of up to ~34 mm, highly extending the capabilities of NIRF alone. The capability of spectroscopic PAUS imaging was tested by direct injection of 20 uM tozuleristide into bovine muscle tissue at a depth of ~ 8 mm. It is shown that laser-fluence compensation and strong clutter suppression enabled by the unique capabilities of the fast-sweep approach greatly improve spectroscopic accuracy and the PA detection limit, and strongly reduce image artifacts. Thus, the combined NIRF-PAUS approach can be promising for comprehensive pre- (with PA) and intra- (with NIRF) operative solid tumor detection and wide-margin excision in optically guided solid tumor surgery.</description>

      <title>Navigated hepatic tumor resection using intraoperative ultrasound imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This proof-of-concept study evaluates feasibility and accuracy of an ultrasound-based navigation system for open liver surgery. Unlike most conventional systems that rely on registration to preoperative imaging, the proposed system provides navigation-guided resection using 3D models generated from intraoperative ultrasound.
  Methods: A pilot study was conducted in 25 patients undergoing resection of liver metastases. The first five cases served to optimize the workflow. Intraoperatively, an electromagnetic sensor compensated for organ motion, after which an ultrasound volume was acquired. Vasculature was segmented automatically and tumors semi-automatically using region-growing (n=15) or a deep learning algorithm (n=5). The resulting 3D model was visualized alongside tracked surgical instruments. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the distance between surgical clips and tumors in the navigation software with the same distance on a postoperative CT of the resected specimen.
  Results: Navigation was successfully established in all 20 patients. However, four cases were excluded from accuracy assessment due to intraoperative sensor detachment (n=3) or incorrect data recording (n=1). The complete navigation workflow was operational within 5-10 minutes. In 16 evaluable patients, 78 clip-to-tumor distances were analyzed. The median navigation accuracy was 3.2 mm [IQR: 2.8-4.8 mm], and an R0 resection was achieved in 15/16 (93.8%) patients and one patient had an R1 vascular resection.
  Conclusion: Navigation based solely on intra-operative ultrasound is feasible and accurate for liver surgery. This registration-free approach paves the way for simpler and more accurate image guidance systems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian model selection and misspecification testing in imaging inverse problems only from noisy and partial measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern imaging techniques heavily rely on Bayesian statistical models to address difficult image reconstruction and restoration tasks. This paper addresses the objective evaluation of such models in settings where ground truth is unavailable, with a focus on model selection and misspecification diagnosis. Existing unsupervised model evaluation methods are often unsuitable for computational imaging due to their high computational cost and incompatibility with modern image priors defined implicitly via machine learning models. We herein propose a general methodology for unsupervised model selection and misspecification detection in Bayesian imaging sciences, based on a novel combination of Bayesian cross-validation and data fission, a randomized measurement splitting technique. The approach is compatible with any Bayesian imaging sampler, including diffusion and plug-and-play samplers. We demonstrate the methodology through experiments involving various scoring rules and types of model misspecification, where we achieve excellent selection and detection accuracy with a low computational cost.</description>

      <title>Multi-hop Parallel Image Semantic Communication for Distortion Accumulation Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing semantic communication schemes primarily focus on single-hop scenarios, overlooking the challenges of multi-hop wireless image transmission. As semantic communication is inherently lossy, distortion accumulates over multiple hops, leading to significant performance degradation. To address this, we propose the multi-hop parallel image semantic communication (MHPSC) framework, which introduces a parallel residual compensation link at each hop against distortion accumulation. To minimize the associated transmission bandwidth overhead, a coarse-to-fine residual compression scheme is designed. A deep learning-based residual compressor first condenses the residuals, followed by the adaptive arithmetic coding (AAC) for further compression. A residual distribution estimation module predicts the prior distribution for the AAC to achieve fine compression performances. This approach ensures robust multi-hop image transmission with only a minor increase in transmission bandwidth. Experimental results confirm that MHPSC outperforms both existing semantic communication and traditional separated coding schemes.</description>

      <title>SYNAPSE-Net: A Unified Framework with Lesion-Aware Hierarchical Gating for Robust Segmentation of Heterogeneous Brain Lesions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022 Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source code and the pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/mubid-01/SYNAPSE-Net-pre.</description>

      <title>Dark-Field X-Ray Imaging Significantly Improves Deep-Learning based Detection of Synthetic Early-Stage Lung Tumors in Preclinical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is the current standard for lung cancer screening, yet its adoption and accessibility remain limited. Many regions lack LDCT infrastructure, and even among those screened, early-stage cancer detection often yield false positives, as shown in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with a sensitivity of 93.8 percent and a false-positive rate of 26.6 percent. We aim to investigate whether X-ray dark-field imaging (DFI) radiograph, a technique sensitive to small-angle scatter from alveolar microstructure and less susceptible to organ shadowing, can significantly improve early-stage lung tumor detection when coupled with deep-learning segmentation. Using paired attenuation (ATTN) and DFI radiograph images of euthanized mouse lungs, we generated realistic synthetic tumors with irregular boundaries and intensity profiles consistent with physical lung contrast. A U-Net segmentation network was trained on small patches using either ATTN, DFI, or a combination of ATTN and DFI channels.Results show that the DFI-only model achieved a true-positive detection rate of 83.7 percent, compared with 51 percent for ATTN-only, while maintaining comparable specificity (90.5 versus 92.9 percent). The combined ATTN and DFI input achieved 79.6 percent sensitivity and 97.6 percent specificity. In conclusion, DFI substantially improves early-tumor detectability in comparison to standard attenuation radiography and shows potential as an accessible, low-cost, low-dose alternative for pre-clinical or limited-resource screening where LDCT is unavailable.</description>

      <title>LV-UNet: A Lightweight and Vanilla Model for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large models have achieved significant progress in computer vision, challenges such as optimization complexity, the intricacy of transformer architectures, computational constraints, and practical application demands highlight the importance of simpler model designs in medical image segmentation. This need is particularly pronounced in mobile medical devices, which require lightweight, deployable models with real-time performance. However, existing lightweight models often suffer from poor robustness across datasets, limiting their widespread adoption. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LV-UNet, a lightweight and vanilla model that leverages pre-trained MobileNetv3-Large backbones and incorporates fusible modules. LV-UNet employs an enhanced deep training strategy and switches to a deployment mode during inference by re-parametrization, significantly reducing parameter count and computational overhead. Experimental results on ISIC 2016, BUSI, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, and Kvair-SEG datasets demonstrate a better trade-off between performance and the computational load. The code will be released at https://github.com/juntaoJianggavin/LV-UNet.</description>

      <title>Augmented Reality-based Guidance with Deformable Registration in Head and Neck Tumor Resection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has one of the highest rates of recurrence cases among solid malignancies. Recurrence rates can be reduced by improving positive margins localization. Frozen section analysis (FSA) of resected specimens is the gold standard for intraoperative margin assessment. However, because of the complex 3D anatomy and the significant shrinkage of resected specimens, accurate margin relocation from specimen back onto the resection site based on FSA results remains challenging. We propose a novel deformable registration framework that uses both the pre-resection upper surface and the post-resection site of the specimen to incorporate thickness information into the registration process. The proposed method significantly improves target registration error (TRE), demonstrating enhanced adaptability to thicker specimens. In tongue specimens, the proposed framework improved TRE by up to 33% as compared to prior deformable registration. Notably, tongue specimens exhibit complex 3D anatomies and hold the highest clinical significance compared to other head and neck specimens from the buccal and skin. We analyzed distinct deformation behaviors in different specimens, highlighting the need for tailored deformation strategies. To further aid intraoperative visualization, we also integrated this framework with an augmented reality-based auto-alignment system. The combined system can accurately and automatically overlay the deformed 3D specimen mesh with positive margin annotation onto the resection site. With a pilot study of the AR guided framework involving two surgeons, the integrated system improved the surgeons' average target relocation error from 9.8 cm to 4.8 cm.</description>

      <title>Highly Undersampled MRI Reconstruction via a Single Posterior Sampling of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incoherent k-space undersampling and deep learning-based reconstruction methods have shown great success in accelerating MRI. However, the performance of most previous methods will degrade dramatically under high acceleration factors, e.g., 8$\times$ or higher. Recently, denoising diffusion models (DM) have demonstrated promising results in solving this issue; however, one major drawback of the DM methods is the long inference time due to a dramatic number of iterative reverse posterior sampling steps. In this work, a Single Step Diffusion Model-based reconstruction framework, namely SSDM-MRI, is proposed for restoring MRI images from highly undersampled k-space. The proposed method achieves one-step reconstruction by first training a conditional DM and then iteratively distilling this model four times using an iterative selective distillation algorithm, which works synergistically with a shortcut reverse sampling strategy for model inference. Comprehensive experiments were carried out on both publicly available fastMRI brain and knee images, as well as an in-house multi-echo GRE (QSM) subject. Overall, the results showed that SSDM-MRI outperformed other methods in terms of numerical metrics (e.g., PSNR and SSIM), error maps, image fine details, and latent susceptibility information hidden in MRI phase images. In addition, the reconstruction time for a 320$\times$320 brain slice of SSDM-MRI is only 0.45 second, which is only comparable to that of a simple U-net, making it a highly effective solution for MRI reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>Poisson Informed Retinex Network for Extreme Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-light image denoising and enhancement are challenging, especially when traditional noise assumptions, such as Gaussian noise, do not hold in majority. In many real-world scenarios, such as low-light imaging, noise is signal-dependent and is better represented as Poisson noise. In this work, we address the problem of denoising images degraded by Poisson noise under extreme low-light conditions. We introduce a light-weight deep learning-based method that integrates Retinex based decomposition with Poisson denoising into a unified encoder-decoder network. The model simultaneously enhances illumination and suppresses noise by incorporating a Poisson denoising loss to address signal-dependent noise. Without prior requirement for reflectance and illumination, the network learns an effective decomposition process while ensuring consistent reflectance and smooth illumination without causing any form of color distortion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed low-light illumination enhancement method. Our method significantly improves visibility and brightness in low-light conditions, while preserving image structure and color constancy under ambient illumination.</description>

      <title>Transformers in Medicine: Improving Vision-Language Alignment for Medical Image Captioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a transformer-based multimodal framework for generating clinically relevant captions for MRI scans. Our system combines a DEiT-Small vision transformer as an image encoder, MediCareBERT for caption embedding, and a custom LSTM-based decoder. The architecture is designed to semantically align image and textual embeddings, using hybrid cosine-MSE loss and contrastive inference via vector similarity. We benchmark our method on the MultiCaRe dataset, comparing performance on filtered brain-only MRIs versus general MRI images against state-of-the-art medical image captioning methods including BLIP, R2GenGPT, and recent transformer-based approaches. Results show that focusing on domain-specific data improves caption accuracy and semantic alignment. Our work proposes a scalable, interpretable solution for automated medical image reporting.</description>

      <title>Spatially Regularized Super-Resolved Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (SR$^2$-CSD) of Diffusion MRI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) is widely used to estimate the white matter fiber orientation distribution (FOD) from diffusion MRI data. Its angular resolution depends on the maximum spherical harmonic order ($l_{max}$): low $l_{max}$ yields smooth but poorly resolved FODs, while high $l_{max}$, as in Super-CSD, enables resolving fiber crossings with small inter-fiber angles but increases sensitivity to noise. In this proof-of-concept study, we introduce Spatially Regularized Super-Resolved CSD (SR$^2$-CSD), a novel method that regularizes Super-CSD using a spatial FOD prior estimated via a self-calibrated total variation denoiser. We evaluated SR$^2$-CSD against CSD and Super-CSD across four datasets: (i) the HARDI-2013 challenge numerical phantom, assessing angular and peak number errors across multiple signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels and CSD variants (single-/multi-shell, single-/multi-tissue); (ii) the Sherbrooke in vivo dataset, evaluating spatial coherence of FODs; (iii) a six-subject test-retest dataset acquired with both full (96 gradient directions) and subsampled (45 directions) protocols, assessing reproducibility; and (iv) the DiSCo phantom, evaluating tractography accuracy under varying SNR levels and multiple noise repetitions. Across all evaluations, SR$^2$-CSD consistently reduced angular and peak number errors, improved spatial coherence, enhanced test-retest reproducibility, and yielded connectivity matrices more strongly correlated with ground-truth. Most improvements were statistically significant under multiple-comparison correction. These results demonstrate that incorporating spatial priors into CSD is feasible, mitigates estimation instability, and improves FOD reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Panoramic Out-of-Distribution Segmentation for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Panoramic imaging enables capturing 360{\deg} images with an ultra-wide Field-of-View (FoV) for dense omnidirectional perception, which is critical to applications, such as autonomous driving and augmented reality, etc. However, current panoramic semantic segmentation methods fail to identify outliers, and pinhole Out-of-distribution Segmentation (OoS) models perform unsatisfactorily in the panoramic domain due to background clutter and pixel distortions. To address these issues, we introduce a new task, Panoramic Out-of-distribution Segmentation (PanOoS), with the aim of achieving comprehensive and safe scene understanding. Furthermore, we propose the first solution, POS, which adapts to the characteristics of panoramic images through text-guided prompt distribution learning. Specifically, POS integrates a disentanglement strategy designed to materialize the cross-domain generalization capability of CLIP. The proposed Prompt-based Restoration Attention (PRA) optimizes semantic decoding by prompt guidance and self-adaptive correction, while Bilevel Prompt Distribution Learning (BPDL) refines the manifold of per-pixel mask embeddings via semantic prototype supervision. Besides, to compensate for the scarcity of PanOoS datasets, we establish two benchmarks: DenseOoS, which features diverse outliers in complex environments, and QuadOoS, captured by a quadruped robot with a panoramic annular lens system. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of POS, with AuPRC improving by 34.25% and FPR95 decreasing by 21.42% on DenseOoS, outperforming state-of-the-art pinhole-OoS methods. Moreover, POS achieves leading closed-set segmentation capabilities and advances the development of panoramic understanding. Code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/MengfeiD/PanOoS.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Software System for Low-Cost, Brightfield Segmentation: Algorithmic Implementation for Cytometric Auto-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11354v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bright-field microscopy, a cost-effective solution for live-cell culture, is often the only resource available, along with standard CPUs, for many low-budget labs. The inherent challenges of bright-field images -- their noisiness, low contrast, and dynamic morphology -- coupled with a lack of GPU resources and complex software interfaces, hinder the desired research output. This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical applications -- particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility</description>
