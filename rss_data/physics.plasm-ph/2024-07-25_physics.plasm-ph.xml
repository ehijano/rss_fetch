      <title>Ion-electron instabilities in the precursor of weakly magnetized, transrelativistic shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks are known to induce turbulence via upstream ion reflection within the precursor region. This study elucidates the properties of electrostatic and electromagnetic instabilities, exploring their role over the transrelativistic range. Notably, the growth of oblique Buneman waves and previously overlooked, secondary small-scale ion-electron instabilities is observed to be particularly promoted in the relativistic regime. Furthermore, the growth of large-scale electromagnetic modes encounters severe limitations in any cold, baryon-loaded precursor. It is argued that electron pre-heating in electrostatic modes may alleviate these constraints, facilitating the subsequent growth of large-scale filamentation modes in the precursor of transrelativistic shocks.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Alfven-Wave Dynamics and Pre-Merger Emission from Crustal Oscillations in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars have solid crusts threaded by strong magnetic fields. Perturbations in the crust can excite non-radial oscillations, which can in turn launch Alfven waves into the magnetosphere. In the case of a compact binary close to merger involving at least one neutron star, this can happen through tidal interactions causing resonant excitations that shatter the neutron star crust. We present the first numerical study that elucidates the dynamics of Alfven waves launched in a compact binary magnetosphere. We seed a magnetic field perturbation on the neutron star crust, which we then evolve in fully general-relativistic force-free electrodynamics using a GPU-based implementation. We show that Alfven waves steepen nonlinearly before reaching the orbital light cylinder, form flares, and dissipate energy in a transient current sheet. Our results predict radio and X-ray precursor emission from this process.</description>

      <title>Ion temperature and density gradient driven instabilities and turbulence in Wendelstein 7-X close to the stability threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrostatic gyrokinetic instabilities and turbulence in the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator are studied. Particular attention is paid to the ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) instability and its character close to marginal stability [Floquet-type turbulence (Zocco et al. 2022) with no electron temperature gradient]. The flux-tube version of the $\delta$f code stella (Barnes et al. 2019) is used to run linear and nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations with kinetic electrons. The nature of the dominant instability depends on the wavelength perpendicular to the magnetic field, and the results are conveniently displayed in stability diagrams that take this dependence into account. This approach highlights the presence of universal instabilities, which are less unstable but have longer wavelengths than other modes. A quasi-linear estimate of the heat flux suggests they are relevant for transport. Close to the stability threshold, the linear eigenmodes and turbulence form highly extended structures along the computational domain if the magnetic shear is small. Numerical experiments and diagnostics are undertaken to assess the resulting radial localisation of the turbulence, which affects the interaction of the latter with zonal flows. Increasing the amplitude of the magnetic shear (e.g. through current drive) has a stabilising effect on the turbulence and thus reduces the nonlinear energy transport.</description>

      <title>Klystron type X-ray crystal-based Volume Free Electron Laser (XVFEL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Typical parameters of electron bunches available now in undulator X-ray FELs enable generation of induced radiation in crystal-based X-ray VFEL. An important peculiarity of an undulator X-ray FEL is electron bunch spatial modulation with the period equal to the wavelength of the produced radiation. Therefore, XFEL can be considered as a modulator of electron bunch density. As a result a facility combining an undulator, which produced a modulated beam, and a crystal, on which the modulated beam is incident, can be considered to be similar to klystron, which is a well-known source for microwaves emission. Use of pre-modulated beams enables to generate and observe superradiation and induced radiation in a crystal-based X-ray VFEL.</description>
