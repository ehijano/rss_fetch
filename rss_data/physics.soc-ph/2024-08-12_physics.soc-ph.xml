      <title>Eigenvector Localization and Universal Regime Transitions in Multiplex Networks: A Perturbative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the transition between layer-localized and delocalized regimes in a general contact-based social contagion model on multiplex networks. We begin by analyzing the layer-localization to delocalization transition through the inverse participation ratio (IPR). Utilizing perturbation analysis, we derive a new analytical approximation for the transition point and an expression for the IPR in the non-dominant layer within the localized regime. Additionally, we examine the transition from a non-dominant to a dominant regime, providing an analytical expression for the transition point. These transitions are further explored and validated through dynamical simulations.</description>

      <title>Social contagion under hybrid interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threshold-driven models and game theory are two fundamental paradigms for describing human interactions in social systems. However, in mimicking social contagion processes, models that simultaneously incorporate these two mechanisms have been largely overlooked. Here, we study a general model that integrates hybrid interaction forms by assuming that a part of nodes in a network are driven by the threshold mechanism, while the remaining nodes exhibit imitation behavior governed by their rationality (under the game-theoretic framework). Our results reveal that the spreading dynamics are determined by the payoff of adoption. For positive payoffs, increasing the density of highly rational nodes can promote the adoption process, accompanied by a hybrid phase transition. The degree of rationality can regulate the spreading speed, with less rational imitators slowing down the spread. We further find that the results are opposite for negative payoffs of adoption. This model may provide valuable insights into understanding the complex dynamics of social contagion phenomena in real-world social networks.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Temporal Network Prediction and Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A social interaction (so-called higher-order event/interaction) can be regarded as the activation of the hyperlink among the corresponding individuals. Social interactions can be, thus, represented as higher-order temporal networks, that record the higher-order events occurring at each time step over time. The prediction of higher-order interactions is usually overlooked in traditional temporal network prediction methods, where a higher-order interaction is regarded as a set of pairwise interactions. The prediction of future higher-order interactions is crucial to forecast and mitigate the spread the information, epidemics and opinion on higher-order social contact networks. In this paper, we propose novel memory-based models for higher-order temporal network prediction. By using these models, we aim to predict the higher-order temporal network one time step ahead, based on the network observed in the past. Importantly, we also intent to understand what network properties and which types of previous interactions enable the prediction. The design and performance analysis of these models are supported by our analysis of the memory property of networks, e.g., similarity of the network and activity of a hyperlink over time respectively. Our models assume that a target hyperlink's future activity (active or not) depends the past activity of the target link and of all or selected types of hyperlinks that overlap with the target. We then compare the performance of both models with a baseline utilizing a pairwise temporal network prediction method. In eight real-world networks, we find that both models consistently outperform the baseline and the refined model tends to perform the best. Our models also reveal how past interactions of the target hyperlink and different types of hyperlinks that overlap with the target contribute to the prediction of the target's future activity.</description>

      <title>A model for efficient dynamical ranking in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a physics-inspired method for inferring dynamic rankings in directed temporal networks - networks in which each directed and timestamped edge reflects the outcome and timing of a pairwise interaction. The inferred ranking of each node is real-valued and varies in time as each new edge, encoding an outcome like a win or loss, raises or lowers the node's estimated strength or prestige, as is often observed in real scenarios including sequences of games, tournaments, or interactions in animal hierarchies. Our method works by solving a linear system of equations and requires only one parameter to be tuned. As a result, the corresponding algorithm is scalable and efficient. We test our method by evaluating its ability to predict interactions (edges' existence) and their outcomes (edges' directions) in a variety of applications, including both synthetic and real data. Our analysis shows that in many cases our method's performance is better than existing methods for predicting dynamic rankings and interaction outcomes.</description>
