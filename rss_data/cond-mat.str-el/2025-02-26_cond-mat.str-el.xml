      <title>Theory of Nonlinear Spectroscopy of Quantum Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) is an established method for characterizing molecules and has been proposed in the THz regime as a new tool for probing exotic excitations of quantum magnets; however, the precise nature of the coupling between pump field and spin degrees of freedom has remained unclear. Here, we develop a general response theory of 2DCS and show how magneto-electric as well as polarization couplings contribute to 2DCS in addition to the typically assumed magnetization. We propose experimental protocols to distill individual contributions, for instance from exchange-striction or spin current mechanism, when the electric field couples to terms quadratic in spin operators. We provide example calculations for the paradigmatic twisted Kitaev chain material $\mathrm{CoNb}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{6}$ and highlight the crucial role of contributions from cross-coupling between polarization and magnetic nonlinear susceptibilities. Our work paves the way for systematic studies of light-matter couplings in quantum magnets and for establishing 2DCS as a versatile tool for probing fractional excitations of exotic magnetic quantum phases.</description>

      <title>On the Electronic Structure of Kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Cs, Rb) have become a fascinating materials platform following the discovery of many novel quantum states due to the interplay between electronic correlation, topology, and geometry. Understanding their physical origin requires constructing effective theories that capture the low-energy electronic structure and electronic interactions. While the band structure calculated by density functional theory (DFT) broadly agrees with experiments in the unbroken symmetry phase, the multiorbital nature challenges a proper understanding of the band structure and its description by tight-binding models. Here, we point out the unusual and puzzling properties of the DFT electronic structure, including the sublattice type of the van Hove singularities, the geometric shape of the Fermi surface, and the orbital content of the low-energy band dispersion, which cannot be described by the commonly used one-orbital or multiorbital kagome tight-binding models. We address these fundamental puzzles and develop an extended Slater-Koster formalism that can successfully resolve these issues. We discover the important role of site-symmetry and interorbital hopping structure and provide a concrete multiorbital tight-binding model description of the electronic structure for $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ and the family of ``135'' compounds with other transition metals. This is a crucial step toward studying the effects of electron-electron interactions for the correlated and topological states in kagome metals and superconductors.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Chern Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern theory of polarization does not apply in its original form to systems with non-trivial band topology. Chern insulators are one such example since they are insulating in the bulk but exhibit metallic edge states, complicating the definition of polarization. Wannier functions formed a key ingredient of the original modern theory of polarization, but it has been considered that these cannot be applied to Chern insulators since they are no longer exponentially localized and the Wannier center is no longer gauge invariant. In this Letter, we provide an unambiguous definition of absolute polarization for a Chern insulator in terms of the Zak phase. We obtain our expression by studying the non-quantized fractional charge bound to lattice dislocations and it can be computed directly from bulk quantities and makes no assumption on the edge state filling. Our result is fully consistent with previous results on the quantized charge bound to dislocations in the presence of crystalline symmetry. At the same time, our result is more general since it also applies to Chern insulators which do not have crystalline symmetries other than translations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18166v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a functional interpolation approach within the auxiliary master equation framework to efficiently and accurately solve correlated impurity problems in nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). By leveraging a near-exact auxiliary bath representation, the method estimates corrections via interpolation over a few bath realisations, significantly reducing computational cost and increasing accuracy. We illustrate the approach on the Anderson impurity model and on the Hubbard model within DMFT, capturing equilibrium and long-lived photodoped states.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement of fermionic gapless symmetry protected topological phases in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement can be an effective diagnostic tool for probing topological phases protected by global symmetries. Recently, the notion of nontrivial topology in critical systems has been proposed and is attracting growing attention. In this work, as a concrete example, we explore the quantum entanglement properties of fermionic gapless topological states by constructing exactly solvable models based on stacked multiple Kitaev chains. We first analytically establish the global phase diagram using entanglement entropy and reveal three topologically distinct gapped phases with different winding numbers, along with three topologically distinct transition lines separating them. Importantly, we unambiguously demonstrate that two transition lines exhibit fundamentally different topological properties despite sharing the same central charge. Specifically, they display nontrivial topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary conditions, thereby generalizing the Li-Haldane bulk-boundary correspondence to a broader class of fermionic gapless topological states. Additionally, we identify a novel Lifshitz multicritical point at the intersection of the three transition lines, which also exhibits nontrivial topological degeneracy. This work provides a valuable reference for investigating gapless topological phases of matter from the perspective of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Density functional theory of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering in the quasi-one-dimensional dimer iridate Ba3InIr2O9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the electronic structure of Ba3InIr2O9 within the density-functional theory (DFT) using the generalized gradient approximation while considering strong Coulomb correlations (GGA+$U$) in the framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital band-structure method. We have investigated resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra at the Ir L3 K edge. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data. The RIXS spectrum of Ba3InIr2O9 at the Ir L3 edge possesses several sharp features below 2 eV corresponding to transitions within the Ir tg levels. The excitation located from 2 to 5 eV is due to tg -&gt; eg transitions. The third wide structure situated at 5-12 eV appears due to charge transfer transitions. We have also presented comprehensive theoretical calculations of the RIXS spectrum at the oxygen K edge.</description>

      <title>Interplay of superconducting, metallic, and crystalline states of composite fermions at $\nu{=}1/6$ in wide quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence for developing fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at filling fraction $\nu{=}1/6$ and $1/8$ has recently been reported in wide GaAs quantum wells [Wang \emph{et al.}, PRL {\bf 134}, 046502 (2025)]. In this article, we theoretically investigate the nature of the state at $\nu{=}1/6$ as a function of the quantum well width and the density by considering composite-fermion (CF) crystals, CF Fermi sea, and various kinds of paired CF states. The $f$-wave paired state has the lowest energy among the paired CF states. However, for parameters of interest, the energies of the CF crystal, the CF Fermi liquid, and the $f$-wave paired CF state are too close to call. We, therefore, predict that {\it if} the FQHE at $\nu{=}1/6$ is experimentally confirmed, this state would be an $f$-wave paired state of CFs, which can be verified by measurement of its thermal Hall conductance. Exact diagonalization studies for systems with up to 8 electrons show that the ground states at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ are incompressible for all widths and densities we have considered and well described by the corresponding Laughlin and Jain states. We propose a phase diagram for large quantum well widths and densities in which at zero disorder, incompressible FQHE states are stabilized at $\nu{=}n/(6n{\pm} 1)$ and $\nu{=}1/6$, but in between these fillings the CF crystal is stabilized. With disorder, which creates a spatial variation in the filling factor, two regimes are identified: (i) for small disorder, when the incompressible states percolate at the special fillings, FQHE with quantized Hall plateaus and vanishing longitudinal resistance should occur; and (ii) for larger disorder, when the CF crystal percolates, the longitudinal resistance rises with decreasing temperature but the domains of FQHE liquid produce minima at the special filling factors. The experiments are consistent with the latter scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the recently discovered multiple superconducting states in rhombohedral graphene quarter metal. We demonstrate that one of these states features a single-spin, single-valley, single-band, single-Fermi-pocket parent state and is most likely a chiral topological pair-density wave, marked by a threefold symmetry that may not be spontaneously broken, unpaired Majorana zero modes at edges, vortices, and dislocations, and an anomalous intrinsic superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>Shining light on collective modes in moir\'e fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that collective excitations and optical responses of moir\'e fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) drastically differ from those of standard fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in a Landau level. By constructing a variational wavefunction that incorporates the moir\'e lattice effect, we capture the collective modes in FCIs across a range of crystal momenta including the roton minimum. Interestingly, new collective modes -- ``fractional excitons'' -- are found in the long wavelength limit ($\boldsymbol{q} \rightarrow 0$) at low energy below the excitation continuum, distinct from the FQH case. Some of these modes are optically active and manifest as sharp peaks in optical conductivity at THz frequency. We further show that intraband optical absorption and spectral weight in twisted ${\rm MoTe}_2$ are highly tunable by the displacement field. Our work thus establishes optical spectroscopy as a powerful tool to illuminate the unique collective modes of moir\'e FCIs.</description>

      <title>Detecting emergent 1-form symmetries with quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-from symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system and they can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose a quantitative criterion for the existence of 1-form symmetries motivated by quantum error correction (QEC). We show that the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition revealed from the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The latter can be solved by mapping the ensemble of post-measurement states to the partition sum of a random bond Ising model along the Nishimori line. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to detect 1-form symmetries with a global Minimal-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As an application of our protocol, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transitions characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately detected by a disorder parameter. By exploiting ideas from quantum error correction, our work develops an information-theoretic criterion for emergent 1-from symmetries, which furthers our understanding of exotic symmetries and offers practical routes toward their characterization.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnetoroton bands in moir\'e materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent realizations of the Hofstadter butterfly and fractional Chern insulators in moir\'e materials have introduced a new ingredient, a periodic lattice potential, to the study of quantum Hall phases. While the fractionalized states in moir\'e systems are expected to be in the same universality class as their counterparts in Landau levels, the periodic potential can have qualitative and quantitative effects on physical observables. Here, we examine how the magnetoroton collective modes of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are altered by external periodic potentials. Employing a single-mode-approximation, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for the low-energy neutral excitations expressed in terms of three-point density correlation functions, which are computed using Monte Carlo. Our analysis is applicable to FQH states in graphene with a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrate and also to fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers. We predict experimentally testable trends in the THz absorption characteristics of FCI and FQH states and estimate the external potential strength at which a soft-mode phase transition occurs between FQH and charge density wave (CDW) states.</description>

      <title>Developing fractional quantum Hall states at even-denominator fillings 1/6 and 1/8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the extreme quantum limit, when the Landau level filling factor $\nu&lt;1$, the dominant electron-electron interaction in low-disorder two-dimensional electron systems leads to exotic many-body phases. The ground states at even-denominator $\nu=$ 1/2 and 1/4 are typically Fermi seas of composite fermions carrying two and four flux quanta, surrounded by the Jain fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) at odd-denominator fillings $\nu=p/(2p\pm1)$ and $\nu=p/(4p\pm1)$, where $p$ is an integer. For $\nu&lt;$ 1/5, an insulating behavior, which is generally believed to signal the formation of a pinned Wigner crystal, is seen. Our experiments on ultrahigh-quality, dilute, GaAs two-dimensional electron systems reveal developing FQHSs at $\nu=p/(6p\pm1)$ and $\nu=p/(8p\pm1)$, manifested by magnetoresistance minima superimposed on the insulating background. In stark contrast to $\nu=$ 1/2 and 1/4, however, we observe a pronounced, sharp minimum in magnetoresistance at $\nu=$ 1/6 and a somewhat weaker minimum at $\nu=$ 1/8, suggesting developing FQHSs, likely stabilized by the pairing of composite fermions that carry six and eight flux quanta. Our results signal the unexpected entry, in ultrahigh-quality samples, of FQHSs at even-denominator fillings 1/6 and 1/8, which are likely to harbor non-Abelian anyon excitations.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of machine learning, physicists have been exploring its new applications in solving or alleviating the curse of dimensionality in many-body problems. In order to accurately reflect the underlying physics of the problem, domain knowledge must be encoded into the machine learning algorithms. In this work, inspired by field theory, we propose a new set of machine learning models called effective field neural networks (EFNNs) that can automatically and efficiently capture important many-body interactions through multiple self-refining processes. Taking the classical $3$-spin infinite-range model and the quantum double exchange model as case studies, we explicitly demonstrate that EFNNs significantly outperform fully-connected deep neural networks (DNNs) and the effective model. Furthermore, with the help of convolution operations, the EFNNs learned in a small system can be seamlessly used in a larger system without additional training and the relative errors even decrease, which further demonstrates the efficacy of EFNNs in representing core physical behaviors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport in Reduced Graphene Oxide Measured by Scanning Probe Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report combined scanning probe microscopy and transport measurements to investigate the local electronic transport properties of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) devices. We demonstrate that the quantum transport properties in these materials can be significantly tuned by the electrostatic potential applied by an atomic force microscope (AFM) conducting tip. Scanning gate microscopy measurements show a distinct p-type response, where the AFM tip locally gates the rGO, thereby modulating the transport current. Additional scanning impedance microscopy measurements indicate shifts in the Fermi energy under different gating conditions, highlighting the strong influence of local electrostatic potentials on the transport characteristics of rGO. We demonstrate that the interplay between the tip-induced Fermi level shifts and defect-mediated scattering processes plays a key role in determining the observed transport behavior. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of scattering mechanisms, particularly resonant scattering caused by impurities or structural defects, in determining low-dimensional transport behavior in rGO. Notably, rGO exhibits resonant scattering effects akin to those seen in one-dimensional systems like carbon nanotubes, despite its two-dimensional structure. These insights advance our current understanding of charge transport in rGO, and have important implications for its use in nanoscale electronics, flexible sensors, and tunable optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous energy gap in superconducting La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ heterostructures</title>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in bilayer nickelate thin films under ambient pressure provides an opportunity to directly investigate characteristic energy scales of the superconducting state from electronic structure. Here, we successfully probe the energy gap and dispersion renormalization in one unit-cell La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films epitaxially grown on SrLaAlO$_4$ substrates, by developing an ultra-high vacuum quenching technique for in-situ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. The energy gap is observed on the underlying Fermi surface without showing a node along the Brillouin zone diagonal. This gap exhibits particle-hole symmetric behavior and persists to a temperature higher than the superconducting transition temperature, indicating the existence of a pseudogap. An abrupt band renormalization is observed with a dispersion anomaly at ~70 meV below Fermi level, pointing to another energy scale besides the energy gap. These observations provide initial information on fundamental properties of the superconducting state in bilayer nickelates under ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Continuously tunable anomalous Hall crystals in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of electronic interactions and nontrivial topology can give rise to a wealth of exotic quantum states. A notable example is the formation of Wigner crystals driven by strong electron-electron interactions. When these electronic crystals emerge in a parent band carrying a large Berry curvature, they can exhibit topologically nontrivial properties as anomalous Hall crystals, spontaneously breaking both continuous translational symmetry and time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report the experimental observation of tunable anomalous Hall crystals in rhombohedral heptalayer graphene moir\'e superlattices. At filling factors near one electron per moir\'e unit cell (v=1), we identify a series of incommensurate Chern insulators with a Chern number of C=1. Furthermore, we observe spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking spanning the entire filling range from v=1 to v=2, manifesting as anomalous Hall effects with pronounced magnetic hysteresis. Notably, anomalous Hall crystals with a high Chern number C=3 are observed over generic fillings ranging from v=1.5 to v=2. These anomalous Hall crystals are incommensurate with the moir\'e superlattice and exhibit dispersive fan diagrams consistent with the Streda formula, with their positions continuously tunable through displacement fields. Remarkably, these partially filled Chern insulators display Chern numbers distinct from their parent bands. Our findings demonstrate the rich variety of electronic crystalline states in rhombohedral graphene moir\'e superlattices, offering valuable insights into the strongly correlated topological phases.</description>

Abstract: Interfacial superconductivity discovered in bilayer nickelate heterostructures opens new avenues for effective tunability and control. Here, we report the superconductor-insulator transition in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$/SrLaAlO$_4$ interfaces, with corresponding electronic structures revealed using synchrotron low-temperature X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray linear dichroism (XLD). In addition to the valence states of each element within the films determined by XAS, XLD at the O K edge pre-peak reveals hybridizations involving both 2p$_{z}$ and 2p$_{x}$/2p$_{y}$ orbitals, which are concomitantly suppressed upon oxygen loss. Intriguingly, such oxygen loss that eliminates superconductivity, induces a qualitative XLD change at the Ni L$_{2}$ edge, implying significant transformations among 3d$_{x^{2}}$ $_{-y^{2}}$ and 3d$_{z^{2}}$ energy bands near the Fermi level. Our findings establish an element- and orbital-resolved electronic framework for the origin of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable Magnonic Bound States in the Continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low energy excitations of a magnetically ordered system are spin waves with magnon being their excitation quanta. Magnons are demonstrated to be useful for data processing and communication. To achieve magnon transport across extended distances, it is essential to minimize magnonic dissipation which can be accomplished by material engineering to reduce intrinsic damping or by spin torques that can counteract damping. This study introduces an alternative methodology to effectively reduce magnon dissipation based on magnonic bound states in the continuum (BIC). We demonstrate the approach for two antiferromagnetically coupled magnonic waveguides, with one waveguide being attached to a current carrying metallic layer. The current acts on the attached waveguide with a spin-orbit torque effectively amplifying the magnonic signal. The setup maps on a non-Hermitian system with coupled loss and more loss, enabling the formation of dissipationless magnon BIC. We investigate the necessary criteria for the formation of magnon BIC through electric currents. The influences of interlayer coupling constant, anisotropy constants and applied magnetic field on the current-induced magnon BIC are analyzed. The identified effect can be integrated in the design of magnon delay lines, offering opportunities for the enhancement of magnonic devices and circuits.</description>

Abstract: Moir\'e materials provide a remarkably tunable platform for topological and strongly correlated quantum phases of matter. Very recently, the first zero field Abelian fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) have been experimentally demonstrated and it has been theoretically predicted that non-Abelian states with Majorana fermion excitations may be realized in the nearly dispersionless minibands of these systems. Here we provide telltale evidence in terms of low-energy quantum numbers, spectral flow and entanglement spectra for the even more exotic possibility of moir\'e-based non-Abelian FCIs exhibiting Fibonacci parafermion excitations.</description>

      <title>Decoupling of Static and Dynamic Charge Correlations revealed by Uniaxial Strain in a Cuprate Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use uniaxial strain in combination with ultra-high-resolution Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) at the oxygen K- and copper L3-edges to study the excitations stemming from the charge ordering wave vector in La1.875Sr0.125CuO4. By detwinning stripe ordering, we demonstrate that the optical phonon anomalies do not show any stripe anisotropy. The low-energy charge excitations also retain an in-plane four-fold symmetry. As such, we find that both phonon and charge excitations are decoupled entirely from the strength of static charge ordering. The almost isotropic character of charge excitations is indicative of a quantum critical behaviour and remains a possible source for the strange metal properties found in the normal state of cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Heisenberg $S=1/2$ chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings using quantum Monte Carlo simulations at ultra-low temperatures, converging to the ground state. Finite-size scaling of correlation functions and excitation gaps demonstrate an exotic critical state in qualitative agreement with previous strong-disorder renormalization group calculations but with scaling exponents depending on the coupling distribution. We find dual scaling regimes of the transverse correlations versus the distance, with an $L$ independent form $C(r)=r^{-\mu}$ for $r \ll L$ and $C(r,L)=L^{-\eta}f(r/L)$ for $r/L &gt; 0$, where $\mu &gt; \eta$ and the scaling function is delivered by our analysis. These results are at variance with previous spin-wave and density-matrix renormalization group calculations, thus highlighting the power of unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Effects of the Hubbard interaction on the quantum metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum geometry provides important information about the structure and topology of quantum states in various forms of quantum matter. The information contained therein has profound effects on observable quantities such as superconducting weight, Drude weight, and optical responses. Motivated by the recent advances in flat-band interacting systems, we investigate the role of interaction effects on the quantum metric. By using the fermionic Creutz ladder as a representative system, we show that the repulsive Hubbard interaction monotonically suppresses the quantum metric. While the eigenstates and their overlap quantifying the quantum metric can be obtained exactly in the presence of interactions through exact diagonalization, this method is limited to small system sizes. Alternatively, two theoretical proposals, the generalized quantum metric and the dressed quantum metric, suggest using renormalized Green's functions to define the interacting quantum metric. By comparing these analytical approaches with results from exact diagonalization, we show that the dressed quantum metric provides a better fit to the exact diagonalization results. Our conclusion holds for both flat-band and dispersive systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets are believed to host phases of matter whose excitations are more fundamental than those of the ordered phases. When combining two such spin systems in a bilayer, strong interaction between the emergent excitations can produce phases not realized in either of its subsystems. We show that the critical fluctuations of a two-dimensional spin liquid state can induce a deconfined quantum critical point in a proximate antiferromagnet. The most relevant coupling between the associated effective field theories is given by a mixed Chern-Simons term of the emergent gauge fields in each layer. This describes a topological current-current interaction. In contrast to the local spin-spin interaction, it strongly modifies the renormalization group flow of the theory describing the N\'eel-valence-bond-solid transition of the antiferromagnet. In particular, the protected coupling constant associated with it implies non-trivial quantum critical scaling characterized by a non-universal power-law divergence of the correlation length in the critical domain and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless divergence approaching it.</description>

      <title>On the Entire Structure of the Energy Bands of 1D Moir\'{e} Superchain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a general model of two atomic chains forming a moir\'{e} pattern due to a small mismatch in their lattice spacings, given by $\theta = (a_{1} - a_{2})/a_{2}$. Assuming arbitrary single-band dispersion relations $\varepsilon_{1}(p)$ and $\varepsilon_{2}(q)$ for the chains, along with an arbitrary inter-chain coupling term $T(x)$, we show that the entire spectrum of such a one-dimensional moir\'{e} superchain is governed by a single three-term recurrence (TTR) relation. We analyze this TTR relation using the discrete WKB method and demonstrate how the entire structure of the spectrum as well as emergence of flat bands can be easily identified from a pair of upper and lower potential functions of the TTR relation. We also comment on the chiral limit of the moir\'{e} superchain, which can be viewed, in some sense, as a 1D analog of the chiral limit of Twisted Bilayer Graphene.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the Hall response of hardcore bosonic atoms on a triangular ladder in a magnetic field. To access the dynamical properties of this many-body quantum system, we employ matrix product states numerical methods. We show that the behavior of the Hall polarization, both in its saturation value and in the short-time dynamics, correlates with the features of the underlying phase diagram, which stem from the interplay of interactions and geometric frustration. This paves the way to employ the Hall response as a sensitive probe of many-body chiral quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Twist-tuned quantum criticality in moir\'e bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that moir\'e bilayer graphene at charge neutrality hosts a continuous semimetal-to-insulator quantum phase transition that can be accessed experimentally by tuning the twist angle between the two layers. For small twist angles near the first magic angle, the system realizes a Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator, characterized by circulating currents and spontaneously broken time reversal and U(1) valley symmetries. For larger twist angles above a critical value, the spectrum remains gapless down to the lowest temperatures, with a fully symmetric Dirac semimetal ground state. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory applied to a realistic model of twisted bilayer graphene, based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian augmented by screened Coulomb interactions, we find that the twist-tuned quantum phase transition is continuous. We argue that the quantum critical behavior belongs to the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY universality class, and we characterize it through an effective field theory analysis. Our theoretical predictions can be directly tested using current experimental setups incorporating the recently developed quantum twisting microscope.</description>

      <title>AC driven fractional quantum Hall systems: Uncovering unexpected features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the challenges of reaching the quantum regime and generating minimal excitations in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) under AC driving. Using the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative (UNEP) approach, we analyze weak backscattering through a quantum point contact (QPC). In both two-terminal geometries and the "anyon collider" setup, the lower bound on photoassisted backscattering noise is set by the photoassisted current rather than the DC noise predicted by Levitov's theorem. This super-Poissonian character is confirmed within the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework, where Levitov's theorem is violated, challenging the conventional interpretation of "photoassisted" noise.
  In the two-terminal geometry, we show that when the QPC has a low scaling dimension, two challenges arise: first, achieving the expected power-law behavior in the DC regime, and second, maintaining the AC quantum regime, where the drive frequency exceeds the temperature, when the DC voltage component is resonant with that drive frequency. The validity of the UNEP relations imposes a lower bound on temperature and a persisting equilibrium contribution to backscattering noise. This forces us to choose a high enough scaling dimension, for which we find that it is rather the photoconductance, often overlooked, that might exhibit spikes at resonant DC voltages, providing a reliable probe of fractional charge. Moreover, we highlight that the zero-temperature limit, frequently assumed in prior studies, including X. G. Wen's foundational work, is inappropriate in this context.
  Our findings extend beyond the FQHE to coherent conductors and Josephson or phase-slip junctions strongly coupled to an ohmic environment under AC bias, with broader implications for quantum transport and minimal excitation engineering.</description>
