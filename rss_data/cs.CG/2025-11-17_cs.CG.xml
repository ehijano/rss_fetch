      <title>Effective Resistance in Simplicial Complexes as Bilinear Forms: Generalizations and Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of effective resistance, originally introduced in electrical circuit theory, has been extended to the setting of graphs by interpreting each edge as a resistor. In this context, the effective resistance between two vertices quantifies the total opposition to current flow when a unit current is injected at one vertex and extracted at the other. Beyond its physical interpretation, the effective resistance encodes rich structural and geometric information about the underlying graph: it defines a metric on the vertex set, relates to the topology of the graph through Foster's theorem, and determines the probability of an edge appearing in a random spanning tree. Generalizations of effective resistance to simplicial complexes have been proposed in several forms, often formulated as matrix products of standard operators associated with the complex.
  In this paper, we present a twofold generalization of the effective resistance. First, we introduce a novel, basis-independent bilinear form, derived from an algebraic reinterpretation of circuit theory, that extends the classical effective resistance from graphs. Second, we extend this bilinear form to simplices, chains, and cochains within simplicial complexes. This framework subsumes and unifies all existing matrix-based formulations of effective resistance. Moreover, we establish higher-order analogues of several fundamental properties known in the graph case: (i) we prove that effective resistance induces a pseudometric on the space of chains and a metric on the space of cycles, and (ii) we provide a generalization of Foster's Theorem to simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>NervePool: A Simplicial Pooling Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For deep learning problems on graph-structured data, pooling layers are important for down sampling, reducing computational cost, and to minimize overfitting. We define a pooling layer, nervePool, for data structured as simplicial complexes, which are generalizations of graphs that include higher-dimensional simplices beyond vertices and edges; this structure allows for greater flexibility in modeling higher-order relationships. The proposed simplicial coarsening scheme is built upon partitions of vertices, which allow us to generate hierarchical representations of simplicial complexes, collapsing information in a learned fashion. NervePool builds on the learned vertex cluster assignments and extends to coarsening of higher dimensional simplices in a deterministic fashion. While in practice the pooling operations are computed via a series of matrix operations, the topological motivation is a set-theoretic construction based on unions of stars of simplices and the nerve complex.</description>

      <title>The Contiguous Art Gallery Problem is in {\Theta}(n log n)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a natural variant of the Art Gallery problem, known as the \emph{Contiguous Art Gallery problem} was proposed. Given a simple polygon $P$, the goal is to partition its boundary $\partial P$ into the smallest number of contiguous segments such that each segment is completely visible from some point in $P$. Unlike the classical Art Gallery problem, which is NP-hard, this variant is polynomial-time solvable. At SoCG~2025, three independent works presented algorithms for this problem, each achieving a running time of $O(k n^5 \log n)$ (or $O(n^6\log n)$), where $k$ is the size of an optimal solution. Interestingly, these results were obtained using entirely different approaches, yet all led to roughly the same asymptotic complexity, suggesting that such a running time might be inherent to the problem.
  We show that this is not the case. In the real RAM-model, the prevalent model in computational geometry, we present an $O(n \log n)$-time algorithm, achieving an $O(k n^4)$ factor speed-up over the previous state-of-the-art. We also give a straightforward sorting-based lower bound by reducing from the set intersection problem. We thus show that the Contiguous Art Gallery problem is in $\Theta(n \log n)$.</description>

      <title>Clean up your Mesh! Part 1: Plane and simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the geometric foundations of mesh representation through the lens of Plane-based Geometric Algebra (PGA), questioning its efficiency and expressiveness for discrete geometry. We find how $k$-simplices (vertices, edges, faces, ...) and $k$-complexes (point clouds, line complexes, meshes, ...) can be written compactly as joins of vertices and their sums, respectively. We show how a single formula for their $k$-magnitudes (amount, length, area, ...) follows naturally from PGA's Euclidean and Ideal norms. This idea is then extended to produce unified coordinate-free formulas for classical results such as volume, centre of mass, and moments of inertia for simplices and complexes of arbitrary dimensionality. Finally we demonstrate the practical use of these ideas on some real-world examples.</description>

      <title>MeshMosaic: Scaling Artist Mesh Generation via Local-to-Global Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling artist-designed meshes to high triangle numbers remains challenging for autoregressive generative models. Existing transformer-based methods suffer from long-sequence bottlenecks and limited quantization resolution, primarily due to the large number of tokens required and constrained quantization granularity. These issues prevent faithful reproduction of fine geometric details and structured density patterns. We introduce MeshMosaic, a novel local-to-global framework for artist mesh generation that scales to over 100K triangles--substantially surpassing prior methods, which typically handle only around 8K faces. MeshMosaic first segments shapes into patches, generating each patch autoregressively and leveraging shared boundary conditions to promote coherence, symmetry, and seamless connectivity between neighboring regions. This strategy enhances scalability to high-resolution meshes by quantizing patches individually, resulting in more symmetrical and organized mesh density and structure. Extensive experiments across multiple public datasets demonstrate that MeshMosaic significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometric fidelity and user preference, supporting superior detail representation and practical mesh generation for real-world applications.</description>
