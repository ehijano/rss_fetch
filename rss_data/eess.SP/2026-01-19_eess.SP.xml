      <title>Zonotope Shadow and Reflection Matching: A Novel GNSS Reflection-Based Framework for Enhanced Positioning Accuracy in Urban Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In urban areas, signal reception conditions are often poor due to reflections from buildings, resulting in inaccurate global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based positioning. Various 3D-mapping-aided (3DMA) GNSS techniques, including shadow matching, have been proposed to address this issue. However, conventional shadow matching estimates positions in a discretized manner. The accuracy of this approach is limited by the resolution of the grid points representing the candidate receiver positions, making it difficult to achieve robust urban positioning and to ensure that the position estimate satisfies user-specified protection levels or safety bounds. To overcome these limitations, zonotope shadow matching (ZSM) has been proposed, which utilizes a set-based position estimate rather than grid-based estimates. ZSM calculates the GNSS shadow--an area on the ground where the line-of-sight (LOS) is blocked and only non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals can be received--to estimate the receiver's position set. ZSM distinguishes between LOS and NLOS satellites, determining that the receiver is inside the GNSS shadow if the satellite is NLOS and outside if the satellite is LOS. However, relying solely on GNSS shadows limits the ability to sufficiently reduce the size of the receiver position set and to precisely estimate the receiver's location. To address this, we propose zonotope shadow and reflection matching (ZSRM) to enhance positioning accuracy in urban areas. The proposed ZSRM technique is validated through field tests using GNSS signals collected in an urban environment. Consequently, the RMS horizontal position error of ZSRM improved by 10.0% to 53.6% compared with ZSM, while the RMS cross-street and along-street position bounds improved by 18.0% to 50.1% and 30.7% to 59.3%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wave Gesture Recognition in ISAC: Does Reducing Sensing Airtime Hamper Accuracy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) systems require dividing airtime across their two modes. However, the specific impact of this decision on sensing performance remains unclear and underexplored. In this paper, we therefore investigate the impact on a gesture recognition system using a Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) ISAC system. With our dataset of power per beam pair gathered with two mmWave devices performing constant beam sweeps while test subjects performed distinct gestures, we train a gesture classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks. We then subsample these measurements, emulating reduced sensing airtime, showing that a sensing airtime of 25 % only reduces classification accuracy by 0.15 percentage points from full-time sensing. Alongside this high-quality sensing at low airtime, mmWave systems are known to provide extremely high data throughputs, making mmWave ISAC a prime enabler for applications such as truly wireless Extended Reality.</description>

      <title>SSC-UNet: UNet with Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning for Phonocardiography Noise Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) remains a significant global health concern affecting approximately 1\% of births worldwide. Phonocardiography has emerged as a supplementary tool to diagnose CHD cost-effectively. However, the performance of these diagnostic models highly depends on the quality of the phonocardiography, thus, noise reduction is particularly critical. Supervised UNet effectively improves noise reduction capabilities, but limited clean data hinders its application. The complex time-frequency characteristics of phonocardiography further complicate finding the balance between effectively removing noise and preserving pathological features. In this study, we proposed a self-supervised phonocardiography noise reduction model based on Noise2Noise to enable training without clean data. Augmentation and contrastive learning are applied to enhance its performance. We obtained an average SNR of 12.98 dB after filtering under 10~dB of hospital noise. Classification sensitivity after filtering was improved from 27\% to 88\%, indicating its promising pathological feature retention capabilities in practical noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Differentiating through binarized topology changes: Second-order subpixel-smoothed projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge in topology optimization (TopOpt) is that manufacturable structures, being inherently binary, are non-differentiable, creating a fundamental tension with gradient-based optimization. The subpixel-smoothed projection (SSP) method addresses this issue by smoothing sharp interfaces at the subpixel level through a first-order expansion of the filtered field. However, SSP does not guarantee differentiability under topology changes, such as the merging of two interfaces, and therefore violates the convergence guarantees of many popular gradient-based optimization algorithms. We overcome this limitation by regularizing SSP with the Hessian of the filtered field, resulting in a twice-differentiable projected density during such transitions, while still guaranteeing an almost-everywhere binary structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our second-order SSP (SSP2) methodology on both thermal and photonic problems, showing that SSP2 has faster convergence than SSP for connectivity-dominant cases -- where frequent topology changes occur -- while exhibiting comparable performance otherwise. Beyond improving convergence guarantees for CCSA optimizers, SSP2 enables the use of a broader class of optimization algorithms with stronger theoretical guarantees, such as interior-point methods. Since SSP2 adds minimal complexity relative to SSP or traditional projection schemes, it can be used as a drop-in replacement in existing TopOpt codes.</description>

      <title>UBiGTLoc: A Unified BiLSTM-Graph Transformer Localization Framework for IoT Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor nodes localization in wireless Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks is crucial for the effective operation of diverse applications, such as smart cities and smart agriculture. Existing sensor nodes localization approaches heavily rely on anchor nodes within wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Anchor nodes are sensor nodes equipped with global positioning system (GPS) receivers and thus, have known locations. These anchor nodes operate as references to localize other sensor nodes. However, the presence of anchor nodes may not always be feasible in real-world IoT scenarios. Additionally, localization accuracy can be compromised by fluctuations in Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), particularly under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. To address these challenges, we propose UBiGTLoc, a Unified Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM)-Graph Transformer Localization framework. The proposed UBiGTLoc framework effectively localizes sensor nodes in both anchor-free and anchor-presence WSNs. The framework leverages BiLSTM networks to capture temporal variations in RSSI data and employs Graph Transformer layers to model spatial relationships between sensor nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that UBiGTLoc consistently outperforms existing methods and provides robust localization across both dense and sparse WSNs while relying solely on cost-effective RSSI data.</description>

      <title>An IoT-Based Controlled Environment Storage for Prevention of Spoilage of Onion (Allium Cepa) During Post-Harvest with UV-C Disinfection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: India is the second largest producer of onions in the world, contributing over 26 million tonnes annually. However, during storage, approximately 30-40% of onions are lost due to rotting, sprouting, and weight loss. Despite being a major producer, conventional storage methods are either low-cost but ineffective (traditional storage with 40% spoilage) or highly effective but prohibitively expensive for small farmers (cold storage). This paper presents a low-cost IoT-based smart onion storage system that monitors and automatically regulates environmental parameters including temperature, humidity, and spoilage gases using ESP32 microcontroller, DHT22 sensor, MQ-135 gas sensor, and UV-C disinfection technology. The proposed system aims to reduce onion spoilage to 15-20% from the current 40-45% wastage rate while remaining affordable for small and marginal farmers who constitute the majority in India. The system is designed to be cost-effective (estimated 60k-70k INR), energy-efficient, farmer-friendly, and solar-powered.</description>

      <title>Sensor Placement for Urban Traffic Interpolation: A Data-Driven Evaluation to Inform Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data on citywide street-segment traffic volumes are essential for urban planning and sustainable mobility management. Yet such data are available only for a limited subset of streets due to the high costs of sensor deployment and maintenance. Traffic volumes on the remaining network are therefore interpolated based on existing sensor measurements. However, current sensor locations are often determined by administrative priorities rather than by data-driven optimization, leading to biased coverage and reduced estimation performance. This study provides a large-scale, real-world benchmarking of easily implementable, data-driven strategies for optimizing the placement of permanent and temporary traffic sensors, using segment-level data from Berlin (Strava bicycle counts) and Manhattan (taxi counts). It compares spatial placement strategies based on network centrality, spatial coverage, feature coverage, and active learning. In addition, the study examines temporal deployment schemes for temporary sensors. The findings highlight that spatial placement strategies that emphasize even spatial coverage and employ active learning achieve the lowest prediction errors. With only 10 sensors, they reduce the mean absolute error by over 60% in Berlin and 70% in Manhattan compared to alternatives. Temporal deployment choices further improve performance: distributing measurements evenly across weekdays reduces error by an additional 7% in Berlin and 21% in Manhattan. Together, these spatial and temporal principles allow temporary deployments to closely approximate the performance of optimally placed permanent deployments. From a policy perspective, the results indicate that cities can substantially improve data usefulness by adopting data-driven sensor placement strategies, while retaining flexibility in choosing between temporary and permanent deployments.</description>

      <title>AnyECG: Evolved ECG Foundation Model for Holistic Health Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Artificial intelligence enabled electrocardiography (AI-ECG) has demonstrated the ability to detect diverse pathologies, but most existing models focus on single disease identification, neglecting comorbidities and future risk prediction. Although ECGFounder expanded cardiac disease coverage, a holistic health profiling model remains needed.
  Methods: We constructed a large multicenter dataset comprising 13.3 million ECGs from 2.98 million patients. Using transfer learning, ECGFounder was fine-tuned to develop AnyECG, a foundation model for holistic health profiling. Performance was evaluated using external validation cohorts and a 10-year longitudinal cohort for current diagnosis, future risk prediction, and comorbidity identification.
  Results: AnyECG demonstrated systemic predictive capability across 1172 conditions, achieving an AUROC greater than 0.7 for 306 diseases. The model revealed novel disease associations, robust comorbidity patterns, and future disease risks. Representative examples included high diagnostic performance for hyperparathyroidism (AUROC 0.941), type 2 diabetes (0.803), Crohn disease (0.817), lymphoid leukemia (0.856), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.773).
  Conclusion: The AnyECG foundation model provides substantial evidence that AI-ECG can serve as a systemic tool for concurrent disease detection and long-term risk prediction.</description>

      <title>LSR-Net: A Lightweight and Strong Robustness Network for Bearing Fault Diagnosis in Noise Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating bearings play an important role in modern industries, but have a high probability of occurrence of defects because they operate at high speed, high load, and poor operating environments. Therefore, if a delay time occurs when a bearing is diagnosed with a defect, this may cause economic loss and loss of life. Moreover, since the vibration sensor from which the signal is collected is highly affected by the operating environment and surrounding noise, accurate defect diagnosis in a noisy environment is also important. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and strong robustness network (LSR-Net) that is accurate in a noisy environment and enables real-time fault diagnosis. To this end, first, a denoising and feature enhancement module (DFEM) was designed to create a 3-channel 2D matrix by giving several nonlinearity to the feature-map that passed through the denoising module (DM) block composed of convolution-based denoising (CD) blocks. Moreover, adaptive pruning was applied to DM to improve denoising ability when the power of noise is strong. Second, for lightweight model design, a convolution-based efficiency shuffle (CES) block was designed using group convolution (GConv), group pointwise convolution (GPConv) and channel split that can design the model while maintaining low parameters. In addition, the trade-off between the accuracy and model computational complexity that can occur due to the lightweight design of the model was supplemented using attention mechanisms and channel shuffle. In order to verify the defect diagnosis performance of the proposed model, performance verification was conducted in a noisy environment using a vibration signal. As a result, it was confirmed that the proposed model had the best anti-noise ability compared to the benchmark models, and the computational complexity of the model was also the lowest.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse recovery methods are essential for channel estimation and localization in modern communication systems, but their reliability relies on accurate physical models, which are rarely perfectly known. Their computational complexity also grows rapidly with the dictionary dimensions in large MIMO systems. In this paper, we propose MOMPnet, a novel unfolded sparse recovery framework that addresses both the reliability and complexity challenges of traditional methods. By integrating deep unfolding with data-driven dictionary learning, MOMPnet mitigates hardware impairments while preserving interpretability. Instead of a single large dictionary, multiple smaller, independent dictionaries are employed, enabling a low-complexity multidimensional Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm. The proposed unfolded network is evaluated on realistic channel data against multiple baselines, demonstrating its strong performance and potential.</description>

Abstract: Traditional data collection from sensors produce a lot of data, which lead to constant power consumption and require more storage space. This study proposes an algorithm for a data acquisition and processing method based on Fourier transform (DFT), which extracts dominant frequency components using harmonic analysis (HA) to identify frequency peaks. This algorithm allows sensors to activate only when an event occurs, while preserving critical information for detecting defects, such as those in the surface structures of buildings and ensuring accuracy for further predictions.</description>

      <title>RIS-aided Radar Detection Architectures with Application to Low-RCS Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the radar detection of low observable targets with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Instead of using a multistatic radar network as counter-stealth strategy with its synchronization, costs, phase coherence, and energy consumption issues, we exploit a RIS to form a joint monostatic and bistatic configuration that can intercept the energy backscattered by the target along irrelevant directions different from the line-of-sight of the radar. Then, this energy is redirected towards the radar that capitalizes all the backscattered energy to detect the low observable target. To this end, five different detection architectures are devised that jointly process monostatic and bistatic echoes and exhibit the constant false alarm rate property at least with respect to the clutter power. To support the practical implementation, we also provide a guideline for the design of a RIS that satisfies the operating requirements of the considered application. The performance analysis is carried out in comparison with conventional detectors and shows that the proposed strategy leads to effective solutions to the detection of low observable targets.</description>

      <title>Large Wireless Foundation Models: Stronger over Bigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-communication integration is widely regarded as a core enabling technology for 6G. Most existing AI-based physical-layer designs rely on task-specific models that are separately tailored to individual modules, resulting in poor generalization. In contrast, communication systems are inherently general-purpose and should support broad applicability and robustness across diverse scenarios. Foundation models offer a promising solution through strong reasoning and generalization, yet wireless-system constraints hinder a direct transfer of large language model (LLM)-style success to the wireless domain. Therefore, we introduce the concept of large wireless foundation models (LWFMs) and present a novel framework for empowering the physical layer with foundation models under wireless constraints. Specifically, we propose two paradigms for realizing LWFMs, including leveraging existing general-purpose foundation models and building novel wireless foundation models. Based on recent progress, we distill two roadmaps for each paradigm and formulate design principles under wireless constraints. We further provide case studies of LWFM-empowered wireless systems to intuitively validate their advantages. Finally, we characterize the notion of "large" in LWFMs through a multidimensional analysis of existing work and outline promising directions for future research.</description>

      <title>DuTrack: Long-Term Indoor Human Tracking with Dual-Channel Sensing and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi tracking technology demonstrates promising potential for future smart home and intelligent family care. Currently, accurate Wi-Fi tracking methods rely primarily on fine-grained velocity features. However, such velocity-based approaches suffer from the problem of accumulative errors, making it challenging to stably track users' trajectories over a long period of time. This paper presents DuTrack, a fusion-based tracking system for stable human tracking. The fundamental idea is to leverage the ubiquitous acoustic signals in households to rectify the accumulative Wi-Fi tracking error. Theoretically, Wi-Fi sensing in line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios can be modeled as elliptical Fresnel zones and hyperbolic zones, respectively. By designing acoustic sensing signals, we are able to model the acoustic sensing zones as a series of hyperbolic clusters. We reveal how to fuse the fields of electromagnetic waves and mechanical waves, and establish the optimization equation. Next, we design a data-driven architecture to solve the aforementioned optimization equation. Experimental results show that the proposed multimodal tracking scheme exhibits superior performance. We achieve a 89.37% reduction in median tracking error compared to model-based methods and a 65.02% reduction compared to data-driven methods.</description>

      <title>Delay-Aware Task Offloading for Heterogeneous VLC-RF-based Vehicular Fog Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular fog computing (VFC) is a promising paradigm for reducing the computation burden of vehicles, thus supporting delay-sensitive services in next-generation transportation networks. However, traditional VFC schemes rely on radio frequency (RF) communications, which limits their adaptability for dense vehicular environments. In this paper, a heterogeneous visible light communication (VLC)-RF architecture is designed for VFC systems to facilitate efficient task offloading. Specifically, computing tasks are dynamically partitioned and offloaded to idle vehicles via both VLC and RF links, thereby fully exploiting the interference resilience of VLC and the coverage advantage of RF. To minimize the average task processing delay (TPD), an optimization problem of task offloading and computing resource allocation is formulated, and then solved by the developed residual-based majorization-minimization (RBMM) algorithm. Simulation results confirm that the heterogeneous VLC-RF architecture with the proposed algorithm achieves a 15% average TPD reduction compared to VFC systems relying solely on VLC or RF.</description>

      <title>Uni-Fi: Integrated Multi-Task Wi-Fi Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing technology enables non-intrusive, continuous monitoring of user locations and activities, which supports diverse smart home applications. Since different sensing tasks exhibit contextual relationships, their integration can enhance individual module performance. However, integrating sensing tasks across different research efforts faces challenges due to the absence of two key elements. The first is a unified architecture that captures the fundamental nature shared across diverse sensing tasks. The second is an extensible pipeline that can integrate sensing methodologies proposed in potential future research. This paper presents Uni-Fi, an extensible framework for multi-task Wi-Fi sensing integration. This paper makes the following contributions. First, we propose a unified theoretical framework that reveals the fundamental differences between single-task and multi-task sensing. Second, we develop a scalable sensing pipeline that automatically generates multi-task sensing solvers, enabling seamless integration of multiple sensing models. Experimental results show that Uni-Fi achieves robust performance across tasks, with a localization error of approximately 0.54 meters, 98.34 percent accuracy for activity classification, and 98.57 percent accuracy for presence detection.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Resource Allocation Scheme for Bistatic ISAC with Data Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables efficient reuse of the existing cellular infrastructure and is likely to play an important role in future sensing networks. In this context, ISAC using the data channel is a promising approach to improve the bistatic sensing performance compared to relying solely on pilots. One of the challenges associated with this approach is resource allocation: the communication link aims to transmit higher modulation order (MO) symbols to maximize the throughput, whereas a lower MO is preferable for sensing to achieve a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the radar image. To address this conflict, this paper introduces a hybrid resource allocation scheme. By placing lower MO symbols as pseudo-pilots on a suitable sensing grid, we enhance the bistatic sensing performance while only slightly reducing the spectral efficiency of the communication link. Simulation results validate our approach against different baselines and provide practical insights into how decoding errors affect the sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition from Mode Extraction to Dimensional Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Comprehensive Robust Dynamic Mode Decomposition (CR-DMD), a novel framework that robustifies the entire DMD process - from mode extraction to dimensional reduction - against mixed noise. Although standard DMD widely used for uncovering spatio-temporal patterns and constructing low-dimensional models of dynamical systems, it suffers from significant performance degradation under noise due to its reliance on least-squares estimation for computing the linear time evolution operator. Existing robust variants typically modify the least-squares formulation, but they remain unstable and fail to ensure faithful low-dimensional representations. First, we introduce a convex optimization-based preprocessing method designed to effectively remove mixed noise, achieving accurate and stable mode extraction. Second, we propose a new convex formulation for dimensional reduction that explicitly links the robustly extracted modes to the original noisy observations, constructing a faithful representation of the original data via a sparse weighted sum of the modes. Both stages are efficiently solved by a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method. Experiments on fluid dynamics datasets demonstrate that CR-DMD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art robust DMD methods in terms of mode accuracy and fidelity of low-dimensional representations under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Scalable mm-Wave Liquid Crystal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces based on the Delay Line Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, fabrication, and characterization of broadband liquid crystal (LC) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) operating around 60 GHz and scaling up to 750 radiating elements. The RISs employ a delay line architecture (DLA) that decouples the phase shifting and radiating layer, enabling wide bandwidth, continuous phase control exceeding 360{\deg}, and fast response times with a micrometer-thin LC layer of 4.6 micrometer. Two prototypes with 120 and 750 elements are realized using identical unit cells and column-wise biasing. Measurements demonstrate beam steering over +-60{\deg} and -3 dB bandwidths exceeding 9% for both apertures, confirming the scalability of the proposed architecture. On top of a measured nanowatt power consumption per unit cell, aperture efficiencies above 20% are predicted by simulations. While the measured efficiencies are reduced to 9.2% and 2.6%, a detailed analysis verifies that this reduction can be attributed to technological challenges in a laboratory environment. Finally, a comprehensive comparison between the applied DLA-based LC-RIS and a conventional approach highlights the superior potential of applied architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies microfluidic molecular communication receivers with finite-capacity Langmuir adsorption driven by an effective surface concentration. In the reaction-limited regime, we derive a closed-form single-pulse response kernel and a symbol-rate recursion for on-off keying that explicitly exposes channel memory and inter-symbol interference. We further develop short-pulse and long-pulse approximations, revealing an interference asymmetry in the long-pulse regime due to saturation. To account for stochasticity, we adopt a finite-receptor binomial counting model, employ pulse-end sampling, and propose a low-complexity midpoint-threshold detector that reduces to a fixed threshold when interference is negligible. Numerical results corroborate the proposed characterization and quantify detection performance versus pulse and symbol durations.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation in MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers (MiLACs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for future gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, enabling beamforming with greatly reduced hardware and computational cost. However, channel estimation for MiLAC-aided systems remains an open problem. Conventional least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation rely on intensive digital computation, which undermines the benefits offered by MiLACs. In this letter, we propose efficient LS and MMSE channel estimation schemes for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems. By designing training precoders and combiners implemented by MiLACs, both LS and MMSE estimation are performed fully in the analog domain, achieving identical performance to their digital counterparts while significantly reducing computational complexity, transmit RF chains, analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) resolution requirements, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Numerical results verify the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum Fourier transform and quantum wavelet transform have been cornerstones of quantum information processing. However, for non-stationary signals and anomaly detection, the Hilbert transform can be a more powerful tool, yet no prior work has provided efficient quantum implementations for the discrete Hilbert transform. This letter presents a novel construction for a quantum Hilbert transform in polylogarithmic size and logarithmic depth for a signal of length $N$, exponentially fewer operations than classical algorithms for the same mapping. We generalize this algorithm to create any $d$-dimensional Hilbert transform in depth $O(d\log N)$. Simulations demonstrate effectiveness for tasks such as power systems control and image processing, with exact agreement with classical results.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Quantum Architecture Search Based on NSGA-II Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum architecture search (QAS) has emerged to automate the design of high-performance quantum circuits under specific tasks and hardware constraints. We propose a noise-aware quantum architecture search (NA-QAS) framework based on variational quantum circuit design. By incorporating a noise model into the training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) , the proposed framework identifies the noise-robust architectures. We introduce a hybrid Hamiltonian $\varepsilon$ -greedy strategy to optimize evaluation costs and circumvent local optima. Furthermore, an enhanced variable-depth NSGA-II algorithm is employed to navigate the vast search space, enabling an automated trade-off between architectural expressibility and quantum hardware overhead. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through binary classification and iris multi-classification tasks under a noisy condition. Compared to existing approaches, our framework can search for quantum architectures with superior performance and greater resource efficiency under a noisy condition.</description>

      <title>A Novel, Beam-based Formalism for Active Impedance of Phased Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The active impedance is a fundamental parameter for characterizing the behavior of large, uniform phased array antennas. However, its conventional calculation via the mutual impedance matrix (or the scattering matrix) offers limited physical intuition and can be computationally intensive. This paper presents a novel derivation of the active impedance directly from the radiated beam pattern of such arrays. This approach maps the scan-angle variation of the active impedance directly to the intrinsic angular variation of the beam, providing a more intuitive physical interpretation. The theoretical derivation is straightforward and rigorous. The validity of the proposed equation is conclusively confirmed through full-wave simulations of a prototype array. This work establishes a new and more intuitive framework for understanding, analyzing and accurately measuring the scan-dependent variations in phased arrays, which is one of the main challenges in modern phased array designs. Consequently, this novel formalism is expected to expedite and simplify the overall design and optimization process for next-generation, large-scale uniform phased arrays.</description>

      <title>PEMNet: Towards Autonomous and Enhanced Environment-Aware Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With 5G deployment and the evolution toward 6G, mobile networks must make decisions in highly dynamic environments under strict latency, energy, and spectrum constraints. Achieving this goal, however, depends on prior knowledge of spatial-temporal variations in wireless channels and traffic demands. This motivates a joint, site-specific representation of radio propagation and user demand that is queryable at low online overhead. In this work, we propose the perception embedding map (PEM), a localized framework that embeds fine-grained channel statistics together with grid-level spatial-temporal traffic patterns over a base station's coverage. PEM is built from standard-compliant measurements -- such as measurement report and scheduling/quality-of-service logs -- so it can be deployed and maintained at scale with low cost. Integrated into PEM, this joint knowledge supports enhanced environment-aware optimization across PHY, MAC, and network layers while substantially reducing training overhead and signaling. Compared with existing site-specific channel maps and digital-twin replicas, PEM distinctively emphasizes (i) joint channel-traffic embedding, which is essential for network optimization, and (ii) practical construction using standard measurements, enabling network autonomy while striking a favorable fidelity-cost balance.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Cell-Free Massive MIMO under Imperfect LoS Phase Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of imperfect line-of-sight (LoS) phase tracking on the performance of cell-free massive MIMO networks. Unlike prior works that assume perfectly known or completely unknown phases, we consider a realistic regime where LoS phases are estimated with residual uncertainty due to hardware impairments, mobility, and synchronization errors. To this end, we propose a Rician fading model where LoS components are rotated by imperfect phase estimates and attenuated by a deterministic phase-error penalty factor. We derive a linear MMSE channel estimator that captures statistical phase errors and unifies prior results, reducing to the Bayesian MMSE estimator with perfect phase knowledge and to a zero-mean model in the absence of phase knowledge. To address the non-Gaussian setting, we introduce a virtual uplink model that preserves second-order statistics of channel estimation, enabling the derivation of tractable centralized and distributed MMSE beamformers. To ensure fair assessment of the network performance, we apply these beamformers to the true uplink model and compute the spectral efficiency bounds available in the literature. Numerical results show that our framework bridges idealized assumptions and practical tracking limitations, providing rigorous performance benchmarks and design insights for 6G cell-free networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient Channel Autoencoders for Wideband Communications leveraging Walsh-Hadamard interleaving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how end-to-end (E2E) channel autoencoders (AEs) can achieve energy-efficient wideband communications by leveraging Walsh-Hadamard (WH) interleaved converters. WH interleaving enables high sampling rate analog-digital conversion with reduced power consumption using an analog WH transformation. We demonstrate that E2E-trained neural coded modulation can transparently adapt to the WH-transceiver hardware without requiring algorithmic redesign. Focusing on the short block length regime, we train WH-domain AEs and benchmark them against standard neural and conventional baselines, including 5G Polar codes. We quantify the system-level energy tradeoffs among baseband compute, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analog converter power. Our analysis shows that the proposed WH-AE system can approach conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power. Compared to the best neural baseline, WH-AE achieves, on average, 29% higher energy efficiency (in bit/J) for the same reliability. These findings establish WH-domain learning as a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.</description>

      <title>Convergence Properties of Good Quantum Codes for Classical Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important part of the information theory folklore had been about the output statistics of codes that achieve the capacity and how the empirical distributions compare to the output distributions induced by the optimal input in the channel capacity problem. Results for a variety of such empirical output distributions of good codes have been known in the literature, such as the comparison of the output distribution of the code to the optimal output distribution in vanishing and non-vanishing error probability cases. Motivated by these, we aim to achieve similar results for the quantum codes that are used for classical communication, that is the setting in which the classical messages are communicated through quantum codewords that pass through a noisy quantum channel. We first show the uniqueness of the optimal output distribution, to be able to talk more concretely about the optimal output distribution. Then, we extend the vanishing error probability results to the quantum case, by using techniques that are close in spirit to the classical case. We also extend non-vanishing error probability results to the quantum case on block codes, by using the second-order converses for such codes based on hypercontractivity results for the quantum generalized depolarizing semi-groups.</description>

Abstract: The pursuit of carbon-neutral wireless networks is increasingly constrained by the escalating energy demands of deep learning-based signal processing. Here, we introduce SpikACom (Spiking Adaptive Communications), a neuromorphic computing framework that synergizes brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) with wireless signal processing to deliver sustainable intelligence. SpikACom advances the paradigm shift from energy-intensive, continuous-valued processing to event-driven sparse computation. Moreover, it supports continual learning in dynamic wireless environments via a dual-scale mechanism that integrates channel distribution-aware context modulation with a synaptic consolidation rule using SNN-specific statistics, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Evaluations across critical wireless communication tasks, including semantic communication, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming, and channel estimation demonstrate that SpikACom matches full-precision deep learning baselines while achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in computational energy efficiency. Our results position SNNs as a promising pathway toward green wireless intelligence, providing evidence that neuromorphic computing can empower the sustainability of modern digital systems.</description>

      <title>Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-Aided Online FDD Precoding via Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Sensing: A Vertical Federated Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a heterogeneous multi-vehicle, multi-modal sensing (H-MVMM) aided online precoding problem. The proposed H-MVMM scheme utilizes a vertical federated learning (VFL) framework to minimize pilot sequence length and optimize the sum rate. This offers a promising solution for reducing latency in frequency division duplexing systems. To achieve this, three preprocessing modules are designed to transform raw sensory data into informative representations relevant to precoding. The approach effectively addresses local data heterogeneity arising from diverse on-board sensor configurations through a well-structured VFL training procedure. Additionally, a label-free online model updating strategy is introduced, enabling the H-MVMM scheme to adapt its weights flexibly. This strategy features a pseudo downlink channel state information label simulator (PCSI-Simulator), which is trained using a semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach alongside an online loss function. Numerical results show that the proposed method can closely approximate the performance of traditional optimization techniques with perfect channel state information, achieving a significant 90.6\% reduction in pilot sequence length.</description>

      <title>Parametric Channel Estimation and Design for Active-RIS-Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology has emerged as a key enabler for future wireless communications. However, its potential is constrained by the difficulty of acquiring accurate user-to-RIS channel state information (CSI), due to the cascaded channel structure and the high pilot overhead of non-parametric methods. Unlike a passive RIS, where the reflected signal suffers from multiplicative path loss, an active RIS amplifies the signal, improving its practicality in real deployments. In this letter, we propose a parametric channel estimation method tailored for active RISs. The proposed approach integrates an active RIS model with an adaptive Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) to recover the main channel parameters using a minimal number of pilots. To further enhance performance, an adaptive active RIS configuration strategy is employed, which refines the beam direction based on an initial user location estimate. Moreover, an orthogonal angle-pair codebook is used instead of the conventional Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) codebook, significantly reducing the codebook size and ensuring reliable operation for both far-field and near-field users. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-optimal performance with very few pilots compared to non-parametric approaches. Its performance is also benchmarked against that of a traditional passive RIS under the same total power budget to ensure fairness. Results show that active RIS yields higher spectral efficiency (SE) by eliminating the multiplicative fading inherent in passive RISs and allocating more resources to data transmission</description>

      <title>Tiny-WiFo: A Lightweight Wireless Foundation Model for Channel Prediction via Multi-Component Adaptive Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The massive scale of Wireless Foundation Models (FMs) hinders their real-time deployment on edge devices. This letter moves beyond standard knowledge distillation by introducing a novel Multi-Component Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (MCAKD) framework. Key innovations include a Cross-Attention-Based Knowledge Selection (CA-KS) module that selectively identifies critical features from the teacher model, and an Autonomous Learning-Passive Learning (AL-PL) strategy that balances knowledge transfer with independent learning to achieve high training efficiency at a manageable computational cost. When applied to the WiFo FM, the distilled Tiny-WiFo model, with only 5.5M parameters, achieves a 1.6 ms inference time while retaining over 98% of WiFo's performance and its crucial zero-shot generalization capability, making real-time FM deployment viable.</description>

      <title>CSIT-Free Beamforming for Multi-Group Multicast in Overloaded mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study downlink multi-group multicast (MGM) transmission in overloaded millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems, where the number of users exceeds the number of transmit antennas. We first show that, under realistic line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant user geometries, the conventional single-slot MGM scheme suffers from a fundamental collapse of the max-min fairness degrees of freedom (MMF-DoF), regardless of beamforming optimization. Although this collapse can in principle be avoided via aggressive time-division scheduling, it requires excessive time sharing and results in severe throughput loss in overloaded regimes. To address this limitation, we propose a CSIT-free multi-group multicast framework (CF-MGM) that does not rely on instantaneous channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and is based on a deterministic multi-slot transmission structure. By exploiting structured precoding and receiver-side combining across multiple slots, the proposed framework eliminates inter-group interference by construction. We show that CF-MGM guarantees a strictly positive MMF-DoF in overloaded LoS mmWave systems, in sharp contrast to the DoF collapse of conventional single-slot MGM. Simulation results demonstrate that CF-MGM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CSIT-based MGM schemes while substantially reducing signaling overhead.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Sparse Bayesian Channel Estimation and Tracking for XL-IRS-Aided Wideband mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid development of 6G systems demands advanced technologies to boost network capacity and spectral efficiency, particularly in the context of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications. A key challenge here is obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI), especially with extremely large IRS (XL-IRS), due to near-field propagation, high-dimensional wideband cascaded channels, and the passive nature of the XL-IRS. In addition, most existing CSI acquisition methods fail to leverage the spatio-temporal sparsity inherent in the channel, resulting in suboptimal estimation performance. To address these challenges, we consider an XL-IRS-aided wideband multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system and propose an efficient channel estimation and tracking (CET) algorithm. Specifically, a unified near-field cascaded channel representation model is presented first, and a hierarchical spatio-temporal sparse prior is then constructed to capture two-dimensional (2D) block sparsity in the polar domain, one-dimensional (1D) clustered sparsity in the angle-delay domain, and temporal correlations across different channel estimation frames. Based on these priors, a tensor-based sparse CET (TS-CET) algorithm is proposed that integrates tensor-based orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) with particle-based variational Bayesian inference (VBI) and message passing. Simulation results demonstrate that the TS-CET framework significantly improves the estimation accuracy and reduces the pilot overhead as compared to existing benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous and Proportional Finger Motion Decoding Using Spatial Features from High-Density Surface Electromyography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Restoring natural and intuitive hand function requires simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) of multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). This study systematically evaluated the multichannel linear descriptors-based block field method (MLD-BFM) for continuous decoding of five finger-joint DoFs by leveraging the rich spatial information of high-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG). Twenty-one healthy participants performed dynamic sinusoidal finger movements while HD sEMG signals were recorded from the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles. MLD-BFM extracted region-specific spatial features, including effective field strength ($\Sigma$), field-strength variation rate ($\Phi$), and spatial complexity ($\Omega$). Model performance was optimized (block size: $2 \times 2$; window: 0.15 s) and compared with conventional time-domain features and dimensionality reduction approaches when applied to multi-output regression models. MLD-BFM consistently achieved the highest $\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}}$ values across all models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with MLD-BFM yielded the best performance ($\mathrm{R}^2_{\mathrm{vw}} = 86.68\% \pm 0.33$). Time-domain features also showed strong predictive capability and were statistically comparable to MLD-BFM in some models, whereas dimensionality reduction techniques exhibited lower accuracy. Decoding accuracy was higher for the middle and ring fingers than for the thumb. Overall, MLD-BFM improved continuous finger movement decoding accuracy, underscoring the importance of taking advantage of the spatial richness of HD sEMG. These findings suggest that spatially structured features enhance SPC and provide practical guidance for designing robust, real-time, and responsive myoelectric interfaces.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model-Aided Hierarchical Control for Robust RIS-Assisted Near-Field Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The deployment of extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs) in sixth-generation (6G) networks could shift communication into the near-field communication (NFC) regime. In this regime, signals exhibit spherical wave propagation, unlike the planar waves in conventional far-field systems. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can dynamically adjust phase shifts to support NFC beamfocusing, concentrating signal energy at specific spatial coordinates. However, effective RIS utilization depends on both rapid channel state information (CSI) estimation and proactive blockage mitigation, which occur on inherently different timescales. CSI varies at millisecond intervals due to small-scale fading, while blockage events evolve over seconds, posing challenges for conventional single-level control algorithms. To address this issue, we propose a dual-transformer (DT) hierarchical framework that integrates two specialized transformer models within a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) architecture, referred to as the DT-HDRL framework. A fast-timescale transformer processes ray-tracing data for rapid CSI estimation, while a vision transformer (ViT) analyzes visual data to predict impending blockages. In HDRL, the high-level controller selects line-of-sight (LoS) or RIS-assisted non-line-of-sight (NLoS) transmission paths and sets goals, while the low-level controller optimizes base station (BS) beamfocusing and RIS phase shifts using instantaneous CSI. This dual-timescale coordination maximizes spectral efficiency (SE) while ensuring robust performance under dynamic conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach improves SE by approximately 18% compared to single-timescale baselines, while the proposed blockage predictor achieves an F1-score of 0.92, providing a 769 ms advance warning window in dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fetal Sleep: A Cross-Species Review of Physiology, Measurement, and Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Study Objectives: Fetal sleep is a vital yet underexplored aspect of prenatal neurodevelopment. Its cyclic organization reflects the maturation of central neural circuits, and disturbances in these patterns may offer some of the earliest detectable signs of neurological compromise. This is the first review to integrate more than seven decades of research into a unified, cross-species synthesis of fetal sleep. We examine: (i) Physiology and Ontogeny-comparing human fetuses with animal models; and (ii) Methodological Evolution-transitioning from invasive neurophysiology to non-invasive monitoring and deep learning frameworks.
  Methods: A structured narrative synthesis was guided by a systematic literature search across four databases (PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar). From 2,925 identified records, 171 studies involving fetal sleep-related physiology, sleep-state classification, or signal-based monitoring were included in this review.
  Results: Across the 171 studies, fetal sleep states become clearly observable as the brain matures. In fetal sheep and baboons, organized cycling between active and quiet sleep emerges at approximately 80%-90% gestation. In humans, this differentiation occurs later, around 95% gestation, with full maturation reached near term. Despite extensive animal research, no unified, clinically validated framework exists for defining fetal sleep states, limiting translation into routine obstetric practice.
  Conclusions: By integrating evidence across species, methodologies, and clinical contexts, this review provides the scientific foundation for developing objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal sleep monitoring technologies-tools that may ultimately support earlier detection of neurological compromise and guide timely prenatal intervention.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel piecewise smooth image model with piecewise constant local parameters that are automatically adapted to each image. Technically, the model is formulated in terms of factor graphs with NUP (normal with unknown parameters) priors, and the pertinent computations amount to iterations of conjugate-gradient steps and Gaussian message passing. The proposed model and algorithms are demonstrated with applications to denoising and contrast enhancement.</description>

      <title>Airy Beamforming for Radiative Near-Field MU-XL-MIMO: Overcoming Half-Space Blockage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The move to next-generation wireless communications with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) brings the communications into the radiative near-field (RNF) region, where distance-aware focusing is feasible. However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, often necessitating the deployment of auxiliary hardware such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to restore connectivity. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS.</description>
