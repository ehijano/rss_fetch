      <title>Spin Photonic Topological Insulator Antenna By Armchair Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A leaky wave antenna based on spin photonic topological insulators has been developed, featuring a hexagonal unit cell arranged in an armchair configuration. This configuration offers advantages over the zigzag arrangement, particularly with its wider leaky region and more suitable pattern. While the proposed antenna is a uniform leaky wave antenna, it is capable of radiating in both backward and forward directions. Notably, the transition through the broadside in the scanning range does not result in a significant drop in performance, despite the presence of an open stop band. This characteristic is unique among leaky wave antennas, to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <title>Guidelines for Fast and Nondestructive Imaging in AM-AFM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amplitude-modulation atomic force microscopy enables observation of fragile molecules at the nanometer scale. To shorten measurement times and capture dynamic molecules, increasing the frame rate is essential. Traditionally, maximum frame rates were thought to be limited by device bandwidth. However, for fragile molecules, imaging speed is often constrained by disruption from tip-sample interaction forces. Despite its significance, no comprehensive theoretical study has addressed this limitation. Here, we establish guidelines for high-speed, nondestructive AM-AFM imaging of fragile molecules. Our analysis identifies two types of forces: an impulsive force on the molecule's uphill side and a steady force linked to error saturation on the downhill side. By examining the frequency dependence of the amplitude-distance curve, we demonstrate that exciting at the resonance slope minimizes feedback error forces and allows for their easy estimation using simple equations. These findings provide valuable insights for studying fragile materials, particularly biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Methods for energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy with photon-counting and deconvolution techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic techniques are essential for studying material properties, but the small cross-sections of some methods may result in low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in the collected spectra. In this article we present methods, based on combining Bragg spectroscopy with photon counting and deconvolution algorithms, which increase the SNRs, making the spectra better suited to further analysis. We aim to provide a comprehensive guide for constructing spectra from camera images. The efficacy of these methods is validated on synthetic and experimental data, the latter coming from the field of high-energy density (HED) science, where x-ray spectroscopy is essential for the understanding of materials under extreme thermodynamic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the demand for high-speed response in display applications, a more detailed study of the capacitive effects in LEDs is required. This work tested the capacitance of LEDs at different frequencies and proposed an effective capacitance model, which achieved a good fit to the frequency dispersion observed in the experimental results. Additionally, it was determined that the low-frequency 1/f capacitance originates from the metal-semiconductor interface.</description>

      <title>Versatile Top-Down Patterning of 3D, 2D and 0D Perovskites for On-Chip Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-halide perovskites (MHPs) have exciting optoelectronic properties and are under investigation for various applications, such as photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and lasers. An essential step toward exploiting the full potential of this class of materials is their large-scale, on-chip integration with high-resolution, top-down patterning. The development of such patterning methods for perovskite films is challenging because of their ionic behavior and adverse reactions with the solvents used in standard lithography processes. Here, we introduce a versatile and precise method comprising photolithography and reactive ion etching (RIE) processes that can be tuned to accommodate different perovskite compositions and morphologies, including 3D, quasi-2D, and quasi-0D structures. Our method utilizes conventional photoresists at reduced temperatures to create micron-sized features down to 1 $\mu$m, providing high reproducibility from chip to chip. The patterning technique is validated through atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), optical spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It enables the scalable and high-throughput on-chip monolithic integration of MHPs.</description>

      <title>Silicon-Enhanced Nanocavity: From Narrow Band Color Reflector to Broadband Near-Infrared Absorber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subwavelength-scale light absorbers and reflectors have gained significant attention for their potential in photonic applications. These structures often utilize a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) architecture, similar to a Fabry-Perot nanocavity, using noble metals and dielectric or semiconductor spacers for narrow-band light absorption. In reflection mode, they function as band-stop filters, blocking specific wavelengths and reflecting others through Fabry-Perot resonance. Efficient color reflection requires asymmetric Fabry-Perot cavities, where metals with differing reflectivities and extinction coefficients enable substantial reflection for non-resonant wavelengths and near-perfect absorption at resonant ones. Unlike narrowband techniques, broadband absorption does not rely on a single resonance phenomenon. Recent developments show that integrating an asymmetric Fabry-Perot nanocavity with an anti-reflection coating achieves near-unity absorption across a broad wavelength range. This study introduces an asymmetric Fabry-Perot nanocavity with a dielectric-semiconductor-dielectric spacer, enabling near-unity color reflection. By incorporating silicon, the reflected color can be tuned with just a 5 nm thickness variation, while achieving broadband absorption over 70% in the 800-1600 nm range. The addition of an anti-reflection coating extends broadband absorption to near unity with minimal impact on reflected color. The planar, nanopattern-free design holds promise for display technologies with better color fidelity and applications in thermal photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Identification of large polarons and exciton polarons in rutile and anatase polymorphs of titanium dioxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a wide-gap semiconductor with numerous applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and neuromorphic computing. The unique functional properties of this material critically depend on its ability to transport charge in the form of polarons, namely narrow electron wavepackets accompanied by local distortions of the crystal lattice. It is currently well established that the most important polymorphs of TiO2, the rutile and anatase phases, harbor small electron polarons and small hole polarons, respectively. However, whether additional polaronic species exist in TiO2, and under which conditions, remain open questions. Here, we provide definitive answers to these questions by exploring the rich landscape of polaron quasiparticles in TiO2 via recently developed ab initio techniques. In addition to the already known small polarons, we identify three novel species, namely a large hole polaron in rutile, a large quasi-two-dimensional electron polaron in anatase, and a large exciton polaron in anatase. These findings complete the puzzle on the polaorn physics of TiO2 and pave the way for systematically probing and manipulating polarons in a broad class of complex oxides and quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Ionization-Based Transverse Profile Monitor for Pulsed Electron Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental demonstration of a single-shot, non-destructive electron beam diagnostic based on the ionization of a low-density pulsed gas jet. In our study, 7~MeV electron bunches from a radio frequency (RF) photoinjector, carrying up to 100 pC of charge, traversed a localized distribution of nitrogen gas (N$_2$). The interaction of the electron bunches with the N$_2$ gas generated a correlated signature in the ionized particle distribution, which was spatially magnified using a series of electrostatic lenses and recorded with a micro-channel-plate detector. Various modalities, including point-to-point imaging and velocity mapping, are investigated. A temporal trace of the detector current enabled the identification of single- and double-ionization events. The characteristics of the ionization distribution, dependence on gas density, total bunch charge, and other parameters, are described. Approaches to scaling to higher electron bunch density and energy are suggested. Additionally, the instrument proves useful for comprehensive studies of the ionization process itself.</description>

      <title>On-chip 7 GHz acousto-optic modulators for visible wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A chip-integrated acousto-optic phase modulator tailored for visible optical wavelengths has been developed. Utilizing the lithium niobate on sapphire platform, the modulator employs a 7 GHz surface acoustic wave, excited by an interdigital transducer and aligned perpendicular to the waveguide. This design achieves efficient phase modulation of visible light within a compact device length of merely 200 microns, while holds the advantages of easy fabrication and high stability due to simple unsuspended structure. Remarkably, in this high-frequency acoustic regime, the acoustic wavelength becomes comparable to the optical wavelength, resulting in a notable single-sideband modulation behavior. This observation underscores the phase delay effects in the acousto-optics interactions, and opens up new aspects for realizing functional visible photonic devices and its integration with atom- and ion-based quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Large tuning of the optical properties of nanoscale NdNiO3 via electron doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We synthesized crystalline films of neodymium nickel oxide (NdNiO3), a perovskite quantum material, switched the films from a metal phase (intrinsic) into an insulator phase (electron-doped) by field-driven lithium-ion intercalation, and characterized their structural and optical properties. Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) showed that the intercalation process resulted in a gradient of the dopant concentration along the thickness direction of the films, turning the films into insulator-metal bilayers. We used variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry to measure the complex refractive indices of the metallic and insulating phases of NdNiO3. The insulator phase has a refractive index of n ~ 2 and low absorption in the visible and near infrared, and analysis of the complex refractive indices indicated that the band gap of the insulating phase is roughly 3-4 eV. Electrical control of the optical band gap, with corresponding large changes to the optical refractive indices, creates new opportunities for tunable optics.</description>

      <title>Acousto-optic modulation based on an AlScN microring resonator for microwave-to-optical conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic-optic (AO) modulation is critical for microwave and optical signal processing, computing and networking. Challenges remain to integrate AO devices on-chip using fabrication process compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. This work presents the demonstration of an AO modulator exploiting a microring resonator (MRR) based on thin-film aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) photonic platform. Leveraging the high piezoelectric properties of AlScN, an MRR is employed with interdigital transducer (IDT) inside to couple microwave signals into acoustic resonant modes, enabling efficient by-directional optical modulation in the MRR. The fabricated MRR exhibits an optical loaded quality factor (Q) of 1.8*e4 at the optical L-band for the TE00 mode. A low effective half-wave voltage Vpi of 1.21 V is achieved, corresponding to a VpiL of 0.0242 Vcm, along with an optomechanical single-photon coupling strength g0 of 0.43 kHz between the 2.11 GHz acoustic mode and the TE00 optical mode. The device shows potential for applications in microwave photonics.</description>

      <title>High-Performances AlGaN-based DUV-LED via Under-Level Multiple Quantum Well Configuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low internal and external quantum efficiencies in high Aluminium content AlGaN-based deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diode (DUV-LED) occurred due to strong polarization effects, spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization, at the interface between two materials. It also leads to a low carrier confinement and Quantum Confined Stark Effect (QCSE), contributing to the efficiency droop of the DUV-LED. This work demonstrates an under-level MQW configuration implemented in a DUV-LED with a 257 nm emission wavelength. Three DUV-LED structures, above-, same- and under-level MQW were investigated, covering important optoelectronics properties such as energy band diagram, carrier concentrations, radiative recombination rates and electric field distribution. It is found that the quantum efficiencies, luminescence intensity and light output power of the under-level configuration has been enhanced by nine-, ten- and five-folds, relative to the above-level MQW configuration.</description>

      <title>Tunable collective electromagnetic induced transparency-like effect due to coupling of dual-band bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between dual-band or multi-band quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) is of great interest for their rich physics and promising applications. Here, we report tunable collective electromagnetic induced transparency-like (EIT-like) phenomenon due to coupling between dual-band collective electric dipolar and magnetic quadrupolar q-BICs, which are supported by an all-dielectric metasurface composed of periodic tilted silicon quadrumers. We show that this collective EIT-like phenomenon with strong slow light effect can be realized by varying the nanodisk diameter or the tilt angle, and that the transparency window wavelength, the quality factor, and the group index can all be tuned by changing the nanodisk size. We further find that as the nanodisk size decreases, the slow light effect becomes stronger, and higher sensitivity can be obtained for the refractive index sensing. Interestingly, the sensitivity first increases exponentially and then reaches a plateau as the nanodisk size decreases, or equivalently as the group index increases. We therefore expect this work will advance the understanding of the collective EIT-like effect due to coupling between q-BICs, and the findings will have potential applications in slow-light enhanced biochemical sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative and reproducible optical characterization of single quantum emitters is crucial for quantum photonic materials research, yet controlling for experimental conditions remains challenging due to a lack of an established reference standard. We propose nanodiamonds containing single nitrogen vacancy (NV$^{-}$) color centers as reliable, stable and robust sources of single-photon emission. We select 4 potential reference emitter candidates from a study of thousands of NV$^{-}$ centers. Candidates were remeasured at a second laboratory, correlating optical pump power and NV$^{-}$ center emission intensity at saturation in addition to corresponding $g^{(2)}(0)$ values. A reference nanodiamond is demonstrated to control for experimental conditions, with reproducible and reliable single-photon emission, as a model for a new single-photon emitter reference standard.</description>

The density, energy level, and position of these trap states often enable or constrain device functionality, making their measurement crucial in materials science and device fabrication. Most methods for measuring trap states involve fabricating a junction, which can inadvertently introduce or alter traps, highlighting the need for alternative, less-invasive techniques. Here, we present a unique photo-Hall-based method to detect and characterize trap density and energy level while concurrently extracting key carrier properties, including mobility, photocarrier density, recombination lifetime, and diffusion length. This technique relies on analyzing the photo-Hall data in terms of "photo-Hall conductivity" vs. electrical conductivity under varying light intensities and temperatures. We show that the photo-Hall effect, in the presence of traps, follows an $\textit{astonishingly simple}$ relationship - $\textit{a hyperbola equation}$ - that reveals detailed insights into charge transport and trap occupation. We have successfully applied this technique to P and N-type silicon as a benchmark and to high-performance halide perovskite photovoltaic films. This technique substantially expands the capability of Hall effect-based measurements by integrating the effects of the four most common excitations in nature - electric field, magnetic field, photon, and phonon in solids - into a single equation and enabling unparalleled extraction of charge carrier and trap properties in semiconductors.</description>

Abstract: Space exploration to have the biosignatures of extraterrestrial life on different planets with oceans in our solar system and beyond requires the design and manufacturing of robust and reliable electronic systems that can be used for sensing, data processing, controlling motor/actuators, and communication while surviving an extreme environment. Commercial off the shelf (COTS) components cannot survive a long time in such harsh environments after being housed in a Warm Electronics Box, and any electronic system designed for such extreme conditions must be tailored to suit such operation. The presence of extremely cold temperatures and high radiation adversely affects the device parameters over time, i.e. the operation of electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Radiation Pattern Synthesis with Uniform Nonlocal Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main applications of electromagnetic metasurfaces (MSs) is to tailor spatial field distributions. The radiation pattern of a given source can be desirably modified upon reflection on an MS having proper spatial modulation of its local macroscopic parameters. At the microscopic level, spatial modulation requires individually engineered meta-atoms at different points. In contrast, the present research demonstrates the opportunity for radiation pattern engineering in the reflection regime without using any spatial modulation. The principle consists in the deliberate tailoring of the surface impedance of an unmodulated but spatially dispersive (nonlocal) MS. A 2D synthesis problem with a magnetic line current source is solved analytically by finding a required form of the surface impedance as a function of the tangential wave vector in both visible and evanescent parts of the spatial spectrum. To prove the principle, three different pattern shapes are implemented via full-wave numerical simulations by tuning the spatial dispersion in a realistic mushroom-type high-impedance electromagnetic surface with loaded vias. This work extends the synthesis methods and the application area of spatially dispersive MSs, showing the latter as a promising platform for new types of antennas.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of a 3D mode size converter for efficient edge coupling in photonic integrated circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate efficient edge couplers by fabricating a 3D mode size converter on a lithium niobate-on-insulator photonic platform. The 3D mode size converter is fabricated using an etching process that employs a Si external mask to provide height variation and adjust the width variation through tapering patterns via lithography. The measured edge coupling efficiency with a 3D mode size converter was approximately 1.16 dB/facet for the TE mode and approximately 0.71 dB/facet for the TM mode at a wavelength of 1550 nm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DC-SRF-II gun, a high-brightness continuous-wave photocathode gun, has greater potential in electron beam irradiation applications. This paper presents the in-vacuum and in-air irradiation dosimetry study of the high repetition rate electron beam from the DC-SRF-II gun with both Monte Carlo simulations and experiments. Especially, high-dose uniform irradiations with flexible and accurate tuning of dose rate across orders of magnitude are demonstrated. Good stability and repeatability of the doses are also shown. The ultra-wide tuning range and precise control of irradiation time and dose rate are expected to pave the way for innovative applications across a wide range of fields.</description>

      <title>Enhanced laser-induced single-cycle terahertz generation in a spintronic emitter with a gradient interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of spintronic emitters of broadband THz pulses relies on designing heterostructures where processes of laser-driven spin current generation and subsequent spin-to-charge current conversion are the most efficient. An interface between ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic layers in the emitter is one of the critical elements. Here, we study experimentally single-cycle THz pulse generation from a laser-pulse excited Pt/Co emitter with a composition gradient interface between Pt and Co and compare it with the emission from a conventional Pt/Co structure with an abrupt interface. We find that the gradient interface enhances the efficiency of optics-to-THz conversion by a factor of two in a wide range of optical fluences up to 3 mJ cm$^{-2}$. We reveal that this enhancement is caused by a pronounced increase in transmittance of the laser-driven spin-polarized current through the gradient interface compared to the abrupt one. Furthermore, we find that such a transmission deteriorates with laser fluence due to the spin accumulation effect.</description>

      <title>On the shape of air bubbles trapped in ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water usually contains dissolved gases, and because freezing is a purifying process these gases must be expelled for ice to form. Bubbles appear at the freezing front and are then trapped in ice, making pores. These pores come in a range of sizes from microns to millimeters and their shapes are peculiar; never spherical but elongated, and usually fore-aft asymmetric. We show that these remarkable shapes result of a delicate balance between freezing, capillarity, and mass diffusion. A non-linear ordinary differential equation suffices to describe the bubbles, which features two non-dimensional numbers representing the supersaturation and the freezing rate, and two additional parameters representing simultaneous freezing and nucleation treated as the initial condition. Our experiments provide us with a large variety of pictures of bubble shapes. We show that all of these bubbles have their rounded tip well described by an asymptotic regime of the differential equation, and that most bubbles can have their full shape quantitatively matched by a full solution. This method enables the measurement of the freezing conditions of ice samples, and the design of freeze-cast porous materials. Furthermore, the equation exhibits a bifurcation that explains why some bubbles grow indefinitely and make long cylindrical ``ice worms'', well known to glaciologists.</description>

      <title>Realization of High-Fidelity CZ Gate based on a Double-Transmon Coupler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Striving for higher gate fidelity is crucial not only for enhancing existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices but also for unleashing the potential of fault-tolerant quantum computation through quantum error correction. A recently proposed theoretical scheme, the double-transmon coupler (DTC), aims to achieve both suppressed residual interaction and a fast high-fidelity two-qubit gate simultaneously, particularly for highly detuned qubits. Harnessing the state-of-the-art fabrication techniques and a model-free pulse-optimization process based on reinforcement learning, we translate the theoretical DTC scheme into reality, attaining fidelities of 99.90% for a CZ gate and 99.98% for single-qubit gates. The performance of the DTC scheme demonstrates its potential as a competitive building block for superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Behavior of the Dielectric and Pyroelectric Responses of Ferroelectric Fine-Grained Ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revealed the anomalous temperature behavior of the giant dielectric permittivity and unusual frequency dependences of the pyroelectric response of the fine-grained ceramics prepared by the spark plasma sintering of the ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanoparticles. The temperature dependences of the electro-resistivity indicate the frequency-dependent transition in the electro-transport mechanisms between the lower and higher conductivity states accompanied by the maximum in the temperature dependence of the loss angle tangent. The pyroelectric thermal-wave probing revealed the existence of the spatially inhomogeneous counter-polarized ferroelectric state at the opposite surfaces of the ceramic sample. We described the temperature behavior of the giant dielectric response and losses using the core-shell model for ceramic grains, effective medium approach and Maxwell-Wagner approach. The superparaelectric-like state with a giant dielectric response may appear due to the internal barrier-layer capacitance effect, while the step-like thermal activation of localized polarons in the semiconducting grains is not excluded. The elucidation of the state microscopic origin requires measurements in the frequency range above 1 MHz.</description>

Abstract: A comprehensive study on the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) numerical modelling of space- and time-varying media is presented. We investigate the dynamic behavior of oblique incidence of both TM and TE electromagnetic fields on space-timemodulated gratings. In their general form, these media have electrical permittivity, magnetic permeability, and electrical conductivity modulated across both space and time. We provide the FDTDschemes, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability condition and equations for both TM and TE wave illuminations of space-time-varying slabs, along with the boundary conditions for the FDTD scheme. Furthermore, with engaging illustrative examples, we showcase the versatility and applications of space-time-varying media.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of InGaAs and GaAsSb Nanowires for Room Temperature Operation of Avalanche Photodiodes at 1.55 {\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: III V semiconductor nanowire based photodetectors have significant potential for remote sensing and LiDAR applications, particularly due to their ability to operate at 1.55 {\mu}m. Achieving room temperature operation and near unity absorption using these nanowires at 1.55 {\mu}m is crucial for single photon detection, which offers a promising solution to the challenges posed by the existing superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. Key materials suited for this wavelength include lattice matched In0.53Ga0.47As and Ga0.5As0.5Sb to InP. This study reports a comparison between InGaAs and GaAsSb nanowires to achieve high absorption efficiency at room temperature. Through optimized nanowire arrangement and geometry, we aim to maximize absorption. Our approach features a comparative analysis of patterned InGaAs and GaAsSb nanowires with absorption characteristics modeled using finite difference time domain simulations to enhance absorption at the target wavelength. We also present the complete workflow for nanowire fabrication, modeling, and simulation, encompassing the production of tapered nanowire structures and measurement of their absorption efficiency. Our experimental results show that tapered InGaAs and GaAsSb nanowires exhibit an absorption efficiency of 93% and 92%, respectively, at room temperature around 1.55 {\mu}m.</description>

      <title>Intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on vortex pinning and Jc degradation in polycrystalline superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The damage and the critical current density (Jc) degradation of polycrystalline superconductors induced by strain dramatically influence their performance in applications. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art experimental techniques are unable to detect the damage of internal polycrystalline structures and the microscopic superconductivity in the presence of strain. We propose a groundbreaking multi-scale theoretical framework aimed at revealing the underlying physical mechanisms of the reversible and irreversible Jc degradation induced by the strain through tackling the complex intertwined effects of elastic deformation and damage on the superconductivity of grain boundaries and the associated vortex pinning. The results are well validated by experimental measurements. Utilizing the benchmarked physical model, we demonstrate that the damage evolutions of polycrystalline superconductors in the presence of strain can be approximately estimated by means of the electromagnetic experiments on Jc. Furthermore, we also discuss the characteristics of damage and Jc degradation of polycrystalline superconductors subjected to biaxial mechanical loads. The findings will pave the way to investigate the tunable vortex pinning and Jc of superconductors by strain, and to develop a brand new electromagnetic method to manifest the damage of polycrystalline superconductors.</description>
