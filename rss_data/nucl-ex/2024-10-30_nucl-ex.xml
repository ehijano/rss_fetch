      <title>Azimuthal Anisotropy Scaling Functions for Identified Particle and Anti-Particle Species across Beam Energies: Insights into Baryon Junction Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the beam energy dependence of azimuthal anisotropy scaling functions for mesons and baryons in Pb+Pb and Au+Au collisions, spanning \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\) from 7.7 GeV to 5.02 TeV. Scaling functions were derived from species-dependent \(v_2(p_T, \text{cent})\) measurements to explore the interplay between radial flow, hadronic re-scattering, and baryon junction effects. The resulting scaling functions unify the anisotropy data across different species, revealing the underlying collective behavior. Results demonstrate that baryon junctions significantly enhance baryon \(v_n\) at low \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\), where the baryon chemical potential (\(\mu_B\)) is large, leading to a substantial baryon--anti-baryon anisotropy difference that diminishes with increasing \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\). The non-monotonic behavior observed in the specific shear viscosity (\(\eta/s\)) and the radial flow parameters for anti-baryons suggests a change in the system's expansion dynamics near \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 39\) GeV, potentially influenced by the critical point of the QCD phase diagram, as well as the combined effects of baryon junctions, hadronic re-scattering, and properties of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). These findings provide new constraints and insights into baryon transport, the influence of baryon junction contributions, and the equation of state (EOS) and transport coefficients for baryon-rich matter.</description>

      <title>No-quenching baseline for energy loss signals in oxygen-oxygen collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform computations of inclusive jet, and semi-inclusive jet-hadron cross sections for minimum bias oxygen-oxygen collisions at RHIC and LHC collision energies. We compute the no-quenching baseline for the jet nuclear modification factor $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and jet-, and hadron-triggered semi-inclusive nuclear modification factors $I_\mathrm{AA}$. We do this with state-of-the-art nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs), next-to-leading-order matrix elements, parton shower, and hadronization. We observe deviations from unity due to cold-nuclear matter effects, even without quenching. We demonstrate that the parton distribution uncertainties constitute a significant obstacle in detecting energy loss in small collision systems. Hadron-triggered observables are particularly sensitive to uncertainties due to correlations between the trigger and analyzed particles. For jet-triggered $I_\mathrm{AA}$, there exists a kinematic window in which nPDF, scale, shower, and hadronization uncertainties cancel down to percent level, overcoming a major limiting factor for energy loss discovery in small systems.</description>

      <title>The Auger-Meitner Radioisotope Microscope: an instrument for characterization of Auger electron multiplicities and energy distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a new instrument, the Argonne Auger-Meitner Radioisotope Microscope (ARM), capable of characterizing the Auger-Meitner electron emission of radionuclides, including candidates relevant in nuclear medicine. Our approach relies on event-by-event coincidence ion, electron time-of-flight and spatial readout measurement to determine correlated electron multiplicity and energy distributions of Auger-Meitner decays. We present a proof-of-principle measurement with the ARM using X-ray photoionization of stable krypton beyond the K-edge and identify a bifurcation in the electron multiplicity distribution depending on the emission of K-LX electrons. Extension of the ARM to the characterization of radioactive sources of Auger-Meitner electron emissions is enabled by the combination of two recent developments: (1) cryogenic buffer gas beam technology, which enables well-defined initial conditions, gas-phase, high activity introduction of Auger-Meitner emitters into the detection region, and (2) large-area micro-channel plate detectors with multi-hit detection capabilities, which enables the simultaneous detection of many electrons emitted in a single decay.
  The ARM will generate new experimental data on Auger-Meitner multiplicities that can be used to benchmark atomic relaxation and decay models. As the multiplicities are binned by energy, this data will provide insight into the low-energy regime of Auger-Meitner electrons where intensity calculations are most challenging and experimental data is limited. In particular, accurate multiplicity data of the low-energy regime can be used to inform oncological dosimetry models, where electron energies less than 500 eV are known to be effective in damaging DNA and cell membranes.</description>

      <title>Ab initio nuclear shape coexistence and emergence of island of inversion around $N=20$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend a nuclear ab initio framework based on chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions to investigate shape coexistence and the degradation of the $N=20$ magic number in both even-even and odd-even neutron-rich nuclei. The quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, combined with the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG), is employed to compute their low-lying states. This approach successfully reproduces the coexistence of weakly and strongly deformed states at comparable energies, providing a natural explanation for the emergence of the $N=20$ island of inversion through the IMSRG evolution of the chiral Hamiltonian. The results highlight the essential roles of both dynamic and static collective correlations in reproducing the ordering of nuclear states with distinct shapes. This work represents a significant advance in the application of ab initio methods to the intricate phenomenon of shape coexistence in medium-mass nuclei.</description>

      <title>QCD Predictions for Meson Electromagnetic Form Factors at High Momenta: Testing Factorization in Exclusive Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first lattice QCD computation of pion and kaon electromagnetic form factors, $F_M(Q^2)$, at large momentum transfer up to 10 and 28 $\mathrm{GeV}^2$, respectively. Utilizing physical masses and two fine lattices, we achieve good agreement with JLab experimental results at $Q^2 \lesssim 4~\mathrm{GeV}^2$. For $Q^2 \gtrsim 4~\mathrm{GeV}^2$, our results provide $\textit{ab-initio}$ QCD benchmarks for the forthcoming experiments at JLab 12 GeV and future electron-ion colliders. We also test the QCD collinear factorization framework utilizing our high-$Q^2$ form factors at next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbation theory, which relates the form factors to the leading Fock-state meson distribution amplitudes. Comparisons with independent lattice QCD calculations using the same framework demonstrate, within estimated uncertainties, the universality of these nonperturbative quantities.</description>
