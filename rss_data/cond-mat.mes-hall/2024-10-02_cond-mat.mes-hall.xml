      <title>Supersymmetry in the Landau Level Problem with a Disorder Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a supersymmetric (SUSY) theory that arises in the Landau level problem with disorder. Charged particles in a strong magnetic field and a local potential are described by small excitations around the ground state, the lowest Landau level (LLL). Around forty years ago Br\'ezin, Gross and Itzykson showed that for a disorder potential certain observables in the LLL limit are described by a chiral SUSY theory. As a consequence, the problem undergoes a dimensional reduction by two dimensions, simplifying the computations. We generalize their findings by identifying the chiral SUSY as a special limit of a `magnetic Parisi-Sourlas (PS)' theory. The latter is a modification of the theories associated to fixed points of random field models. We show that the SUSY features extend to a much larger class of observables and to higher Landau levels. Finally we identify a set of new super-Ward identities and show how observables in the disordered theory must satisfy them.</description>

      <title>Topologically-enhanced exciton transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons dominate the optoelectronic response of many materials. Depending on the timescale and host material, excitons can exhibit free diffusion, phonon-limited diffusion, or polaronic diffusion, and exciton transport often limits the efficiency of optoelectronic devices such as solar cells or photodetectors. We demonstrate that topological excitons exhibit enhanced diffusion in all transport regimes. Appealing to notions of quantum geometry, we find that topological excitons are generically larger and more dispersive than their trivial counterparts, promoting their diffusion. We apply this general theory to a range of organic polyacene semiconductors, and show that exciton transport increases four-fold when topological excitons are present. We also propose that non-uniform electric fields can be used to directly probe the quantum metric of excitons, providing an experimental window into a basic geometric feature of quantum states. Our results provide a new avenue to enhance exciton transport and reveal that the mathematical ideas of topology and quantum geometry can be important ingredients in designing next-generation optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>A review on Aharonov-Bohm quantum machines: Thermoelectric heat engines and diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of heat-to-work conversion has gained significant attention in recent years, highlighting the potential of nanoscale systems to achieve energy conversion in steady-state devices without any macroscopic moving parts. This review examines the theoretical frameworks governing the steady-state flows of quantum particles like electrons, photons, and phonons within various mesoscopic or nanoscale devices, such as thermoelectric heat engines in the context of quantum dot Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometric configurations. Quantum interference effects hold great promise for enhancing the thermoelectric transport properties of such quantum devices by allowing more precise control over energy levels and transport pathways. Driven quantum dot AB networks can maintain quantum coherence and provide precise experimental control. Unlike bulk systems, nanoscale systems like quantum dots reveal distinct quantum interference phenomena, including sharp features in transmission spectra and Fano resonances. This review highlights the distinction between optimization methods that produce boxcar functions and coherent control methods that result in complex interference patterns. It reveals that the effective design of thermoelectric heat engines requires careful tailoring of quantum interference and the magnetic field-induced effects to enhance performance. We emphasize how magnetic fields can change the bounds of power or efficiency. These machines with broken time-reversal symmetry provide insights into directional dependencies and asymmetries in quantum transport. We offer a thorough overview of past and current research on quantum thermoelectric heat engines using the AB effect and present a detailed review of three-terminal AB heat engines, where broken time-reversal symmetry can induce a coherent diode effect. We cover bounds on power and efficiency in systems with broken time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Infinite magneto-resistance and bipolar effect in spin valves driven by spin batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that spin valves under suitable symmetry conditions exhibit an ON-OFF response to a spin battery. While a spin valve driven by a charge battery displays the usual GMR (Giant Magneto-Resistance), a pure spin current or pure spin accumulation can generate an infinite magneto-resistance effect(IMR). In practice the effect is curtailed by asymmetry but the achievable magneto-resistance ratio is still predicted to be unusually large in several example setups. It is closely related to the bipolar effect (BE) of Johnson transistor which can be triggered under the same symmetry conditions.</description>

      <title>Millikelvin Si-MOSFETs for Quantum Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large power consumption of silicon CMOS electronics is a challenge in very-large-scale integrated circuits and a major roadblock to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Matching the power dissipation of Si-MOSFETs to the thermal budget at deep cryogenic temperatures, below 1 K, requires switching performance beyond levels facilitated by currently available CMOS technologies. We have manufactured fully depleted silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs tailored for overcoming the power dissipation barrier towards sub-1 K applications. With these cryo-optimized transistors we achieve a major milestone of reaching subthreshold swing of 0.3 mV/dec at 420 mK, thereby enabling very-large-scale integration of cryo-CMOS electronics for ultra-low temperature applications.</description>

      <title>Isolated zero-energy flat-bands and intrinsic magnetism in carbon monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat-band in twisted graphene bilayer has garnered widespread attention, and whether flat-bands can be realized in carbon monolayer is an interesting topic worth exploring in condensed matter physics. In this work, we demonstrate that, based on the theory of compact localized states, a series of two-dimensional carbon allotropes with flat-bands can be achieved. Two of them named as 191-8-66-C-r567x-1 and 191-10-90-C-r567x-1 are confirmed to be dynamically stable carbon phases with isolated or weakly overlapped flat-bands at the Fermi-level. The maximum Fermi velocities of the flat-band electrons are evaluated to be 1x10^4 m/s and 0.786x10^4 m/s, both of which are lower than the Fermi velocity of the flat-band electrons in magic-angle graphene (4x10^4 m/s). Furthermore, 191-8-66-C-r567x-1 has been confirmed to be a flat-band related magnetic half-metal with a magnetic moment of 1.854 miuB per cell, while 191-10-90-C-r567x-1 is a flat-band related magnetic normal metal with a magnetic moment of 1.663 miuB per cell. These results not only show that flat-bands can be constructed in carbon monolayer, but also indicate the potential for achieving non-metallic magnetic materials with light elements based on flat-band theory.</description>

      <title>Impact of the angular alignment on the crystal field and intrinsic doping of bilayer graphene/BN heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy gap of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene can be tuned by applying a perpendicular electric field. The origin of this gap can be traced down to the breaking of its inversion symmetry by an onsite potential difference between the layers. This degree of tunability makes bilayer graphene a perfect playground for the study of the effects of electric fields, such as the crystalline field, which are developed when layers of other materials are deposited on top of it. Here, we introduce a novel device architecture allowing a simultaneous control over the applied displacement field and the crystalline alignment between two materials. Our experimental and numerical results confirm that the crystal field and electrostatic doping due to the interface reflect the 120$^{\circ}$ symmetry of the bilayer graphene/BN heterostructure and are highly affected by the commensurate state. These results provide an unique insight into the role of the twist angle in the development of internal crystal fields and intrinsic electrostatic doping in heterostructures. Our results highligth the importance of layer alignment, beyond the existence of a moir\'e superlattice, to understand and simulate the intrinsic properties of a van der Waal heterostructure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene is being increasingly used as an interesting transducer membrane in micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS, respectively) due to its atomical thickness, extremely high carrier mobility, high mechanical strength and piezoresistive electromechanical transductions. NEMS devices based on graphene feature increased sensitivity, reduced size, and new functionalities. In this review, we discuss the merits of graphene as a functional material for MEMS and NEMS, the related properties of graphene, the transduction mechanisms of graphene MEMS and NEMS, typical transfer methods for integrating graphene with MEMS substrates, methods for fabricating suspended graphene, and graphene patterning and electrical contact. Consequently, we provide an overview of devices based on suspended and nonsuspended graphene structures. Finally, we discuss the potential and challenges of applications of graphene in MEMS and NEMS. Owing to its unique features, graphene is a promising material for emerging MEMS, NEMS and sensor applications.</description>

      <title>Four ribbons of double-layer graphene suspending masses for NEMS applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene ribbons with a suspended proof mass for nanomechanical systems have been rarely studied. Here, we report three types of nanomechanical devices consisting of graphene ribbons (two ribbons, four ribbons-cross and four ribbons-parallel) with suspended Si proof masses and studied their mechanical properties. The resonance frequencies and built-in stresses of three types of devices ranged from tens of kHz to hundreds of kHz, and from 82.61 MPa to 545.73 MPa, respectively, both of which decrease with the increase of the size of proof mass. The devices with four graphene ribbons featured higher resonance frequencies and spring constants, but lower built-in stresses than two ribbon devices under otherwise identical conditions. The Young's modulus and fracture strain of double-layer graphene were measured to be 0.34 TPa and 1.13% respectively, by using the experimental data and finite element analysis (FEA) simulations. Our studies would lay the foundation for understanding of mechanical properties of graphene ribbons with a suspended proof mass and their potential applications in nanoelectromechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Humidity Sensing Properties of Different Atomic Layers of Graphene on SiO2/Si Substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene has the great potential to be used for humidity sensing due to ultrahigh surface area and conductivity. However, the impact of different atomic layers of graphene on SiO2/Si substrate on the humidity sensing have not been studied yet. In this paper, we fabricated three types of humidity sensors on SiO2/Si substrate based on one to three atomic layers of graphene, in which the sensing areas of graphene are 75 {\mu}m * 72 {\mu}m and 45 {\mu}m * 72 {\mu}m, respectively. We studied the impact of both the number of atomic layers of graphene and the sensing areas of graphene on the responsivity and response/recovery time of the prepared graphene-based humidity sensors. We found the relative resistance change of the prepared devices decreased with the increase of number of atomic layers of graphene under the same change of relative humidity. Further, devices based on tri-layer graphene showed the fastest response/recovery time while devices based on double-layer graphene showed the slowest response/recovery time. Finally, we chose the devices based on double-layer graphene that have relatively good responsivity and stability for application in respiration monitoring and contact-free finger monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a cylindrical plasmonic waveguide consisting of a magnetic Weyl semimetal embedded in a dielectric medium. We determine the dispersion relation of the surface plasmon polaritons and show how it depends on the plasma frequency, the radius of the semimetal and the separation between the nodes. We show that the band structure, which modifies the electrodynamics in the medium, manifests itself through a pronounced asymmetry in the dispersion curves and a giant splitting in the group velocity, with the orbital angular momentum as a control parameter for the direction of propagation.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical properties of electron gas in a chain of planar quantum rings: Effect of screening on the signature of quantum phase interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium properties and interminiband transitions for Hartree-interacting two-dimensional electron gas in a one-dimensional chain of planar quantum rings subjected to a transverse homogeneous magnetic field are examined theoretically and numerically. The proposed analytical models for the external modulation potential and the basis wave-function reflect the symmetry and the topology of the system allowing to get high accuracy results in comparatively short computational times. The calculated dependencies of the electronic band structure versus magnetic field show two detached minibands in the region of low energies, while higher minibands manifest multiple crossings and anticrossings. The existence of highly degenerate energy levels (referred to as miniband nodes) for certain values of magnetic field is revealed. The miniband nodes are preserved when taking into account the Coulomb interaction of the electrons. The interaction leads to an up-shift and a broadening of the minibands, as well as to a shift of the nodes toward the larger values of the magnetic field. The miniband nodes have their signature in the magnetization of the electron gas and in the interminiband transitions. The number of electrons per a unite cell of the system has a strong impact on the current density distribution, magnetization and the oscillator strength. The obtained results open new opportunities for a flexible manipulation of magneto-optical properties of future devices operating in far-infrared and THz regimes.</description>

      <title>Fast switchable unidirectional magnon emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon spintronics is an emerging field that explores the use of magnons, the quanta of spin waves in magnetic materials for information processing and communication. Achieving unidirectional information transport with fast switching capability is critical for the development of fast integrated magnonic circuits, which offer significant advantages in high-speed, low-power information processing. However, previous unidirectional information transport has primarily focused on Damon-Eshbach spin wave modes, which are non-switchable as their propagation direction is defined by the direction of the external field and cannot be changed in a short time. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a fast switchable unidirectional magnon emitter in the forward volume spin wave mode by a current-induced asymmetric Oersted field. Our findings reveal significant nonreciprocity and nanosecond switchability, underscoring the potential of the method to advance high-speed spin-wave processing networks.</description>

      <title>Revealing non-Markovian Kondo transport with waiting time distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate non-Markovian transport dynamics and signatures of the Kondo effect in a single impurity Anderson model. The model consists of a quantum dot (QD) with ultra-strong coupling to a left lead and weak coupling to a right lead acting as a detector. We calculate the waiting time distribution (WTD) of electrons tunneling into the detector using a combination of the hierarchical equations of motion approach (HEOM) and a dressed master equation. Oscillations emerge in the short-time WTD, becoming more pronounced with stronger left-lead coupling. Fourier analysis reveals a blue shift in the oscillation frequency as coupling increases, indicating enhanced system-bath hybridization. Crucially, comparison with a dressed master equation confirms that these oscillations are a direct consequence of non-Markovian system-bath correlations. We examine the Kondo effect's influence on these oscillations by varying the quantum dot's Coulomb repulsion. Increasing this interaction enhances the WTD oscillations, coinciding with the signatures of a strengthened Kondo resonance in the quantum dot's density of states. Our results demonstrate that WTD oscillations offer a valuable tool for probing non-Markovian system-bath interactions and the emergence of Kondo correlations within quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>Itinerant magnetism in Hubbard models with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wide variety of experimental platforms, ranging from semiconductor quantum-dot arrays to moir\'e materials, have recently emerged as powerful quantum simulators for studying the Hubbard model and its variants. Motivated by these developments, here, we investigate a generalization of the Hubbard model which includes the effects of long-range Coulomb interactions. Working on finite-sized two-dimensional square and triangular lattices, we use exact diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group calculations to probe the magnetic structure of the ground state in the strong-coupling regime, where $U$ (the onsite repulsion) $\gg$ $t$ (the nearest-neighbor hopping). For small electron dopings above the half-filled antiferromagnet, we numerically uncover a rich variety of magnetically ordered states, and in conjunction with theoretical arguments, infer the phase diagram of the system as a function of doping and interaction strengths. In particular, we find that the inclusion of long-range Coulomb interactions induces an instability of high-spin states$\unicode{x2014}$such as the saturated Nagaoka ferromagnet$\unicode{x2014}$towards phase separation and stripe ordering. We also present proposals for the observation of some of our key findings in experiments that would shed further light on this paradigmatic strongly correlated system.</description>

      <title>Mumax3-cQED: an extension of Mumax3 to simulate magnon-photon interactions in cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the well-known micromagnetic package Mumax3 to simulate magnon-polaritons in realistic magnetic materials and nanostructures. Mumax3-cQED leverages the full GPU-accelerated capabilities of Mumax3 to model standard spin-spin interactions and the coupling of magnetic moments to external space- and time-dependent magnetic fields, with the additional unique feature of including the coupling to a cavity. We validate the code against results obtained from the Dicke model in both the paramagnetic and the superradiant phases. We show that hybrid magnon-light states can be calculated, as well as the non-equilibrium dynamics and their approach to equilibrium. In addition, we demonstrate the potential of Mumax3-cQED to reproduce experimental results and design magnon-cavity experiments, including three-dimensional and coplanar waveguide resonators. The code is fully available and will be useful for designing experiments involving microscopic saturated ferromagnets as well as systems featuring spin textures such as domain walls, vortices, or skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Flux-pump induced degradation of $T_1$ for dissipative cat qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative stabilization of cat qubits autonomously corrects for bit flip errors by ensuring that reservoir-engineered two-photon losses dominate over other mechanisms inducing phase flip errors. To describe the latter, we derive an effective master equation for an asymmetrically threaded SQUID based superconducting circuit used to stabilize a dissipative cat qubit. We analyze the dressing of relaxation processes under drives in time-dependent Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory for weakly anharmonic bosonic degrees of freedom, and in numerically exact Floquet theory. We find that spurious single-photon decay rates can increase under the action of the parametric pump that generates the required interactions for cat-qubit stabilization. Our analysis feeds into mitigation strategies that can inform current experiments, and the methods presented here can be extended to other circuit implementations.</description>

      <title>Programmable lattices for non-Abelian topological photonics and braiding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian physics, originating from noncommutative sequences of operations, unveils novel topological degrees of freedom for advancing band theory and quantum computation. In photonics, significant efforts have been devoted to developing reconfigurable non-Abelian platforms, serving both as classical testbeds for non-Abelian quantum phenomena and as programmable systems that harness topological complexities. Here we establish topological spinor lattices for non-Abelian programmable photonics. We design a building block for reconfigurable unitary coupling between pseudospin resonances, achieving a universal set of rotation gates through coupling along the unit cell boundary. The lattice assembly of our building blocks enables the emulation of the extended quantum Hall family across various eigenspinor bases. Particularly, we reveal the emergence of a non-Abelian interface even when the bulks are Abelian, which allows the topologically trivial engineering of topologically protected edge states. We also define the braid group for pseudospin observables, demonstrating non-Abelian braiding operations and the Yang-Baxter relations. Our results pave the way for realizing a reconfigurable testbed for a wide class of Abelian and non-Abelian topological phenomena and braiding operations.</description>

      <title>First-principles computational methods for quantum defects in two-dimensional materials: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum defects are atomic defects in materials that provide resources to construct quantum information devices such as single-photon emitters (SPEs) and spin qubits. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials gained prominence as a host of quantum defects with many attractive features derived from their atomically thin and layered material formfactor. In this perspective, we discuss first-principles computational methods and challenges to predict the spin and electronic properties of quantum defects in 2D materials. We focus on the open quantum system nature of the defects and their interaction with external parameters such as electric field, magnetic field, and lattice strain. We also discuss how such prediction and understanding can be used to guide experimental studies, ranging from defect identification to tuning of their spin and optical properties. This perspective provides significant insights into the interplay between the defect, the host material, and the environment, which will be essential in the pursuit of ideal two-dimensional quantum defect platforms.</description>

      <title>Phonon coherence and minimum thermal conductivity in disordered superlattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon coherence elucidates the propagation and interaction of phonon quantum states within superlattice, unveiling the wave-like nature and collective behaviors of phonons. Taking MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ lateral heterostructures as a model system, we demonstrate that the intricate interplay between wave-like and particle-like phonons, previously observed in perfect superlattice only, also occurs in disordered superlattice. By employing molecular dynamics simulation based on a highly accurate and efficient machine-learned potential constructed herein, we observe a non-monotonic dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity on the interface density in both perfect and disordered superlattice, with a global minimum occurring at relatively higher interface density for disordered superlattice. The counter-intuitive phonon coherence contribution can be characterized by the lagged self-similarity of the structural sequences in the disordered superlattice. Our findings extend the realm of coherent phonon transport from perfect superlattice to more general structures, which offers more flexibility in tuning thermal transport in superlattices.</description>

Abstract: The determination of mechanical properties such as the Young's modulus provides an important means to compare classical molecular dynamics simulations with materials. In this respect, ultra-thin materials hold several challenges: their volume is ambiguous, and different methods to determine a stress-strain relation deliver different result in particular for disordered systems. Using the example of carbon nanomembranes we show that stress-strain simulations following experimental setups deliver correct results if adjusted carefully.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological photonics enables unprecedented photon manipulation by realizing various topological states, such as corner states, edge states, and surface states. However, achieving a topological fiber state has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a topological fiber state in a Weyl gyromagnetic photonic crystal fiber. By applying an in-plane magnetic bias to a gyromagnetic photonic crystal fiber with broken parity-inversion symmetry, we create an asymmetrical Weyl bandgap that supports one-way fiber states associated with type-II Weyl points. Dispersion and topological invariant calculations reveal the transition from Weyl surface states to one-way Weyl fiber states. Electromagnetic field simulations confirm the existence of one-way Weyl fiber states and their robust transport in the presence of metallic obstacle along the transport path. Our findings offer an intriguing pathway for exploring novel topological states and guiding the design of topological fibers.</description>

Abstract: Orbital Hall effect in the altermagnetic RuO2 is theoretically investigated. Transport calculations using the Kubo formula with a first-principles tight-binding model present a significant orbital Hall conductivity depending on the direction of the Neel vector. An pertuabative analysis explaines the mechanism by two roles of the spin-orbit interaction: converting the spin current into the parallelly polarized orbital current; recovering the orbital angular momentum anisotropically under the orthorhombic ligand field on the Ru sites. From an application perspective, this effect provides a promising method of generating orbital currents polarizing to arbitrary directions, realising an orbital source offering both controllability and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: For spin batteries we introduce the concept of internal spin resistance which quantifies the amount of backflow from the load to the battery. It allows to relate through a Thevenin-Norton relation, spin current sources to spin accumulation sources. The value of the internal spin resistance is derived explicitly for several spin batteries based on spin injection, ferromagnetic resonance or spin Hall effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.13285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optical properties of bulk ZrSiS nodal-line semimetal are theoretically studied within a many-body formalism. The G0W0 bands are similar to those calculated within the density functional theory, except near the {\Gamma} point; in particular, no significant differences are found around the Fermi energy. On the other hand, the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation reveals a significant excitonic activity, mostly as dark excitons which appear in a wide energy range. Bright excitons, on the contrary, are less numerous, but their location and intensity depend greatly on the polarization of the incident electric field, as the absorption coefficient itself does. The binding energy of these excitons correlate well with their spatial distribution functions. In any case, a good agreement with available experimental data for absorption-reflection is achieved. Finally, the possible activation of plasma oscillations at low energies is discarded, because these are damped by producing electron-hole pairs, more importantly for q along the {\Gamma}-M path.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic planar Hall effects in Bi$_2$Se$_3$/EuS interfaces: Deciphering the role of proximity induced spin canting and topological spin texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proximity coupling of ferromagnetic insulator EuS to the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ has been proposed to break time-reversal symmetry near the surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, introducing an energy gap or a tilt in the surface Dirac cone. As an inverse proximity effect, strong spin-orbit coupling available in the topological surface states can enhance the Curie temperature of ferromagnetism in EuS largely beyond its bulk value, and also generate a magnetic anisotropy. This can result in a canting of the magnetic moment of Eu ions in a plane perpendicular to the interface. Here, we investigate theoretically electronic transport properties arising from the Bi$_2$Se$_3$/EuS interfaces in the planar Hall geometry. Our analysis, based on a realistic model Hamiltonian and a semi-classical formalism for the Boltzmann transport equation, reveals distinct intriguing features of anisotropic planar Hall conductivity, depending on different scenarios for the canting of the Eu moments: fixed Eu moment canting, and freely-orientable Eu moment in response to the external in-plane magnetic field. The anisotropy in the planar Hall conductivity arises from the asymmetric Berry curvature of the gapped topological surface states. We also explore topological Hall effect of the Dirac surface states, coupled to a skyrmion crystal which can emerge in the EuS due to the interplay of ferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and perpendicular alignment of the Eu moment. Our study provides new impetus for probing complex interplay between magnetic exchange interactions and topological surface states via anisotropic planar Hall effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we report an excitation of chaos and a non-trivial magnetization switching via transient chaos in a three-terminal spin-torque oscillator (STO). The driving force of the chaos is a voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect generated by a feedback signal from the STO since the feedback effect is known to be effective in exciting chaos in a dynamical system. Solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation numerically and applying temporal and statistical analyses to its solution, the existence of the chaos driven by the feedback VCMA effect is identified. Simultaneously, however, transient chaos is also observed, where the magnetization initially shows chaotic behavior but finally switches its direction. This transient dynamics from chaos to magnetization switching was unexpected because the sign of the feedback VCMA effect was chosen so that the switching current increases and, as a result, the situation rather favors the condition for sustaining chaos. It is implied that this switching happens when narrowing a stable region of the magnetic potential energy by the feedback effect and magnetization precession pointing to a saddle point coincidentally occur simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Influence of flat bands on RKKY interaction: perspective of Fano defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the effect of flat bands on the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction by using a coordinate transformation that detangles flat-band states from dispersive ones. Under this transformation, original flat-band systems containing magnetic impurities are mapped onto a generalized Fano-Anderson model, where flat-band states act as Fano defects. From this perspective, several features of exact RKKY couplings calculated numerically can be understood easily. As an illustrative example, we analyze a dimerized diamond chain model, which can exhibit either gapped or gapless spectra depending on the ratio of hopping integrals. We find that anomalous decay in the RKKY couplings arises exclusively in the gapless case and with specific magnetic coupling configurations. Furthermore, the conventional wisdom regarding the signs of RKKY interactions breaks down under certain conditions. These subtleties arising from flat bands find explanation within our present approach. Our investigation offers deeper insights into how flat bands influence carrier-mediated exchange interactions, with implications extending to broader contexts.</description>

      <title>Natural width of the superconducting transition in epitaxial TiN films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of various fluctuation mechanisms on the DC resistance in superconducting devices based on epitaxial titanium nitride (TiN) films. The samples we studied show a relatively steep resistive transition (RT), with a transition width $\Delta T/T_\mathrm{c} \sim 0.002-0.025$, depending on the film thickness (20 nm, 9 nm, and 5 nm) and device dimensions. This value is significantly broader than expected due to conventional superconducting fluctuations ($\Delta T/T_\mathrm{c} \ll 10^{-3}$). The shape and width of the RT can be perfectly described by the well-known effective medium theory, which allows us to understand the origin of the inhomogeneity in the superconducting properties of TiN films. We propose that this inhomogeneity can have both dynamic and static origins. The dynamic mechanism is associated with spontaneous fluctuations in electron temperature (T-fluctuations), while the static mechanism is due to a random spatial distribution of surface magnetic disorder (MD). Our analysis has revealed clear correlations between the transition width and material parameters as well as device size for both proposed mechanisms. While T-fluctuations may contribute significantly to the observed transition width, our findings suggest that the dominant contribution comes from the MD mechanism. Our results provide new insights into the microscopic origin of broadening of the superconducting transition and inhomogeneity in thin superconducting films.</description>

      <title>Tree-like process tensor contraction for automated compression of environments</title>

Abstract: The algorithm "automated compression of environments" (ACE) [Nat. Phys. 18, 662 (2022)] provides a versatile way of simulating an extremely broad class of open quantum systems. This is achieved by encapsulating the influence of the environment, which is determined by the interaction Hamiltonian(s) and initial states, into compact process tensor matrix product operator (PT-MPO) representations. The generality of the ACE method comes at high numerical cost. Here, we demonstrate that orders-of-magnitude improvement of ACE is possible by changing the order of PT-MPO contraction from a sequential to a tree-like scheme. The problem of combining two partial PT-MPOs with large inner bonds is solved by a preselection approach. The drawbacks of the preselection approach are that the MPO compression is suboptimal and that it is more prone to error accumulation than sequential combination and compression. We therefore also identify strategies to mitigate these disadvantages by fine-tuning compression parameters. This results in a scheme that is similar in compression efficiency and accuracy to the original ACE algorithm, yet is significantly faster. Our numerical experiments reach similar conclusions for bosonic and fermionic test cases, suggesting that our findings are characteristic of the combination of PT-MPOs more generally.</description>

      <title>Buried Dirac points in Quantum Spin Hall Insulators: Implications for edge transport and Majorana Kramer Pairs</title>

Abstract: For heterostructures formed by a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) placed in proximity to a superconductor (SC), no external magnetic field is necessary to drive the system into a phase supporting topological superconductivity with Majorana zero energy states, making them very attractive for the realization of non-Abelian states and fault-tolerant qubits. Despite considerable work investigating QSHI edge states, there is still an open question about their resilience to large magnetic fields and the implication of such resilience for the formation of a quasi-1D topological superconducting state. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of helical edge states in a QSHI-SC junction formed by a InAs/GaSb (15nm/5nm) double quantum well and a superconducting tantalum (Ta) constriction. We observe a robust conductance plateau up to 2 T, signaling resilient edge state transport. Such resilience is consistent with the Dirac point for the edge states being buried in the bulk valence band. Using a modified Landauer-Buttiker analysis, we find that the conductance is consistent with 98% Andreev reflection probability owing to the high transparency of the InAs/GaSb-Ta interface. We further theoretically show that a buried Dirac point does not affect the robustness of the quasi-1D topological superconducting phase, and favors the hybridization of Majorana Kramer pairs and fermionic modes in the QSHI resulting in extended MKP states, highlighting the subtle role of buried Dirac points in probing MKPs.</description>

      <title>Element-specific, non-destructive profiling of layered heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Fabrication of semiconductor heterostructures is now so precise that metrology has become a key challenge for progress in science and applications. It is now relatively straightforward to characterize classic III-V and group IV heterostructures consisting of slabs of different semiconductor alloys with thicknesses of $\sim$5 nm and greater using sophisticated tools such as X-ray diffraction, high energy X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. However, profiling thin layers with nm or sub-nm thickness, e.g. atomically thin dopant layers ($\delta$-layers), of impurities required for modulation doping and spin-based quantum and classical information technologies is more challenging.
  Here, we present theory and experiment showing how resonant-contrast X-ray reflectometry meets this challenge. The technique takes advantage of the change in the scattering factor of atoms as their core level resonances are scanned by varying the X-ray energy. We demonstrate the capability of the resulting element-selective, non-destructive profilometry for single arsenic $\delta$-layers within silicon, and show that the sub-nm electronic thickness of the $\delta$-layers corresponds to sub-nm chemical thickness. In combination with X-ray fluorescence imaging, this enables non-destructive three-dimensional characterization of nano-structured quantum devices. Due to the strong resonances at soft X-ray wavelengths, the technique is also ideally suited to characterize layered quantum materials, such as cuprates or the topical infinite-layer nickelates.</description>
