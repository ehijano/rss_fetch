      <title>Energy Estimates for Fractional Evolution Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a more broadly applicable version of an energy inequality for weak solutions of evolution equations involving fractional time derivatives. Unlike the classical identity that relates the time derivative of the squared norm to the inner product of the derivative and the function itself, its fractional analogue typically requires a regularity condition that is difficult to verify in practice. We revisit this inequality in the setting of square integrable functions over an open domain and provide a new proof based solely on the assumption that the solution is essentially bounded in time. In our approach, the required regularity emerges naturally within the argument, rather than being imposed beforehand. This refinement expands the scope of applicability of the inequality and offers a rigorous foundation for using the Faedo Galerkin method in problems governed by fractional evolution equations. As an application, we prove existence, uniqueness, and regularity of weak solutions to the fractional heat equation.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: Revisiting the Failure of Concatenation in Mittag-Leffler Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The function $t \mapsto E_{\alpha}(\lambda t^\alpha)$ is widely regarded as the fractional analogue of the exponential function, yet its algebraic properties remain poorly understood. In particular, standard references lack a rigorous proof of the failure of the semigroup property. In this work, we fill this gap by providing an analytical proof that the semigroup property holds if and only if either $\alpha = 1$ or $\lambda = 0$. Our result establishes a precise criterion for when Mittag-Leffler dynamics are compatible with semigroup evolution, thereby emphasizing the intrinsic nonlocality of fractional-order differential equations.</description>

      <title>Hunter-type Implosion Profiles for Energy-supercritical Polytropic Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously construct a family of smooth self-similar solutions to the isentropic gravitational Euler-Poisson system with a polytropic equation of state for polytropic indices lying in the full energy-supercritical range, $1&lt;\gamma&lt;\frac{6}{5}$. The result is an extension of the author's previous construction of Hunter solutions in the isothermal case, $\gamma=1$, and complements a construction of Larson-Penston-type solutions by Guo-Had\v{z}i\'c-Jang-Schrecker for the same system in the full mass-supercritical range, $1&lt;\gamma&lt;\frac{4}{3}$. As an ingredient in the proof, a general framework is introduced for proving local analyticity of solutions to this system in the vicinity of singular points. This framework could be used for other quasilinear self-similar blow-up constructions.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Riemann Problem for a $2 \times 2$ System of Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Conservation Laws Using Shadow Waves and Dafermos Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of two conservation laws and provide a detailed description of both classical and non-classical self-similar Riemann solutions. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of overcompressive delta shocks as singular limits of the Dafermos regularization of the system. The system is chosen for its minimal yet representative structure, which captures the essential features of transport dynamics under density constraints. Our analysis is carried out using blow-up techniques within the framework of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT), allowing us to resolve the internal structure of these singular solutions. Despite its simplicity, the system serves as a versatile prototype for crowding-limited transport across a range of applications, including biological aggregation, ecological dispersal, granular compaction, and traffic congestion. Our findings are supported by numerical simulations using the Local Lax-Friedrichs scheme.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of positive radial solutions for semipositone $\phi$-Laplacian problems with superlinear reaction term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to prove the nonexistence of positive radial solutions to the problem $-\Delta_\phi u=\lambda f(u)$, $x\in B_1(0)$, $u(x)=0$ on $|x|=1$, for $\lambda&gt;0$ sufficiently large. Here, $\phi$ is a continuous function, $\Delta_\phi$ denotes the $\phi$-Laplacian operator which is defined by $\Delta_\phi (u):=div (\phi (|\nabla u|) \nabla u)$, and $B_1(0)$ is the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^N$, with $N&gt;1$. Furthermore, $f$ is a continuous, nondecreasing function such that $f(0)&lt;0$, and its behavior at infinity is intimately related to $\phi$. Our findings are presented in a combined format, employing both an indirect argument and an energy analysis.</description>

      <title>$L^{2}$-estimates for the linear elastic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the large time behavior of the solution to the Cauchy problem for the elastic wave equations. In particular, optimal $L^{2}$ estimates of the elastic waves are obtained in the sense that the upper and lower bounds of the $L^{2}$ norms of each component of the solution are proved for large $t$, under the minimum assumptions necessary regarding regularity with respect to initial data. The proof is based on the approximation of the solution by a smooth auxiliary function with suitable parameters.</description>

      <title>Global solutions in $L^{p}_{v}L^{\infty}_{x}$ for the Boltzmann equation in bounded domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence theory for solutions to the Boltzmann equation in bounded domains has primarily been developed within uniformly bounded function classes, such as $L^{\infty}_{x,v}$, as in [Duan-Huang-Wang-Yang,2017], [Duan-Wang,2019], [Guo,2010]. In this paper, we investigate solutions in relaxed function spaces $L^{p}_{v}L^\infty_{x}$ for the initial-boundary value problem of the Boltzmann equation in bounded domains. We consider the case of hard potential under diffuse reflection boundary conditions and assume cutoff model. For large initial data in a weighted $L^{p}_{v}L^\infty_{x}$ space with small relative entropy, we construct unique global-in-time mild solution that converge exponentially to the global Maxwellian. A pointwise estimate for the gain term, bounded in terms of $L^p_v$ and $L^2_v$ norms, is essential to prove our main results. Relative to [Gualdani-Mischler-Mouhot,2017], our work provides an alternative perspective on convergence to equilibrium in the presence of boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Weighted estimates for the Stokes semigroup in the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the initial-boundary value problem for the Stokes system in the half-space, within the framework of weighted Lebesgue spaces. Introducing a new weight function defined via a product of powers of distances from fixed points, we establish existence, uniqueness, and regularity results for strong solutions to the Stokes problem in the half space. Our analysis generalizes previous results for the Stokes system in radial-weighted spaces (Galdi and Maremonti, J. Math. Fluid Mech. 25:7,2023; Maremonti and Pane, J. Math. Fluid Mech. 27:2,2025) and extends the theory to our setting. These results represent a first step toward the analysis of the Navier-Stokes system in weighted spaces, with applications in both half-space and exterior domain configurations.</description>

      <title>Event triggered control and exponential stability for infinite dimensional linear systems $\star$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims at providing a unified analysis of the exponential stabilization of some abstract infinite dimensional systems undergoing an event-triggering mechanism that samples the control input. The partial differential equation is supposed to be defined by a skew-adjoint operator and controlled and observed through bounded operators. The continuously controlled closed loop system is assumed to be exponentially stable and the goal is to prove that a well-designed event-triggering mechanism to rule the time updates of the sampled control will allow to keep such a stability property. The key of the proof relies on the existence of an adequate Lyapunov functional. Existence and regularity of the solution to the closed-loop event-triggered system are also proven, along with the avoidance of Zeno behavior.</description>

      <title>Sharp non-existence threshold for a parabolic Hardy-H{\'e}non equation with quasilinear diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal conditions for initial data leading to non-existence of non-negative solutions to the Cauchy problem for the parabolic Hardy-H{\'e}non equation $$ \partial\_tu=\Delta u^m+|x|^{\sigma}u^p, \quad (t,x)\in(0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^N, $$ with $m&gt;0$, $\sigma&gt;0$ and $p&gt;\max\{1,m\}$, are identified. Assuming that the initial condition satisfies $$ u\_0\in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N), \quad \lim\limits\_{|x|\to\infty}|x|^{\gamma}u\_0(x)=L\in(0,\infty), \quad u\_0\geq0, $$ it is shown that non-existence of solution occurs for $$ \gamma&lt;\frac{\sigma+2}{p-m} - \frac{2\max{\{p-p\_G,0\}}}{(p-1)(p-m)} $$ with $$ p\_G:=1+\frac{\sigma(1-m)}{2}. $$ The above threshold for non-existence is optimal, in view of the existence of self-similar solutions for the limiting value of $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Inverse Source Problems for the Time-Fractional Evolution Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the direct and linear inverse problems of identifying time-dependent and time-independent source terms in a time-fractional diffusion-wave equation, using measured data at an interior point of the time interval. We first establish the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of the solution to the direct problem by employing the spectral method. Then, based on the properties of the direct problem, we study two inverse problems: one involving the recovery of a time-independent source term, and the other concerning the identification of a time-dependent coefficient function in the source term.</description>

Abstract: The paper deals with the inverse problem of determining a polyhedral inclusion compactly contained in an elastic body from boundary measurements of traction and displacement taken on an open portion of the boundary. Both the inclusion and the body are made of homogeneous isotropic material. Under suitable assumptions on the geometry of the unknown inclusion, we prove a constructive Lipschitz stability estimate from the local Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous continuous loss of Sobolev regularity for the 3D incompressible Euler equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove instantaneous and continuous-in-time loss of supercritical Sobolev regularity for the 3D incompressible Euler equations in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Namely, for any $s\in (0,3/2)$ and $\varepsilon &gt;0$, we construct a divergence-free initial vorticity $\omega_0$ defined in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ satisfying $\| \omega_0 \|_{H^s}\leq \varepsilon$, as well as $T&gt;0$, $c&gt;0$ and a corresponding local-in-time solution $\omega$ such that, for each $t\in [0,T]$, $\omega (\cdot ,t ) \in {H^{\frac{s-ct}{1+ct}}}$ and $ \omega (\cdot ,t ) \not \in {H^\beta }$ for any $\beta &gt; \frac{s-ct}{1+ct} $. Moreover, $\omega$ is unique among all solutions with initial condition $\omega_0$ which are locally $C^2$ and belong to $C([0,T];L^p )$ for any $p&gt;3 $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study both existence and nonexistence of nonnegative solutions for nonlinear elliptic problems with singular lower order terms that have natural growth with respect to the gradient, whose model is $$ \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u + \frac{|\nabla u|^2}{u^{\gamma}} = f &amp; \mbox{in } \Omega,\newline
  \hfill u=0 \hfill &amp; \mbox{on } \partial \Omega, \end{cases} $$ where $\Omega$ is an open bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^N $, $\gamma&gt; 0$ and $f$ is a function which is strictly positive on every compactly contained subset of $\Omega$. As a consequence of our main results, we prove that the condition $\gamma&lt;2$ is necessary and sufficient for the existence of solutions in $H^{1}_{0}(\Omega)$ for every sufficiently regular $f$ as above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the frame hydrodynamics of biaxial nematic phases, a coupled system between the evolution of the orthonormal frame and the Navier--Stokes equation, which is derived from a molecular-theory-based dynamical tensor model about two second-order tensors. In two and three dimensions, we establish global well-posedness of strong solutions to the Cauchy problem of frame hydrodynamics for small initial data. The key ingredient of the proof relies on estimates of nonlinear terms with rotational derivatives on $SO(3)$, together with the dissipative structure of the frame hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Diffuse measures and nonlinear parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a parabolic cylinder $Q =(0,T)\times\Omega$, where $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{N}$ is a bounded domain, we prove new properties of solutions of \[ u_t-\Delta_p u = \mu \quad \text{in $Q$} \] with Dirichlet boundary conditions, where $\mu$ is a finite Radon measure in $Q$. We first prove a priori estimates on the $p$-parabolic capacity of level sets of $u$. We then show that diffuse measures (i.e.\@ measures which do not charge sets of zero parabolic $p$-capacity) can be strongly approximated by the measures $\mu_k = (T_k(u))_t-\Delta_p(T_k(u))$, and we introduce a new notion of renormalized solution based on this property. We finally apply our new approach to prove the existence of solutions of $$ u_t-\Delta_{p} u + h(u)=\mu \quad \text{in $Q$,} $$ for any function $h$ such that $h(s)s\geq 0$ and for any diffuse measure $\mu$; when $h$ is nondecreasing we also prove uniqueness in the renormalized formulation. Extensions are given to the case of more general nonlinear operators in divergence form.</description>

      <title>A duality approach to the fractional Laplacian with measure data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a duality method to prove both existence and uniqueness of solutions to nonlocal problems like $$ (-\Delta)^s v = \mu \quad \text{in}\ \mathbb{R}^N, $$ with vanishing conditions at infinity.
  Here $\mu$ is a bounded Radon measure whose support is compactly contained in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq2$, and $-(\Delta)^s$ is the fractional Laplace operator of order $s\in (1/2,1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes that, under the appropriate range of values of the parameters involved in the formulation of the model, a diffusive predator-prey system with saturation can have an arbitrarily large number of coexistence states for sufficiently large saturation rates. Moreover, it ascertains the global structure of the set of coexistence states in the limiting system as the saturation rate blows-up.</description>

      <title>Selection of the ground state on a compact metric graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the ground state in the Fisher--KPP model on a compact metric graph with Dirichlet conditions on boundary vertices is either trivial (zero) or nontrivial and strictly positive. For positive initial data, we prove that the trivial ground state is globally asymptotically stable if the edges of the metric graph are uniformly small and the nontrivial ground state is globally asymptotically stable if the edges are uniformly large. For the intermediate case, we find a sharp criterion for the existence, uniqueness and global asymptotic stability of the trivial versus nontrivial ground state. Besides standard methods based on the comparison theory, energy minimizers, and the lowest eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian, we develop a novel method based on the period function for differential equations to characterize the nontrivial ground state in the particular case of flower graphs.</description>

  As an application, we prove that every Riemannian 3-sphere of positive Ricci curvature contains, for every g, a genus g embedded minimal surface with area at most twice the first Simon-Smith width of the ambient 3-sphere.</description>

      <title>An index formula for families of end-periodic Dirac operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a transgression formula for the renormalized Chern character of the Bismut superconnection in the context of end-periodic fiber bundles and families of end-periodic Clifford modules. The transgression is expressed in terms of the Fourier-Laplace transform of the Bismut superconnection using the renormalized supertrace of Mrowka-Ruberman-Saveliev. Consequently, we establish an index formula for families of Dirac operators on end-periodic manifolds. The index formula involves a new ``end-periodic eta form'' which generalizes both the Bismut-Cheeger eta form and the end-periodic eta invariant of Mrowka-Ruberman-Saveliev.</description>

      <title>Existence and Multiplicity of Solutions for a Cooperative Elliptic System Using Morse Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of nontrivial solutions of the Dirichlet boundary value problem for the following elliptic system: \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{aligned} -\Delta u &amp; = au + bv + f(x,u,v); &amp;\quad\mbox{ for }x\in\Omega,\\ -\Delta v &amp; = bu + cv + g(x,u,v), &amp;\quad\mbox{ for }x\in\Omega,\\ u&amp;=v=0,&amp;\quad\mbox{ on }\partial\Omega, \end{aligned} \right.\qquad (1) \end{equation} for $x\in\Omega$, where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is an open and connected bounded set with a smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$, with $N\geqslant 3,$ $u,v:\overline{\Omega}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, $a,b,c\in\mathbb{R},$ and $f,g : \overline{\Omega} \times\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ are continuous functions with $f(x,0,0)=0$ and $g(x,0,0) = 0$, and with super-quadratic, but sub-critical growth in the last two variables. We prove that the boundary value problem (1) has at least two nontrivial solutions for the case in which the eigenvalues of the matrix $\displaystyle \textbf{M} = \begin{pmatrix} a &amp; b \\ b &amp; c \end{pmatrix}$ are higher than the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian over $\Omega$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions; $u = v= 0$ on $\partial\Omega$. We use variational methods and infinite-dimensional Morse theory to obtain the multiplicity result.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for the generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}$ and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we address the Cauchy problem associated with the $k$-generalized Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation posed on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}$. By establishing an almost optimal linear $L^4$-estimate, along with a family of bilinear refinements, we significantly lower the well-posedness threshold for all $k \geq 2$. In particular, we show that the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation is locally well-posed in $H^s(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T})$ for all $s &gt; \frac{3}{8}$.</description>

      <title>Second order estimates for a free boundary phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that minimizers of the Allen-Cahn-type functional
  \[
  J_\epsilon(u):=\int_\Omega\frac{\epsilon|\nabla u|^2}{2}+\frac{W(u)}{\epsilon},
  \]
  where $W$ is a double-well potential, resemble minimal surfaces in the sense that their level sets converge to a minimal surface as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. In this work, we consider the indicator potential $W(\tau)=\chi_{(-1,1)}(\tau)$, which leads to the Bernoulli-type free-boundary problem
  \[
  \left\{
  \begin{alignedat}{2}
  \Delta u&amp;=0&amp;\quad&amp;\textrm{in}\quad\{|u|&lt;1\}\\
  |\nabla u|&amp;=\epsilon^{-1}&amp;\quad&amp;\textrm{on}\quad\partial \{|u|&lt;1\}.
  \end{alignedat}
  \right.
  \]
  We provide a short proof that the transition layers are uniformly $C^{2,\alpha}$ regular, up to the free boundary. In addition to the uniform $C^{2,\alpha}$ estimate, we also obtain improved $C^\alpha$ mean curvature bound that decays in an algebraic rate of $\epsilon$, which confirms the convergence of interfaces to the minimal surface in a very strong sense. We present a simple elliptic equation
  \[
  \Delta\phi=H^2-|\mathbf{A}|^2
  \]
  where $\phi=\log(1/|\nabla u|)$ is the log-gradient of $u$, $H$ and $\mathbf{A}$ are the mean curvature and the second fundamental form of level surfaces, respectively. From this, the uniform estimates readily follow. The whole argument is performed in a general Riemannian manifold setting.</description>

      <title>Geometrical characterizations of radiating and non-radiating elastic sources and mediums with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate two types of time-harmonic elastic wave scattering problems. The first one involves the scattered wave generated by an active elastic source with compact support. The second one concerns elastic wave scattering caused by an inhomogeneous medium, also with compact support. We derive several novel quantitative results concerning the geometrical properties of the underlying scatterer, the associated source or incident wave field, and the physical parameters. In particular, we show that a scatterer with either a small support or high-curvature boundary points must radiate at any frequency. These qualitative characterizations allow us to establish several local and global uniqueness results for determining the support of the source or medium scatterer from a single far-field measurement. Furthermore, we reveal new geometric properties of elastic transmission eigenfunctions. To derive a quantitative relationship between the intensity of a radiating or non-radiating source and the diameter of its support, we utilize the Helmholtz decomposition, the translation-invariant $L^2$-norm estimate for the Lam\'e operator, and global energy estimates. Another pivotal technical approach combines complex geometric optics (CGO) solutions with local regularity estimates, facilitating microlocal analysis near admissible $K$-curvature boundary points.</description>
