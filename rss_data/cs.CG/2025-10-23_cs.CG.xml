      <title>Error Resilient Space Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.03675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major research area in discrete geometry is to consider the best way to partition the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ under various quality criteria. In this paper we introduce a new type of space partitioning that is motivated by the problem of rounding noisy measurements from the continuous space $\mathbb{R}^d$ to a discrete subset of representative values. Specifically, we study partitions of $\mathbb{R}^d$ into bounded-size tiles colored by one of $k$ colors, such that tiles of the same color have a distance of at least $t$ from each other. Such tilings allow for \emph{error-resilient} rounding, as two points of the same color and distance less than $t$ from each other are guaranteed to belong to the same tile, and thus, to be rounded to the same point.
  The main problem we study in this paper is characterizing the achievable tradeoffs between the number of colors $k$ and the distance $t$, for various dimensions $d$. On the qualitative side, we show that in $\mathbb{R}^d$, using $k=d+1$ colors is both sufficient and necessary to achieve $t&gt;0$. On the quantitative side, we achieve numerous upper and lower bounds on $t$ as a function of $k$. In particular, for $d=3,4,8,24$, we obtain sharp asymptotic bounds on $t$, as $k \to \infty$. We obtain our results with a variety of techniques including isoperimetric inequalities, the Brunn-Minkowski theorem, sphere packing bounds, Bapat's connector-free lemma, and \v{C}ech cohomology.</description>

      <title>VisDiff: SDF-Guided Polygon Generation for Visibility Reconstruction and Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05530v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to capture rich representations of combinatorial structures has enabled the application of machine learning to tasks such as analysis and generation of floorplans, terrains, images, and animations. Recent work has primarily focused on understanding structures with well-defined features, neighborhoods, or underlying distance metrics, while those lacking such characteristics remain largely unstudied. Examples of these combinatorial structures can be found in polygons, where a small change in the vertex locations causes a significant rearrangement of the combinatorial structure, expressed as a visibility or triangulation graphs. Current representation learning approaches fail to capture structures without well-defined features and distance metrics. In this paper, we study the open problem of Visibility Reconstruction: Given a visibility graph $G$, construct a polygon $P$ whose visibility graph is $G$.
  We introduce VisDiff, a novel diffusion-based approach to generate polygon $P$ from the input visibility graph $G$. The main novelty of our approach is that, rather than generating the polygon's vertex set directly, we first estimate the signed distance function (SDF) associated with the polygon. The SDF is then used to extract the vertex location representing the final polygon. We show that going through the SDF allows VisDiff to learn the visibility relationship much more effectively than generating vertex locations directly. In order to train VisDiff, we create a carefully curated dataset. We use this dataset to benchmark our method and achieve 26% improvement in F1-Score over standard methods as well as state of the art approaches.</description>

      <title>Bounding the number of holes required for folding rectangular polyominoes into cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of whether rectangular polyominoes with holes are cube-foldable, that is, whether they can be folded into a cube, if creases are only allowed along grid lines. It is known that holes of sufficient size guarantee that this is the case.
  Smaller holes which by themselves do not make a rectangular polyomino cube-foldable can sometimes be combined to create cube-foldable polyominoes. We investigate minimal sets of holes which guarantee cube-foldability. We show that if all holes are of the same type, the these minimal sets have size at most 4, and if we allow different types of holes, then there is no upper bound on the size.</description>
