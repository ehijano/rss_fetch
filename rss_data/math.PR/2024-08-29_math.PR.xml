      <title>Gibbs scheme in the theory of random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to expand and clarify the concept of the class of Gibbs random fields and give its structure the form accepted in the theory of random processes. It is possible thanks to the proposed purely probabilistic definition of the Gibbs random field without refereing to any physical notion. However, we do not oppose to each other the physical and probabilistic points of view on mathematical statistical physics; on the contrary, we show their natural compatibility within the framework of the suggested Gibbs scheme. The outlines of the corresponding theory are presented. In this theory, the DLR--definition is not used. At the same time, the related existence theorem provides one of adequate ways to construct Gibbs random fields (in the sense of probabilistic definition). The results of mathematical statistical physics are embedded in the theory of Gibbs random fields under development as its important (if not the most important) part. We describe in general terms the range of those problems that are more natural to solve using our definition. For example, the problem of the Gibbsian description of known classes of random fields as well as questions of validity of limit theorems of probability theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides a scaling limit for a family of skew interacting Brownian motions in the context of mesoscopic interface models. Let $d\in\mathbb N$, $y_1,\dots,y_M\in\mathbb R$ and $f\in C_b(\mathbb R)$ be fixed. For each $N\in\mathbb N$ we consider a $k_N$-dimensional, skew reflecting distorted Brownian motion $(X^{N,i}_t)_{i=1,\dots,k_N}$, $t\geq 0$, and investigate the scaling limits for $N\to\infty$. The drift includes skew reflections at height levels $\tilde y_j:=N^{1-\frac{d}{2}}y_j$ with intensities $\beta_j/N^d$ for $j=1,\dots,M$. The corresponding SDE is given by \begin{equation}
  d X^{N,i}_t=-\big(A_N X^{N}_t\big)_id t-\frac{1}{2}N^{-\tfrac{d}{2}-1}\,f\big(N^{\frac{d}{2}-1}X^{N,i}_t\big)d t
  \\+\sum_{j=1}^M\tfrac{1-e^{-\beta_j/N^d}}{1+e^{-\beta_j/N^d}}d l_t^{N,i, \tilde y_j}
  +d B_t^{N,i}, \end{equation} where ${(B_t^{N,i})}_{t\geq 0}$, $i=1,\dots, k_N$, are independent Brownian motions and $ l_t^{N,i, \tilde y_j}$ denotes the local time of ${(X^{N,i}_t)}_{t\geq 0}$ at $\tilde y_j$. We prove the weak convergence of the equilibrium laws of \begin{equation*}
  u_t^N=\Lambda_N\circ X^{N}_{N^2t},\quad t\geq 0, \end{equation*} for $N\to\infty$, choosing suitable injective, linear maps $\Lambda_N:\mathbb R^{k_N}\to \{h\,|\,h:D\to\mathbb R\}$. The scaling limit is a distorted Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose state space is the Hilbert space $H=L^2(D, dz)$. We characterize a class of height maps, such that the scaling limit of the dynamic is not influenced by the particular choice of ${(\Lambda_N)}_{N\in\mathbb N}$ within that class.</description>

      <title>Duality for some models of epidemic spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine three non-conservative interacting particle systems in one dimension modeling epidemic spreading: the diffusive contact process (DCP), a model that we introduce and call generalized diffusive contact process (GDCP), and the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model. For each system, we establish duality relations through an analytical approach. As an application, we provide a new expression of the correlation functions for the steady state of the finite volume DCP and GDCP in contact with boundary reservoirs. We explicitly compute the one point correlation function of the steady state of a small sized DCP, and for arbitrary size in a particular setting of the GDCP. For the infinite SIR model, the duality relation obtained yields an explicit expression of the time evolution of some specific correlation functions, describing the time decay of the sizes of chains of susceptible individuals.</description>

      <title>Markov Processes and Stochastic Extrinsic Derivative Flows on the Space of Absolutely Continuous Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E$ be the class of finite (resp. probability) measures absolutely continuous with respect to a $\sigma$-finite Radon measure on a Polish space. We present a criterion on the quasi-regularity of Dirichlet forms on $E$ in terms of upper bound conditions given by the uniform $(L^1+L^\infty)$-norm of the extrinsic derivative. As applications, we construct a class of general type Markov processes on $E$ via quasi-regular Dirichlet forms containing the diffusion, jump and killing terms. Moreover, stochastic extrinsic derivative flows on $E$ are studied by using quasi-regular Dirichlet forms, which in particular provide martingale solutions to SDEs on these two spaces, with drifts given by the extrinsic derivative of entropy functionals.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Stochastic Chemical Reaction Networks with a Hierarchy of Timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of stochastic chemical reaction networks with $n{\ge}1$ chemical species $S_1$, \ldots, $S_n$, and whose complexes are only of the form $k_iS_i$, $i{=}1$,\ldots, $n$, where $(k_i)$ are integers. The time evolution of these CRNs is driven by the kinetics of the law of mass action. A scaling analysis is done when the rates of external arrivals of chemical species are proportional to a large scaling parameter $N$. A natural hierarchy of fast processes, a subset of the coordinates of $(X_i(t))$, is determined by the values of the mapping $i{\mapsto}k_i$. We show that the scaled vector of coordinates $i$ such that $k_i{=}1$ and the scaled occupation measure of the other coordinates are converging in distribution to a deterministic limit as $N$ gets large. The proof of this result is obtained by establishing a functional equation for the limiting points of the occupation measure, by an induction on the hierarchy of timescales and with relative entropy functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a recently developed method for proving asymptotics via orthogonal polynomial duality arXiv:2305.17602, we prove that the dynamic ASEP introduced in arXiv:1701.05239 has asymptotics which are either distributed as the Tracy--Widom \(F_2,\) or are almost surely bounded. Using a different duality, we also provide contour integrals formulas for multi--species ASEP, which generalize results for the single--species ASEP.</description>

      <title>About the first eigenvector of the simple random walk killed upon exiting a large bounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a discrete version of a Dirichlet problem in an open bounded set $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, in dimension $d\geq 2$. More precisely, we consider the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$, killed upon exiting the large (bounded) domain $D_N :=(ND)\cap \mathbb{Z}^d$. We denote by $P_N$ the corresponding transition matrix and we study the properties of its ($L^2$-normalized) principal eigenvector $\phi_N$ -- one of our motivation is that the random walk ``conditioned to stay in $D_N$'' is a random walk among conductances $c_N(x,y) = \phi_N(x)\phi_N(y)$. With probabilistic arguments and under mild assumptions on the domain, we show that $\phi_N$ varies regularly, with a uniform control inside $D_N$. We derive several corollaries, among which a uniform convergence of $\phi_N$ to the first eigenfunction of the corresponding continuous Dirichlet problem. Our results may not be new, but our proofs use (simple) probabilistic ideas that could be helpful in other contexts.</description>

      <title>On the positivity of some weighted partial sums of a random multiplicative function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired in the papers by Angelo and Xu, Q.J Math., 74, pp. 767-777, and improvements by Kerr and Klurman, arXiv:2211.05540, we study the probability that the weighted sums of a Rademacher random multiplicative function, $\sum_{n\leq x}f(n)n^{-\sigma}$, are positive for all $x\geq x_\sigma\geq 1$ in the regime $\sigma\to1/2^+$. In a previous paper by the author, when $\sigma\leq 1/2$ this probability is zero. Here we give a positive lower bound for this probability depending on $x_\sigma$ that becomes large as $\sigma\to1/2^+$. The main inputs in our proofs are a maximal inequality based in relatively high moments for these partial sums combined with a Hal\'asz-Bonami's moment inequality, and also explicit estimates for the partial sums of non-negative multiplicative functions.</description>

      <title>Cartan-Schouten metrics for information geometry and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Cartan-Schouten metrics, explore invariant dual connections, and propose them as models for Information Geometry.
  Based on the underlying Riemannian barycenter and the biinvariant mean of Lie groups, we subsequently propose a new parametric mean for data science and machine learning which comes with several advantages compared to traditional tools such as the arithmetic mean, median, mode, expectation, least square method, maximum likelihood, linear regression. We call a metric on a Lie group, a Cartan-Schouten metric, if its Levi-Civita connection is biinvariant, so every 1-parameter subgroup through the unit is a geodesic.
  Except for not being left or right invariant in general, Cartan-Schouten metrics enjoy the same geometry as biinvariant metrics, since they share the same Levi-Civita connection. To bypass the non-invariance apparent drawback, we show that Cartan-Schouten metrics are completely determined by their value at the unit. We give an explicit formula for recovering them from their value at the unit, thus making them much less computationally demanding, compared to general metrics on manifolds. Furthermore, Lie groups with Cartan-Schouten metrics are complete Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. We give a complete characterization of Lie groups with Riemannian or Lorentzian Cartan-Schouten metrics. Cartan-Schouten metrics are in abundance on 2-nilpotent Lie groups. Namely, on every 2-nilpotent Lie group, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of left invariant metrics and that of Cartan-Schouten metrics.</description>

      <title>Fast convergence rates for estimating the stationary density in SDEs driven by a fractional Brownian motion with semi-contractive drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the solution of an additive fractional stochastic differential equation (SDE) and, leveraging continuous observations of the process, introduce a methodology for estimating its stationary density $\pi$. Initially, employing a tailored martingale decomposition specifically designed for the statistical challenge at hand, we establish convergence rates surpassing those found in existing literature. Subsequently, we refine the attained rate for the case where $H &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ by incorporating bounds on the density of the semi-group. This enhancement outperforms previous rates. Finally, our results weaken the usual convexity assumptions on the drift component, allowing to consider settings where strong convexity only holds outside a compact set.</description>

      <title>Filtering SPDEs with Spatio-Temporal Point Process Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the mathematical framework for filtering problems arising from biophysical applications where data is collected from confocal laser scanning microscopy recordings of the space-time evolution of intracellular wave dynamics of biophysical quantities. In these applications, signals are described by stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and observations can be modelled as functionals of marked point processes whose intensities depend on the underlying signal. We derive both the unnormalized and normalized filtering equations for these systems, demonstrate the asymptotic consistency and approximations of finite dimensional observation schemes respectively partial observations. Our theoretical results are validated through extensive simulations using synthetic and real data. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of filtering with point process observations and provide a robust framework for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Weak Distributive Laws between Monads of Continuous Valuations and of Non-Deterministic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there is weak distributive law of the Smyth hyperspace monad $\mathcal Q_{\mathsf V}$ (resp., the Hoare hyperspace monad $\mathcal H_{\mathsf V}$, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V}$ of quasi-lenses, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ of lenses) over the continuous valuation monad $\mathbf V$, as well as over the subprobability valuation monad $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ and the probability valuation monad $\mathbf V_1$, on the whole category $\mathbf{Top}$ of topological spaces (resp., on certain full subcategories such as the category of locally compact spaces or of stably compact spaces). We show that the resulting weak composite monad is the author's monad of superlinear previsions (resp., sublinear previsions, resp. forks), possibly subnormalized or normalized depending on whether we consider $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ or $\mathbf V_1$ instead of $\mathbf V$. As a special case, we obtain a weak distributive law of the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V} \cong \mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ over the monad of (sub)probability Radon measures $\mathbf R_\bullet$ on the category of stably compact spaces, which specializes further to a weak distributive laws of the Vietoris monad over $\mathbf R_\bullet$. The associated weak composite monad is the monad of (sub)normalized forks.</description>

      <title>Input estimation from discrete workload observations in a L\'evy-driven storage system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our goal is to estimate the characteristic exponent of the input to a L\'evy-driven storage system from a sample of equispaced workload observations. The estimator relies on an approximate moment equation associated with the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the workload at exponentially distributed sampling times. The estimator is pointwise consistent for any observation grid. Moreover, a high frequency sampling scheme yields asymptotically normal estimation errors for a class of input processes. A resampling scheme that uses the available information in a more efficient manner is suggested and assessed via simulation experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study the equilibrium fluctuations of an interacting particle system evolving on the discrete ring with $N\in\mathbb N$ points, denoted by $\mathbb T_N$, and with three species of particles that we name $A,B$ and $C$, but such that at each site there is only one particle. We prove that proper choices of density fluctuation fields (that match those from nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics theory) associated to the (two) conserved quantities converge, in the limit $N\to\infty$, to a system of stochastic partial differential equations, that can either be the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation or the Stochastic Burgers equation. To understand the cross interaction between the two conserved quantities, we derive a general version of the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma which is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a finite undirected graph and place an urn with balls of two colours at each vertex. At every discrete time step, for each urn, a fixed number of balls are drawn from that same urn with probability $p$, and from a randomly chosen neighbour of that urn with probability $1-p$. Based on what is drawn, the urns then reinforce themselves or their neighbours. For every ball of a given colour in the sample, in case of P\'olya-type reinforcement, a constant multiple of balls of that colour is added while in case of Friedman-type reinforcement, balls of the other colour are reinforced. These different choices for reinforcement give rise to multiple models. In this paper, we study the convergence of the fraction of balls of either colour across urns for all of these models. We show that in most cases the urns synchronize, that is, the fraction of balls of either colour in each urn converges to the same limit almost surely. A different kind of asymptotic behaviour is observed on bipartite graphs. We also prove similar results for the case of finite directed graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18973v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A homogenization problem of infinite dimensional diffusion processes indexed by ${\mathbf Z}^d$ having periodic drift coefficients is considered. By an application of the uniform ergodic theorem for infinite dimensional diffusion processes based on logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, an homogenization property of the processes starting from an almost every arbitrary point in the state space with respect to an invariant measure is proved. This result is also interpreted as solution to a homogenization problem of infinite dimensional diffusions with random coefficients, which is essentially analogous to the known ones in finite dimensions.</description>

      <title>Putting all eggs in one basket: some insights from a correlation inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give examples of situations -- stochastic production, military tactics, corporate merger -- where it is beneficial to concentrate risk rather than to diversify it, that is, to put all eggs in one basket. Our examples admit a dual interpretation: as optimal strategies of a single player (the `principal') or, alternatively, as dominant strategies in a non-cooperative game with multiple players (the `agents').
  The key mathematical result can be formulated in terms of a convolution structure on the set of increasing functions on a Boolean lattice (the lattice of subsets of a finite set). This generalizes the well-known Harris inequality from statistical physics and discrete mathematics; we give a simple self-contained proof of this result, and prove a further generalization based on the game-theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>Feller generators with singular drifts in the critical range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider diffusion operator $-\Delta + b \cdot \nabla$ in $\mathbb R^d$, $d \geq 3$, with drift $b$ in a large class of locally unbounded vector fields that can have critical-order singularities. Covering the entire range of admissible magnitudes of singularities of $b$ (but excluding the borderline value), we construct a strongly continuous Feller semigroup on the space of continuous functions vanishing at infinity, thus completing a number of results on well-posedness of SDEs with singular drifts. The previous results on Feller semigroups employed strong elliptic gradient bounds and hence required the magnitude of the singularities to be less than a small dimension-dependent constant. Our approach is different and uses De Giorgi's method ran in $L^p$ for $p$ sufficiently large, hence the gain in the assumptions on singular drift.
  For the critical borderline value of the magnitude of singularities of $b$, we construct a strongly continuous semigroup in a ``critical'' Orlicz space on $\mathbb R^d$ whose local topology is stronger than the local topology of $L^p$ for any $2 \leq p&lt;\infty$ but is slightly weaker than that of $L^\infty$.</description>

Abstract: In this report we generalize the game of Book or Band described in Levin (2024) to an arbitrary playing deck with $m$ ranks and $s$ cards in each rank, for a total of $t=ms$ cards. Two events (a band or a bump) are defined in terms of given non-negative integers $0\le l\le u \le s$, not necessarily with $l+u=s$. We derive expressions for the joint stopping time distribution and outcome band or bump in terms of rectangular event probabilities for central multiple hyper-geometric random variables.</description>

      <title>The Reverse Littlewood--Offord problem of Erd\H{o}s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\epsilon_{1},\ldots,\epsilon_{n}$ be a sequence of independent Rademacher random variables. We prove that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that for any unit vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in \mathbb{R}^2$,
  $$\Pr\left[||\epsilon_1 v_1+\ldots+\epsilon_n v_n||_2 \leq \sqrt{2}\right]\geq \frac{c}{n}.$$
  This resolves the only remaining conjecture from the seminal paper of Erd\H{o}s on the Littlewood--Offord problem, and it is sharp both in the sense that the constant $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be reduced and that the magnitude $n^{-1}$ is best possible. We also prove polynomial bounds for the analogous problem in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Handling model risk with XVAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.11834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit Burnett (2021) \&amp; Burnett and Williams (2021)'s notion of hedging valuation adjustment (HVA), originally intended to deal with dynamic hedging frictions such as transaction costs, in the direction of model risk. The corresponding HVA reconciles a global fair valuation model with the local models used by the different desks of the bank. Model risk and dynamic hedging frictions indeed deserve a reserve, but a risk-adjusted one, so not only an HVA, but also a contribution to the KVA of the bank. The orders of magnitude of the effects involved suggest that local models should not so much be managed via reserves, as excluded altogether.</description>

      <title>Towards an Optimal Contention Resolution Scheme for Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study contention resolution schemes for matchings. Given a fractional matching $x$ and a random set $R(x)$ where each edge $e$ appears independently with probability $x_e$, we want to select a matching $M \subseteq R(x)$ such that $\Pr[e \in M \mid e \in R(x)] \geq c$, for $c$ as large as possible. We call such a selection method a $c$-balanced contention resolution scheme.
  Our main results are (i) an asymptotically (in the limit as $\|x\|_\infty$ goes to 0) optimal $\simeq 0.544$-balanced contention resolution scheme for general matchings, and (ii) a $0.509$-balanced contention resolution scheme for bipartite matchings. To the best of our knowledge, this result establishes for the first time, in any natural relaxation of a combinatorial optimization problem, a separation between (i) offline and random order online contention resolution schemes, and (ii) monotone and non-monotone contention resolution schemes. We also present an application of our scheme to a combinatorial allocation problem, and discuss some open questions related to van der Waerden's conjecture for the permanent of doubly stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Weak error estimates for rough volatility models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of stochastic processes with rough stochastic volatility, examples of which include the rough Bergomi and rough Stein-Stein model, that have gained considerable importance in quantitative finance.
  A basic question for such (non-Markovian) models concerns efficient numerical schemes. While strong rates are well understood (order $H$), we tackle here the intricate question of weak rates. Our main result asserts that the weak rate, for a reasonably large class of test function, is essentially of order $\min \{ 3H+\tfrac12, 1 \}$ where $H \in (0,1/2]$ is the Hurst parameter of the fractional Brownian motion that underlies the rough volatility process.
  Interestingly, the phase transition at $H=1/6$ is related to the correlation between the two driving factors, and thus gives additional meaning to a quantity already of central importance in stochastic volatility modelling.Our results are complemented by a lower bound which show that the obtained weak rate is indeed optimal.</description>

      <title>Optimal and exact recovery on general non-uniform Hypergraph Stochastic Block Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the community detection problem in random hypergraphs under the non-uniform hypergraph stochastic block model (HSBM), where each hyperedge appears independently with some given probability depending only on the labels of its vertices. We establish, for the first time in the literature, a sharp threshold for exact recovery under this non-uniform case, subject to minor constraints; in particular, we consider the model with multiple communities. One crucial point here is that by aggregating information from all the uniform layers, we may obtain exact recovery even in cases when this may appear impossible if each layer were considered alone. Besides that, we prove a wide-ranging, information-theoretic lower bound on the number of misclassified vertices \emph{for any algorithm}, depending on a \emph{generalized Chernoff-Hellinger} divergence involving model parameters. We provide two efficient algorithms which successfully achieve exact recovery when above the threshold, and attain the lowest possible mismatch ratio when the exact recovery is impossible, proved to be optimal. The theoretical analysis of our algorithms relies on the concentration and regularization of the adjacency matrix for non-uniform random hypergraphs, which could be of independent interest. We also address some open problems regarding parameter knowledge and estimation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Diagnostics (Part I): Prevalence, Uncertainty Quantification, and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diagnostic testing provides a unique setting for studying and developing tools in classification theory. In such contexts, the concept of prevalence, i.e. the number of individuals with a given condition, is fundamental, both as an inherent quantity of interest and as a parameter that controls classification accuracy. This manuscript is the first in a two-part series that studies deeper connections between classification theory and prevalence, showing how the latter establishes a more complete theory of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for certain types of machine learning (ML). We motivate this analysis via a lemma demonstrating that general classifiers minimizing a prevalence-weighted error contain the same probabilistic information as Bayes-optimal classifiers, which depend on conditional probability densities. This leads us to study relative probability level-sets $B^\star (q)$, which are reinterpreted as both classification boundaries and useful tools for quantifying uncertainty in class labels. To realize this in practice, we also propose a numerical, homotopy algorithm that estimates the $B^\star (q)$ by minimizing a prevalence-weighted empirical error. The successes and shortcomings of this method motivate us to revisit properties of the level sets, and we deduce the corresponding classifiers obey a useful monotonicity property that stabilizes the numerics and points to important extensions to UQ of ML. Throughout, we validate our methods in the context of synthetic data and a research-use-only SARS-CoV-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay.</description>

      <title>Towards An Analytical Framework for Dynamic Potential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potential game is an emerging notion and framework for studying N-player games, especially with heterogeneous players. In this paper, we build an analytical framework for dynamic potential games. We prove that a game is a dynamic potential game if and only if each player's value function can be decomposed as a potential function and a residual term which is solely dependent on other players' policies. This decomposition is consistent with the result in the static setting and enables us to identify and analyze an important and new class of dynamic potential games called the distributed game. Moreover, we prove that a game is a dynamic potential game if the value function has a symmetric Jacobian. This generalizes the differential characterization for static potential games by replacing the classical derivative with a new notation of functional derivative with respect to Markov policies. For a general class of continuous-time stochastic games, we explicitly characterize their potential functions. In particular, we show that the potential function of linear-quadratic games can be studied through a system of linear ODEs. Furthermore, under a rank condition on control coefficients, we prove a linear-quadratic game is a Markov potential game if and only if all players have identical cost functions.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing dynamical systems as zero-noise limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dynamical system may be defined by a simple transition law - such as a map or a vector field. The objective of most learning techniques is to reconstruct this dynamic transition law. This is a major shortcoming, as most dynamic properties of interest are asymptotic properties such as an attractor or invariant measure. One of the major theoretical challenges for numerical methods is that approximating the dynamical law may not be sufficient to approximate these asymptotic properties. This article presents a method of representing a discrete-time deterministic dynamical system as the zero-noise limit of a Markov process. The Markov process approximation is completely data-driven. Besides proving a low-noise approximation of the dynamics the process also approximates the invariant set, via the support of its stationary measures. Thus invariant sets of arbitrary dynamical systems, even with complicated non-smooth topology, can be approximated by this technique. Under further assumptions, we show that the technique performs a convergent statistical approximation as well as approximations of true orbits.</description>

      <title>A strange five vertex model and multispecies ASEP on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing the stationary states of the multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process on a one-dimensional periodic lattice. Central to our approach is a quantum oscillator weighted five vertex model which features a strange weight conservation distinct from the conventional one. Our results clarify the interrelations among several known results and refine their derivations. For instance, the stationary probability derived from the multiline queue construction by Martin (2020) and Corteel--Mandelshtam--Williams (2022) is identified with the partition function of a three-dimensional system. The matrix product operators by Prolhac--Evans--Mallick (2009) acquire a natural diagrammatic interpretation as corner transfer matrices (CTM). The origin of their recursive tensor structure, as questioned by Aggarwal--Nicoletti--Petrov (2023), is revealed through the CTM diagrams. Finally, the derivation of the Zamolodchikov--Faddeev algebra by Cantini--de Gier--Wheeler (2015) is made intrinsic by elucidating its precise connection to a solution to the Yang--Baxter equation originating from quantum group representations.</description>
