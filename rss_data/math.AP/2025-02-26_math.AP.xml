      <title>Local minimizers in $3$d of vector Allen-Cahn with a quadruple junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\Omega$ a perturbation of the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$, we establish the existence of a sequence of local minimizers for the vector Allen-Cahn energy. The sequence converges in $L^1$ to a partition of $\Omega$ whose skeleton is given by a tetrahedral cone and thus contains a quadruple point. This is accomplished by proving that the partition is an isolated local minimizer of the associated $\Gamma$-limit of the sequence of Allen-Cahn functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of a fully nontrivial solution with nonnegative components for a weakly coupled competitive system for the $p$-Laplacian in $\mathbb{R}^N$ whose nonlinear terms are purely critical.
  We also show that the purely critical equation for the $p$-Laplacian in $\mathbb{R}^N$ has infinitely many nodal solutions.</description>

      <title>The H\"{o}lder regularity of div-curl system with anisotropic coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research examines the regularity of weak solutions to the Div-Curl system with low regularity anisotropic coefficients. The H\"older regularity of the Div-Curl system with one anisotropic coefficient was an unresolved problem raised by Yin in 2016. We have addressed the open problem, and the findings extend to the scenario involving two anisotropic coefficients. We establish the H\"{o}lder regularity of the solution when the coefficients is H\"{o}lder continuous. Moreover, the degree of H\"{o}lder regularity of the solution can be improved if the coefficient has a greater degree of H\"{o}lder regularity.</description>

      <title>Multi-Bubble Blow-up Analysis for an Almost Critical Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a smooth, bounded domain $\O\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\geq 4$ and a smooth positive function $V$. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of a sequence of positive solutions $u_\e$ to the equation $-\Delta u +V(x)u =u^{\frac{n+2}{n-2}-\e}$ in $\O$ with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, as $\e\to 0$. We determine the precise blow-up rate and characterize the locations of interior concentration points in the general case of multiple blow-up, providing an exhaustive description of interior blow-up phenomena of this equation. Our result is established through a delicate analysis of the gradient of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange functional.</description>

      <title>The regularity of electronic wave functions in Barron spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic Schr\"odinger equation describes the motion of $N$ electrons under Coulomb interaction forces in a field of clamped nuclei. It is proved that its solutions for eigenvalues below the essential spectrum lie in the spectral Barron spaces $\mathcal{B}^s(\mathbb{R}^{3N})$ for $s&lt;1$. The example of the hydrogen ground state shows that this result cannot be improved.</description>

We prove the global well-posedness of this equation in $E$. Moreover, we give an explicit formula for the chiral solution to this equation.</description>

      <title>Almost global existence for Hamiltonian PDEs on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an abstract result of almost global existence of small solutions to semi-linear Hamiltonian partial differential equations satisfying very weak non resonance conditions and basic multilinear estimates. Thanks to works by Delort--Szeftel, these assumptions turn out to typically hold for Hamiltonian PDEs on any smooth compact boundaryless Riemannian manifold. As a main application, we prove the almost global existence of small solutions to nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations on such manifolds: for almost all mass, any arbitrarily large $r$ and sufficiently large $s$, solutions with initial data of sufficiently small size $\varepsilon \ll 1$ in the Sobolev space $H^s \times H^{s-1}$ exist and remain in $H^s \times H^{s-1}$ for polynomial times $|t| \leq \varepsilon^{-r}$. This is the first result of almost global existence without specific assumptions on the compact manifold.  We also apply this abstract result to nonlinear Schr\''odinger equations close to ground states and nonlinear Klein--Gordon equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with positive quadratic potentials.</description>

      <title>Existence and Stability of Ground States for the Defocusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation on Quantum Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and stability of ground states for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on non-compact metric graphs. We establish a sharp criterion for the existence of action ground states, linking it to the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian operator. In particular, we show that ground states exist if and only if the bottom of the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is negative and the frequency lies in a suitable range. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between action and energy ground states, proving that while every action minimizer is an energy minimizer, the converse may not hold and the energy minimizer may not exist for all masses. To illustrate this phenomenon, we analyze explicit solutions on star graphs with $\delta$ and $\delta'$-couplings, showing that for mass subcritical exponents of the nonlinearity, there exists a large interval of masses for which no energy ground state exists while in the opposite case, they exist for all masses.</description>

Abstract: We derive the stability result of the dual curvature measure with near constant density in the even case. As an application, the uniqueness and existence of solutions to the even dual Minkowski problem in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ are obtained for $n\geq 1$, provided the density of the measure is close to 1 in $C^{\alpha}$ norm with $\alpha\in (0,1)$.</description>

      <title>A Note on Moving Frames along Sobolev Maps and the Regularity of Weakly Harmonic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is twofold. First we show that, for weakly differentiable maps between Riemannian manifolds of any dimension, a smallness condition on a Morrey-norm of the gradient is sufficient to guarantee that the pulled-back tangent bundle is trivialised by a finite-energy frame over simply connected regions in the domain. This is achieved via new structure equations for a connection introduced by Rivi\`ere in the study of weakly harmonic maps, combined with Coulomb-frame methods and the Hardy-BMO duality of Fefferman-Stein. We also prove that for weakly harmonic maps from domains of any dimension into closed homogeneous targets, a smallness condition on the BMO seminorm of the map is sufficient to obtain full regularity.</description>

Abstract: In this article we study the non-linear Neumann spectral problem in outward cuspidal domains. By using composition operators we prove embedding of Sobolev spaces into weighted Lebesgue spaces. As a consequence, we obtain solvability of the Neumann spectral problem and estimates of Neumann weighted eigenvalues in outward cuspidal domains.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local existence of solutions to the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system describing the motion of a compressible, viscous, electrically and heat conducting fluid in the $L^p-L^q$ class with inhomogeneous boundary conditions. The open system is allowed to receive incoming matter from the outside through (part of) the boundary which we refer to as an inflow boundary. This setup brings about a difficulty in estimating the regularity of the density $\varrho$ which we remedy by assuming appropriate hypotheses on the velocity field, domain boundary and on the boundary and initial data of $\varrho$. The main result ensures the local well-posedness of the full MHD system which is shown through a linearization combined with a Banach fixed-point theorem.</description>

      <title>An improved upper bound for the Froude number of irrotational solitary water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical and central problem in the theory of water waves is to classify parameter regimes for which nontrivial solitary waves exist. In the two-dimensional, irrotational, pure gravity case, the Froude number $Fr$ (a non-dimensional wave speed) plays the central role. So far, the best analytic result $Fr &lt; \sqrt{2}$ was obtained by Starr (1947), while the numerical evidence of Longuet-Higgins &amp; Fenton (1974) states $Fr \le 1.294$. On the other hand, as shown recently by Kozlov (2023), the upper bound $Fr &lt; 1.399$ is related to the existence of subharmonic bifurcations of Stokes waves. In this paper, we develop a new strategy utilizing the flow force function and rigorously establish the improved upper bound $Fr &lt; 1.37838$.</description>

      <title>Stable and Minimizing Cones in the Alt-Phillips Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study homogeneous solutions to the Alt-Phillips problem when the exponent $\gamma$ is close to 1.
  In dimension $d\ge3$, we show that the radial cone is minimizing when $\gamma$ is close to 1.
  In dimension $d \ge 4$, we construct an axially symmetric cone whose contact set has with positive density. We show that it is a global minimizer. It is analogous to the De Silva-Jerison \cite{DJ} cone for the Alt-Caffarelli functional which corresponds to exponent $\gamma=0$. The cone we construct bifurcates from another minimizing cone whose contact set has zero density, obtained as the trivial extension of the radial solution. This second cone is analogous to a quadratic polynomial solution in the classical obstacle problem which corresponds to exponent $\gamma=1$. In particular our results show that, when $\gamma&lt;1$ is sufficiently close to 1, there are axis symmetric cones that exhibit the properties of both end point cases $\gamma=0$ and $\gamma=1$.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions to lower critical Choquard equation in mass-supercritical setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the normalized solutions to the following Choquard equation
  \begin{equation*}
  \aligned &amp;-\Delta u + \lambda u =\mu g(u) + \gamma (I_\alpha * |u|^{\frac{N+\alpha}{N}})|u|^{\frac{N+\alpha}{N}-2}u &amp; \text{in\ \ } \mathbb{R}^N \endaligned
  \end{equation*} under the $L^2$-norm constraint $\|u\|_2=c$. Here $\gamma&gt;0$, $ N\geq 1$, $\alpha\in(0,N)$, $I_{\alpha}$ is the Riesz potential, and the unknown $\lambda$ appears as a Lagrange multiplier. In a mass supercritical setting on $g$, we find regions in the $(c,\mu)$--parameter space such that the corresponding equation admits a positive radial ground state solution. To overcome the lack of compactness resulting from the nonlocal term, we present a novel compactness lemma and some prior energy estimate. These results are even new for the power type nonlinearity $g(u)= |u|^{q-2}u$ with $2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;q&lt;2^*$ ($2^*:=\frac{2N}{N-2}$, if $N\geq 3$ and $2^* = \infty$, if $N=1, 2$). We also show that as $\mu$ or $c$ tends to $0$ (resp. $\mu$ or $c$ tends to $+\infty$), after a suitable rescaling the ground state solutions converge in $H^1(\RN)$ to a particular solution of the limit equations. Further, we study the non-existence and multiplicity of positive radial solutions to \begin{equation*}
  -\Delta u + u = \eta |u|^{q-2}u + (I_\alpha * |u|^{\frac{N+\alpha}{N}})|u|^{\frac{N+\alpha}{N}-2}u, \quad \text{in}\ \ \RN \end{equation*} where $N \geq 1$, $ 2&lt; q&lt;2^*$ and $\eta&gt;0$. Based on some analytical ideas the limit behaviors of the normalized solutions, we verify some threshold regions of $\eta$ such that the corresponding equation has no positive least action solution or admits multiple positive solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this seems to be the first result concerning the non-existence and multiplicity of positive solutions to Choquard type equations involving the lower critical exponent.</description>

      <title>Existence of Viscosity Solutions to Abstract Cauchy Problems via Nonlinear Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide conditions for nonlinear monotone semigroups on locally convex vector lattices to give rise to a generalized notion of viscosity solutions to a related nonlinear partial differential equation. The semigroup needs to satisfy a convexity estimate, so called $K$-convexity, w.r.t. another family of operators, defined on a potentially larger locally convex vector lattice. We then show that, under mild continuity requirements on the bounding family of operators, the semigroup yields viscosity solutions to the abstract Cauchy problem given in terms of its generator in the larger locally convex vector lattice. We apply our results to drift control problems for infinite-dimensional L\'evy processes and robust optimal control problems for infinite-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.</description>

      <title>A new framework for Ljusternik-Schnirelmann theory and its application to planar Choquard equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the planar logarithmic Choquard equation
  $$
  - \Delta u + a(x)u + (\log|\cdot| \ast u^2)u = 0,\qquad \text{in } \mathbb{R}^2
  $$ in the strongly indefinite and possibly degenerate setting where no sign condition is imposed on the linear potential $a \in L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^2)$. In particular, we shall prove the existence of a sequence of high energy solutions to this problem in the case where $a$ is invariant under $\mathbb{Z}^2$-translations.
  The result extends to a more general $G$-equivariant setting, for which we develop a new variational approach which allows us to find critical points of Ljusternik-Schnirelmann type. In particular, our method resolves the problem that the energy functional $\Phi$ associated with the logarithmic Choquard equation is only defined on a subspace $X \subset H^1(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with the property that $\|\cdot\|_X$ is not translation invariant. The new approach is based on a new $G$-equivariant version of the Cerami condition and on deformation arguments adapted to a family of suitably constructed scalar products $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_u$, $u \in X$ with the $G$-equivariance property $\langle g \ast v , g \ast w \rangle_{g \ast u} = \langle v , w \rangle_u.$</description>

      <title>Sufficient Conditions for the Energy Balance for the Stochastic Incompressible Euler Equations with Additive Noise in two Space Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider vanishing viscosity approximations to solutions of the stochastic incompressible Euler equations in two space dimensions with additive noise. We identify sufficient and necessary conditions under which martingale solutions of the stochastic Euler equations satisfy an exact energy balance in mean. We find that the tightness of the laws of the approximating sequence of solutions of the stochastic Navier-Stokes equations in $L^2([0,T]\times D)$ is equivalent to the limiting martingale solution satisfying an energy balance in mean. Numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic branching algorithms provide a useful alternative to grid-based schemes for the numerical solution of partial differential equations, particularly in high-dimensional settings. However, they require a strict control of the integrability of random functionals of branching processes in order to ensure the non-explosion of solutions. In this paper, we study the stability of a functional branching representation of PDE solutions by deriving sufficient criteria for the integrability of the multiplicative weighted progeny of stochastic branching processes. We also prove the uniqueness of mild solutions under uniform integrability assumptions on random functionals.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on finding an approximate solution of a kind of Fokker-Planck equation with time-dependent perturbations. A formulation of the approximate solution of the equation is constructed, and then the existence of the formulation is proved. The related Hamiltonian dynamical system explains the estimations. Our work provides a more comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of systems described by this Fokker-Planck equation and the corresponding stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <title>A microlocal pathway to spectral asymmetry: curl and the eta invariant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of eta invariant is traditionally defined by means of analytic continuation. We prove, by examining the particular case of the operator curl, that the eta invariant can equivalently be obtained as the trace of the difference of positive and negative spectral projections, appropriately regularised. Our construction is direct, in the sense that it does not involve analytic continuation, and is based on the use of pseudodifferential techniques. This provides a novel approach to the study of spectral asymmetry of non-semibounded (pseudo)differential systems on manifolds which encompasses and extends previous results.</description>

Abstract: In this work we consider the Cauchy problem for the cubic Schr\"odinger equation posed on cylinder $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{T}$ with fractional derivatives $(-\partial_y^2)^{\alpha},\, \alpha &gt;0$, in the periodic direction. The spatial operator includes elliptic and hyperbolic regimes. We prove $L^2$ global well-posedness results when $\alpha &gt; 1$ by proving a $L^4 - L^2$ Strichartz inequality for the linear equation, following the ideas developep by H. Takaoka and N. Tzvetkov in the the case of the Laplacian operator. Further, these results remain valid on the euclidean environment $\mathbb{R}^2$, so well-posedness in $L^2$ are also achieved in this case. Our proof in the elliptic (hyperbolic) case does not work in the case $0&lt;\alpha &lt;1$ ($0&lt;\alpha \leq 1$), respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a normalized solution $u=(u_1,\ldots,u_K)$ to the system of $K$ coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations \begin{equation*}
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  -\Delta u_i+ \lambda_i u_i = \sum_{j=1}^K\beta_{i,j}u_i|u_i|^{p/2-2}|u_j|^{p/2} \quad \mathrm{in} \, \mathbb{R}^3,\newline
  u_i \in H^1_{rad}(\mathbb{R}^3),\newline
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} |u_i|^2 \, dx = \rho_i^2 \quad \text{for }i=1,\ldots, K,
  \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $\rho=(\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_K)\in(0,\infty)^K$ is prescribed, $(\lambda,u) \in \mathbb{R}^K\times H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)^K$ are the unknown and $4\leq p&lt;6$. In the case of two equations we show the existence of multiple solutions provided that the coupling is sufficiently large. We also show that for negative coupling there are no ground state solutions. The main novelty in our approach is that we use the Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum theorem in order to estimate the Morse index of a solution as well as a Liouville-type result in an exterior domain.</description>

      <title>Perron solutions and boundary regularity for nonlocal nonlinear Dirichlet problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For nonlinear operators of fractional $p$-Laplace type, we consider two types of solutions to the nonlocal Dirichlet problem: Sobolev solutions based on fractional Sobolev spaces and Perron solutions based on superharmonic functions. These solutions give rise to two different concepts of regularity for boundary points, namely Sobolev and Perron regularity. We show that these two notions are equivalent and we also provide several characterizations of regular boundary points. Along the way, we give a new definition of Perron solutions, which is applicable to arbitrary exterior Dirichlet data $g: \Omega^c \to [-\infty,\infty]$. We obtain resolutivity results for these Perron solutions, and show that the Sobolev and Perron solutions coincide for a large class of exterior Dirichlet data. This also implies invariance of the Perron solutions under perturbations on sets of zero fractional capacity. A uniqueness result for the Dirichlet problem is also obtained for the class of bounded solutions taking prescribed continuous exterior data quasieverywhere on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Interaction between initial behavior of temperature and the mean curvature of the interface in two-phase heat conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the heat diffusion equation in the whole Euclidean space consisting of two media locally with different constant conductivities, where initially one medium has temperature 0 and the other has temperature 1. Under the assumption that a part of the interface between two media with different constant conductivities is of class $C^2$ in a neighborhood of a point $x$ on it, we extract the mean curvature of the interface at $x$ from the initial behavior of temperature at $x$. This result is purely local in space. As a corollary, when the whole Euclidean space consists of two media globally with different constant conductivities, it is shown that if a connected component $\Gamma$ of the interface is of class $C^2$ and is stationary isothermic, then the mean curvature of $\Gamma$ must be constant. Moreover, we apply this result to some overdetermined problems for two-phase heat conductors and obtain some symmetry theorems which relax considerably the regularity assumptions of some previous results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we control the growth of the support of particular solutions to the Euler two-dimensional equations, whose vorticity is concentrated near special vortex crystals. These vortex crystals belong to the classical family of regular polygons with a central vortex, where we choose a particular intensity for the central vortex to have strong stability properties. A special case is the regular pentagon with no central vortex which also satisfies the stability properties required for the long-time confinement to work.</description>

      <title>Quantitative bounds for bounded solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in endpoint critical Besov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantitative regularity and blowup criteria for classical solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a critical Besov space framework. Specifically, we consider solutions $u\in L^\infty_t(\dot{B}_{p,\infty}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}})$ such that $|D|^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}|u|\in L^\infty_t (L^p)$ with $3&lt;p&lt;\infty$. By deriving refined regularity estimates and substantially improving the strategy in \cite{Tao_20}, we overcome difficulties stemming from the low regularity of the Besov spaces and establish quantitative bounds for such solutions. These bounds are expressed in terms of a triple exponential of $\| u (t)\|_{\dot{B}_{p,\infty}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}}$ combined with a single exponential of $\bigl\| |D|^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}|u(t)| \bigr\|_{L^p}$. Consequently, we obtain a new blowup rate which can be interpreted as a coupling of triple logarithm of $\| u(t) \|_{\dot{B}_{p,\infty}^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}}$ and a single logarithm of $\bigl\| |D|^{-1+\frac{3}{p}}|u(t)| \bigr\|_{L^p}$.</description>

Abstract: We construct non-negative weak solutions of fast diffusion equations with a divergence type of drift term satisfying the $L^q$-energy inequality and speed estimate in Wasserstein spaces under some integrability conditions on the drift term. Furthermore, in the case that the drift term has a divergence-free structure, it turns out that its integrability conditions can be relaxed, which is also applicable to porous medium equations, thereby improving previous results. As an application, the existence of weak solutions is also discussed for a viscous Boussinesq system of the fast diffusion type.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06232v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and investigate $(1, p)$-Sobolev space, $p$-energy, and the corresponding $p$-energy measures on the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet for all $p \in (1, \infty)$. Our method is based on the idea of Kusuoka and Zhou [Probab. Theory Related Fields $\textbf{93}$ (1992), no. 2, 169--196], where Brownian motion (the case $p = 2$) on self-similar sets including the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet were constructed. Similar to this earlier work, we use a sequence of discrete graph approximations and the corresponding discrete $p$-energies to define the Sobolev space and $p$-energies. However, we need a new approach to ensure that our $(1, p)$-Sobolev space has a dense set of continuous functions when $p$ is less than the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension. The new ingredients are the use of Loewner type estimates on combinatorial modulus to obtain Poincar\'e inequality and elliptic Harnack inequality on a sequence of approximating graphs. An important feature of our Sobolev space is the self-similarity of our $p$-energy, which allows us to define corresponding $p$-energy measures on the planar Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet. We show that our Sobolev space can also be viewed as a Korevaar-Schoen type space. We apply our results to the attainment problem for Ahlfors regular conformal dimension of the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet. In particular, we show that if the Ahlfors regular conformal dimension, say $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$, is attained, then any optimal measure which attains $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$ should be comparable with the $\dim_{\mathrm{ARC}}$-energy measure of some function in our $(1, \dim_{\mathrm{ARC}})$-Sobolev space up to a multiplicative constant. In this case, we also prove that the Newton-Sobolev space corresponding to any optimal measure and metric can be identified as our self-similar $(1, \dim_{\mathrm{ARC}})$-Sobolev space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the solution of monotone inverse problems using the particular example of a parameter identification problem for a semilinear parabolic PDE. For the regularized solution of this problem, we introduce a total variation based regularization method requiring the solution of a monotone inclusion problem. We show well-posedness in the sense of inverse problems of the resulting regularization scheme. In addition, we introduce and analyze a numerical algorithm for the solution of this inclusion problem using a nested inertial primal dual method. We demonstrate by means of numerical examples the convergence of both the numerical algorithm and the regularization method.</description>
