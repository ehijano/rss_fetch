      <title>Solving deep-learning density functional theory via variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning models, chiefly deep neural networks, have revealed suited to learn accurate energy-density functionals from data. However, problematic instabilities have been shown to occur in the search of ground-state density profiles via energy minimization. Indeed, any small noise can lead astray from realistic profiles, causing the failure of the learned functional and, hence, strong violations of the variational property. In this article, we employ variational autoencoders to build a compressed, flexible, and regular representation of the ground-state density profiles of various quantum models. Performing energy minimization in this compressed space allows us to avoid both numerical instabilities and variational biases due to excessive constraints. Our tests are performed on one-dimensional single-particle models from the literature in the field and, notably, on a three-dimensional disordered potential. In all cases, the ground-state energies are estimated with errors below the chemical accuracy and the density profiles are accurately reproduced without numerical artifacts.</description>

      <title>Subharmonic lock-in detection and its optimisation for femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although often viewed as detrimental, fluctuations carry valuable information about the physical system from which they emerge. Femtosecond noise correlation spectroscopy (FemNoC) has recently been established to probe the ultrafast fluctuation dynamics of thermally populated magnons by measurement of their amplitude autocorrelation. Subharmonic lock-in detection is the key technique in this method, allowing to extract the pulse-to-pulse polarisation fluctuations of two femtosecond optical pulse trains transmitted through a magnetic sample. Here, we present a thorough technical description of the subharmonic demodulation technique and of the FemNoC measurement system. We mathematically model the data acquisition process and identify the essential parameters which critically influence the signal-to-noise ratio of the signals. Comparing the model calculations to real datasets allows validating the predicted parameter dependences and provides a means to optimise FemNoC experiments.</description>

      <title>Markovian and non-Markovian master equations versus an exactly solvable model of a qubit in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of open quantum systems, but their accuracy is rarely compared with the analytical solution of exactly solvable models. In this work, we perform such a comparison for the damped Jaynes-Cummings model of a qubit in a leaky cavity, for which an analytical solution is available in the one-excitation subspace. We consider the non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation up to the second (Redfield) and fourth orders as well as three types of Markovian master equations: the coarse-grained, cumulant, and standard rotating-wave approximation (RWA) Lindblad equations. We compare the exact solution to these master equations for three different spectral densities: impulse, Ohmic, and triangular. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained master equation outperforms the standard RWA-based Lindblad master equation for weak coupling or high qubit frequency (relative to the spectral density high-frequency cutoff $\omega_c$), where the Markovian approximation is valid. In the presence of non-Markovian effects characterized by oscillatory, non-decaying behavior, the TCL approximation closely matches the exact solution for short evolution times (in units of $\omega_c^{-1}$) even outside the regime of validity of the Markovian approximations. For long evolution times, all master equations perform poorly, as quantified in terms of the trace-norm distance from the exact solution. The fourth-order time-convolutionless master equation achieves the top performance in all cases. Our results highlight the need for reliable approximation methods to describe open-system quantum dynamics beyond the short-time limit.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Lieb superlattices: from the discrete to the continuum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lieb lattice is one of the simplest lattices that exhibits both linear Dirac-like and flat topological electronic bands. We propose to further tailor its electronic properties through periodic 1D electrostatic superlattices (SLs), which, in the long wavelength limit, were predicted to give rise to novel transport signatures, such as the omnidirectional super-Klein tunnelling (SKT). By numerically modelling the electronic structure at tight-binding level, we uncover the evolution of the Lieb SL band structure from the discrete all the way to the continuum regime and build a comprehensive picture of the Lieb lattice under 1D potentials. This approach allows us to also take into consideration the discrete lattice symmetry-breaking that occurs at the well/barrier interfaces created by the 1D SL, whose consequences cannot be explored using the previous low energy and long wavelength approaches. We find novel features in the band structure, among which are intersections of quadratic and flat bands, tilted Dirac cones, or series of additional anisotropic Dirac cones at energies where the SKT is predicted. Such features are relevant to experimental realizations of electronic transport in Lieb 1D SL realized in artificial lattices or in real material systems like 2D covalent organic/metal-organic frameworks and inorganic 2D solids.</description>

      <title>Quantum Synchronization in Nonconservative Electrical Circuits with Kirchhoff-Heisenberg Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum synchronization phenomena in electrical circuits that incorporate specifically designed nonconservative elements. A dissipative theory of classical and quantized electrical circuits is developed based on the Rayleigh dissipation function. The introduction of this framework enables the formulation of a generalized version of classical Poisson brackets, which are termed Poisson-Rayleigh brackets. By using these brackets, we are able to derive the equations of motion for a given circuit. Remarkably, these equations are found to correspond to Kirchhoff's current laws when Kirchhoff's voltage laws are employed to impose topological constraints, and vice versa. In the quantum setting, the equations of motion are referred to as the Kirchhoff-Heisenberg equations, as they represent Kirchhoff's laws within the Heisenberg picture. These Kirchhoff-Heisenberg equations, serving as the native equations for an electrical circuit, can be used in place of the more abstract master equations in Lindblad form. To validate our theoretical framework, we examine three distinct circuits. The first circuit consists of two resonators coupled via a nonconservative element. The second circuit extends the first to incorporate weakly nonlinear resonators, such as transmons. Lastly, we investigate a circuit involving two resonators connected through an inductor in series with a resistor. This last circuit, which incidentally represents a realistic implementation, allows for the study of a singular system, where the absence of a coordinate leads to an ill-defined system of Hamilton's equations. To analyze such a pathological circuit, we introduce the concept of auxiliary circuit element. After resolving the singularity, we demonstrate that this element can be effectively eliminated at the conclusion of the analysis, recuperating the original circuit.</description>

      <title>Retardation Effects in Atom-Wall Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The onset of retardation effects in atom-wall interactions is studied. It is shown that the transition range from the 1/z^3 short-range (van der Waals) interaction to the 1/z^4 long-range (Casimir) retarded interaction critically depends on the atomic properties and on the dielectric function of the material. For simple non-alkali atoms (e.g., ground-state hydrogen and ground-state helium) interacting with typical dielectric materials such as intrinsic silicon, the transition to the retarded regime is shown to proceed at a distance of about 10 nm (200 Bohr radii). This is much shorter than typical characteristic absorption wavelengths of solids. Larger transition regimes are obtained for atoms with a large static polarizability such as metastable helium. We present a simple estimate for the critical distance, z_cr=137*(\alpha(0)/Z)^(1/2) atomic units, where alpha(0) is the static polarizability (expressed in atomic units) and Z is the number of electrons of the atom.</description>

      <title>Challenges of variational quantum optimization with measurement shot noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum enhanced optimization of classical cost functions is a central theme of quantum computing due to its high potential value in science and technology. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) are popular variational approaches that are considered the most viable solutions in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. Here, we study the scaling of the quantum resources, defined as the required number of circuit repetitions, to reach a fixed success probability as the problem size increases, focusing on the role played by measurement shot noise, which is unavoidable in realistic implementations. Simple and reproducible problem instances are addressed, namely, the ferromagnetic and disordered Ising chains. Our results show that: (i) VQE with the standard heuristic ansatz scales comparably to direct brute-force search when energy-based optimizers are employed. The performance improves at most quadratically using a gradient-based optimizer. (ii) When the parameters are optimized from random guesses, also the scaling of QAOA implies problematically long absolute runtimes for large problem sizes. (iii) QAOA becomes practical when supplemented with a physically-inspired initialization of the parameters. Our results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical algorithms should possibly avoid a brute force classical outer loop, but focus on smart parameters initialization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Simulation of a Mixed Spin-Boson Hamiltonian and Its Performance for a Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to broaden the spectrum of possible applications of quantum computers and use their capabilities to investigate effects in cavity quantum electrodynamics ("cavity QED"). Interesting application examples are material properties, multiphoton effects such as superradiance, systems with strong field-matter coupling, and others. For QED applications, experimental studies are challenging, and classical simulations are often expensive. Therefore, exploring the capabilities of quantum computers is of interest. Below we present a methodology for simulating a phase transition in a pair of coupled cavities that permit photon hopping. We map the spin and boson systems to separate parts of the register and use first-order Trotterization to time-propagate the wavefunction. The order parameter, which is the observable for the phase transition, is calculated by measuring the number operator and its square. We introduce a boson-to-qubit mapping to facilitate a multi-photon, multi-atom case study. Our mapping scheme is based on the inverse Holstein-Primakoff transformation. In the multi-photon regime, boson operators are expressed via higher-spin operators which are subsequently mapped on a circuit using Pauli operators. We use a Newton series expansion to enable rigorous treatment of the square root operator. We reproduce the results of classical simulations of a phase transition with a noiseless 6-qubit simulation. We find that the simulation can be performed with a modest amount of quantum resources. Finally, we perform simulations on noisy emulators and find that mitigation techniques are essential to distinguish signal from noise.</description>
