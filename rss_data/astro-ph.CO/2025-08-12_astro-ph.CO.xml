      <title>From Theory to Forecast: Neutrino Mass Effects on Mode-Coupling Kernels and Their Observational Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical expression that gives both the matter and tracer (halo or galaxy) power spectrum with 1-loop corrections that include the neutrino effects on the mode coupling kernels. We use the FFTLog algorithm to accelerate calculating the higher-order corrections to the power spectrum. We then use our power spectrum and bispectrum models to pursue two main goals. First, we examine the impact of neutrino mass on cosmological parameter estimation from both the power spectrum and bispectrum in real space. We create 1-loop power spectrum and bispectrum templates in real-space and fit to the \texttt{Quijote} simulation suite, including the cross-covariance between the power spectrum and the bispectrum. We show the neutrino signature kernels estimate the same cosmological parameters as the model with the SPT (Standard Perturbation Theory) kernels, even for DESI Year 5 volume, except for the galaxy bias parameters inferred from the bispectrum. Second, we investigate to what extent the bispectrum can improve parameter constraints. We perform a Fisher forecast using the power spectrum, the tree-level bispectrum, and a joint analysis that includes the cross-covariance between them. We show that including the bispectrum can substantially reduce the error bars on key parameters. For the neutrino mass in particular, the uncertainty is reduced by $\sim 20\%$</description>

      <title>Power Spectrum, Bispectrum, 2- and 3-Point Correlation Function, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: N-Point Correlation Functions, usually with N = 2, 3, and their Fourier-space analogs power spectrum and bispectrum, are major tools used in cosmology to capture the clustering of large-scale structure. We outline how the clustering these functions capture emerges, explain that inflation produces a 2PCF or power spectrum but that subsequent evolution eventually produces a 3PCF or bispectrum, and beyond (and that inflation may do so as well at some level). Furthermore, in principle the Universe also has a 4PCF or trispectrum, and even clustering beyond. For each of these tools, we discuss the motivation, the practical details of how they are estimated, the current algorithms used to compute them, the theory behind them, and recent applications to data. Throughout, we focus on positioning the reader to find and apply these algorithms with some understanding, linking to public code for each algorithm to the fullest extent possible.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves in Parity-violating Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the inflationary phenomenology of parity-violating (PV) extensions of symmetric teleparallel gravity by applying this PV gravity theory to axion inflation. The presence of PV terms induces velocity birefringence in the tensor perturbations. During inflation, when the inflaton rapidly traverses the cliff-like region in its potential, the tensor modes at specific scales for one of the two circular polarization states undergo significant amplification due to tachyonic instability. Consequently, the resulting primordial gravitational waves (GWs), characterized by a one-handed polarization and a multi-peak structure in their energy spectrum, exhibit a significant amplitude potentially detectable by LISA and Taiji, and their chirality could be determined by the LISA-Taiji network. The detection of such a chiral GW signal provides an opportunity to probe inflation and PV gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Testing the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation with Neural Kernel Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we test the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) by combining Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) data and DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements. To resolve the redshift mismatch between the two datasets, we develop a new method called Neural Kernel Gaussian Process Regression (NKGPR), which uses two neural networks to simultaneously learn the mean and kernel functions of a Gaussian process. This approach improves upon traditional Gaussian process regression by mitigating trend mismatches and removing the need for manual kernel selection. We investigate possible deviations from the CDDR by adopting three parameterizations of the deviation function and constrain the model-independent parameter $\eta_0$ through a marginalized likelihood analysis. Our results show no significant departure from the expected relation, confirming the consistency of the CDDR within current observational uncertainties.</description>

      <title>The 4MOST-Cosmology Redshift Survey: Target Selection of Bright Galaxies and Luminous Red Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmology Redshift Survey of the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST-CRS) will provide redshift measurements of galaxies and quasars over 5700{\degsq} in the southern hemisphere. As targets for the 4MOST-CRS, we present a selection of an $r&lt;19.25$ magnitude limited sample of Bright Galaxies (BG) and a colour selected sample of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG) based on DESI Legacy Survey DR10.1 photometric data, in the redshift ranges $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.5$ and $0.4&lt;z&lt;1$, respectively. These samples are selected using the $g$, $r$, $z$, and $W1$ (from unWISE) photometric bands. For BGs, the star--galaxy separation is performed based on Gaia and Tycho-2 star catalogues. Following 4MOST requirements, the target densities of BGs and LRGs are 250{\mdegsq} and 400{\mdegsq}, respectively. We quantified the stellar contamination to be $&lt;2-4\%$ for both galaxy samples using data from the first DESI data release. Using angular clustering, we show that both samples are robust against imaging systematics, confirming a low stellar contamination. Finally, we provide forecasts of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) and growth of structure ($\sigma_8$) measurements from the 4MOST-CRS alone and in combination with DESI. From the 4MOST-CRS, we expect 3\% and 25\% precision on BAO and $\sigma_8$ measurements, respectively. Combining 4MOST-CRS with DESI improves the constraints from DESI alone by 12$\%$ in the 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8 redshift range, leading to the most stringent constraints on BAO measurements from spectroscopic galaxy clustering.</description>

      <title>Signature of polarized ultralight vector dark matter in pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate observational signatures of ultralight vector dark matter with masses $m \sim 10^{-24}$-$10^{-22}$ eV in pulsar timing arrays, taking into account general polarization states of the vector field. We find that vector dark matter induces pulsar timing residuals with nontrivial directional dependence, reflecting the anisotropic property and polarization structure specific to vector dark matter, unlike scalar dark matter. We also derive angular correlation curves of the timing residuals. Intriguingly, circular polarization of the vector dark matter enhances the quadrupole nature of the correlation curve, resulting in a more notable bending of the Hellings-Downs curve. The derived correlation curves offer a useful means to distinguish gravitational wave and dark matter contributions and to probe the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Rescattering of non-minimal coupling scalar particles during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the rescattering effects arising from non-minimally coupled scalar particles $\chi$ that are suddenly produced during inflation. The coupling term $\xi R \chi^2$ significantly enhances resonant particle production compared to minimal coupling scenarios. Consequently, the produced $\chi$ particles rescattering off the homogeneous inflaton condensate $\phi$, generating abundant $\delta\phi$ quanta within very short time intervals. This process leads to characteristic enhancements in the power spectrum of primordial curvature perturbations at scales corresponding to the moments of particle production. When this occurs at small scales, the power spectrum amplitude can reach as high as $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$. Furthermore, analysis of the equilateral bispectrum shows that this mechanism also induces substantial non-Gaussian features.</description>

      <title>Preheating and gravitational waves in large-field hilltop inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combined Planck, BICEP/Keck Array and BAO measurements of the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio from the cosmic microwave background observations severely constrain or completely rule out several models of inflationary potentials. On the other hand, the data seems to favor concave potentials over convex ones. In this paper, we study preheating and gravitational waves after inflation in a large-field, regularized hilltop potential where inflation takes place in the concave plateau. The inflaton, $\phi$, is coupled to a subdominant scalar field, $\chi$, through a quartic coupling. After inflation ends, $\phi$ oscillates about the potential minimum and becomes inhomogeneous. The growth of the fluctuation modes, $\delta\phi_k$ and $\delta\chi_k$, in a homogeneous, oscillating background is analyzed in linear perturbation theory, revealing that small modes likely experience broad self-resonance or external parametric resonance. To determine if the resonances are sufficiently strong to cause unstable growth of the modes we perform a lattice simulation. The lattice simulations demonstrate that, although the initial inhomogeneities generate a stochastic gravitational wave background that remains below the present observational limit, the fluctuations do not grow exponentially, and the occupation numbers of $\delta\phi_k$ and $\delta\chi_k$ remain close to zero.</description>

      <title>The Filament Rift: $\Lambda$CDM's Structural Challenge Against Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the first extended comparison of cosmic filaments identified in SDSS DR10 observations ($z &lt; 0.05$) and the IllustrisTNG300-1 $\Lambda$CDM simulation ($z = 0$), utilizing the novel GrAviPaSt filament-finder method. The analyses are performed on both macro- and micro-filaments, each characterized by their length, thickness, and contrast in mass density. In addition to total sample comparisons, two subcategories of micro-filaments, GG (linking galaxy groups) and CC (linking galaxy clusters), are introduced to further analyze discrepancies between the $\Lambda$CDM model and observation. While $\Lambda$CDM produces extended macro-filaments, such structures are largely absent in SDSS, and where present, they exhibit higher densities than their simulated counterparts. Micro-filaments also show notable density discrepancies: at fixed length and thickness, observational filaments are significantly denser than those in the simulation. Employing radial density profiles reveal that micro-filaments in the $\Lambda$CDM simulation exhibit higher contrasts in mass density relative to the background compared to their observational counterparts. Notably, CC type micro-filaments displayed enhanced density contrasts over GG types in the simulation, while observational data showed the opposite trend. Furthermore, SDSS galaxies in both GG and CC micro-filaments exhibit lower specific star formation rates (sSFR) and older stellar populations, while TNG300-1 micro-filaments host more actively star-forming galaxies within the intermediate stellar mass range. These results reveal persistent discrepancies between observational data and the $\Lambda$CDM reconstruction of cosmic filaments, pointing to possible tensions in our current understanding of large-scale structures and their environmental effects on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Abundance and Phase-Space Distribution of Subhalos in Cosmological N-body Simulations: Testing Numerical Convergence and Correction Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subhalos play a crucial role in accurately modeling galaxy formation and galaxy-based cosmological probes within the highly nonlinear, virialized regime. However, numerical convergence of subhalo evolution is difficult to achieve, especially in the inner regions of host halos where tidal forces are strongest. I investigate the numerical convergence and correction methods for the abundance, spatial, and velocity distributions of subhalos using two $6144^3$-particle cosmological N-body simulations with different mass resolutions -- Jiutian-300 ($1.0 \times 10^{7}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) and Jiutian-1G ($3.7 \times 10^{8}\,h^{-1}M_{\odot}$) -- with subhalos identified by HBT+. My study shows that the Surviving subhalo Peak Mass Function (SPMF) converges only for subhalos with $m_{\mathrm{peak}}$ above $5000$ particles but can be accurately recovered by including orphan subhalos that survive according to the merger timescale model of Jiang et al., which outperforms other models. Including orphan subhalos also enables recovery of the real-space spatial and velocity distributions to $5$--$10\%$ accuracy down to scales of $0.1$--$0.2\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. The remaining differences are likely due to cosmic variance and finite-box effects in the smaller Jiutian-300 simulation. Convergence below $0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ remains challenging and requires more sophisticated modeling of orphan subhalos. I further highlight that redshift-space multipoles are more difficult to recover even at larger scales because unreliable small-scale pairs at $r_{\mathrm{p}} &lt; 0.1\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ in real space affect scales of tens of $\mathrm{Mpc}$ in redshift space due to elongated Fingers-of-God effects. Therefore, for redshift-space statistics, I recommend using modified or alternative measures that reduce sensitivity to small projected separations in subhalo-based studies.</description>

      <title>The Blooming Tree Algorithm at Work: Clusters, Filaments and Superclusters in the Field of A2029</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Blooming Tree (BT) algorithm, based on the hierarchical clustering method, is designed to identify clusters, groups, and substructures from galaxy redshift surveys. We apply the BT algorithm to a wide-field ($10\times 10$ deg$^2$) spectroscopic dataset centered on the galaxy cluster A2029. The BT algorithm effectively identifies all the X-ray luminous clusters and most of the optical clusters known in the literature, numerous groups, and the filaments surrounding the clusters, associating a list of galaxy members to each structure. By lowering the detection threshold, the BT algorithm also identifies the three superclusters in the field. The BT algorithm arranges the clusters and groups that make up the superclusters in a hierarchical tree according to their pairwise binding energy: the algorithm thus unveils the possible accretion history of each supercluster and their future evolution. These results show how the BT algorithm can represent a crucial tool to investigate the formation and evolution of cosmic structures on non-linear and mildly non-linear scales.</description>

      <title>Probing gravity beyond general relativity with bispectrum multipoles of cosmological tracers: I. Theoretical Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bispectrum, being sensitive to non-Gaussianity and mode coupling of cosmological fields induced by non-linear gravitational evolution, serves as a powerful probe for detecting deviations from General Relativity (GR). The signatures of modified gravity in the bispectrum are even more pronounced in redshift space, where anisotropies from peculiar velocities provide unbiased information on higher-order properties of gravity. We investigate the potential of all non-zero angular multipoles $B_l^m$ of redshift space bispectrum across all possible triangle configurations to probe degenerate higher-order scalar tensor (DHOST) theory. We show that the higher-order multipoles of the bispectrum with $l=2,4,6$ are more sensitive to the modifications in gravity than the spherically averaged monopole moment $l=0$. These multipoles demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to the higher-order growth history, which varies across triangle configurations, with acute triangles generally being the most sensitive to modification in GR. The values of various multipoles exhibit opposite signs in modified gravity compared to those predicted in GR, which serves as a robust indicator of the deviation from GR. We demonstrate that, unlike $l=2$ and $4$ multipoles, the $l=6$ multipoles with $m\leq 4$ are not affected by the quadratic bias and second-order tidal bias parameters, emphasising the need to leverage their capabilities in analyses. The $(l=6, m &gt; 4)$ multipoles fail to capture the second-order growth, while all $l=8$ multipoles lack any independent information regarding modified gravity in both linear and nonlinear regimes.</description>

      <title>Parametrizing the Hubble function instead of dark energy: Many possibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present article, we propose a very simple parametrization of the Hubble function without parametrizing the dark components of the Universe. One of the novelties of the parametrization is that it may include a wide variety of the cosmological models, such as dark energy (both noninteracting and interacting fluids), modified gravity, cosmological matter creation and other known scenarios. The model is constrained with the latest astronomical probes from Hubble parameter measurements, three distinct versions of Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+, DESY5, Union3) and baryon acoustic oscillations from Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument data releases 1 and 2. Our results suggest a mild deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model for most of the combined datasets. We also find that our model is thermodynamically consistent and performs well in the model comparison tests.</description>

      <title>Mitigating incoherent excess variance in high-redshift 21-cm observations with multi-output cross Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic effects that limit the achievable sensitivity of current low-frequency radio telescopes to the 21-cm signal are among the foremost challenges in observational 21-cm cosmology. The standard approach to retrieving the 21-cm signal from radio interferometric data separates it from bright astrophysical foregrounds by exploiting their spectrally smooth nature, in contrast to the finer spectral structure of the 21-cm signal. Contaminants exhibiting rapid frequency fluctuations, on the other hand, are difficult to separate from the 21-cm signal using standard techniques, and the power from these contaminants contributes to low-level systematics that can limit our ability to detect the 21-cm signal. Many of these low-level systematics are incoherent across multiple nights of observation, resulting in an incoherent excess variance above the thermal noise sensitivity of the instrument. In this paper, we develop a method called cross-GPR (cross covariance Gaussian process regression) that exploits the incoherence of these systematics to separate them from the 21-cm signal, which remains coherent across multiple nights of observation. We first develop and demonstrate the technique on synthetic signals in a general setting, and then apply it to gridded interferometric visibility cubes. We perform realistic simulations of visibility cubes containing foregrounds, 21-cm signal, noise, and incoherent systematics. The simulations show that the method can successfully separate and subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, and its advantages over standard techniques become more evident when the spectral behavior of the contaminants resembles that of the 21-cm signal. Simulations performed on a variety of 21-cm signal shapes also reveal that the cross-GPR approach can subtract incoherent contributions to the excess variance, without suppressing the 21-cm signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that primordial black holes (PBHs) in the $\textit{Stupendously Large Black Hole}$ mass range ($M \gtrsim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$) produce isocurvature perturbations exceeding current $\textit{Planck}$ Cosmic Microwave Background limits, thereby excluding them as a significant dark matter component.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity toward dark matter annihilation imprints on 21-cm signal with SKA-Low: A convolutional neural network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the sensitivity of the radio interferometers to identify imprints of spatially inhomogeneous dark matter annihilation signatures in the 21-cm signal during the pre-reionization era. We focus on the upcoming low-mode survey of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Low) telescope. Using CNNs, we analyze simulated 3D 21-cm differential brightness temperature maps generated via the DM21cm code, which is based on 21cmFAST and DarkHistory, to distinguish between spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous energy injection/deposition scenarios arising from dark matter annihilation. The inhomogeneous case accounts for local dark matter density contrasts and gas properties, such as thermal and ionization states, while the homogeneous model assumes uniform energy deposition. Our study focuses on two primary annihilation channels to electron-positron pairs ($e^+e^-$) and photons ( $\gamma \gamma$), exploring dark matter masses from 1 MeV to 100 MeV and a range of annihilation cross-sections. For $\gamma \gamma$ channel, the distinction across dark matter models is less pronounced due to the larger mean free path of the emitted photons, resulting in a more uniform energy deposition. For $e^+e^-$ channel, the results indicate that the CNNs can effectively differentiate between the inhomogeneous and homogeneous cases. Despite observational challenges, the results demonstrate that these effects remain detectable even after incorporating noise from next-generation radio interferometers, such as the SKA. We find that the inhomogeneous dark matter annihilation models can leave measurable imprints on the 21-cm signal maps distinguishable from the homogeneous scenarios for the dark matter masses $m_{\rm DM}=1$ MeV and the annihilation cross-sections of $\geq 5 \times 10^{-30}~{\rm cm^3/sec}$ ($\geq 5 \times 10^{-29}~{\rm cm^3/sec}$ for $m_{\rm DM}=100$ MeV) for moderate SKA-Low noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the second data release (DR2) of the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation, from the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, available at http://flathub.flatironinstitute.org/fire. DR2 includes all snapshots for most simulations, starting at z ~ 99, with all snapshot time spacings &lt;~ 25 Myr. The Core suite -- comprising 14 Milky Way-mass galaxies, 5 SMC/LMC-mass galaxies, and 4 lower-mass galaxies -- includes 601 snapshots to z = 0. For the Core suite, we also release resimulations with physics variations: (1) dark-matter-only versions; (2) a modified ultraviolet background with later reionization at z = 7.8; (3) magnetohydrodynamics, anisotropic conduction, and viscosity in gas; and (4) a model for cosmic-ray injection, transport, and feedback (assuming a constant diffusion coefficient). The Massive Halo suite now includes 8 massive galaxies with 278 snapshots to z = 1. The High Redshift suite includes 34 simulations: in addition to the 22 simulations run to z = 5, we now include 12 additional simulations run to z = 7 and z = 9. Most simulations include catalogs of (sub)halos and galaxies at all available snapshots, and most Core simulations to z = 0 include full halo merger trees.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Wavelength Survey of Transient Lensing Opportunities for Primordial Black Hole Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of short astrophysical transients provides a uniquely direct avenue for searching for primordial black holes (PBHs) across a vast range of masses. While past search efforts have focused on particular source classes-such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) and gamma-ray burst spikes-no systematic, multi-wavelength survey has compared their relative potential for PBH discovery. We present here a broad assessment of transient lensing search opportunities, spanning more than twenty decades in photon frequency and over twelve orders of magnitude in PBH mass. For each class, we determine the accessible PBH mass window by accounting for wave-optics suppression and time-delay resolution limits, and we estimate potential sensitivities to the PBH abundance using representative event rates, distances, and optical depths. Our survey includes low-frequency radio events (FRBs, pulsar giant pulses, planetary cyclotron bursts), optical/infrared signals, and high-energy phenomena (gamma-ray burst spikes, fast X-ray transients, TeV blazar flares). We synthesize these results in a unified mass-abundance diagram and comprehensive tables summarizing both physical reach and observational requirements. This work serves as a roadmap for optimizing future multi-wavelength lensing searches, guiding the design of instruments and strategies to explore the PBH dark matter hypothesis across its remaining viable parameter space.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Inflation with Hubble Anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been persistent suggestions, based on several diverse data sets, that the cosmic expansion is not exactly isotropic. It is not easy to develop a coherent theoretical account of such a ``Hubble anisotropy'', for, in standard General Relativity, intuition suggests that it contradicts the predictions of the very successful Inflationary hypothesis. We put this intuition on a firm basis, by proving that if we [a] make use of an Inflationary theory in which Inflation isotropises spatial geometry -- $\,$ this, of course, includes the vast majority of such theories -- $\,$ and if [b] we insist on assuming that spacetime has a strictly metric geometry (one in which the geometry is completely determined by a metric tensor), then indeed all aspects of the ``Hubble field'' must be isotropic. Conversely, should a Hubble anisotropy be confirmed, then either we must contrive to build anisotropy into Inflation from the outset, or we will have to accept that spacetime geometry is not strictly metric. We argue that allowing spacetime torsion to be non-zero would be by far the most natural way to accommodate such observations. Such theories make firm predictions, as for example that there should be a correlation between the degree of anisotropy at the end of Inflation and a certain specific component of the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Pantheon+ supernova data suggests evidence of sign-changing pressure of the cosmological fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit/reinterpret/extend the model-independent analysis method (which we now call spread - luminosity distance fitting, spread-LDF) from our previous work. We apply it to the updated supernova type Ia catalogue, Pantheon+ and recent GRB compilations. The procedure allows us, using only FLRW assumption, to construct good approximations for expansion history of the universe, re-confirming its acceleration to be a robust feature. When we also assume General Relativity ("GR"), we can demonstrate, without any matter/energy model in mind, the need for (possibly nonconstant) dark energy ("GDE"). We find hints for positive pressure of GDE at z&gt;1 with implications on either the complexity of dark energy, or the validity of one of the cosmological principle, interpretation of SN Ia data, or GR.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of the QCD Interaction Scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laboratory and astrophysical tests of ''constant variation'' have so far concentrated on the dimensionless fine-structure constant $\alpha$ and on the electron or quark mass ratios $X_{e,q}=m_{e,q}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$, treating the QCD scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ as unchangeable. Certain beyond Standard Model frameworks, most notably those with a dark matter or dark energy scalar field $\phi$ coupling with the gluon field, would make $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ itself time dependent while leaving $\alpha$ and the electron mass untouched. Under the minimal assumption that this gluonic channel is the sole $\phi$ interaction, we recast state-of-the-art atomic clock comparisons into $\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}=(3.2 \pm 3.5) \times 10^{-17} \ \text{yr}^{-1}$ limits, translate the isotope yields of the 1.8-Gyr-old Oklo natural reactor into a complementary geophysical limit of $|\delta\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;2\times10^{-9}$ over that time span, corresponding to the linear drift limit $|\dot{\Lambda}_{\text{QCD}}/\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}|&lt;1\times10^{-18} \text{yr}^{-1}$, and show that the proposed $8.4$ eV $^{229}$Th nuclear clock would amplify a putative $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ drift by four orders of magnitude compared with present atomic clocks. We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</description>

Abstract: We numerically study how the primordial magnetic field affects the first-order electroweak phase transition in the early Universe. We observe that: 1) the phase transition process would be slowed down by the magnetic field; 2) the phenomenon of vortex structure of the Higgs condensation appears when the homogenesis hypermagentic field $g'B_Y^{ex}/m_W^2\gtrsim3.63$; and, 3) the helical hypermagnetic field can dramatically enhance the sphaleron rate and validate the generation of the baryon asymmetry through the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Black Hole in the accelerating Universe approaching the future singularity -- Possible origin of (super-)massive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and investigate the dynamical black hole spacetime embedded in the expanding universe filled with cosmic fluid, such as dark energy. When the equation of state (EoS) parameter of the fluid is a constant, we find exact solutions of the Einstein equation where the Schwarzschild black hole is embedded in the expanding universe. This solution differs from the well-known McVittie metric, where the EoS parameter is not a constant but rather depends on the radial coordinate. It is shown that a dynamical black hole grows with the expansion of the universe. If primordial black holes are created before or during inflation, above dynamical black holes might be the origin of the supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, massive black holes suggested by the GW231123 event, and also the dark matter. The case where the cosmic fluid EoS is more general is also considered so that the universe enters the epoch of finite-time future singularity. Thermodynamics and the behaviour of black holes around different future singularities are carefully investigated. It is then demonstrated that the black hole horizon enhances the tidal force, but near the horizon, the tidal force works to press the extended object, which is in contrast with a massive body near to future singularity.
  We also propose a new type of future singularity where the singularity inside the black hole is a sphere with a finite radius. When the radius of the spherical singularity becomes larger than the radius of the black hole horizon, it becomes naked. The universe may end up with a cosmic doomsday when the radius of the singularity becomes infinite.</description>

      <title>Coupled Time-Dependent Proton Acceleration and Leptonic-Hadronic Radiation in Turbulent Supermassive Black Hole Coronae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent coronae of supermassive black holes can accelerate non-thermal particles to high energies and produce observable radiation, but capturing this process is challenging due to comparable timescales of acceleration, cooling, and the development of cascades. We present a time-dependent numerical framework that self-consistently couples proton acceleration -- modeled by the Fokker-Planck equation -- with leptonic-hadronic radiation. For the neutrino-emitting Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, we reproduce the neutrino spectrum observed by IceCube, while satisfying gamma-ray constraints. We also consider a transient corona scenario, potentially emerging in non-jetted tidal disruption events like AT 2019dsg, and show that early-stage cascade feedback can impact proton acceleration and radiation processes in weaker coronae, producing delayed optical/ultraviolet, X-ray, and neutrino emissions of $\mathcal O(100~\rm d)$. This flexible code efficiently models multi-messenger signals from both steady and transient astrophysical sources, providing insights in combining particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Gravitational Waves from Anisotropic Axion Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a powerful probe of the early universe due to their ability to free-stream across cosmic history. We study GW production in a compelling scenario where a rotating axion(-like) field becomes relevant for a brief period in the early universe before transitioning into a kination fluid and rapidly dissipating its energy through cosmic expansion. During this short epoch, the curvature perturbation can be predominantly sourced by the rotating axion and may significantly exceed the adiabatic component. Moreover, axion field perturbations grow on superhorizon scales during this phase. These effects can generate a strong stochastic background of induced GWs. This GW background also exhibits a pronounced large-scale anisotropy inherited from the axion fluctuations, serving as a distinctive signature of the scenario. Importantly, the transient nature of axion relevance enables this scenario to evade stringent bounds on large-scale perturbations. We analyze various observational constraints and find that both the amplitude and anisotropy of the resulting GW signal could be accessible to future detectors.</description>

      <title>Using Cumulative Number Densities to Compare Galaxies across Cosmic Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:1308.3232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Comparing galaxies across redshifts at fixed cumulative number density is a popular way to estimate the evolution of specific galaxy populations. This method ignores scatter in mass accretion histories and galaxy-galaxy mergers, which can lead to errors when comparing galaxies over large redshift ranges (Delta z &gt; 1). We use abundance matching in the LCDM paradigm to estimate the median change in number density with redshift and provide a simple fit (+0.16 dex per unit Delta z) for progenitors of z = 0 galaxies. We find that galaxy descendants do not evolve in the same way as galaxy progenitors, largely due to scatter in mass accretion histories. We also provide estimates for the 1-sigma range of number densities corresponding to galaxy progenitors and descendants. Finally, we discuss some limits on number density comparisons, which arise due to difficulties measuring physical quantities (e.g., stellar mass) consistently across redshifts. A public tool to calculate number density evolution for galaxies, as well as approximate halo masses, is available online.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Hubble and matter density parameters with and without modelling the CMB anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$ from: (i) the age of the Universe based on old stars and stellar populations in the Galactic disc and halo (Cimatti &amp; Moresco 2023); (ii) the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum, which tells us the cosmological horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality (Philcox et al. 2022); and (iii) the shape of the expansion history from supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs) with no absolute calibration of either, a technique known as uncalibrated cosmic standards (UCS; Lin, Chen, &amp; Mack 2021). A narrow region is consistent with all three constraints just outside their $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Although this region is defined by techniques unrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the standard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region. This concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously high local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be reconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\Omega_{\mathrm{M}}$. We suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &amp; Cowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent local $H_0$. Given the difficulties with solutions in the early universe, we argue that the most promising alternative to a local void is a modification to the expansion history at late times, perhaps due to a changing dark energy density.</description>

      <title>Avoiding lensing bias in cosmic shear analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show, using the pseudo-$C_\ell$ technique, how to estimate cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing power spectra that are insensitive to the effects of multiple sources of lensing bias including source-lens clustering, magnification bias and obscuration effects. All of these effects are of significant concern for ongoing and near-future Stage-IV cosmic shear surveys. Their common attribute is that they all introduce a cosmological dependence into the selection of the galaxy shear sample. Here, we show how a simple adaptation of the pseudo-$C_\ell$ method can help to suppress these biases to negligible levels in a model-independent way. Our approach is based on making pixelised maps of the shear field and then using a uniform weighting of those shear maps when extracting power spectra. To produce unbiased measurements, the weighting scheme must be independent of the cosmological signal, which makes the commonly-used inverse-variance weighting scheme unsuitable for cosmic shear measurements. We demonstrate this explicitly. A frequently-cited motivation for using inverse-variance weights is to minimize the errors on the resultant power spectra. We find that, for a Stage-IV-like survey configuration, this motivation is not compelling: the precision of power spectra recovered from uniform-weighted maps is only very slightly degraded compared to those recovered from an inverse-variance analysis, and we predict no degradation in cosmological parameter constraints. We suggest that other 2-point statistics, such as real-space correlation functions, can be rendered equally robust to these lensing biases by applying those estimators to pixelised shear maps using a uniform weighting scheme.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy within the Generalized Uncertainty Principle in Light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we modify the $\Lambda$CDM model by introducing a deformed algebra within the framework of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We formulate the modified Raychaudhuri equation, where new terms are introduced which describe dynamical pressure components. For the quadratic GUP model, we derive the Hubble function, which leads to a time-dependent dark energy model. The free parameters are determined using late-time observational data, the Pantheon+ SNIa sample, the cosmic chronometers, and the DESI 2025 BAO data. We find that the modified model introduce only one new additional degree of freedom compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The GUP-Modified $\Lambda$CDM model provides a better fit to the data than the undeformed theory. Furthermore, we compare the same model with the DESI 2024 BAO data and find that the Bayesian evidence becomes stronger with the inclusion of the DESI 2025 release.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble Tension with a Local Void and Transitions of the Absolute Magnitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, one of the well-known serious challenges in cosmology is the Hubble tension, namely the discrepancy between the Hubble constants from the local observation of Type Ia supernova (SNIa) and the high-$z$ observation of cosmic microwave background (CMB). Here, we are interested in alleviating the Hubble tension with a local void. The key idea is assuming that we live in a locally underdense void, where one will feel a faster expansion rate compared to the cosmic average. In the literature, it was found that a local void cannot satisfyingly alleviate the Hubble tension, since it is not preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model by the observations such as the Pantheon SNIa sample, especially in terms of the information criteria AIC and BIC. In the present work, we try to alleviate the Hubble tension with a local void and transitions of the absolute magnitude $M$, by using the Pantheon+ SNIa sample alone or jointly with the CMB data of Planck 2018. We find that the Hubble tension can be satisfyingly alleviated, while the $\Lambda$LTB void models are strongly preferred by the observations.</description>

      <title>Detecting Modeling Bias with Continuous Time Flow Models on Weak Lensing Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for extracting rich information from nonlinear scales in current and upcoming cosmological surveys, and ensuring its robustness requires stringent validation of forward models. In this work, we recast forward model validation as an out-of-distribution (OoD) detection problem within the framework of machine learning (ML)-based simulation-based inference (SBI). We employ probability density as the metric for OoD detection, and compare various density estimation techniques, demonstrating that field-level probability density estimation via continuous time flow models (CTFM) significantly outperforms feature-level approaches that combine scattering transform (ST) or convolutional neural networks (CNN) with normalizing flows (NFs), as well as NF-based field-level estimators, as quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Our analysis shows that CTFM not only excels in detecting OoD samples but also provides a robust metric for model selection. Additionally, we verified CTFM maintains consistent efficacy across different cosmologies while mitigating the inductive biases inherent in NF architectures. Although our proof-of-concept study employs simplified forward modeling and noise settings, our framework establishes a promising pathway for identifying unknown systematics in the cosmology datasets.</description>

      <title>Uncalibrated Cosmic Standards as a Robust Test on Late-Time Cosmological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an assumption-minimized framework for testing late-time cosmological models using Uncalibrated Cosmic Standards (UCS), including standard rulers and standard candles, without relying on absolute calibrations. The method exploits a tight, model-insensitive correlation between the sound horizons at recombination and the drag epoch. By avoiding dependence on pre-recombination physics and the amplitude of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra, the UCS framework reduces potential early-Universe biases while retaining much of the constraining power of full analyses. Applying UCS to the recent dynamical dark energy (DE) study that reported deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, we find the constraints shift systematically toward the $\Lambda$CDM case. If this shift is physical, it may result from the omission of some pre-recombination physical processes that influence the scale dependence of the CMB spectra. We also observe a mild tension between uncalibrated standard rulers and candles, which can be largely mitigated by introducing a redshift-dependent magnitude bias in the supernova (SNe Ia) data. Our results highlight the importance of isolating post-recombination observables for testing late-time models in the era of precision cosmology, positioning UCS analysis as a robust framework for upcoming galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Association between optically identified galaxy clusters and the underlying dark matter halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clusters of galaxies trace massive dark matter halos in the Universe, but they can include multiple halos projected along lines of sight. As a case study, we quantify the properties of halos contributing to clusters identified by the redMaPPer algorithm using the Cardinal simulation, which mimics the Dark Energy Survey data. For each cluster, we identify the halos hosting its member galaxies, and we define the main halo as the one contributing the most to the cluster's richness ($\lambda$, the estimated number of member galaxies). At $z=0.3$, for clusters with $\lambda &gt; 60$, the main halo typically contributes to $92\%$ of the richness, and this fraction drops to $67\%$ for $\lambda \approx 20$. Defining "clean" clusters as those with $\geq50\%$ of the richness contributed by the main halo, we find that $100\%$ of the $\lambda &gt; 60$ clusters are clean, while $73\%$ of the $\lambda \approx 20$ clusters are clean. Three halos can usually account for more than $80\%$ of the richness of a cluster. The main halos associated with redMaPPer clusters have a completeness ranging from $98\%$ at virial mass $10^{14.6}~h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ to $64\%$ at $10^{14}~h^{-1}M_{\odot}$. In addition, we compare the inferred cluster centers with true halo centers, finding that $30\%$ of the clusters are miscentered with a mean offset $40\%$ of the cluster radii, in agreement with recent X-ray studies. These systematics worsen as redshift increases, but we expect that upcoming surveys extending to longer wavelengths will improve the cluster finding at high redshifts. Our results affirm the robustness of the redMaPPer algorithm and provide a framework for benchmarking other cluster-finding strategies.</description>

      <title>New constraints on cosmological gravitational waves from CMB and BAO in light of dynamical dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we derive upper limits on the physical energy-density fraction today of cosmological gravitational waves, denoted by $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}$, by combining \emph{Planck} \&amp; ACT \&amp; SPT CMB data with DESI BAO data. In the standard cosmological model, we establish 95\% CL upper limits of $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ for adiabatic initial conditions and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.7 \times 10^{-7}$ for homogeneous initial conditions. In light of dynamical dark energy, we get $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 7.2 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous). We also project the sensitivity achievable with LiteBIRD \&amp; CMB Stage-IV measurements of CMB and CSST observations of BAO, forecasting 68\% CL uncertainties of $\sigma = 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\sigma = 0.9 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous) for ${\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}}$. The constraints provide critical benchmarks for exploring the cosmological origins of gravitational waves within the frequency band $f \gtrsim 10^{-15}$\,Hz and potentially enable joint analysis with direct gravitational-wave detection sensitive to this regime.</description>

      <title>Can a multi-tracer approach improve the constraints on the turnover scale at low redshift?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The turnover scale of the power spectrum is related to the size of the particle horizon at the matter-radiation equality, which can be used as a standard ruler to constrain cosmological parameters. In this work, we apply a model-independent method to mock datasets to forecast constraints on the turnover scale below a redshift of 0.5, investigating for the first time with a multi-tracer approach. We find that combining the galaxy density with peculiar velocity does not improve the turnover scale constraints for current or currently planned surveys because either the cosmological volume or the effective number density of peculiar velocities is too low. However, we demonstrate that when combining the galaxy power spectrum from 4HS with the HI power spectrum from SKA1-B2, the constraints on the turnover scale improve by $\sim30\%$ compared to using only a single tracer. We demonstrate for the first time that combining DESI, 4HS, and an SKA Phase 1 Band 2 survey could achieve a $\sim5\%$ level constraint on the turnover scale and a $\sim90\%$ probability of detecting the turnover below a redshift of 0.5. Lastly, we also demonstrate that combining the DESI BGS redshift sample with the LRG, ELG, and QSO samples could break the degeneracy between $r_H$ and $\Omega_m$ and improve their constraints by $\sim25\%$ and $\sim45\%$, respectively, compared to only using the high redshift samples. The constraints on the particle horizon at the matter-radiation equality $r_H$ and the matter density $\Omega_m$ could then further improve by $\sim20\%$ and $\sim30\%$, respectively, when combining the full set of DESI redshift tracers with 4HS and SKA1-B2.</description>

      <title>High Frequency Peak Radio Sources from the AT20G Catalogue and Their Radio Spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sample of high-frequency peaker (HFP) candidates was formed from the AT20G catalog radio sources with spectral indices of the optically thick emission region $\alpha_{below}$ exceeding +0.5. A study of the spectral properties of the sources in the sample, which included 269 radio sources, was performed. The spectra of the sources were constructed and the spectral indices below $\alpha_{below}$ and above the peak $\alpha_{above}$, the peak frequency $\nu_{obs}$, the flux density at the peak frequency $S_{peak}$, and the peak half-width in the radio spectrum were determined. Analysis of the spectra showed that the sample is fairly homogeneous and consists of HFPs with $\nu_{obs}&gt;5$ GHz. Most sources (67%) do not have data at frequencies below 0.8 GHz. 187 sources have ultra-inverted spectra ($\alpha_{below}&gt;$+0.7), which is 3.2% of all sources in the AT20G catalog and 70% of radio sources in our sample. Optical identification of radio sources in the sample showed that 70% of the hosts are quasars. The sample consists of compact objects with radio luminosity at 20 GHz in the range of $10^{23}$-$10^{30}$ W/Hz, angular sizes of emitting regions of radio sources are 0.002-0.25 mas, projected linear sizes are from 0.2 to 30 pc. The dependence of the peak frequencies of radio sources on their angular sizes is in good agreement with that previously discovered for CSS and GPS sources.</description>

      <title>Checking the Empirical Relations with the Current Localized Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although fast radio bursts (FRBs) were discovered more than a decade ago, and they have been one of the active fields in astronomy and cosmology, their origins are still unknown. An interesting topic closely related to the origins of FRBs is their classifications. Different classes of FRBs require different physical mechanisms. If some empirical relations are found for different classes of FRBs, they might justify the classifications scenario and help us to reveal the physical mechanisms behind. On the other hand, FRBs are actually a promising probe for cosmology, since their redshifts could be $z\sim 3$ or even higher. Similar to the cosmology of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) or Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), some empirical relations might also play an important role in the FRB cosmology. In the literature, some new classifications of FRBs different from repeaters and non-repeaters were proposed recently. In particular, it was suggested to classify FRBs into the ones associated with old or young stellar populations, and some empirical relations have also been found for them, respectively. One of these empirical relations (namely $L_\nu-E$ relation) without dispersion measure (DM) has been used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology. This shows the potential of the new classification and the empirical relations for FRBs. Nowadays, more than 50 FRBs have been well localized, and hence their redshifts $z$ are observationally known. So, it is of interest to check the empirical relations with the actual data of current localized FRBs. We find that many empirical relations still hold, and in particular the one used to calibrate FRBs as standard candles for cosmology stands firm. This is beneficial to the FRB cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to search for gravitational waves from quasinormal modes in the ringdowns of the remnants of the mergers of the binary black hole systems. The method is based on maximum likelihood estimation. We derive a time-domain matched-filtering statistic that can be used to search for any number of modes in the data. The parameters of the modes can be estimated and the modes present in the data can be reconstructed. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the method by injecting the quasinormal mode waveforms to noise. We analyze performance of the method for searches of quasinormal modes in the advanced detectors data like LIGO and Virgo, in the third generation of detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer and in the space detector LISA data. We analyze ringdown of publicly available GW190521 event and we compare our results with analysis by other methods.</description>

      <title>When First Beats Fast: Early Neutrino-Mass-Driven Flavor Instabilities in Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor conversions in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) begin with instabilities, initially triggered when the dominant $\nu_e$ outflow concurs with a small flux of antineutrinos with the opposite lepton number, with $\overline{\nu}_e$ dominating over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$. When these "flipped" neutrinos emerge in the energy-integrated angular distribution (angular crossing), they initiate a fast instability. However, before such conditions arise, spectral crossings typically appear within $20~\mathrm{ms}$ of collapse, i.e., local spectral excesses of $\overline{\nu}_e$ over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ along some direction. Therefore, post-processing SN simulations cannot consistently capture later fast instabilities because the early slow ones have already altered the conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions in the early Universe are a well-motivated source of gravitational waves (GWs). In this Letter, we identify a previously overlooked GW production mechanism: gravitational transition radiation, arising from graviton emission by particles whose mass changes as they pass through expanding bubble walls. Unlike conventional sources such as bubble collisions or sound waves, this mechanism operates at the microscopic scale set by the Lorentz-contracted wall thickness, leading to GW emission at significantly higher frequencies. The resulting spectrum features a distinctive shape with a peak frequency redshifting to $f_{\rm peak}\sim T_0\sim 10^{10}\,{\rm Hz}$ where $T_0$ is the current temperature of the Universe. This mechanism is generic and is expected to operate similarly for domain walls and other relativistic interfaces.</description>
