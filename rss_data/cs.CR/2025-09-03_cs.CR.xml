      <title>Per-sender neural network classifiers for email authorship validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Business email compromise and lateral spear phishing attacks are among modern organizations' most costly and damaging threats. While inbound phishing defenses have improved significantly, most organizations still trust internal emails by default, leaving themselves vulnerable to attacks from compromised employee accounts. In this work, we define and explore the problem of authorship validation: verifying whether a claimed sender actually authored a given email. Authorship validation is a lightweight, real-time defense that complements traditional detection methods by modeling per-sender writing style. Further, the paper presents a collection of new datasets based on the Enron corpus. These simulate inauthentic messages using both human-written and large language model-generated emails. The paper also evaluates two classifiers -- a Naive Bayes model and a character-level convolutional neural network (Char-CNN) -- for the authorship validation task. Our experiments show that the Char-CNN model achieves high accuracy and F1 scores under various circumstances. Finally, we discuss deployment considerations and show that per-sender authorship classifiers are practical for integrating into existing commercial email security systems with low overhead.</description>

      <title>Case Studies: Effective Approaches for Navigating Cross-Border Cloud Data Transfers Amid U.S. Government Privacy and Safety Concerns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study attempts to explain the impact of information exchange from one country to another, as well as the legal and technological implications for these exchanges. Due to the emergence of cloud technology, possibilities for free exchange of information between countries have increased rapidly, as it has become possible to save information in a country and access it in almost any part of the world. Countries all around the world have been confronted with developing frameworks to facilitate this process, although there are significant challenges which must be confronted on legal and technological fronts, as loopholes in the framework adopted by countries may hinder free access to information stored on cloud, and also compromise data privacy. Cloud technology is impacting a lot of issues, including domestic and international businesses, hence the need for a study to propose measures for safe exchange of information using cloud technology.</description>

      <title>Keystroke Detection by Exploiting Unintended RF Emission from Repaired USB Keyboards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic devices and cables inadvertently emit RF emissions as a byproduct of signal processing and/or transmission. Labeled as electromagnetic emanations, they form an EM side-channel for data leakage. Previously, it was believed that such leakage could be contained within a facility since they are weak signals with a short transmission range. However, in the preliminary version of this work [1], we found that the traditional cable repairing process forms a tiny monopole antenna that helps emanations transmit over a long range. Experimentation with three types of cables revealed that emanations from repaired cables remain detectable even at &gt;4 m and can penetrate a 14 cm thick concrete wall. In this extended version, we show that such emanation can be exploited at a long distance for information extraction by detecting keystrokes typed on a repaired USB keyboard. By collecting data for 70 different keystrokes at different distances from the target in 3 diverse environments (open space, a corridor outside an office room, and outside a building) and developing an efficient detection algorithm, ~100% keystroke detection accuracy has been achieved up to 12 m distance, which is the highest reported accuracy at such a long range for USB keyboards in the literature. The effect of two experimental factors, interference and human-body coupling, has been investigated thoroughly. Along with exploring the vulnerability, multi-layer external metal shielding during the repairing process as a possible remedy has been explored. This work exposes a new attack surface caused by hardware modification, its exploitation, and potential countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Enabling Transparent Cyber Threat Intelligence Combining Large Language Models and Domain Ontologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) relies upon accurately structured and semantically enriched information extracted from cybersecurity system logs. However, current methodologies often struggle to identify and interpret malicious events reliably and transparently, particularly in cases involving unstructured or ambiguous log entries. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that combines ontology-driven structured outputs with Large Language Models (LLMs), to build an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that improves the accuracy and explainability of information extraction from cybersecurity logs. Central to our approach is the integration of domain ontologies and SHACL-based constraints to guide the language model's output structure and enforce semantic validity over the resulting graph. Extracted information is organized into an ontology-enriched graph database, enabling future semantic analysis and querying. The design of our methodology is motivated by the analytical requirements associated with honeypot log data, which typically comprises predominantly malicious activity. While our case study illustrates the relevance of this scenario, the experimental evaluation is conducted using publicly available datasets. Results demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy in information extraction compared to traditional prompt-only approaches, with a deliberate focus on extraction quality rather than processing speed.</description>

      <title>Private, Verifiable, and Auditable AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing societal reliance on artificial intelligence necessitates robust frameworks for ensuring its security, accountability, and trustworthiness. This thesis addresses the complex interplay between privacy, verifiability, and auditability in modern AI, particularly in foundation models. It argues that technical solutions that integrate these elements are critical for responsible AI innovation. Drawing from international policy contributions and technical research to identify key risks in the AI pipeline, this work introduces novel technical solutions for critical privacy and verifiability challenges. Specifically, the research introduces techniques for enabling verifiable and auditable claims about AI systems using zero-knowledge cryptography; utilizing secure multi-party computation and trusted execution environments for auditable, confidential deployment of large language models and information retrieval; and implementing enhanced delegation mechanisms, credentialing systems, and access controls to secure interactions with autonomous and multi-agent AI systems. Synthesizing these technical advancements, this dissertation presents a cohesive perspective on balancing privacy, verifiability, and auditability in foundation model-based AI systems, offering practical blueprints for system designers and informing policy discussions on AI safety and governance.</description>

      <title>AEGIS : Automated Co-Evolutionary Framework for Guarding Prompt Injections Schema</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant challenge to the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. While prompt-based detection offers a lightweight and interpretable defense strategy, its effectiveness has been hindered by the need for manual prompt engineering. To address this issue, we propose AEGIS , an Automated co-Evolutionary framework for Guarding prompt Injections Schema. Both attack and defense prompts are iteratively optimized against each other using a gradient-like natural language prompt optimization technique. This framework enables both attackers and defenders to autonomously evolve via a Textual Gradient Optimization (TGO) module, leveraging feedback from an LLM-guided evaluation loop. We evaluate our system on a real-world assignment grading dataset of prompt injection attacks and demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior robustness in both attack success and detection. Specifically, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 1.0, representing an improvement of 0.26 over the baseline. For detection, the true positive rate (TPR) improves by 0.23 compared to the previous best work, reaching 0.84, and the true negative rate (TNR) remains comparable at 0.89. Ablation studies confirm the importance of co-evolution, gradient buffering, and multi-objective optimization. We also confirm that this framework is effective in different LLMs. Our results highlight the promise of adversarial training as a scalable and effective approach for guarding prompt injections.</description>

      <title>Enhanced R\'{e}nyi Entropy-Based Post-Quantum Key Agreement with Provable Security and Information-Theoretic Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced post-quantum key agreement protocol based on R\'{e}nyi entropy, addressing vulnerabilities in the original construction while preserving information-theoretic security properties. We develop a theoretical framework leveraging entropy-preserving operations and secret-shared verification to achieve provable security against quantum adversaries. Through entropy amplification techniques and quantum-resistant commitments, the protocol establishes $2^{128}$ quantum security guarantees under the quantum random oracle model. Key innovations include a confidentiality-preserving verification mechanism using distributed polynomial commitments, tightened min-entropy bounds with guaranteed non-negativity, and composable security proofs in the quantum universal composability framework. Unlike computational approaches, our method provides information-theoretic security without hardness assumptions while maintaining polynomial complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates resilience against known quantum attack vectors, including Grover-accelerated brute force and quantum memory attacks. The protocol achieves parameterization for 128-bit quantum security with efficient $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ communication complexity. Extensions to secure multiparty computation and quantum network applications are established, providing a foundation for long-term cryptographic security. All security claims are derived from mathematical proofs; this theoretical work presents no experimental validation.</description>

      <title>A Whole New World: Creating a Parallel-Poisoned Web Only AI-Agents Can See</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel attack vector that leverages website cloaking techniques to compromise autonomous web-browsing agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). As these agents become more prevalent, their unique and often homogenous digital fingerprints - comprising browser attributes, automation framework signatures, and network characteristics - create a new, distinguishable class of web traffic. The attack exploits this fingerprintability. A malicious website can identify an incoming request as originating from an AI agent and dynamically serve a different, "cloaked" version of its content. While human users see a benign webpage, the agent is presented with a visually identical page embedded with hidden, malicious instructions, such as indirect prompt injections. This mechanism allows adversaries to hijack agent behavior, leading to data exfiltration, malware execution, or misinformation propagation, all while remaining completely invisible to human users and conventional security crawlers. This work formalizes the threat model, details the mechanics of agent fingerprinting and cloaking, and discusses the profound security implications for the future of agentic AI, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses against this stealthy and scalable attack.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Approach to Estimate the Security Posture of a Cyber Infrastructure: A Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Academic and research Cyber Infrastructures (CI) present unique security challenges due to their collaborative nature, heterogeneous components, and the lack of practical, tailored security assessment frameworks. Existing standards can be too generic or complex for CI administrators to apply effectively. This report introduces a systematic, mission-centric approach to estimate and analyze the security posture of a CI. The framework guides administrators through a top-down process: (1) defining unacceptable losses and security missions, (2) identifying associated system hazards and critical assets, and (3) modeling the CI's components and their relationships as a security knowledge graph. The core of this methodology is the construction of directed attack graphs, which systematically map all potential paths an adversary could take from an entry point to a critical asset. By visualizing these attack paths alongside defense mechanisms, the framework provides a clear, comprehensive overview of the system's vulnerabilities and security gaps. This structured approach enables CI operators to proactively assess risks, prioritize mitigation strategies, and make informed, actionable decisions to strengthen the overall security posture of the CI.</description>

      <title>ShadowScope: GPU Monitoring and Validation via Composable Side Channel Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As modern systems increasingly rely on GPUs for computationally intensive tasks such as machine learning acceleration, ensuring the integrity of GPU computation has become critically important. Recent studies have shown that GPU kernels are vulnerable to both traditional memory safety issues (e.g., buffer overflow attacks) and emerging microarchitectural threats (e.g., Rowhammer attacks), many of which manifest as anomalous execution behaviors observable through side-channel signals. However, existing golden model based validation approaches that rely on such signals are fragile, highly sensitive to interference, and do not scale well across GPU workloads with diverse scheduling behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose ShadowScope, a monitoring and validation framework that leverages a composable golden model. Instead of building a single monolithic reference, ShadowScope decomposes trusted kernel execution into modular, repeatable functions that encode key behavioral features. This composable design captures execution patterns at finer granularity, enabling robust validation that is resilient to noise, workload variation, and interference across GPU workloads. To further reduce reliance on noisy software-only monitoring, we introduce ShadowScope+, a hardware-assisted validation mechanism that integrates lightweight on-chip checks into the GPU pipeline. ShadowScope+ achieves high validation accuracy with an average runtime overhead of just 4.6%, while incurring minimal hardware and design complexity. Together, these contributions demonstrate that side-channel observability can be systematically repurposed into a practical defense for GPU kernel integrity.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid AI-based and Rule-based Approach to DICOM De-identification: A Solution for the MIDI-B Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the de-identification of medical imaging data is a critical step in enabling safe data sharing. This paper presents a hybrid de-identification framework designed to process Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files. Our framework adopts a modified, pre-built rule-based component, updated with The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)'s best practices guidelines, as outlined in DICOM PS 3.15, for improved performance. It incorporates PaddleOCR, a robust Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for extracting text from images, and RoBERTa, a fine-tuned transformer-based model for identifying and removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI). Initially, the transformer-based model and the rule-based component were integrated to process for both structured data and free text. However, this coarse-grained approach did not yield optimal results. To improve performance, we refined our approach by applying the transformer model exclusively to free text, while structured data was handled only by rule-based methods. In this framework the DICOM validator dciodvfy was leveraged to ensure the integrity of DICOM files after the deID process. Through iterative refinement, including the incorporation of custom rules and private tag handling, the framework achieved a de-identification accuracy of 99.91% on the MIDI-B test dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining rule-based compliance with AI-enabled adaptability in addressing the complex challenges of DICOM de-identification.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Malware Detection via Probability-Level Fusion of Lightweight Gradient Boosting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating sophistication of malware necessitates robust detection mechanisms that generalize across diverse data sources. Traditional single-dataset models struggle with cross-domain generalization and often incur high computational costs. This paper presents a novel, lightweight framework for malware detection that employs probability-level fusion across three distinct datasets: EMBER (static features), API Call Sequences (behavioral features), and CIC Obfuscated Memory (memory patterns). Our method trains individual LightGBM classifiers on each dataset, selects top predictive features to ensure efficiency, and fuses their prediction probabilities using optimized weights determined via grid search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fusion approach achieves a macro F1-score of 0.823 on a cross-domain validation set, significantly outperforming individual models and providing superior generalization. The framework maintains low computational overhead, making it suitable for real-time deployment, and all code and data are provided for full reproducibility.</description>

      <title>FreeTalk:A plug-and-play and black-box defense against speech synthesis attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, speech assistant and speech verification have been used in many fields, which brings much benefit and convenience for us. However, when we enjoy these speech applications, our speech may be collected by attackers for speech synthesis. For example, an attacker generates some inappropriate political opinions with the characteristic of the victim's voice by obtaining a piece of the victim's speech, which will greatly influence the victim's reputation. Specifically, with the appearance of some zero-shot voice conversion methods, the cost of speech synthesis attacks has been further reduced, which also brings greater challenges to user voice security and privacy. Some researchers have proposed the corresponding privacy-preserving methods. However, the existing approaches have some non-negligible drawbacks: low transferability and robustness, high computational overhead. These deficiencies seriously limit the existing method deployed in practical scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a lightweight, robust, plug-and-play privacy preservation method against speech synthesis attacks in a black-box setting. Our method generates and adds a frequency-domain perturbation to the original speech to achieve privacy protection and high speech quality. Then, we present a data augmentation strategy and noise smoothing mechanism to improve the robustness of the proposed method. Besides, to reduce the user's defense overhead, we also propose a novel identity-wise protection mechanism. It can generate a universal perturbation for one speaker and support privacy preservation for speech of any length. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 5 speech synthesis models, 5 speech verification models, 1 speech recognition model, and 2 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has satisfying privacy-preserving performance, high speech quality, and utility.</description>

      <title>Federated Survival Analysis with Node-Level Differential Privacy: Private Kaplan-Meier Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how to calculate Kaplan-Meier survival curves across multiple health-care jurisdictions while protecting patient privacy with node-level differential privacy. Each site discloses its curve only once, adding Laplace noise whose scale is determined by the length of the common time grid; the server then averages the noisy curves, so the overall privacy budget remains unchanged. We benchmark four one-shot smoothing techniques: Discrete Cosine Transform, Haar Wavelet shrinkage, adaptive Total-Variation denoising, and a parametric Weibull fit on the NCCTG lung-cancer cohort under five privacy levels and three partition scenarios (uniform, moderately skewed, highly imbalanced). Total-Variation gives the best mean accuracy, whereas the frequency-domain smoothers offer stronger worst-case robustness and the Weibull model shows the most stable behaviour at the strictest privacy setting. Across all methods the released curves keep the empirical log-rank type-I error below fifteen percent for privacy budgets of 0.5 and higher, demonstrating that clinically useful survival information can be shared without iterative training or heavy cryptography.</description>

      <title>Enabling Trustworthy Federated Learning via Remote Attestation for Mitigating Byzantine Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention for its privacy-preserving capabilities, enabling distributed devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, its distributed nature forces the central server to blindly trust the local training process and aggregate uncertain model updates, making it susceptible to Byzantine attacks from malicious participants, especially in mission-critical scenarios. Detecting such attacks is challenging due to the diverse knowledge across clients, where variations in model updates may stem from benign factors, such as non-IID data, rather than adversarial behavior. Existing data-driven defenses struggle to distinguish malicious updates from natural variations, leading to high false positive rates and poor filtering performance.
  To address this challenge, we propose Sentinel, a remote attestation (RA)-based scheme for FL systems that regains client-side transparency and mitigates Byzantine attacks from a system security perspective. Our system employs code instrumentation to track control-flow and monitor critical variables in the local training process. Additionally, we utilize a trusted training recorder within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to generate an attestation report, which is cryptographically signed and securely transmitted to the server. Upon verification, the server ensures that legitimate client training processes remain free from program behavior violation or data manipulation, allowing only trusted model updates to be aggregated into the global model. Experimental results on IoT devices demonstrate that Sentinel ensures the trustworthiness of the local training integrity with low runtime and memory overhead.</description>

      <title>LLM-HyPZ: Hardware Vulnerability Discovery using an LLM-Assisted Hybrid Platform for Zero-Shot Knowledge Extraction and Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of hardware vulnerabilities has created an urgent need for systematic and scalable analysis methods. Unlike software flaws, which are often patchable post-deployment, hardware weaknesses remain embedded across product lifecycles, posing persistent risks to processors, embedded devices, and IoT platforms. Existing efforts such as the MITRE CWE Hardware List (2021) relied on expert-driven Delphi surveys, which lack statistical rigor and introduce subjective bias, while large-scale data-driven foundations for hardware weaknesses have been largely absent. In this work, we propose LLM-HyPZ, an LLM-assisted hybrid framework for zero-shot knowledge extraction and refinement from vulnerability corpora. Our approach integrates zero-shot LLM classification, contextualized embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and prompt-driven summarization to mine hardware-related CVEs at scale. Applying LLM-HyPZ to the 2021-2024 CVE corpus (114,836 entries), we identified 1,742 hardware-related vulnerabilities. We distilled them into five recurring themes, including privilege escalation via firmware and BIOS, memory corruption in mobile and IoT systems, and physical access exploits. Benchmarking across seven LLMs shows that LLaMA 3.3 70B achieves near-perfect classification accuracy (99.5%) on a curated validation set. Beyond methodological contributions, our framework directly supported the MITRE CWE Most Important Hardware Weaknesses (MIHW) 2025 update by narrowing the candidate search space. Specifically, our pipeline surfaced 411 of the 1,026 CVEs used for downstream MIHW analysis, thereby reducing expert workload and accelerating evidence gathering. These results establish LLM-HyPZ as the first data-driven, scalable approach for systematically discovering hardware vulnerabilities, thereby bridging the gap between expert knowledge and real-world vulnerability evidence.</description>

      <title>Virtual Reality, Real Problems: A Longitudinal Security Analysis of VR Firmware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) technology is rapidly growing in recent years. VR devices such as Meta Quest 3 utilize numerous sensors to collect users' data to provide an immersive experience. Due to the extensive data collection and the immersive nature, the security of VR devices is paramount. Leading VR devices often adopt and customize Android systems, which makes them susceptible to both Android-based vulnerabilities and new issues introduced by VR-specific customizations (e.g., system services to support continuous head and hand tracking). While prior work has extensively examined the security properties of the Android software stack, how these security properties hold for VR systems remains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of VR firmware. We collect over 300 versions of VR firmware from two major vendors, Quest and Pico, and perform a longitudinal analysis across the kernel layer, the system binary and library layer, and the application layer. We have identified several security issues in these VR firmware, including missing kernel-level security features, insufficient binary hardening, inconsistent permission enforcement, and inadequate SELinux policy enforcement. Based on our findings, we synthesize recommendations for VR vendors to improve security and trust for VR devices. This paper will act as an important security resource for VR developers, users, and vendors, and will also direct future advancements in secure VR ecosystem.</description>

      <title>X-PRINT:Platform-Agnostic and Scalable Fine-Grained Encrypted Traffic Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although encryption protocols such as TLS are widely de-ployed,side-channel metadata in encrypted traffic still reveals patterns that allow application and behavior inference.How-ever,existing fine-grained fingerprinting approaches face two key limitations:(i)reliance on platform-dependent charac-teristics,which restricts generalization across heterogeneous platforms,and(ii)poor scalability for fine-grained behavior identification in open-world settings.
  In this paper,we present X-PRINT,the first server-centric,URI-based framework for cross-platform fine-grained encrypted-traffic fingerprinting.X-PRINT systematically demonstrates that backend URI invocation patterns can serve as platform-agnostic invariants and are effective for mod-eling fine-grained behaviors.To achieve robust identifica-tion,X-PRINT further leverages temporally structured URI maps for behavior inference and emphasizes the exclusion of platform-or application-specific private URIs to handle unseen cases,thereby improving reliability in open-world and cross-platform settings.Extensive experiments across diverse cross-platform and open-world settings show that X-PRINT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in fine-grained fingerprint-ing and exhibits strong scalability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Bayesian and Multi-Objective Decision Support for Real-Time Cyber-Physical Incident Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research proposes a real-time, adaptive decision-support framework for mitigating cyber incidents in cyber-physical systems, developed in response to an increasing reliance on these systems within critical infrastructure and evolving adversarial tactics. Existing decision-support systems often fall short in accounting for multi-agent, multi-path attacks and trade-offs between safety and operational continuity. To address this, our framework integrates hierarchical system modelling with Bayesian probabilistic reasoning, constructing Bayesian Network Graphs from system architecture and vulnerability data. Models are encoded using a Domain Specific Language to enhance computational efficiency and support dynamic updates. In our approach, we use a hybrid exposure probability estimation framework, which combines Exploit Prediction Scoring System and Common Vulnerability Scoring System scores via Bayesian confidence calibration to handle epistemic uncertainty caused by incomplete or heterogeneous vulnerability metadata. Mitigation recommendations are generated as countermeasure portfolios, refined using multi-objective optimisation to identify Pareto-optimal strategies balancing attack likelihood, impact severity, and system availability. To accommodate time- and resource-constrained incident response, frequency-based heuristics are applied to prioritise countermeasures across the optimised portfolios. The framework was evaluated through three representative cyber-physical attack scenarios, demonstrating its versatility in handling complex adversarial behaviours under real-time response constraints. The results affirm its utility in operational contexts and highlight the robustness of our proposed approach across diverse threat environments.</description>

      <title>MAESTROCUT: Dynamic, Noise-Adaptive, and Secure Quantum Circuit Cutting on Near-Term Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MaestroCut, a closed-loop framework for quantum circuit cutting that adapts partitioning and shot allocation to device drift and workload variation. MaestroCut tracks a variance proxy in real time, triggers re-cutting when accuracy degrades, and routes shots using topology-aware priors. An online estimator cascade (MLE, Bayesian, GP-assisted) selects the lowest-error reconstruction within a fixed budget. Tier-1 simulations show consistent variance contraction and reduced mean-squared error versus uniform and proportional baselines. Tier-2 emulation with realistic queueing and noise demonstrates stable latency targets, high reliability, and ~1% software overhead under stress scenarios. These results indicate that adaptive circuit cutting can provide accuracy and efficiency improvements with minimal operational cost on near-term hardware.</description>

      <title>Adaptive t Design Dummy-Gate Obfuscation for Cryogenic Scale Enforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud quantum services can reveal circuit structure and timing through scheduler metadata, latency patterns, and co-tenant interference. We introduce NADGO (Noise-Adaptive Dummy-Gate Obfuscation), a scheduling and obfuscation stack that enforces operational privacy for gate-model workloads by applying per-interval limits on observable information leakage. To support confidentiality and fair multi-tenancy, operators require a method to audit compliance at acceptable overheads. NADGO combines: (i) hardware-aware t-design padding for structured cover traffic, (ii) particle-filter timing randomization to mask queue patterns, (iii) CASQUE subcircuit routing across heterogeneous backends, and (iv) a per-interval leakage estimator with locked calibration artifacts and a dual-threshold kill-switch. We prototype the approach on a 4-qubit superconducting tile with cryo-CMOS control and evaluate both depth-varied local-random circuits and small QAOA instances. Monitoring runs at a 6.3 microsecond control interval, and per-interval decisions are recorded in an append-only, hash-chained audit log. Across Monte Carlo (Tier 1) and cloud-hardware emulation (Tier 2) evaluations, NADGO maintains leakage within budget in nominal operation (interval-abort rate below 1 percent) and under attack yields high separation with concentrated aborts. At matched leakage targets, microbenchmarks indicate lower latency and cryogenic power consumption than static padding, while end-to-end workloads maintain competitive cost envelopes.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Effectiveness of LoRA-FP for Seamless Transfer Implantation of Fingerprints in Downstream Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), safeguarding intellectual property (IP) has become increasingly critical. To address the challenges of high costs and potential contamination in fingerprint integration, we propose LoRA-FP, a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that embeds backdoor fingerprints into LoRA adapters through constrained fine-tuning. This design enables seamless fingerprint transplantation via parameter fusion, eliminating the need for full-parameter updates while preserving model integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that LoRA-FP not only significantly reduces computational overhead compared to conventional approaches but also achieves superior robustness across diverse scenarios, including incremental training and model fusion. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/Xuzhenhua55/LoRA-FP.</description>

      <title>VULSOVER: Vulnerability Detection via LLM-Driven Constraint Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional vulnerability detection methods rely heavily on predefined rule matching, which often fails to capture vulnerabilities accurately. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), leveraging their ability to understand code semantics has emerged as a promising direction for achieving more accurate and efficient vulnerability detection. However, current LLM-based approaches face significant challenges: instability in model outputs, limitations in context length, and hallucination. As a result, many existing solutions either use LLMs merely to enrich predefined rule sets, thereby keeping the detection process fundamentally rule-based, or over-rely on them, leading to poor robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a constraint-solving approach powered by LLMs named VULSOLVER. By modeling vulnerability detection as a constraint-solving problem, and by integrating static application security testing (SAST) with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs, our method enables the LLM to act like a professional human security expert. We assess VULSOLVER on the OWASP Benchmark (1,023 labeled samples), achieving 96.29% accuracy, 96.55% F1-score, and 100% recall. Applied to popular GitHub repositories, VULSOLVER also identified 15 previously unknown high-severity vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.5-9.8), demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world security analysis.</description>

      <title>Hybrid AI-Driven Intrusion Detection: Framework Leveraging Novel Feature Selection for Enhanced Network Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, safeguarding network infrastructures against cyberattacks has become a critical priority. This research presents an innovative AI-driven real-time intrusion detection framework designed to enhance network security, particularly in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Cloud Computing (CC) environments. The system employs classical machine learning models, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors, optimized through the novel Energy Valley Optimization (EVO) method using the NSL-KDD dataset. Feature selection significantly reduced the number of input features from 42 to 18 while maintaining strong detection capabilities. The proposed system achieved 98.95 percent accuracy with Decision Tree, 98.47 percent with K-Nearest Neighbors, and 88.84 percent with Logistic Regression. Moreover, high precision, recall, and F1-scores were attained across all classifiers while substantially reducing training and testing times, making the framework highly suitable for real-time applications. To ensure fair detection across diverse attack types, dataset balancing via downsampling was applied to address class imbalance challenges. This investigation focuses on the significance of advancing intrusion detection systems in cloud computing and WSNs. Overall, this work advances secure communications by delivering a scalable, low-latency, and high-accuracy intrusion detection solution aligned with the latest trends in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and real-time digital networks</description>

      <title>PREE: Towards Harmless and Adaptive Fingerprint Editing in Large Language Models via Knowledge Prefix Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the intellectual property protection challenges in commercial deployment of large language models (LLMs), existing black-box fingerprinting techniques face dual challenges from incremental fine-tuning erasure and feature-space defense due to their reliance on overfitting high-perplexity trigger patterns. Recent work has revealed that model editing in the fingerprinting domain offers distinct advantages, including significantly lower false positive rates, enhanced harmlessness, and superior robustness. Building on this foundation, this paper innovatively proposes a $\textbf{Pr}$efix-$\textbf{e}$nhanced Fingerprint $\textbf{E}$diting Framework (PREE), which encodes copyright information into parameter offsets through dual-channel knowledge edit to achieve covert embedding of fingerprint features. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves the 90\% trigger precision in mainstream architectures including LLaMA-3 and Qwen-2.5. The minimal parameter offset (change rate &lt; 0.03) effectively preserves original knowledge representation while demonstrating strong robustness against incremental fine-tuning and multi-dimensional defense strategies, maintaining zero false positive rate throughout evaluations.</description>

      <title>Clone What You Can't Steal: Black-Box LLM Replication via Logit Leakage and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical systems, facilitating tasks such as satellite operations, command-and-control, military decision support, and cyber defense. Many of these systems are accessed through application programming interfaces (APIs). When such APIs lack robust access controls, they can expose full or top-k logits, creating a significant and often overlooked attack surface. Prior art has mainly focused on reconstructing the output projection layer or distilling surface-level behaviors. However, regenerating a black-box model under tight query constraints remains underexplored. We address that gap by introducing a constrained replication pipeline that transforms partial logit leakage into a functional deployable substitute model clone. Our two-stage approach (i) reconstructs the output projection matrix by collecting top-k logits from under 10k black-box queries via singular value decomposition (SVD) over the logits, then (ii) distills the remaining architecture into compact student models with varying transformer depths, trained on an open source dataset. A 6-layer student recreates 97.6% of the 6-layer teacher model's hidden-state geometry, with only a 7.31% perplexity increase, and a 7.58 Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL). A 4-layer variant achieves 17.1% faster inference and 18.1% parameter reduction with comparable performance. The entire attack completes in under 24 graphics processing unit (GPU) hours and avoids triggering API rate-limit defenses. These results demonstrate how quickly a cost-limited adversary can clone an LLM, underscoring the urgent need for hardened inference APIs and secure on-premise defense deployments.</description>

      <title>Lightening the Load: A Cluster-Based Framework for A Lower-Overhead, Provable Website Fingerprinting Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Website fingerprinting (WF) attacks remain a significant threat to encrypted traffic, prompting the development of a wide range of defenses. Among these, two prominent classes are regularization-based defenses, which shape traffic using fixed padding rules, and supersequence-based approaches, which conceal traces among predefined patterns. In this work, we present a unified framework for designing an adaptive WF defense that combines the effectiveness of regularization with the provable security of supersequence-style grouping. The scheme first extracts behavioural patterns from traces and clusters them into (k,l)-diverse anonymity sets; an early-time-series classifier (adapted from ECDIRE) then switches from a conservative global set of regularization parameters to the lighter, set-specific parameters. We instantiate the design as Adaptive Tamaraw, a variant of Tamaraw that assigns padding parameters on a per-cluster basis while retaining its original information-theoretic guarantee. Comprehensive experiments on public real-world datasets confirm the benefits. By tuning k, operators can trade privacy for efficiency: in its high-privacy mode Adaptive Tamaraw pushes the bound on any attacker's accuracy below 30%, whereas in efficiency-centred settings it cuts total overhead by 99% compared with classic Tamaraw.</description>

      <title>Efficient and High-Accuracy Secure Two-Party Protocols for a Class of Functions with Real-number Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-party secret sharing scheme, values are typically encoded as unsigned integers $\mathsf{uint}(x)$, whereas real-world applications often require computations on signed real numbers $\mathsf{Real}(x)$. To enable secure evaluation of practical functions, it is essential to computing $\mathsf{Real}(x)$ from shared inputs, as protocols take shares as input. At USENIX'25, Guo et al. proposed an efficient method for computing signed integer values $\mathsf{int}(x)$ from shares, which can be extended to compute $\mathsf{Real}(x)$. However, their approach imposes a restrictive input constraint $|x| &lt; \frac{L}{3}$ for $x \in \mathbb{Z}_L$, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we significantly relax this constraint to $|x| &lt; B$ for any $B \leq \frac{L}{2}$, where $B = \frac{L}{2}$ corresponding to the natural representable range in $x \in \mathbb{Z}_L$. This relaxes the restrictions and enables the computation of $\mathsf{Real}(x)$ with loose or no input constraints. Building upon this foundation, we present a generalized framework for designing secure protocols for a broad class of functions, including integer division ($\lfloor \frac{x}{d} \rfloor$), trigonometric ($\sin(x)$) and exponential ($e^{-x}$) functions. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed protocols achieve both high efficiency and high accuracy. Notably, our protocol for evaluating $e^{-x}$ reduces communication costs to approximately 31% of those in SirNN (S&amp;P 21) and Bolt (S&amp;P 24), with runtime speedups of up to $5.53 \times$ and $3.09 \times$, respectively. In terms of accuracy, our protocol achieves a maximum ULP error of $1.435$, compared to $2.64$ for SirNN and $8.681$ for Bolt.</description>

      <title>Web Fraud Attacks Against LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the proliferation of applications built upon LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MAS), the security of Web links has become a critical concern in ensuring system reliability. Once an agent is induced to visit a malicious website, attackers can use it as a springboard to conduct diverse subsequent attacks, which will drastically expand the attack surface. In this paper, we propose Web Fraud Attacks, a novel type of attack aiming at inducing MAS to visit malicious websites. We design 11 representative attack variants that encompass domain name tampering (homoglyph deception, character substitution, etc.), link structure camouflage (sub-directory nesting, sub-domain grafting, parameter obfuscation, etc.), and other deceptive techniques tailored to exploit MAS's vulnerabilities in link validation. Through extensive experiments on these crafted attack vectors, we demonstrate that Web fraud attacks not only exhibit significant destructive potential across different MAS architectures but also possess a distinct advantage in evasion: they circumvent the need for complex input formats such as jailbreaking, which inherently carry higher exposure risks. These results underscore the importance of addressing Web fraud attacks in LLM-driven MAS, as their stealthiness and destructiveness pose non-negligible threats to system security and user safety.</description>

      <title>Practical and Private Hybrid ML Inference with Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contemporary cloud-based services, protecting users' sensitive data and ensuring the confidentiality of the server's model are critical. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) enables inference directly on encrypted inputs, but its practicality is hindered by expensive bootstrapping and inefficient approximations of non-linear activations. We introduce Safhire, a hybrid inference framework that executes linear layers under encryption on the server while offloading non-linearities to the client in plaintext. This design eliminates bootstrapping, supports exact activations, and significantly reduces computation. To safeguard model confidentiality despite client access to intermediate outputs, Safhire applies randomized shuffling, which obfuscates intermediate values and makes it practically impossible to reconstruct the model. To further reduce latency, Safhire incorporates advanced optimizations such as fast ciphertext packing and partial extraction. Evaluations on multiple standard models and datasets show that Safhire achieves 1.5X - 10.5X lower inference latency than Orion, a state-of-the-art baseline, with manageable communication overhead and comparable accuracy, thereby establishing the practicality of hybrid FHE inference.</description>

      <title>An Automated Attack Investigation Approach Leveraging Threat-Knowledge-Augmented Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are prolonged, stealthy intrusions by skilled adversaries that compromise high-value systems to steal data or disrupt operations. Reconstructing complete attack chains from massive, heterogeneous logs is essential for effective attack investigation, yet existing methods suffer from poor platform generality, limited generalization to evolving tactics, and an inability to produce analyst-ready reports. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong semantic understanding and summarization capabilities, but in this domain they struggle to capture the long-range, cross-log dependencies critical for accurate reconstruction.
  To solve these problems, we present an LLM-empowered attack investigation framework augmented with a dynamically adaptable Kill-Chain-aligned threat knowledge base. We organizes attack-relevant behaviors into stage-aware knowledge units enriched with semantic annotations, enabling the LLM to iteratively retrieve relevant intelligence, perform causal reasoning, and progressively expand the investigation context. This process reconstructs multi-phase attack scenarios and generates coherent, human-readable investigation reports. Evaluated on 15 attack scenarios spanning single-host and multi-host environments across Windows and Linux (over 4.3M log events, 7.2 GB of data), the system achieves an average True Positive Rate (TPR) of 97.1% and an average False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.2%, significantly outperforming the SOTA method ATLAS, which achieves an average TPR of 79.2% and an average FPR of 29.1%.</description>

      <title>Anomaly detection in network flows using unsupervised online machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, the volume of network traffic continues to grow, along with the frequency and sophistication of attacks. This scenario highlights the need for solutions capable of continuously adapting, since network behavior is dynamic and changes over time. This work presents an anomaly detection model for network flows using unsupervised machine learning with online learning capabilities. This approach allows the system to dynamically learn the normal behavior of the network and detect deviations without requiring labeled data, which is particularly useful in real-world environments where traffic is constantly changing and labeled data is scarce. The model was implemented using the River library with a One-Class SVM and evaluated on the NF-UNSW-NB15 dataset and its extended version v2, which contain network flows labeled with different attack categories. The results show an accuracy above 98%, a false positive rate below 3.1%, and a recall of 100% in the most advanced version of the dataset. In addition, the low processing time per flow (&lt;0.033 ms) demonstrates the feasibility of the approach for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>LiFeChain: Lightweight Blockchain for Secure and Efficient Federated Lifelong Learning in IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices constantly generates heterogeneous data streams, driving demand for continuous, decentralized intelligence. Federated Lifelong Learning (FLL) provides an ideal solution by incorporating federated and lifelong learning to overcome catastrophic forgetting. The extended lifecycle of FLL in IoT systems increases their vulnerability to persistent attacks, and these risks may be obscured by performance degradation caused by spatial-temporal data heterogeneity. Moreover, this problem is exacerbated by the standard single-server architecture, as its single point of failure makes it difficult to maintain a reliable audit trail for long-term threats. Blockchain provides a tamper-proof foundation for trustworthy FLL systems. Nevertheless, directly applying blockchain to FLL significantly increases computational and retrieval costs with the expansion of the knowledge base, slowing down the training on IoT devices. To address these challenges, we propose LiFeChain, a lightweight blockchain for secure and efficient federated lifelong learning by providing a tamper-resistant ledger with minimal on-chain disclosure and bidirectional verification. To the best of our knowledge, LiFeChain is the first blockchain tailored for FLL. LiFeChain incorporates two complementary mechanisms: the proof-of-model-correlation (PoMC) consensus on the server, which couples learning and unlearning mechanisms to mitigate negative transfer, and segmented zero-knowledge arbitration (Seg-ZA) on the client, which detects and arbitrates abnormal committee behavior without compromising privacy. LiFeChain is designed as a plug-and-play component that can be seamlessly integrated into existing FLL algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that LiFeChain not only enhances model performance against two long-term attacks but also sustains high efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>LLMHoney: A Real-Time SSH Honeypot with Large Language Model-Driven Dynamic Response Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cybersecurity honeypots are deception tools for engaging attackers and gather intelligence, but traditional low or medium-interaction honeypots often rely on static, pre-scripted interactions that can be easily identified by skilled adversaries. This Report presents LLMHoney, an SSH honeypot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate realistic, dynamic command outputs in real time. LLMHoney integrates a dictionary-based virtual file system to handle common commands with low latency while using LLMs for novel inputs, achieving a balance between authenticity and performance. We implemented LLMHoney using open-source LLMs and evaluated it on a testbed with 138 representative Linux commands. We report comprehensive metrics including accuracy (exact-match, Cosine Similarity, Jaro-Winkler Similarity, Levenshtein Similarity and BLEU score), response latency and memory overhead. We evaluate LLMHoney using multiple LLM backends ranging from 0.36B to 3.8B parameters, including both open-source models and a proprietary model(Gemini). Our experiments compare 13 different LLM variants; results show that Gemini-2.0 and moderately-sized models Qwen2.5:1.5B and Phi3:3.8B provide the most reliable and accurate responses, with mean latencies around 3 seconds, whereas smaller models often produce incorrect or out-of-character outputs. We also discuss how LLM integration improves honeypot realism and adaptability compared to traditional honeypots, as well as challenges such as occasional hallucinated outputs and increased resource usage. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-driven honeypots are a promising approach to enhance attacker engagement and collect richer threat intelligence.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving authentication for military 5G networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As 5G networks gain traction in defense applications, ensuring the privacy and integrity of the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol is critical. While 5G AKA improves upon previous generations by concealing subscriber identities, it remains vulnerable to replay-based synchronization and linkability threats under realistic adversary models. This paper provides a unified analysis of the standardized 5G AKA flow, identifying several vulnerabilities and highlighting how each exploits protocol behavior to compromise user privacy. To address these risks, we present five lightweight mitigation strategies. We demonstrate through prototype implementation and testing that these enhancements strengthen resilience against linkability attacks with minimal computational and signaling overhead. Among the solutions studied, those introducing a UE-generated nonce emerge as the most promising, effectively neutralizing the identified tracking and correlation attacks with negligible additional overhead. Integrating this extension as an optional feature to the standard 5G AKA protocol offers a backward-compatible, low-overhead path toward a more privacy-preserving authentication framework for both commercial and military 5G deployments.</description>

      <title>Insight-LLM: LLM-enhanced Multi-view Fusion in Insider Threat Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insider threat detection (ITD) requires analyzing sparse, heterogeneous user behavior. Existing ITD methods predominantly rely on single-view modeling, resulting in limited coverage and missed anomalies. While multi-view learning has shown promise in other domains, its direct application to ITD introduces significant challenges: scalability bottlenecks from independently trained sub-models, semantic misalignment across disparate feature spaces, and view imbalance that causes high-signal modalities to overshadow weaker ones. In this work, we present Insight-LLM, the first modular multi-view fusion framework specifically tailored for insider threat detection. Insight-LLM employs frozen, pre-nes, achieving state-of-the-art detection with low latency and parameter overhead.</description>

      <title>Securing Radiation Detection Systems with an Efficient TinyML-Based IDS for Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) play a vital role in ensuring public safety across various settings, from nuclear facilities to medical environments. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as data injection, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, ICMP floods, botnet attacks, privilege escalation, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Such threats could compromise the integrity and reliability of radiation measurements, posing significant public health and safety risks. This paper presents a new synthetic radiation dataset and an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for resource-constrained environments, bringing Machine Learning (ML) predictive capabilities closer to the sensing edge layer of critical infrastructure. Leveraging TinyML techniques, the proposed IDS employs an optimized XGBoost model enhanced with pruning, quantization, feature selection, and sampling. These TinyML techniques significantly reduce the size of the model and computational demands, enabling real-time intrusion detection on low-resource devices while maintaining a reasonable balance between efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Statistics-Friendly Confidentiality Protection for Establishment Data, with Applications to the QCEW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confidentiality for business data is an understudied area of disclosure avoidance, where legacy methods struggle to provide acceptable results. Modern formal privacy techniques designed for person-level data do not provide suitable confidentiality/utility trade-offs due to the highly skewed nature of business data and because extreme outlier records are often important contributors to query answers. In this paper, inspired by Gaussian Differential Privacy, we propose a novel confidentiality framework for business data with a focus on interpretability for policy makers. We propose two query-answering mechanisms and analyze new challenges that arise when noisy query answers are converted into confidentiality-preserving microdata. We evaluate our mechanisms on confidential Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) microdata and a public substitute dataset.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Intrusion Detection System for Safeguarding Radiation Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) are used to measure and detect abnormal levels of radioactive material in the environment. These systems are used in many applications to mitigate threats posed by high levels of radioactive material. However, these systems lack protection against malicious external attacks to modify the data. The novelty of applying Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in RDSs is a crucial element in safeguarding these critical infrastructures. While IDSs are widely used in networking environments to safeguard against various attacks, their application in RDSs is novel. A common attack on RDSs is Denial of Service (DoS), where the attacker aims to overwhelm the system, causing malfunctioning RDSs. This paper proposes an efficient Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS to detect anomalies in radiation data, focusing on DoS attacks. This work explores the use of sampling methods to create a simulated DoS attack based on a real radiation dataset, followed by an evaluation of various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), to detect DoS attacks on RDSs. LightGBM is emphasized for its superior accuracy and low computational resource consumption, making it particularly suitable for real-time intrusion detection. Additionally, model optimization and TinyML techniques, including feature selection, parallel execution, and random search methods, are used to improve the efficiency of the proposed IDS. Finally, an optimized and efficient LightGBM-based IDS is developed to achieve accurate intrusion detection for RDSs.</description>

      <title>AmphiKey: A Dual-Mode Secure Authenticated Key Encapsulation Protocol for Smart Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AmphiKey, a dual-mode post-quantum/traditional (PQ/T) hybrid authenticated key exchange mechanism (AKEM) has been designed to secure smart grid communications against both classical and quantum threats. AmphiKey offers two distinct operational modes within a single framework: an Authenticated Mode and a Deniable Mode. The Authenticated Mode employs a blackbox approach, combining ephemeral ML-KEM-768 and X25519 with long-term Raccoon DSA keys to provide forward secrecy and strong, non-repudiable authenticity. This design achieves "OR" confidentiality, where security holds if either of the KEMs is unbroken, and robust "AND" authenticity. For the signature operation, it leverages the 'masking-friendly' Raccoon digital signature (DSA), which is specifically designed for side-channel attack resistance, though this protection is localized to the signing key and does not provide deniability. In contrast, Deniable Mode provides deniable authentication, preserving privacy. The protocol used ML-KEM-768 (AKEM-1), Ephemeral X25519 (AKEM-2), Raccoon-based DSA (Rac) (compared performance to ML-DSA-65), and the Ascon cipher to deliver its security guarantees. Key contributions include providing a flexible protocol with enhanced security, optional deniability, and efficiency adapted to the diverse needs of the smart grid infrastructure. We present a comprehensive performance evaluation on a heterogeneous testbed featuring a powerful server and client (AMD Ryzen 5) and a resource-constrained client (Raspberry Pi). In efficient Deniable mode, the full handshake completes in 0.15 ms on the server and 0.41 ms on the Raspberry Pi client. In contrast, the Authenticated Mode is bottlenecked by the client-side signature generation; the handshake takes 4.8 ms for the Raspberry Pi client to initiate and 0.84 ms for the server to verify.</description>

      <title>Designing a Layered Framework to Secure Data via Improved Multi Stage Lightweight Cryptography in IoT Cloud Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel multi-layered hybrid security approach aimed at enhancing lightweight encryption for IoT-Cloud systems. The primary goal is to overcome limitations inherent in conventional solutions such as TPA, Blockchain, ECDSA and ZSS which often fall short in terms of data protection, computational efficiency and scalability. Our proposed method strategically refines and integrates these technologies to address their shortcomings while maximizing their individual strengths. By doing so we create a more reliable and high-performance framework for secure data exchange across heterogeneous environments. The model leverages the combined potential of emerging technologies, particularly Blockchain, IoT and Cloud computing which when effectively coordinated offer significant advancements in security architecture. The proposed framework consists of three core layers: (1) the H.E.EZ Layer which integrates improved versions of Hyperledger Fabric, Enc-Block and a hybrid ECDSA-ZSS scheme to improve encryption speed, scalability and reduce computational cost; (2) the Credential Management Layer independently verifying data integrity and authenticity; and (3) the Time and Auditing Layer designed to reduce traffic overhead and optimize performance across dynamic workloads. Evaluation results highlight that the proposed solution not only strengthens security but also significantly improves execution time, communication efficiency and system responsiveness, offering a robust path forward for next-generation IoT-Cloud infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Are Enterprises Ready for Quantum-Safe Cybersecurity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing threatens to undermine classical cryptography by breaking widely deployed encryption and signature schemes. This paper examines enterprise readiness for quantum-safe cybersecurity through three perspectives: (i) the technologist view, assessing the maturity of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD); (ii) the enterprise (CISO/CIO) view, analyzing organizational awareness, risk management, and operational barriers; and (iii) the threat actor view, evaluating the evolving quantum threat and the urgency of migration. Using recent standards (e.g., NIST's 2024 PQC algorithms), industry surveys, and threat intelligence, we synthesize findings via a SWOT analysis to map strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Results indicate uneven and generally insufficient preparedness: while PQC standards and niche QKD deployments signal technical progress, fewer than 5\% of enterprises have formal quantum-transition plans, and many underestimate "harvest now, decrypt later" risks. Financial, telecom, and government sectors have begun migration, but most industries remain exploratory or stalled by costs, complexity, and skills gaps. Expert consensus places cryptanalytically relevant quantum computers in the 2030s, yet delayed preparation could leave today's data vulnerable for decades. We recommend immediate steps: establishing crypto-agility, creating quantum transition roadmaps, prioritizing PQC deployment in high-value systems, and upskilling cybersecurity teams. A coordinated, proactive approach is essential to secure current and future digital assets in the quantum era.</description>

      <title>BOLT: Bandwidth-Optimized Lightning-Fast Oblivious Map powered by Secure HBM Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Trusted Execution Environments provide a strong foundation for secure cloud computing, they remain vulnerable to access pattern leakages. Oblivious Maps (OMAPs) mitigate this by fully hiding access patterns but suffer from high overhead due to randomized remapping and worst-case padding. We argue these costs are not fundamental. Modern accelerators featuring High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) offer a new opportunity: Vaswani et al. [OSDI'18] point out that eavesdropping on HBM is difficult -- even for physical attackers -- as its memory channels are sealed together with processor cores inside the same physical package. Later, Hunt et al. [NSDI'20] show that, with proper isolation, HBM can be turned into an unobservable region where both data and memory traces are hidden. This motivates a rethink of OMAP design with HBM-backed solutions to finally overcome their traditional performance limits. Building on these insights, we present BOLT, a Bandwidth Optimized, Lightning-fast OMAP accelerator that, for the first time, achieves O(1) + O((log log N)^2) bandwidth overhead. BOLT introduces three key innovations: (i) a new OMAP algorithm that leverages isolated HBM as an unobservable cache to accelerate oblivious access to large host memory; (ii) a self-hosted architecture that offloads execution and memory control from the host to mitigate CPU-side leakage; and (iii) tailored algorithm-architecture co-designs that maximize resource efficiency. We implement a prototype BOLT on a Xilinx U55C FPGA. Evaluations show that BOLT achieves up to 279x and 480x speedups in initialization and query time, respectively, over state-of-the-art OMAPs, including an industry implementation from Facebook.</description>

      <title>E-PhishGen: Unlocking Novel Research in Phishing Email Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every day, our inboxes are flooded with unsolicited emails, ranging between annoying spam to more subtle phishing scams. Unfortunately, despite abundant prior efforts proposing solutions achieving near-perfect accuracy, the reality is that countering malicious emails still remains an unsolved dilemma.
  This "open problem" paper carries out a critical assessment of scientific works in the context of phishing email detection. First, we focus on the benchmark datasets that have been used to assess the methods proposed in research. We find that most prior work relied on datasets containing emails that -- we argue -- are not representative of current trends, and mostly encompass the English language. Based on this finding, we then re-implement and re-assess a variety of detection methods reliant on machine learning (ML), including large-language models (LLM), and release all of our codebase -- an (unfortunately) uncommon practice in related research. We show that most such methods achieve near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same dataset -- a result which intrinsically hinders development (how can future research outperform methods that are already near perfect?). To foster the creation of "more challenging benchmarks" that reflect current phishing trends, we propose E-PhishGEN, an LLM-based (and privacy-savvy) framework to generate novel phishing-email datasets. We use our E-PhishGEN to create E-PhishLLM, a novel phishing-email detection dataset containing 16616 emails in three languages. We use E-PhishLLM to test the detectors we considered, showing a much lower performance than that achieved on existing benchmarks -- indicating a larger room for improvement. We also validate the quality of E-PhishLLM with a user study (n=30). To sum up, we show that phishing email detection is still an open problem -- and provide the means to tackle such a problem by future research.</description>

      <title>From CVE Entries to Verifiable Exploits: An Automated Multi-Agent Framework for Reproducing CVEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality datasets of real-world vulnerabilities and their corresponding verifiable exploits are crucial resources in software security research. Yet such resources remain scarce, as their creation demands intensive manual effort and deep security expertise. In this paper, we present CVE-GENIE, an automated, large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework designed to reproduce real-world vulnerabilities, provided in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) format, to enable creation of high-quality vulnerability datasets. Given a CVE entry as input, CVE-GENIE gathers the relevant resources of the CVE, automatically reconstructs the vulnerable environment, and (re)produces a verifiable exploit. Our systematic evaluation highlights the efficiency and robustness of CVE-GENIE's design and successfully reproduces approximately 51% (428 of 841) CVEs published in 2024-2025, complete with their verifiable exploits, at an average cost of $2.77 per CVE. Our pipeline offers a robust method to generate reproducible CVE benchmarks, valuable for diverse applications such as fuzzer evaluation, vulnerability patching, and assessing AI's security capabilities.</description>

      <title>Augmented Shuffle Differential Privacy Protocols for Large-Domain Categorical and Key-Value Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shuffle DP (Differential Privacy) protocols provide high accuracy and privacy by introducing a shuffler who randomly shuffles data in a distributed system. However, most shuffle DP protocols are vulnerable to two attacks: collusion attacks by the data collector and users and data poisoning attacks. A recent study addresses this issue by introducing an augmented shuffle DP protocol, where users do not add noise and the shuffler performs random sampling and dummy data addition. However, it focuses on frequency estimation over categorical data with a small domain and cannot be applied to a large domain due to prohibitively high communication and computational costs.
  In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing a novel augmented shuffle DP protocol called the FME (Filtering-with-Multiple-Encryption) protocol. Our FME protocol uses a hash function to filter out unpopular items and then accurately calculates frequencies for popular items. To perform this within one round of interaction between users and the shuffler, our protocol carefully communicates within a system using multiple encryption. We also apply our FME protocol to more advanced KV (Key-Value) statistics estimation with an additional technique to reduce bias. For both categorical and KV data, we prove that our protocol provides computational DP, high robustness to the above two attacks, accuracy, and efficiency. We show the effectiveness of our proposals through comparisons with twelve existing protocols.</description>

      <title>Targeted Physical Evasion Attacks in the Near-Infrared Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of attacks rely on infrared light sources or heat-absorbing material to imperceptibly fool systems into misinterpreting visual input in various image recognition applications. However, almost all existing approaches can only mount untargeted attacks and require heavy optimizations due to the use-case-specific constraints, such as location and shape. In this paper, we propose a novel, stealthy, and cost-effective attack to generate both targeted and untargeted adversarial infrared perturbations. By projecting perturbations from a transparent film onto the target object with an off-the-shelf infrared flashlight, our approach is the first to reliably mount laser-free targeted attacks in the infrared domain. Extensive experiments on traffic signs in the digital and physical domains show that our approach is robust and yields higher attack success rates in various attack scenarios across bright lighting conditions, distances, and angles compared to prior work. Equally important, our attack is highly cost-effective, requiring less than US\$50 and a few tens of seconds for deployment. Finally, we propose a novel segmentation-based detection that thwarts our attack with an F1-score of up to 99%.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Future DDoS Attacks Using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper forecasts future Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using deep learning models. Although several studies address forecasting DDoS attacks, they remain relatively limited compared to detection-focused research. By studying the current trends and forecasting based on newer and updated datasets, mitigation plans against the attacks can be planned and formulated. The methodology used in this research work conforms to the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) model.</description>

      <title>From Attack Descriptions to Vulnerabilities: A Sentence Transformer-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of security, vulnerabilities frequently remain undetected even after their exploitation. In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly disclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) reports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is essential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with immediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is infeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14 state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate that the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior classification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was observed that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet model are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an attack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to those cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results revealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the MITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques to vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities related to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during which vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the development of more secure systems.</description>

      <title>Performance analysis of common browser extensions for cryptojacking detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers five extensions for Chromium-based browsers in order to determine how effective can browser-based defenses against cryptojacking available to regular users be. We've examined most popular extensions - MinerBlock, AdGuard AdBlocker, Easy Redirect &amp;&amp; Prevent Cryptojacking, CoinEater and Miners Shield, which claim to be designed specifically to identify and stop illegal cryptocurrency mining. An empirically confirmed dataset of 373 distinct cryptojacking-infected websites which was assembled during multi-stage procedure, was used to test those extensions. The results showed that all plugins in question had significant performance limits. Easy Redirect and Miners Shield only blocked 6 and 5 websites respectively, while MinerBlock had the greatest detection rate at only 27% (101/373 sites blocked). Most concerningly, despite promises of cryptojacking prevention, AdGuard (which has over 13 million users) and CoinEater were unable to identify any of the compromised websites. These results demonstrate serious flaws in cryptojacking detection products targeted for regular users, since even the best-performing specimen failed to detect 73% of attacks. The obvious difference between advertised capabilities and real performance highlights the urgent need for either accessibility improvements for laboratory-grade detection technologies that show 90%+ efficiency in controlled environment or fundamental upgrades to current commonly used extensions.</description>

      <title>A Gentle Introduction to Blind signatures: From RSA to Lattice-based Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind signatures were first introduced by David Chaum. They allow a user to have a message signed by a signer without revealing the message itself. This property is particularly useful in applications such as electronic voting and digital cash, where user anonymity is important. In a blind signature scheme, the user blinds their message before sending it to the signer, who signs the blinded message. The user then unblinds the signed message to obtain a valid signature that can be verified publicly, ensuring that the signer cannot trace the signed message back to the original unblinded version. A good analogy is placing the message inside an envelope and having the envelope signed. Once the envelope is opened, the signature remains valid for the enclosed message, ensuring that the content remains confidential.
  Such constructions provide anonymity and privacy to the user but given a practical quantum computer, the security of traditional crypto-systems providing such features will be broken. To address this, the development of quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols is essential for maintaining the security of digital transactions and data. Aligning with the same goal, this work aims to thoroughly review the background of lattice-based blind signatures. We start with the foundations of digital signatures in the classical settings and then move on to lattice-based constructions.</description>

      <title>Passwords and FIDO2 Are Meant To Be Secret: A Practical Secure Authentication Channel for Web Browsers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Password managers provide significant security benefits to users. However, malicious client-side scripts and browser extensions can steal passwords after the manager has autofilled them into the web page. In this paper, we extend prior work by Stock and Johns, showing how password autofill can be hardened to prevent these local attacks. We implement our design in the Firefox browser and conduct experiments demonstrating that our defense successfully protects passwords from XSS attacks and malicious extensions. We also show that our implementation is compatible with 97% of the Alexa top 1000 websites. Next, we generalize our design, creating a second defense that prevents recently discovered local attacks against the FIDO2 protocols. We implement this second defense into Firefox, demonstrating that it protects the FIDO2 protocol against XSS attacks and malicious extensions. This defense is compatible with all websites, though it does require a small change (2-3 lines) to web servers implementing FIDO2.</description>

      <title>Poisoned at Scale: A Scalable Audit Uncovers Hidden Scam Endpoints in Production LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become critical to modern software development, but their reliance on internet datasets for training introduces a significant security risk: the absorption and reproduction of malicious content. To evaluate this threat, this paper introduces a scalable, automated audit framework that synthesizes innocuous, developer-style prompts from known scam databases to query production LLMs and determine if they generate code containing harmful URLs. We conducted a large-scale evaluation across four production LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Scout, and DeepSeek-V3), and found a systemic vulnerability, with all tested models generating malicious code at a non-negligible rate. On average, 4.2\% of programs generated in our experiments contained malicious URLs. Crucially, this malicious code is often generated in response to benign prompts. We manually validate the prompts which cause all four LLMs to generate malicious code, and resulting in 177 innocuous prompts that trigger all models to produce harmful outputs. These results provide strong empirical evidence that the training data of production LLMs has been successfully poisoned at scale, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defense mechanisms and post-generation safety checks to mitigate the propagation of hidden security threats.</description>

      <title>Real-time ML-based Defense Against Malicious Payload in Reconfigurable Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing use of FPGAs in reconfigurable systems introducessecurity risks through malicious bitstreams that could cause denial-of-service (DoS), data leakage, or covert attacks. We investigated chip-level hardware malicious payload in embedded systems and proposed a supervised machine learning method to detect malicious bitstreams via static byte-level features. Our approach diverges from existing methods by analyzing bitstreams directly at the binary level, enabling real-time detection without requiring access to source code or netlists. Bitstreams were sourced from state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks and re-engineered to target the Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA Development Board. Our dataset included 122 samples of benign and malicious configurations. The data were vectorized using byte frequency analysis, compressed using TSVD, and balanced using SMOTE to address class imbalance. The evaluated classifiers demonstrated that Random Forest achieved a macro F1-score of 0.97, underscoring the viability of real-time Trojan detection on resource-constrained systems. The final model was serialized and successfully deployed via PYNQ to enable integrated bitstream analysis.</description>

      <title>A Survey: Towards Privacy and Security in Mobile Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing diverse fields such as healthcare, finance, and education with their ability to perform advanced natural language processing tasks on-the-go. However, the deployment of these models in mobile and edge environments introduces significant challenges related to privacy and security due to their resource-intensive nature and the sensitivity of the data they process. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of privacy and security issues associated with mobile LLMs, systematically categorizing existing solutions such as differential privacy, federated learning, and prompt encryption. Furthermore, we analyze vulnerabilities unique to mobile LLMs, including adversarial attacks, membership inference, and side-channel attacks, offering an in-depth comparison of their effectiveness and limitations. Despite recent advancements, mobile LLMs face unique hurdles in achieving robust security while maintaining efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To bridge this gap, we propose potential applications, discuss open challenges, and suggest future research directions, paving the way for the development of trustworthy, privacy-compliant, and scalable mobile LLM systems.</description>

      <title>APEX: Automatic Event Sequence Generation for Android Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the event driven nature and the versatility of GUI designs in Android programs, it is challenging to generate event sequences with adequate code coverage within a reasonable time. A common approach to handle this issue is to rely on GUI models to generate event sequences. These sequences can be effective in covering GUI states, but inconsistent in exposing program behaviors that require specific inputs. A major obstacle to generate such specific inputs is the lack of a systematic GUI exploration process to accommodate the analysis requirements. In this paper, we introduce Android Path Explorer (APEX), a systematic input generation framework using concolic execution. APEX addresses the limitations of model-based sequence generation by using concolic execution to discover the data dependencies of GUI state transitions. Moreover, concolic execution is also used to prioritize events during the exploration of GUI, which leads to a more robust model and accurate input generation. The key novelty of APEX is that concolic execution is not only used to construct event sequences, but also used to traverse the GUI more systematically. As such, our experimental results show that APEX can be used to generate a set of event sequences that achieve high code coverage, as well as event sequences that reach specific targets.</description>

      <title>Enabling decision support over confidential data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling automated decision-making processes by leveraging data-driven analysis is a core goal of Decision Support Systems (DSSs). In multi-party scenarios where decisions rely on distributed and sensitive data, though, ensuring confidentiality, verifiability, transparency, integrity, and consistency at once remains an open challenge for DSSs. To tackle this multi-faceted problem, we propose the Secure Platform for Automated decision Rules via Trusted Applications (SPARTA) approach. By leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) at its core, SPARTA ensures that the decision logic and the data remain protected. To guarantee transparency and consistency of the decision process, SPARTA encodes decision rules into verifiable software objects deployed within TEEs. To maintain the confidentiality of the outcomes while keeping the information integrity, SPARTA employs cryptography techniques on notarized data based on user-definable access policies. Based on experiments conducted on public benchmarks and synthetic data, we find our approach to be practically applicable and scalable.</description>

      <title>A Fluid Antenna Enabled Physical Layer Key Generation for Next-G Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a promising physical layer security technique, physical layer key generation (PLKG) enables legitimate users to obtain secret keys from wireless channel without security infrastructures. However, in harsh propagation environments, the channel characteristic becomes unsatisfactory, the key generation rate (KGR) is significantly deteriorated. In this paper, we propose a novel fluid antenna (FA) enabled PLKG system to address this challenge. Specifically, we first derive the closed-form expression of the KGR for FA array, and then jointly optimize the precoding matrix and the antenna positions via a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Next, to further reduce the computational complexity of the optimization procedure, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which combines the projected gradient descent (PGD) and the PSO. Simulation results demonstrate that by exploiting the additional spatial degree of freedom (DoF), our FA enabled PLKG system is superior to the benchmarks, such as the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). It is worth highlighting that compared to the conventional uniform planar antenna (UPA), the FA enabled PLKG achieves a 35.42\% KGR performance improvement under PSO algorithm and a 67.73\% KGR performance improvement under AO algorithm, respectively.</description>

      <title>CryptoFace: End-to-End Encrypted Face Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Face recognition is central to many authentication, security, and personalized applications. Yet, it suffers from significant privacy risks, particularly arising from unauthorized access to sensitive biometric data. This paper introduces CryptoFace, the first end-to-end encrypted face recognition system with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). It enables secure processing of facial data across all stages of a face-recognition process--feature extraction, storage, and matching--without exposing raw images or features. We introduce a mixture of shallow patch convolutional networks to support higher-dimensional tensors via patch-based processing while reducing the multiplicative depth and, thus, inference latency. Parallel FHE evaluation of these networks ensures near-resolution-independent latency. On standard face recognition benchmarks, CryptoFace significantly accelerates inference and increases verification accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art FHE neural networks adapted for face recognition. CryptoFace will facilitate secure face recognition systems requiring robust and provable security. The code is available at https://github.com/human-analysis/CryptoFace.</description>

      <title>The Resurgence of GCG Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2) prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for more robust adversarial evaluation.</description>

      <title>FedThief: Harming Others to Benefit Oneself in Self-Centered Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In federated learning, participants' uploaded model updates cannot be directly verified, leaving the system vulnerable to malicious attacks. Existing attack strategies have adversaries upload tampered model updates to degrade the global model's performance. However, attackers also degrade their own private models, gaining no advantage. In real-world scenarios, attackers are driven by self-centered motives: their goal is to gain a competitive advantage by developing a model that outperforms those of other participants, not merely to cause disruption. In this paper, we study a novel Self-Centered Federated Learning (SCFL) attack paradigm, in which attackers not only degrade the performance of the global model through attacks but also enhance their own models within the federated learning process. We propose a framework named FedThief, which degrades the performance of the global model by uploading modified content during the upload stage. At the same time, it enhances the private model's performance through divergence-aware ensemble techniques, where "divergence" quantifies the deviation between private and global models, that integrate global updates and local knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively degrades the global model performance while allowing the attacker to obtain an ensemble model that significantly outperforms the global model.</description>

      <title>AMCR: A Framework for Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks, significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns, researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms, ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis, and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks, offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of generative models.</description>

      <title>Secure and Scalable Face Retrieval via Cancelable Product Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and (ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.</description>

      <title>Throttling Web Agents Using Reasoning Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time, web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling. We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However, we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.</description>

      <title>An intrusion detection system in internet of things using grasshopper optimization algorithm and machine learning algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a foundational paradigm supporting a range of applications, including healthcare, education, agriculture, smart homes, and, more recently, enterprise systems. However, significant advancements in IoT networks have been impeded by security vulnerabilities and threats that, if left unaddressed, could hinder the deployment and operation of IoT based systems. Detecting unwanted activities within the IoT is crucial, as it directly impacts confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Consequently, intrusion detection has become a fundamental research area and the focus of numerous studies. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is essential to the IoTs alarm mechanisms, enabling effective security management. This paper examines IoT security and introduces an intelligent two-layer intrusion detection system for IoT. Machine learning techniques power the system's intelligence, with a two layer structure enhancing intrusion detection. By selecting essential features, the system maintains detection accuracy while minimizing processing overhead. The proposed method for intrusion detection in IoT is implemented in two phases. In the first phase, the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) is applied for feature selection. In the second phase, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used to detect intrusions. The method was implemented in MATLAB, and the NSLKDD dataset was used for evaluation. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves accuracy compared to other approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum Statistical Witness Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical witness indistinguishability is a relaxation of statistical zero-knowledge which guarantees that the transcript of an interactive proof reveals no information about which valid witness the prover used to generate it. In this paper we define and initiate the study of QSWI, the class of problems with quantum statistically witness indistinguishable proofs.
  Using inherently quantum techniques from Kobayashi (TCC 2008), we prove that any problem with an honest-verifier quantum statistically witness indistinguishable proof has a 3-message public-coin malicious-verifier quantum statistically witness indistinguishable proof. There is no known analogue of this result for classical statistical witness indistinguishability. As a corollary, our result implies SWI is contained in QSWI.
  Additionally, we extend the work of Bitansky et al. (STOC 2023) to show that quantum batch proofs imply quantum statistically witness indistinguishable proofs with inverse-polynomial witness indistinguishability error.</description>

      <title>See No Evil: Adversarial Attacks Against Linguistic-Visual Association in Referring Multi-Object Tracking Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02028v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction, temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations. Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames. We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability, inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Data Publication: A Bilevel Optimization Framework with Curvature-Guided Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in terms of sample quality and diversity.</description>

Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset for malware analysis, comprising over \textbf{200M} Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a foundational benchmark for the community. The dataset and tools are publicly available at https://higraph.org.</description>

      <title>Prefix Siphoning: Exploiting LSM-Tree Range Filters For Information Disclosure (Full Version)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04602v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Key-value stores typically leave access control to the systems for which they act as storage engines. Unfortunately, attackers may circumvent such read access controls via timing attacks on the key-value store, which use differences in query response times to glean information about stored data.
  To date, key-value store timing attacks have aimed to disclose stored values and have exploited external mechanisms that can be disabled for protection. In this paper, we point out that key disclosure is also a security threat -- and demonstrate key disclosure timing attacks that exploit mechanisms of the key-value store itself.
  We target LSM-tree based key-value stores utilizing range filters, which have been recently proposed to optimize LSM-tree range queries. We analyze the impact of the range filters SuRF and prefix Bloom filter on LSM-trees through a security lens, and show that they enable a key disclosure timing attack, which we call prefix siphoning. Prefix siphoning successfully leverages benign queries for non-present keys to identify prefixes of actual keys -- and in some cases, full keys -- in scenarios where brute force searching for keys (via exhaustive enumeration or random guesses) is infeasible.</description>

      <title>An Information-Flow Perspective on Algorithmic Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents insights gained by investigating the relationship between algorithmic fairness and the concept of secure information flow. The problem of enforcing secure information flow is well-studied in the context of information security: If secret information may "flow" through an algorithm or program in such a way that it can influence the program's output, then that is considered insecure information flow as attackers could potentially observe (parts of) the secret.
  There is a strong correspondence between secure information flow and algorithmic fairness: if protected attributes such as race, gender, or age are treated as secret program inputs, then secure information flow means that these ``secret'' attributes cannot influence the result of a program. While most research in algorithmic fairness evaluation concentrates on studying the impact of algorithms (often treating the algorithm as a black-box), the concepts derived from information flow can be used both for the analysis of disparate treatment as well as disparate impact w.r.t. a structural causal model.
  In this paper, we examine the relationship between quantitative as well as qualitative information-flow properties and fairness. Moreover, based on this duality, we derive a new quantitative notion of fairness called fairness spread, which can be easily analyzed using quantitative information flow and which strongly relates to counterfactual fairness. We demonstrate that off-the-shelf tools for information-flow properties can be used in order to formally analyze a program's algorithmic fairness properties, including the new notion of fairness spread as well as established notions such as demographic parity.</description>

      <title>Redesigning Traffic Signs to Mitigate Machine-Learning Patch Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic-Sign Recognition (TSR) is a critical safety component for autonomous driving. Unfortunately, however, past work has highlighted the vulnerability of TSR models to physical-world attacks, through low-cost, easily deployable adversarial patches leading to misclassification. To mitigate these threats, most defenses focus on altering the training process or modifying the inference procedure. Still, while these approaches improve adversarial robustness, TSR remains susceptible to attacks attaining substantial success rates.
  To further the adversarial robustness of TSR, this work offers a novel approach that redefines traffic-sign designs to create signs that promote robustness while remaining interpretable to humans. Our framework takes three inputs: (1) A traffic-sign standard along with modifiable features and associated constraints; (2) A state-of-the-art adversarial training method; and (3) A function for efficiently synthesizing realistic traffic-sign images. Using these user-defined inputs, the framework emits an optimized traffic-sign standard such that traffic signs generated per this standard enable training TSR models with increased adversarial robustness.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework via a concrete implementation, where we allow modifying the pictograms (i.e., symbols) and colors of traffic signs. The results show substantial improvements in robustness -- with gains of up to 16.33%--24.58% in robust accuracy over state-of-the-art methods -- while benign accuracy is even improved. Importantly, a user study also confirms that the redesigned traffic signs remain easily recognizable and to human observers. Overall, the results highlight that carefully redesigning traffic signs can significantly enhance TSR system robustness without compromising human interpretability.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Cyber Security Through Predictive Analytics: Real-Time Threat Detection and Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates the application of predictive analytics for real-time cyber-attack detection and response, focusing on how statistical and machine learning methods can improve decision-making in Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Using a curated network-traffic dataset of 2,000 records, we analyzed key features such as attack type, packet length, anomaly scores, protocol usage, and geo-location patterns to assess their predictive value. Findings indicate that attack type has a measurable influence on response actions, while basic header metrics alone lack the precision needed for accurate classification. These results highlight the importance of incorporating richer contextual features - such as user behavior, asset criticality, and temporal patterns - into predictive models. By integrating such features into operational pipelines, organizations can improve early threat detection, reduce false positives, and optimize resource allocation. This research contributes actionable insights for advancing proactive, data-driven cyber defense strategies and outlines directions for future implementation in live SOC environments.</description>

      <title>KeySpace: Enhancing Public Key Infrastructure for Interplanetary Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10963v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the use of satellites continues to grow, new networking paradigms are emerging to support the scale and long distance communication inherent to these networks. In particular, interplanetary communication relays connect distant network segments together, but result in a sparsely connected network with long-distance links that are frequently interrupted. In this new context, traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) becomes difficult to implement, due to the impossibility of low-latency queries to a central authority. This paper addresses the challenge of implementing PKI in these complex networks, identifying the essential goals and requirements.
  Using these requirements, we develop the KeySpace framework, comprising a set of standardized experiments and metrics for comparing PKI systems across various network topologies, evaluating their performance and security. This enables the testing of different protocols and configurations in a standard, repeatable manner, so that improvements can be more fairly tested and clearly demonstrated. We use KeySpace to test two standard PKI protocols in use in terrestrial networks (OCSP and CRLs), demonstrating for the first time that both can be effectively utilized even in interplanetary networks with high latency and frequent interruptions, provided authority is properly distributed throughout the network. Finally, we propose and evaluate a number of novel techniques extending standard OCSP to improve the overhead of connection establishment, reduce link congestion, and limit the reach of an attacker with a compromised key. Using KeySpace we validate these claims, demonstrating their improved performance over the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Efficient Detection of Toxic Prompts in Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini have significantly advanced natural language processing, enabling various applications such as chatbots and automated content generation. However, these models can be exploited by malicious individuals who craft toxic prompts to elicit harmful or unethical responses. These individuals often employ jailbreaking techniques to bypass safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for robust toxic prompt detection methods. Existing detection techniques, both blackbox and whitebox, face challenges related to the diversity of toxic prompts, scalability, and computational efficiency. In response, we propose ToxicDetector, a lightweight greybox method designed to efficiently detect toxic prompts in LLMs. ToxicDetector leverages LLMs to create toxic concept prompts, uses embedding vectors to form feature vectors, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for prompt classification. Our evaluation on various versions of the LLama models, Gemma-2, and multiple datasets demonstrates that ToxicDetector achieves a high accuracy of 96.39\% and a low false positive rate of 2.00\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ToxicDetector's processing time of 0.0780 seconds per prompt makes it highly suitable for real-time applications. ToxicDetector achieves high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it a practical method for toxic prompt detection in LLMs.</description>

      <title>Breaking Bad: How Compilers Break Constant-Time Implementations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The implementations of most hardened cryptographic libraries use defensive programming techniques for side-channel resistance. These techniques are usually specified as guidelines to developers on specific code patterns to use or avoid. Examples include performing arithmetic operations to choose between two variables instead of executing a secret-dependent branch. However, such techniques are only meaningful if they persist across compilation. In this paper, we investigate how optimizations used by modern compilers break the protections introduced by defensive programming techniques. Specifically, how compilers break high-level constant-time implementations used to mitigate timing side-channel attacks. We run a large-scale experiment to see if such compiler-induced issues manifest in state-of-the-art cryptographic libraries. We develop a tool that can profile virtually any architecture, and we use it to run trace-based dynamic analysis on 44,604 different targets. Particularly, we focus on the most widely deployed cryptographic libraries, which aim to provide side-channel resistance. We are able to evaluate whether their claims hold across various CPU architectures, including x86-64, x86-i386, armv7, aarch64, RISC-V, and MIPS-32. Our large-scale study reveals that several compiler-induced secret-dependent operations occur within some of the most highly regarded hardened cryptographic libraries. To the best of our knowledge, such findings represent the first time these issues have been observed in the wild. One of the key takeaways of this paper is that the state-of-the-art defensive programming techniques employed for side-channel resistance are still inadequate, incomplete, and bound to fail when paired with the optimizations that compilers continuously introduce.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Aware Vulnerability Detection in Smart Contract Bytecodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of vulnerabilities in smart contracts remains a significant challenge. While numerous tools are available for analyzing smart contracts in source code, only about 1.79% of smart contracts on Ethereum are open-source. For existing tools that target bytecodes, most of them only consider the semantic logic context and disregard function interface information in the bytecodes. In this paper, we propose COBRA, a novel framework that integrates semantic context and function interfaces to detect vulnerabilities in bytecodes of the smart contract. To our best knowledge, COBRA is the first framework that combines these two features. Moreover, to infer the function signatures that are not present in signature databases, we propose SRIF, automatically learn the rules of function signatures from the smart contract bytecodes. The bytecodes associated with the function signatures are collected by constructing a control flow graph (CFG) for the SRIF training. We optimize the semantic context using the operation code in the static single assignment (SSA) format. Finally, we integrate the context and function interface representations in the latent space as the contract feature embedding. The contract features in the hidden space are decoded for vulnerability classifications with a decoder and attention module. Experimental results demonstrate that SRIF can achieve 94.76% F1-score for function signature inference. Furthermore, when the ground truth ABI exists, COBRA achieves 93.45% F1-score for vulnerability classification. In the absence of ABI, the inferred function feature fills the encoder, and the system accomplishes an 89.46% recall rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a blockchain-based insurance scheme that integrates parametric and collaborative elements. A pool of investors, referred to as surplus providers, locks funds in a smart contract, enabling blockchain users to underwrite parametric insurance contracts. These contracts automatically trigger compensation when predefined conditions are met. The collaborative aspect is embodied in the generation of tokens, which are distributed to surplus providers. These tokens represent each participant's share of the surplus and grant voting rights for management decisions. The smart contract is developed in Solidity, a high-level programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with data processing and analysis conducted using Python. In addition, open-source code is provided and main research challenges are identified, so that further research can be carried out to overcome limitations of this first proof of concept.</description>

      <title>PBI-Attack: Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for Toxicity Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05892v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the vulnerabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to jailbreak attacks is essential for their responsible real-world deployment. Most previous work requires access to model gradients, or is based on human knowledge (prompt engineering) to complete jailbreak, and they hardly consider the interaction of images and text, resulting in inability to jailbreak in black box scenarios or poor performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for toxicity maximization, referred to as PBI-Attack. Our method begins by extracting malicious features from a harmful corpus using an alternative LVLM and embedding these features into a benign image as prior information. Subsequently, we enhance these features through bidirectional cross-modal interaction optimization, which iteratively optimizes the bimodal perturbations in an alternating manner through greedy search, aiming to maximize the toxicity of the generated response. The toxicity level is quantified using a well-trained evaluation model. Experiments demonstrate that PBI-Attack outperforms previous state-of-the-art jailbreak methods, achieving an average attack success rate of 92.5% across three open-source LVLMs and around 67.3% on three closed-source LVLMs. Disclaimer: This paper contains potentially disturbing and offensive content.</description>

      <title>A Trust-Centric Approach To Quantifying Maturity and Security in Internet Voting Protocols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voting is a cornerstone of collective participatory decision-making in contexts ranging from political elections to decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Despite the proliferation of internet voting protocols promising enhanced accessibility and efficiency, their evaluation and comparison are complicated by a lack of standardized criteria and unified definitions of security and maturity. Furthermore, socio-technical requirements by decision makers are not structurally taken into consideration when comparing internet voting systems. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a trust-centric maturity scoring framework to quantify the security and maturity of seventeen internet voting systems. A comprehensive trust model analysis is conducted for selected internet voting protocols, examining their security properties, trust assumptions, technical complexity, and practical usability. In this paper we propose the Internet Voting Maturity Framework (IVMF) which supports nuanced assessment that reflects real-world deployment concerns and aids decision-makers in selecting appropriate systems tailored to their specific use-case requirements. The framework is general enough to be applied to other systems, where the aspects of decentralization, trust, and security are crucial, such as digital identity, Ethereum layer-two scaling solutions, and federated data infrastructures. Its objective is to provide an extendable toolkit for policy makers and technology experts alike that normalizes technical and non-technical requirements on a univariate scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a global model using their local datasets while reinforcing data privacy, but it is prone to poisoning attacks. Existing defense mechanisms assume that clients' data are independent and identically distributed (IID), making them ineffective in real-world applications where data are non-IID. This paper presents FL-CLEANER, the first defense capable of filtering both byzantine and backdoor attackers' model updates in a non-IID FL environment. The originality of FL-CLEANER is twofold. First, it relies on a client confidence score derived from the reconstruction errors of each client's model activation maps for a given trigger set, with reconstruction errors obtained by means of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder trained according to a novel server-side strategy. Second, it uses an original ad-hoc trust propagation algorithm we propose. Based on previous client scores, it allows building a cluster of benign clients while flagging potential attackers. Experimental results on the datasets MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate the efficiency of FL-CLEANER against Byzantine attackers as well as to some state-of-the-art backdoors in non-IID scenarios; it achieves a close-to-zero (&lt;1%) benign client misclassification rate, even in the absence of an attack, and achieves strong performance compared to state of the art defenses.</description>

      <title>RewardDS: Privacy-Preserving Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models via Reward Driven Data Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) has attracted many individuals to fine-tune them for domain-specific tasks by uploading their data. However, in sensitive areas like healthcare and finance, privacy concerns often arise. One promising solution is to generate synthetic data with Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees to replace private data. However, these synthetic data contain significant flawed data, which are considered as noise. Existing solutions typically rely on naive filtering by comparing ROUGE-L scores or embedding similarities, which are ineffective in addressing the noise. To address this issue, we propose \textit{RewardDS}, a novel privacy-preserving framework that fine-tunes a reward proxy model and uses reward signals to guide the synthetic data generation. Our \textit{RewardDS} introduces two key modules, Reward Guided Filtering and Self-Optimizing Refinement, to both filter and refine the synthetic data, effectively mitigating the noise. Extensive experiments across medical, financial, and code generation domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Progent: Programmable Privilege Control for LLM Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM agents utilize Large Language Models as central components with diverse tools to complete various user tasks, but face significant security risks when interacting with external environments. Attackers can exploit these agents through various vectors, including indirect prompt injection, memory/knowledge base poisoning, and malicious tools, tricking agents into performing dangerous actions such as unauthorized financial transactions or data leakage. The core problem that enables attacks to succeed lies in over-privileged tool access. We introduce Progent, the first privilege control framework to secure LLM agents. Progent enforces security at the tool level by restricting agents to performing tool calls necessary for user tasks while blocking potentially malicious ones. Progent features a domain-specific language that allows for expressing fine-grained policies for controlling tool privileges, flexible fallback actions when calls are blocked, and dynamic policy updates to adapt to changing agent states. The framework operates deterministically at runtime, providing provable security guarantees. Thanks to our modular design, integrating Progent does not alter agent internals and only requires minimal changes to the existing agent implementation, enhancing its practicality and potential for widespread adoption. Our extensive evaluation across various agent use cases, using benchmarks like AgentDojo, ASB, and AgentPoison, demonstrates that Progent reduces attack success rates to 0%, while preserving agent utility and speed. Additionally, we show that LLMs can automatically generate effective policies, highlighting their potential for automating the process of writing Progent's security policies.</description>

      <title>One Shot Dominance: Knowledge Poisoning Attack on Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have shown improved performance in generating accurate responses. However, the dependence on external knowledge bases introduces potential security vulnerabilities, particularly when these knowledge bases are publicly accessible and modifiable. While previous studies have exposed knowledge poisoning risks in RAG systems, existing attack methods suffer from critical limitations: they either require injecting multiple poisoned documents (resulting in poor stealthiness) or can only function effectively on simplistic queries (limiting real-world applicability). This paper reveals a more realistic knowledge poisoning attack against RAG systems that achieves successful attacks by poisoning only a single document while remaining effective for complex multi-hop questions involving complex relationships between multiple elements. Our proposed AuthChain address three challenges to ensure the poisoned documents are reliably retrieved and trusted by the LLM, even against large knowledge bases and LLM's own knowledge. Extensive experiments across six popular LLMs demonstrate that AuthChain achieves significantly higher attack success rates while maintaining superior stealthiness against RAG defense mechanisms compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>ORCAS: Obfuscation-Resilient Binary Code Similarity Analysis using Dominance Enhanced Semantic Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) serves as a foundational technique for binary analysis tasks such as vulnerability detection and malware identification. Existing graph based BCSA approaches capture more binary code semantics and demonstrate remarkable performance. However, when code obfuscation is applied, the unstable control flow structure degrades their performance. To address this issue, we develop ORCAS, an Obfuscation-Resilient BCSA model based on Dominance Enhanced Semantic Graph (DESG). The DESG is an original binary code representation, capturing more binaries' implicit semantics without control flow structure, including inter-instruction relations (e.g., def-use), inter-basic block relations (i.e., dominance and post-dominance), and instruction-basic block relations. ORCAS takes binary functions from different obfuscation options, optimization levels, and instruction set architectures as input and scores their semantic similarity more robustly. Extensive experiments have been conducted on ORCAS against eight baseline approaches over the BinKit dataset. For example, ORCAS achieves an average 12.1% PR-AUC improvement when using combined three obfuscation options compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, an original obfuscated real-world vulnerability dataset has been constructed and released to facilitate a more comprehensive research on obfuscated binary code analysis. ORCAS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches over this newly released real-world vulnerability dataset by up to a recall improvement of 43%.</description>

      <title>QGuard:Question-based Zero-shot Guard for Multi-modal LLM Safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have had a significant impact on a wide range of fields, from general domains to specialized areas. However, these advancements have also significantly increased the potential for malicious users to exploit harmful and jailbreak prompts for malicious attacks. Although there have been many efforts to prevent harmful prompts and jailbreak prompts, protecting LLMs from such malicious attacks remains an important and challenging task. In this paper, we propose QGuard, a simple yet effective safety guard method, that utilizes question prompting to block harmful prompts in a zero-shot manner. Our method can defend LLMs not only from text-based harmful prompts but also from multi-modal harmful prompt attacks. Moreover, by diversifying and modifying guard questions, our approach remains robust against the latest harmful prompts without fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our model performs competitively on both text-only and multi-modal harmful datasets. Additionally, by providing an analysis of question prompting, we enable a white-box analysis of user inputs. We believe our method provides valuable insights for real-world LLM services in mitigating security risks associated with harmful prompts.</description>

      <title>SAFER-D: A Self-Adaptive Security Framework for Distributed Computing Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems has introduced new challenges on ensuring secure and robust communication. The growing number of connected devices increases network complexity, leading to higher latency and traffic. Distributed computing architectures (DCAs) have gained prominence to address these issues. This shift has significantly expanded the attack surface, requiring additional security measures to protect all components -- from sensors and actuators to edge nodes and central servers. Recent incidents highlight the difficulty of this task: Cyberattacks, like distributed denial of service attacks, continue to pose severe threats and cause substantial damage. Implementing a holistic defense mechanism remains an open challenge, particularly against attacks that demand both enhanced resilience and rapid response. Addressing this gap requires innovative solutions to enhance the security of DCAs. In this work, we present our holistic self-adaptive security framework which combines different adaptation strategies to create comprehensive and efficient defense mechanisms. We describe how to incorporate the framework into a real-world use case scenario and further evaluate its applicability and efficiency. Our evaluation yields promising results, indicating great potential to further extend the research on our framework.</description>

      <title>Anti-Phishing Training (Still) Does Not Work: A Large-Scale Reproduction of Phishing Training Inefficacy Grounded in the NIST Phish Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social engineering attacks delivered via email, commonly known as phishing, represent a persistent cybersecurity threat leading to significant organizational incidents and data breaches. Although many organizations train employees on phishing, often mandated by compliance requirements, the real-world effectiveness of this training remains debated. To contribute to evidence-based cybersecurity policy, we conducted a large-scale reproduction study (N = 12,511) at a US-based financial technology firm. Our experimental design refined prior work by comparing training modalities in operational environments, validating NIST's standardized phishing difficulty measurement, and introducing novel organizational-level temporal resilience metrics. Echoing prior work, training interventions showed no significant main effects on click rates (p=0.450) or reporting rates (p=0.417), with negligible effect sizes. However, we found that the NIST Phish Scale predicted user behavior, with click rates increasing from 7.0% for easy lures to 15.0% for hard lures. Our organizational-level resilience result was mixed: 36-55% of campaigns achieved "inoculation" patterns where reports preceded clicks, but training did not significantly improve organizational-level temporal protection. In summary, our results confirm the ineffectiveness of current phishing training approaches while offering a refined study design for future work.</description>

      <title>ExCyTIn-Bench: Evaluating LLM agents on Cyber Threat Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present ExCyTIn-Bench, the first benchmark to Evaluate an LLM agent x on the task of Cyber Threat Investigation through security questions derived from investigation graphs. Real-world security analysts must sift through a large number of heterogeneous alert signals and security logs, follow multi-hop chains of evidence, and compile an incident report. With the developments of LLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a promising direction. To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we construct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated real-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and related services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage security logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat investigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes on the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as answer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only provides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the pipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs. This also enables the automatic generation of procedural tasks with verifiable rewards, which can be naturally extended to training agents via reinforcement learning. Our comprehensive experiments with different models confirm the difficulty of the task: with the base setting, the average reward across all evaluated models is 0.249, and the best achieved is 0.368, leaving substantial headroom for future research. Code and data are coming soon!</description>

      <title>Performance and Storage Analysis of CRYSTALS Kyber as a Post Quantum Replacement for RSA and ECC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01694v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The steady advancement in quantum computer error correction technology has pushed the current record to 48 stable logical qubits, bringing us closer to machines capable of running Shor's algorithm at scales that threaten RSA and ECC cryptography. While the timeline for developing such quantum computers remains uncertain, the cryptographic community must prepare for the transition to quantum-resistant algorithms. CRYSTALS-Kyber, standardized by NIST in 2022, represents a leading post-quantum cryptographic solution, but widespread adoption faces significant challenges. If this migration follows patterns similar to the SHA-1 to SHA-2 transition, organizations may experience prolonged periods of vulnerability, with substantial security and economic consequences. This study evaluates Kyber's practical viability through performance testing across various implementation schemes, utilizing only standard built-in processor acceleration features, some of which include AES-NI and ASIMD, without any specialized hardware additions. Our findings demonstrate that Kyber provides robust security guarantees against quantum attacks while maintaining acceptable performance profiles for most contemporary applications, utilizing only commodity hardware with manufacturer-provided acceleration capabilities.</description>

      <title>Yet Another Mirage of Breaking MIRAGE: Debunking Occupancy-based Side-Channel Attacks on Fully Associative Randomized Caches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work presented at USENIX Security 2025 (SEC'25) claims that occupancy-based attacks can recover AES keys from the MIRAGE randomized cache. In this paper, we examine these claims and find that they arise from a modeling flaw in the SEC'25 paper. Most critically, the SEC'25 paper's simulation of MIRAGE uses a constant seed to initialize the random number generator used for global evictions in MIRAGE, causing every AES encryption they trace to evict the same deterministic sequence of cache lines. This artificially creates a highly repeatable timing pattern that is not representative of a realistic implementation of MIRAGE, where eviction sequences vary randomly between encryptions. When we instead randomize the eviction seed for each run, reflecting realistic operation, the correlation between AES T-table accesses and attacker runtimes disappears, and the attack fails. These findings show that the reported leakage is an artifact of incorrect modeling, and not an actual vulnerability in MIRAGE.</description>

      <title>UAV Individual Identification via Distilled RF Fingerprints-Based LLM in ISAC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) individual (ID) identification is a critical security surveillance strategy in low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic knowledge distillation (KD)-enabled wireless radio frequency fingerprint large language model (RFF-LLM) framework for UAV ID identification. First, we propose an RFF-LLM framework based on the modified GPT-2 model to improve the identification accuracy in complex outdoor environments. Then, considering the parameter overhead of the RFF-LLM, we design a dynamic KD strategy to compress the model. Specifically, the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is employed to dynamically adjust the distillation temperature, overcoming the local optimum dilemma inherent in static KD. As a next step, the knowledge of the RFF-LLM is adequately transferred to the lightweight Lite-HRNet model. Finally, our experiments are conducted based on the self-built drone RFF dataset of Release one, namely DRFF-R1, by collecting the I/Q signals of 20 commercial UAVs in channel 149. The experiment results show that the proposed framework achieves 98.38% ID identification accuracy with merely 0.15 million parameters and 2.74 ms response time, which outperforms the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>NodeShield: Runtime Enforcement of Security-Enhanced SBOMs for Node.js</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The software supply chain is an increasingly common attack vector for malicious actors. The Node.js ecosystem has been subject to a wide array of attacks, likely due to its size and prevalence. To counter such attacks, the research community and practitioners have proposed a range of static and dynamic mechanisms, including process- and language-level sandboxing, permission systems, and taint tracking. Drawing on valuable insight from these works, this paper studies a runtime protection mechanism for (the supply chain of) Node.js applications with the ambitious goals of compatibility, automation, minimal overhead, and policy conciseness.
  Specifically, we design, implement and evaluate NodeShield, a protection mechanism for Node.js that enforces an application's dependency hierarchy and controls access to system resources at runtime. We leverage the up-and-coming SBOM standard as the source of truth for the dependency hierarchy of the application, thus preventing components from stealthily abusing undeclared components. We propose to enhance the SBOM with a notion of capabilities that represents a set of related system resources a component may access. Our proposed SBOM extension, the Capability Bill of Materials or CBOM, records the required capabilities of each component, providing valuable insight into the potential privileged behavior. NodeShield enforces the SBOM and CBOM at runtime via code outlining (as opposed to inlining) with no modifications to the original code or Node.js runtime, thus preventing unexpected, potentially malicious behavior. Our evaluation shows that NodeShield can prevent over 98% out of 67 known supply chain attacks while incurring minimal overhead on servers at less than 1ms per request. We achieve this while maintaining broad compatibility with vanilla Node.js and a concise policy language that consists of at most 7 entries per dependency.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Defense Potential of Machine Unlearning against Membership Inference Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) pose a significant privacy risk, as they enable adversaries to determine whether a specific data point was included in the training dataset of a model. While Machine Unlearning is primarily designed as a privacy mechanism to efficiently remove private data from a machine learning model without the need for full retraining, its impact on the susceptibility of models to MIA remains an open question. In this study, we systematically assess the vulnerability of models to MIA after applying state-of-art Machine Unlearning algorithms. Our analysis spans four diverse datasets (two from the image domain and two in tabular format), exploring how different unlearning approaches influence the exposure of models to membership inference. The findings highlight that while Machine Unlearning is not inherently a countermeasure against MIA, the unlearning algorithm and data characteristics can significantly affect a model's vulnerability. This work provides essential insights into the interplay between Machine Unlearning and MIAs, offering guidance for the design of privacy-preserving machine learning systems.</description>

      <title>SyncGuard: Robust Audio Watermarking Capable of Countering Desynchronization Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio watermarking has been widely applied in copyright protection and source tracing. However, due to the inherent characteristics of audio signals, watermark localization and resistance to desynchronization attacks remain significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a learning-based scheme named SyncGuard to address these challenges. Specifically, we design a frame-wise broadcast embedding strategy to embed the watermark in arbitrary-length audio, enhancing time-independence and eliminating the need for localization during watermark extraction. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a meticulously designed distortion layer. Additionally, we employ dilated residual blocks in conjunction with dilated gated blocks to effectively capture multi-resolution time-frequency features. Extensive experimental results show that SyncGuard efficiently handles variable-length audio segments, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness against various attacks, and delivers superior auditory quality.</description>

While typically considered cyber-physical systems (CPSs), their dependence on traditional networked software stacks (e.g., Linux operating systems), robot operating system (ROS) middleware, and over-the-air update channels, creates a distinct security profile that exposes them to vulnerabilities conventional CPS models do not fully address. Prior studies have mainly examined specific threats, such as LiDAR spoofing or adversarial machine learning (AML). This narrow focus overlooks how an attack targeting one component can cascade harm throughout the robot's interconnected systems. We address this gap through a systematization of knowledge (SoK) that takes a comprehensive approach, consolidating fragmented research from robotics, CPS, and network security domains. We introduce a seven-layer security model for humanoid robots, organizing 39 known attacks and 35 defenses across the humanoid ecosystem-from hardware to human-robot interaction. Building on this security model, we develop a quantitative 39x35 attack-defense matrix with risk-weighted scoring, validated through Monte Carlo analysis. We demonstrate our method by evaluating three real-world robots: Pepper, G1 EDU, and Digit. The scoring analysis revealed varying security maturity levels, with scores ranging from 39.9% to 79.5% across the platforms. This work introduces a structured, evidence-based assessment method that enables systematic security evaluation, supports cross-platform benchmarking, and guides prioritization of security investments in humanoid robotics.</description>

Abstract: The development of blockchain technology has significantly enhanced the security and transparency of personal information and transaction records. Concurrent with the advancement of blockchain technology and the emergence of the digital currency ecosystem, the internet has evolved from a paradigm dominated by information flow to one driven by value flow. Consequently, the concept of token has gained widespread dissemination, and the electronic token under investigation in this thesis is a development of this concept. The application of electronic tokens has become pervasive with the development of the internet, but the functionality of these tokens is often limited, and issues related to trust remain significant challenges. This study proposes innovative solutions to address the deficiencies in traditional electronic token systems, including the issuance of tokens, the heterogeneity of issuance standards, and the lack of democracy. The solutions are based on distributed storage, anti-tampering mechanisms, consensus protocols, and transparent, traceable storage. Additionally, the study employs NFTs, smart contracts, and RSA blind signatures, among other key technologies, to construct a system based on blockchain technology. The process integrates the decentralised management and centralised operation models, aligning them with the national policy directives. The developed solution enables the full utilisation of blockchain technology's advantages while also fostering community participation. Consequently, it establishes a secure, legal, reliable, and dynamic electronic certification system.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Layer Barrier: Remodeling Private Transformer Inference with Hybrid CKKS and MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient framework for private Transformer inference that combines Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) to protect data privacy. Existing methods often leverage HE for linear layers (e.g., matrix multiplications) and MPC for non-linear layers (e.g., Softmax activation functions), but the conversion between HE and MPC introduces significant communication costs. The proposed framework, dubbed BLB, overcomes this by breaking down layers into fine-grained operators and further fusing adjacent linear operators, reducing the need for HE/MPC conversions. To manage the increased ciphertext bit width from the fused linear operators, BLB proposes the first secure conversion protocol between CKKS and MPC and enables CKKS-based computation of the fused operators. Additionally, BLB proposes an efficient matrix multiplication protocol for fused computation in Transformers. Extensive evaluations on BERT-base, BERT-large, and GPT2-base show that BLB achieves a $21\times$ reduction in communication overhead compared to BOLT (S\&amp;P'24) and a $2\times$ reduction compared to Bumblebee (NDSS'25), along with latency reductions of $13\times$ and $1.8\times$, respectively, when leveraging GPU acceleration.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting for Smart and Connected Infrastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of deep learning models has revolutionized various industries over the last decade, leading to a surge in connected devices and infrastructures. However, these models can be tricked into making incorrect predictions with high confidence, leading to disastrous failures and security concerns. To this end, we explore the impact of adversarial attacks on multivariate time-series forecasting and investigate methods to counter them. Specifically, we employ untargeted white-box attacks, namely the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Basic Iterative Method (BIM), to poison the inputs to the training process, effectively misleading the model. We also illustrate the subtle modifications to the inputs after the attack, which makes detecting the attack using the naked eye quite difficult. Having demonstrated the feasibility of these attacks, we develop robust models through adversarial training and model hardening. We are among the first to showcase the transferability of these attacks and defenses by extrapolating our work from the benchmark electricity data to a larger, 10-year real-world data used for predicting the time-to-failure of hard disks. Our experimental results confirm that the attacks and defenses achieve the desired security thresholds, leading to a 72.41% and 94.81% decrease in RMSE for the electricity and hard disk datasets respectively after implementing the adversarial defenses.</description>

      <title>Why Johnny Signs with Next-Generation Tools: A Usability Case Study of Sigstore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00271v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software signing is the most robust method for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of components in a software supply chain. Traditional signing tools burdened practitioners with key management and signer identification, creating both usability challenges and security risks. A new class of next-generation signing tools has automated many of these concerns, but little is known about their usability and its effect on adoption and effectiveness in practice. A usability evaluation can clarify the extent to which next-generation designs succeed and highlight priorities for improvement.
  To fill this gap, we conducted a usability study of Sigstore, a pioneering and widely adopted exemplar of next-generation signing. Through interviews with 17 industry experts, we examined (1) the problems and advantages associated with practitioners' tooling choices, (2) how and why their signing-tool usage has evolved over time, and (3) the contexts that cause usability concerns. Our findings illuminate the usability factors of next-generation signing tools and yield recommendations for toolmakers, adopting organizations, and the research community. Notably, components of next-generation tooling exhibit different levels of maturity and readiness for adoption, and integration flexibility is a common pain point, but potentially mitigable through plugins and APIs. Our results will help next-generation signing toolmakers further strengthen software supply chain security.</description>

      <title>Membership Inference Attacks on Large-Scale Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As large-scale models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) see increasing deployment, their privacy risks remain underexplored. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which reveal whether a data point was used in training the target model, are an important technique for exposing or assessing privacy risks and have been shown to be effective across diverse machine learning algorithms. However, despite extensive studies on MIAs in classic models, there remains a lack of systematic surveys addressing their effectiveness and limitations in large-scale models. To address this gap, we provide the first comprehensive review of MIAs targeting LLMs and LMMs, analyzing attacks by model type, adversarial knowledge, and strategy. Unlike prior surveys, we further examine MIAs across multiple stages of the model pipeline, including pre-training, fine-tuning, alignment, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Finally, we identify open challenges and propose future research directions for strengthening privacy resilience in large-scale models.</description>

      <title>Tech-ASan: Two-stage check for Address Sanitizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05022v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Address Sanitizer (ASan) is a sharp weapon for detecting memory safety violations, including temporal and spatial errors hidden in C/C++ programs during execution. However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which limits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from sanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over the past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by eliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to adequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To address this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based technique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel two-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to reduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel algorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a memory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation using the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan and ASan--, respectively. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects 56 fewer false negative cases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same redzone setting.</description>
