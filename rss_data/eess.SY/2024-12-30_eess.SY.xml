      <title>FITS: Ensuring Safe and Effective Touchscreen Use in Moving Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Touch interfaces are replacing physical buttons, dials, and switches in the new generation of cars, aircraft, and vessels. However, vehicle vibrations and accelerations perturb finger movements and cause erroneous touchscreen inputs by users. Furthermore, unlike physical buttons, touchscreens cannot be operated by touch alone and always require users' visual focus. Hence, despite their numerous benefits, touchscreens are not inherently suited for use in vehicles, which results in an increased risk of accidents. In a recently awarded research project titled "Right Touch Right Time: Future In-vehicle Touchscreens (FITS)", we aim to address these problems by developing novel in-vehicle touchscreens that actively predict and correct perturbed finger movements and simulate physical touch interactions with artificial tactile feedback.</description>

      <title>State-of-the-Art Underwater Vehicles and Technologies Enabling Smart Ocean: Survey and Classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration and sustainable use of marine environments have become increasingly critical as oceans cover over 70% of surface of Earth. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and classification of state-of-the-art underwater vehicles (UVs) and supporting technologies essential for enabling a smart ocean. We categorize UVs into several types, including remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), hybrid underwater vehicles (HUVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), and underwater bionic vehicles (UBVs). These technologies are fundamental in a wide range of applications, such as environmental monitoring, deep-sea exploration, defense, and underwater infrastructure inspection. Additionally, the paper explores advancements in underwater communication technologies, namely acoustic, optical, and hybrid systems, as well as key support facilities, including submerged buoys, underwater docking stations, and wearable underwater localization systems. By classifying the vehicles and analyzing their technological capabilities and limitations, this work aims to guide future developments in underwater exploration and monitoring, addressing challenges such as energy efficiency, communication limitations, and environmental adaptability. The paper concludes by discussing the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in enhancing the autonomy and operational efficiency of these systems, paving the way for the realization of a fully interconnected and sustainable Smart Ocean.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted Simultaneous Legitimate Monitoring and Jamming for Industrial Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted simultaneous legitimate monitoring and jamming techniques for industrial environments, so that egitimate monitor (LM) and legitimate jammers (LJs) can sustainably monitor and interfere with suspicious communications with minimum transmission power. Specifically, we propose a Block Coordinate Descent-Particle Swarm Optimization (BCD-PSO) based scheme to optimize RIS's phase shift matrix and minimize LJs' transmission power, while successfully jamming and stably monitoring unauthorized communications. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BCD-PSO can enhance the performances in terms of monitoring, resource utilization and robustness. Moreover, we effectively exam the best deployment of RIS towards diverse objectives.</description>

      <title>Preventing output saturation in active noise control: An output-constrained Kalman filter approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF)-based active noise control (ANC) system demonstrates superior tracking and faster convergence compared to the least mean square (LMS) method, particularly in dynamic noise cancellation scenarios. However, in environments with extremely high noise levels, the power of the control signal can exceed the system's rated output power due to hardware limitations, leading to output saturation and subsequent non-linearity. To mitigate this issue, a modified KF with an output constraint is proposed. In this approach, the disturbance treated as an measurement is re-scaled by a constraint factor, which is determined by the system's rated power, the secondary path gain, and the disturbance power. As a result, the output power of the system, i.e. the control signal, is indirectly constrained within the maximum output of the system, ensuring stability. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves rapid suppression of dynamic noise but also effectively prevents non-linearity due to output saturation, highlighting its practical significance.</description>

      <title>External Bias and Opinion Clustering in Cooperative Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a group of n agents which interact with each other in a cooperative framework. A Laplacian-based model is proposed to govern the evolution of opinions in the group when the agents are subjected to external biases like agents' traits, news, etc. The objective of the paper is to design a control input which leads to any desired opinion clustering even in the presence of external bias factors. Further, we also determine the conditions which ensure the reachability to any arbitrary opinion states. Note that all of these results hold for any kind of graph structure. Finally, some numerical simulations are discussed to validate these results.</description>

      <title>An Approximated Model of Wildfire Propagation on Slope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires underscore the need for accurate predictive models to enhance wildfire management. Traditional models, such as Rothermel and FARSITE, provide foundational insights but often oversimplify the complex dynamics of wildfire spread. Advanced methods, employing sophisticated mathematical techniques, offer more precise modeling by accounting for real-world complexities and dynamic environmental factors.
  This paper focuses on wildfire propagation over inclined terrains and combines the Rothermel model, Huygens' principle, and advanced mathematical techniques to provide a more precise model of propagation. Environmental parameters and vegetation factors are directly incorporated into formulas and equations to improve the reliability and effectiveness of wildfire management strategies. The practical application of these results is demonstrated through MATLAB simulations, specifically examining wildfire spread under wind conditions that do not impede upwind fire advancement. The findings of this work contribute to both wildfire research and the development of more effective management strategies.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Discrete Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter demonstrates how synthetic inertia can be obtained with the control of flexible discrete devices to keep the power balance of power systems, even if the system does not include any synchronous generator or conventional grid-forming converter. The letter also discusses solutions to cycling issues, which can arise due to the interaction of uncoordinated discrete inertia controllers. The effectiveness, dynamic performance, and challenges of the proposed approach are validated through simulations using modified versions of the WSCC 9-bus test system and of the all-island Irish transmission system.</description>

      <title>Robust $H_{\infty}$ Position Controller for Steering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust position controller for electric power assisted steering and steer-by-wire force-feedback systems. A position controller is required in steering systems for haptic feedback control, advanced driver assistance systems and automated driving. However, the driver's \textit{physical} arm impedance causes an inertial uncertainty during coupling. Consequently, a typical position controller, i.e., based on single variable, becomes less robust and suffers tracking performance loss. Therefore, a robust position controller is investigated.
  The proposed solution is based on the multi-variable concept such that the sensed driver torque signal is also included in the position controller. The subsequent solution is obtained by solving the LMI$-H_{\infty}$ optimization problem. As a result, the desired loop gain shape is achieved, i.e., large gain at low frequencies for performance and small gain at high frequencies for robustness.
  Finally, frequency response comparison of different position controllers on real hardware is presented. Experiments and simulation results clearly illustrate the improvements in reference tracking and robustness with the proposed $H_\infty$ controller.</description>

      <title>Parametrizations of All Stable Closed-loop Responses: From Theory to Neural Network Control Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of modern control systems necessitates architectures that achieve high performance while ensuring robust stability, particularly for nonlinear systems. In this work, we tackle the challenge of designing optimal output-feedback controllers to boost the performance of $\ell_p$-stable discrete-time nonlinear systems while preserving closed-loop stability from external disturbances to input and output channels. Leveraging operator theory and neural network representations, we parametrize the achievable closed-loop maps for a given system and propose novel parametrizations of all $\ell_p$-stabilizing controllers, unifying frameworks such as nonlinear Youla and Internal Model Control. Contributing to a rapidly growing research line, our approach enables unconstrained optimization exclusively over stabilizing output-feedback controllers and provides sufficient conditions to ensure robustness against model mismatch. Additionally, our methods reveal that stronger notions of stability can be imposed on the closed-loop maps if disturbance realizations are available after one time step. Last, our approaches are compatible with the design of nonlinear distributed controllers. Numerical experiments on cooperative robotics demonstrate the flexibility of our framework, allowing cost functions to be freely designed for achieving complex behaviors while preserving stability.</description>

      <title>Advanced Scheduling of Electrolyzer Modules for Grid Flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the transition to sustainable power generation progresses, green hydrogen production via electrolysis is expected to gain importance as a means for energy storage and flexible load to complement variable renewable generation. With the increasing need for cost-effective and efficient hydrogen production, electrolyzer optimization is essential to improve both energy efficiency and profitability. This paper analyzes how the efficiency and modular setup of alkaline hydrogen electrolyzers can improve hydrogen output of systems linked to a fluctuating renewable power supply. To explore this, we propose a day-ahead optimal scheduling problem of a hybrid wind and electrolyzer system. The novelty of our approach lies in modeling the number and capacity of electrolyzer modules, and capturing the modules' impact on the hydrogen production and efficiency. We solve the resulting mixed-integer optimization problem with several different combinations of number of modules, efficiency and operating range parameters, using day-ahead market data from a wind farm generator in the ERCOT system as an input. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures that electrolyzer owners can better optimize the operation of their systems, achieving greater hydrogen production and higher revenue. Key findings include that as the number of modules in a system with the same overall capacity increases, hydrogen production and revenue increases.</description>

      <title>A Review of Resilience Enhancement Measures for Hydrogen-penetrated Multi-energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy supply for electricity and heat sectors accounts for more than 40% of global carbon emissions in 2023, which brings great pressure for achieving net-zero carbon emission targets in the future. Under the above background, hydrogen-penetrated multi-energy systems (HMESs) have received wide attention due to their potential low-carbon attribute. However, HMESs still face the following challenge, i.e., how to survive and quickly recover from extreme and unexpected events (e.g., natural disasters, extreme weather, and cyber-physical attacks). To enable the above resilience attribute, many existing works on HMES resilience enhancement have been done. However, there lacks a systematic overview of different resilience enhancement measures for HMESs. To fill the research gap, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of resilience enhancement strategies for HMESs from the perspective of hydrogen-related planning and operation. To be specific, we propose a comprehensive resilience enhancement framework for HEMSs. Under the proposed framework, the widely used resilience metrics and event-oriented contingency models in existing works are summarized. Then, we classify the hydrogen-related planning measures for HMES resilience enhancement according to the type of hydrogen-related facilities and provide some insights for planning problem formulation framework. Moreover, we categorize the hydrogen-related operation measures for HMES resilience enhancement according to the three kinds of operation response stages involved, including preventive response, emergency response, and restoration response. Finally, we identify some research gaps and point out possible future directions.</description>

      <title>Preventive Energy Management for Distribution Systems Under Uncertain Events: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As power systems become more complex with the continuous integration of intelligent distributed energy resources (DERs), new risks and uncertainties arise. Consequently, to enhance system resiliency, it is essential to account for various uncertain events when implementing the optimization problem for the energy management system (EMS). This paper presents a preventive EMS considering the probability of failure (PoF) of each system component across different scenarios. A conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR)-based framework is proposed to integrate the uncertainties of the distribution network. Loads are classified into critical, semi-critical, and non-critical categories to prioritize essential loads during generation resource shortages. A proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning (RL) agent is used to solve the formulated problem and generate the control decisions. The proposed framework is evaluated on a notional MVDC ship system and a modified IEEE 30-bus system, where the results demonstrate that the PPO agent can successfully optimize the objective function while maintaining the network and operational constraints. For validation, the RL-based method is benchmarked against a traditional optimization approach, further highlighting its effectiveness and robustness. This comparison shows that RL agents can offer more resiliency against future uncertain events compared to the traditional solution methods due to their adaptability and learning capacity.</description>

      <title>Online distributed algorithms for mixed equilibrium problems in dynamic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the mixed equilibrium problem with coupled inequality constraints in dynamic environments is solved by employing a multi-agent system, where each agent only has access to its own bifunction, its own constraint function, and can only communicate with its immediate neighbors via a time-varying digraph. At each time, the goal of agents is to cooperatively find a point in the constraint set such that the sum of local bifunctions with a free variable is non-negative. Different from existing works, here the bifunctions and the constraint functions are time-varying and only available to agents after decisions are made. To tackle this problem, first, an online distributed algorithm involving accurate gradient information is proposed based on mirror descent algorithms and primal-dual strategies. Of particular interest is that dynamic regrets, whose offline benchmarks are to find the solution at each time, are employed to measure the performance of the algorithm. Under mild assumptions on the graph and the bifunctions, we prove that if the deviation in the solution sequence grows within a certain rate, then both the dynamic regret and the violation of coupled inequality constraints increase sublinearly. Second, considering the case where each agent only has access to a noisy estimate on the accurate gradient, we propose an online distributed algorithm involving the stochastic gradients. The result shows that under the same conditions as in the first case, if the noise distribution satisfies the sub-Gaussian condition, then dynamic regrets, as well as constraint violations, increase sublinearly with high probability. Finally, several simulation examples are presented to corroborate the validity of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimization framework for the joint multimodal transit frequency and shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) fleet size optimization, a problem variant of the transit network frequency setting problem (TNFSP) that explicitly considers mode choice behavior and route selection. To address the non-linear non-convex optimization problem, we develop a hybrid solution approach that combines metaheuristics (particle swarm optimization, PSO) with local nonlinear programming (NLP) improvement, incorporating approximation models for SAV waiting time, multimodal route choice, and mode choice. Applied to the Chicago metropolitan area, our method achieves a 33.3% increase in transit ridership.</description>

      <title>Multi-Condition Fault Diagnosis of Dynamic Systems: A Survey, Insights, and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial production systems, accurate fault diagnosis is essential to ensure safe and efficient system operation. However, due to changes in production demands, dynamic process adjustments, and complex external environmental disturbances, multiple operating conditions frequently arise during production. The multi-condition characteristics pose significant challenges to traditional fault diagnosis methods. In this context, multi-condition fault diagnosis has gradually become a key area of research, attracting extensive attention from both academia and industry. This paper aims to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of existing research in the field. Firstly, the mathematical definition of the problem is presented, followed by an overview of the current research status. Subsequently, the existing literature is reviewed and categorized from the perspectives of single-model and multi-model approaches. In addition, standard evaluation metrics and typical real-world application scenarios are summarized and analyzed. Finally, the key challenges and prospects in the field are thoroughly discussed.</description>

      <title>Arbitrarily Fast Tracking Multivariable Least-squares MRAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel least-squares model-reference direct adaptive control (LS MRAC) algorithm for multivariable (MIMO) plants is presented. The controller parameters are directly updated based on the output tracking error. The control law is crucially modified to reduce the relative degree of the error model to zero. A comprehensive Lyapunov-based stability analysis as well as a tracking error convergence characterization is provided demonstrating that the LS MRAC can achieve arbitrarily fast tracking while maintaining satisfactory parameter convergence for quite large adaptation gains. Simulation results show a significant improvement in tracking performance compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Trading Off Energy Storage and Payload -- An Analytical Model for Freight Train Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To support planning of alternative fuel technology (e.g., battery-electric locomotives) deployment for decarbonizing non-electrified freight rail, we develop a convex optimization formulation with a closed-form solution to determine the optimal number of energy storage tender cars in a train. The formulation shares a similar structure to an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model. For given market characteristics, cost forecasts, and technology parameters, our model captures the trade-offs between inventory carrying costs associated with trip times (including delays due to charging/refueling) and ordering costs associated with train dispatch and operation (energy, amortized equipment, and labor costs). To illustrate the framework, we find the optimal number of battery-electric energy tender cars in 22,501 freight markets (origin-destination pairs and commodities) for U.S. Class I railroads. The results display heterogeneity in optimal configurations with lighter, yet more time-sensitive shipments (e.g., intermodal) utilizing more battery tender cars. For heavier commodities (e.g., coal) with lower holding costs, single battery tender car configurations are generally optimal. The results also show that the optimal train configurations are sensitive to delays associated with recharging or swapping tender cars.</description>

      <title>SAFLITE: Fuzzing Autonomous Systems via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzz testing effectively uncovers software vulnerabilities; however, it faces challenges with Autonomous Systems (AS) due to their vast search spaces and complex state spaces, which reflect the unpredictability and complexity of real-world environments. This paper presents a universal framework aimed at improving the efficiency of fuzz testing for AS. At its core is SaFliTe, a predictive component that evaluates whether a test case meets predefined safety criteria. By leveraging the large language model (LLM) with information about the test objective and the AS state, SaFliTe assesses the relevance of each test case. We evaluated SaFliTe by instantiating it with various LLMs, including GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama2-7B, and integrating it into four fuzz testing tools: PGFuzz, DeepHyperion-UAV, CAMBA, and TUMB. These tools are designed specifically for testing autonomous drone control systems, such as ArduPilot, PX4, and PX4-Avoidance. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to PGFuzz, SaFliTe increased the likelihood of selecting operations that triggered bug occurrences in each fuzzing iteration by an average of 93.1\%. Additionally, after integrating SaFliTe, the ability of DeepHyperion-UAV, CAMBA, and TUMB to generate test cases that caused system violations increased by 234.5\%, 33.3\%, and 17.8\%, respectively. The benchmark for this evaluation was sourced from a UAV Testing Competition.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study of RCS Diversity with Novel No-divergent OAM Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research proposes a novel approach utilizing Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) beams to enhance Radar Cross Section (RCS) diversity for target detection in future transportation systems. Unlike conventional OAM beams with hollow-shaped divergence patterns, the new proposed OAM beams provide uniform illumination across the target without a central energy void, but keep the inherent phase gradient of vortex property. We utilize waveguide slot antennas to generate four different modes of these novel OAM beams at X-band frequency. Furthermore, these different mode OAM beams are used to illuminate metal models, and the resulting RCS is compared with that obtained using plane waves. The findings reveal that the novel OAM beams produce significant azimuthal RCS diversity, providing a new approach for the detection of weak and small targets.This study not only reveals the RCS diversity phenomenon based on novel OAM beams of different modes but also addresses the issue of energy divergence that hinders traditional OAM beams in long-range detection applications.</description>

      <title>Data-driven $H_{\infty}$ predictive control for constrained systems: a Lagrange duality approcah</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a data-driven $H_{\infty}$ control scheme for time-domain constrained systems based on model predictive control formulation. The scheme combines $H_{\infty}$ control and minimax model predictive control, enabling more effective handling of external disturbances and time-domain constraints. First, by leveraging input-output-disturbance data, the scheme ensures $H_{\infty}$ performance of the closed-loop system. Then, a minimax optimization problem is converted to a more manageable minimization problem employing Lagrange duality, which reduces conservatism typically associated with ellipsoidal evaluations of time-domain constraints. The study examines key closed-loop properties, including stability, disturbance attenuation, and constraint satisfaction, achieved by the proposed data-driven moving horizon predictive control algorithm. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated through numerical simulations involving a batch reactor system, confirming its robustness and feasibility under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Noise Sensitivity of the Semidefinite Programs for Direct Data-Driven LQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the noise sensitivity of the semidefinite program (SDP) proposed for direct data-driven infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. While this SDP is shown to find the true LQR controller in the noise-free setting, we show that it leads to a trivial solution with zero gain matrices when data is corrupted by noise, even when the noise is arbitrarily small. We then study a variant of the SDP that includes a robustness promoting regularization term and prove that regularization does not fully eliminate the sensitivity issue. In particular, the solution of the regularized SDP converges in probability also to a trivial solution.</description>

      <title>Direct Data-Driven State-Feedback Control of Linear Parameter-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17182v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The framework of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems has shown to be a powerful tool for the design of controllers for complex nonlinear systems using linear tools. In this work, we derive novel methods that allow to synthesize LPV state-feedback controllers directly from only a single sequence of data and guarantee stability and performance of the closed-loop system. We show that if the measured open-loop data from the system satisfies a persistency of excitation condition, then the full open-loop and closed-loop input-scheduling-state behavior can be represented using only the data. With this representation we formulate data-driven analysis and synthesis problems, where the latter yields controllers that guarantee stability and performance in terms of infinite horizon quadratic cost, generalized $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm and $\ell_2$-gain of the closed-loop system. The controllers are synthesized by solving a semi-definite program. Additionally, we provide a synthesis method to handle noisy measurement data. Competitive performance of the proposed data-driven synthesis methods is demonstrated w.r.t. model-based synthesis in multiple simulation studies, including a nonlinear unbalanced disc system.</description>

      <title>NN-ETM: Enabling safe neural network-based event-triggering mechanisms for consensus problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event-triggering mechanisms (ETM) have been developed for consensus problems to reduce communication while ensuring performance guarantees, but their design has grown increasingly complex by incorporating the agent's local and neighbor information. This typically results in ad-hoc solutions, which may only work for the consensus protocol under consideration. We aim to safely incorporate neural networks in the ETM to provide a general solution while guaranteeing performance. To decouple the stability analysis of the consensus protocol from the abstraction of the neural network, we derive design criteria for the consensus and ETM pair, allowing independent analysis of each element under mild constraints. Then, we propose NN-ETM, a novel ETM featuring a neural network, to optimize communication while preserving the stability guarantees of the consensus protocol.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Reachability on Riemannian Manifolds for Unknown Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the reachable set for a given nonlinear system is critically important for autonomous trajectory planning for reach-avoid applications and safety critical scenarios. Providing the reachable set is generally impossible when the dynamics are unknown, so we calculate underapproximations of such sets using local dynamics at a single point and bounds on the rate of change of the dynamics determined from known physical laws. Motivated by scenarios where an adverse event causes an abrupt change in the dynamics, we attempt to determine a provably reachable set of states without knowledge of the dynamics. This paper considers systems which are known to operate on a manifold. Underapproximations are calculated by utilizing the aforementioned knowledge to derive a guaranteed set of velocities on the tangent bundle of a complete Riemannian manifold that can be reached within a finite time horizon. We then interpret said set as a control system; the trajectories of this control system provide us with a guaranteed set of reachable states the unknown system can reach within a given time. The results are general enough to apply on systems that operate on any complete Riemannian manifold. To illustrate the practical implementation of our results, we apply our algorithm to a model of a pendulum operating on a sphere and a three-dimensional rotational system which lives on the abstract set of special orthogonal matrices.</description>

      <title>Priority aware grouping-based multihop routing scheme for RIS-assisted wireless networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is a novel communication technology that has been recently presented as a potential candidate for beyond fifth-generation wireless communication networks. In this paper, we propose a priority-aware user traffic-dependent grouping-based multihop routing scheme for a RIS-assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) device-to-device (D2D) communication network with spatially correlated channels. Specifically, the proposed scheme exploits the priority of the users (based on their respective delay-constrained applications) and the aspect of spatial correlation in the narrowly spaced reflecting elements of the RISs. Here, based on the other users in the neighborhood, their respective traffic characteristics, and the already deployed RISs in the surroundings, we establish a multihop connection for information transfer from one of the users to its intended receiver. In this context, we take into account the impact of considering practical discrete phase shifts at the RIS patches instead of its ideal continuous counterpart. Moreover, we also claim and demonstrate that the existing classic least remaining distance (LRD)-based approach is not always the optimal solution. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed strategy and that it significantly outperforms the existing benchmark schemes in terms of system performance metrics such as data throughput, energy consumption, as well as energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Ring-LWE based encrypted controller with unlimited number of recursive multiplications and effect of error growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to encrypt linear dynamic controllers that enables an unlimited number of recursive homomorphic multiplications on a Ring Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) based cryptosystem without bootstrapping. Unlike LWE based schemes, where a scalar error is injected during encryption for security, Ring-LWE based schemes are based on polynomial rings and inject error as a polynomial having multiple error coefficients. Such errors accumulate under recursive homomorphic operations, and it has been studied that their effect can be suppressed by the closed-loop stability when dynamic controllers are encrypted using LWE based schemes. We show that this also holds for the proposed controller encrypted using a Ring-LWE based scheme. Specifically, only the constant terms of the error polynomials affect the control performance, and their effect can be arbitrarily bounded even when the noneffective terms diverge. Furthermore, a novel packing algorithm is applied, resulting in reduced computation time and enhanced memory efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Pattern, Headway, and Fleet Size of Multiple Urban Transit Lines with Perceived Headway Consideration and Passenger Flow Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study addresses the urban transit pattern design problem, optimizing stop sequences, headways, and fleet sizes across multiple routes and periods simultaneously to minimize user costs (composed of riding, waiting, and transfer times) under operational constraints (e.g., vehicle capacity and fleet size). A destination-labeled multi-commodity network flow (MCNF) formulation is developed to solve the problem at a large scale more efficiently compared to the previous literature. The model allows for flexible pattern options without relying on pre-defined candidate sets and simultaneously considers multiple operational strategies such as express/local services, short-turning, and deadheading. It evaluates perceived headways of joint patterns for passengers, assigns passenger flows to each pattern accordingly, and allows transfers across patterns in different directions. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is demonstrated with a city-sized network of metro lines in Chicago, USA, achieving near-optimal solutions in hours. The total weighted journey times are reduced by 0.61% and 5.76% under single-route and multi-period multi-route scenarios respectively. The model provides transit agencies with an efficient tool for comprehensive service design and resource allocation, improving service quality and resource utilization without additional operational costs.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Pressure for Multi-Intersection Traffic Signal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) system is a critical component of intelligent transportation, with the capability to significantly alleviate urban traffic congestion. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have demonstrated promising performance in achieving ATSC, existing methods are still prone to making unreasonable policies. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Pressure for multi-intersection signal control (BCT-APLight). In BCT-APLight, the Critique-Tune (CT) framework, a two-layer Bayesian structure is designed to refine the excessive trust of RL policies. Specifically, the Bayesian inference-based Critique Layer provides effective evaluations of the credibility of policies; the Bayesian decision-based Tune Layer fine-tunes policies by minimizing the posterior risks when the evaluations are negative. Meanwhile, an attention-based Adaptive Pressure (AP) mechanism is designed to effectively weight the vehicle queues in each lane, thereby enhancing the rationality of traffic movement representation within the network. Equipped with the CT framework and AP mechanism, BCT-APLight effectively enhances the reasonableness of RL policies. Extensive experiments conducted with a simulator across a range of intersection layouts demonstrate that BCT-APLight is superior to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on seven real-world datasets. Specifically, BCT-APLight decreases average queue length by \textbf{\(\boldsymbol{9.60\%}\)} and average waiting time by \textbf{\(\boldsymbol{15.28\%}\)}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of steering the distribution of the state of a discrete-time linear system to a given target distribution while minimizing an entropy-regularized cost functional. This problem is called a maximum entropy density control problem. Specifically, the running cost is given by quadratic forms of the state and the control input, and the initial and target distributions are Gaussian. We first reveal that our problem boils down to solving two Riccati difference equations coupled through their boundary values. Based on them, we give the closed-form expression of the unique optimal policy. Next, we show that the optimal density control of a backward system can be obtained simultaneously with the forward-time optimal policy. The backward solution gives another expression of the forward solution. Finally, by considering the limit where the entropy regularization vanishes, we derive the unregularized density control in closed form.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement with single-particle states is advantageous in quantum technology because of their ability to encode and process information more securely than their multi-particle analogs. Threeway and nonlocal two-way entangled single-particle states are desirable in this context. Herein, we generate genuine three-way entanglement from an initially separable state involving three degrees of freedom of a quantum particle, which evolves via a 2D alternate quantum walk employing a resource-saving single-qubit coin. We achieve maximum possible values for the three-way entanglement quantified by the {\pi}-tangle between the three degrees of freedom. We also generate optimal nonlocal two-way entanglement, quantified by the negativity between the nonlocal position degrees of freedom of the particle. This prepared architecture using quantum walks can be experimentally realized with a photon.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Resource Allocation with Karma: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A system of non-tradable credits that flow between individuals like karma, hence proposed under that name, is a mechanism for repeated resource allocation that comes with attractive efficiency and fairness properties, in theory. In this study, we test karma in an online experiment in which human subjects repeatedly compete for a resource with time-varying and stochastic individual preferences or urgency to acquire the resource. We confirm that karma has significant and sustained welfare benefits even in a population with no prior training. We identify mechanism usage in contexts with sporadic high urgency, more so than with frequent moderate urgency, and implemented as a simple (binary) karma bidding scheme as particularly effective for welfare improvements: relatively larger aggregate efficiency gains are realized that are (almost) Pareto superior. These findings provide guidance for further testing and for future implementation plans of such mechanisms in the real world.</description>

      <title>A blueprint for large-scale quantum-network deployments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Communications is a field that promises advances in cryptography, quantum computing and clock synchronisation, among other potential applications. However, communication based on quantum phenomena requires an extreme level of isolation from external disturbances, making the transmission of quantum signals together with classical ones difficult. A range of techniques has been tested to introduce quantum communications in already deployed optical networks which also carry legacy traffic. This comes with challenges, not only at the physical layer but also at the operations and management layer. To achieve a broad acceptance among network operators, the joint management and operation of quantum and classical resources, compliance with standards, and quality and legal assurance need to be addressed. This article presents a detailed account of solutions to the above issues, deployed and evaluated in the MadQCI (Madrid Quantum Communication Infrastructure) testbed. This network is designed to integrate quantum communications in the telecommunications ecosystem by installing quantum-key-distribution modules from multiple providers in production nodes of two different operators. The modules were connected through an optical-switched network with more than 130 km of deployed optical fibre. The tests were done in compliance with strict service level agreements that protected the legacy traffic of the pre-existing classical network. The goal was to achieve full quantum-classical compatibility at all levels, while limiting the modifications of optical transport and encryption and complying with as many standards as possible. This effort was intended to serve as a blueprint, which can be used as the foundation of large-scale quantum network deployments. To demonstrate the capabilities of MadQCI, end-to-end encryption services were deployed and a variety of use-cases were showcased.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Decentralized Actor-Critic Algorithm in General-sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov games provide a powerful framework for modeling strategic multi-agent interactions in dynamic environments. Traditionally, convergence properties of decentralized learning algorithms in these settings have been established only for special cases, such as Markov zero-sum and potential games, which do not fully capture real-world interactions. In this paper, we address this gap by studying the asymptotic properties of learning algorithms in general-sum Markov games. In particular, we focus on a decentralized algorithm where each agent adopts an actor-critic learning dynamic with asynchronous step sizes. This decentralized approach enables agents to operate independently, without requiring knowledge of others' strategies or payoffs. We introduce the concept of a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) and demonstrate that it serves as an approximate Lyapunov function for the policy updates in the decentralized learning dynamics, which allows us to characterize the convergent set of strategies. We further strengthen our result under specific regularity conditions and with finite Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Control Pneumatic Soft Bending Actuator with Feedforward Hysteresis Compensation by Pneumatic Physical Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonlinearities of soft robots bring control challenges like hysteresis but also provide them with computational capacities. This paper introduces a fuzzy pneumatic physical reservoir computing (FPRC) model for feedforward hysteresis compensation in motion tracking control of soft actuators. Our method utilizes a pneumatic bending actuator as a physical reservoir with nonlinear computing capacities to control another pneumatic bending actuator. The FPRC model employs a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy logic to process outputs from the physical reservoir. The proposed FPRC model shows equivalent training performance to an Echo State Network (ESN) model, whereas it exhibits better test accuracies with significantly reduced execution time. Experiments validate the FPRC model's effectiveness in controlling the bending motion of a pneumatic soft actuator with open-loop and closed-loop control system setups. The proposed FPRC model's robustness against environmental disturbances has also been experimentally verified. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first implementation of a physical system in the feedforward hysteresis compensation model for controlling soft actuators. This study is expected to advance physical reservoir computing in nonlinear control applications and extend the feedforward hysteresis compensation methods for controlling soft actuators.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Performance Evaluation of a Hybrid PV-Wind-Battery Power System for a Mars Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a hybrid photovoltaic-wind-battery power system designed to sustain a Mars base under varying seasonal and climatic conditions. The Mars Climate Database was utilized to simulate the effects of seasonal changes, diurnal cycles, and dust storms on the system's power generation. The seasonal performance was analyzed across the Martian surface and at potential habitation sites proposed in the "First Landing Site/Exploration Zone Workshop for Human Missions to the Surface of Mars (FLSW).'' Within the hybrid system, the photovoltaic arrays serve as the primary energy source, with wind turbines providing essential backup during nighttime and dust storms. A single $1\,000\,\mathrm{m}^2$ photovoltaic array, a $33.4\,\mathrm{m}$ diameter wind turbine, and a $312\,\mathrm{kWh}$ battery can support a six-person Mars base at $32.1\%$ of the Martian surface during the equinoxes and solstices, expanding to $51.7\%$ with three sets of arrays and turbines. Additionally, $24$ FLSW sites can be supported throughout the solstices and equinoxes by a single photovoltaic array, turbine, and battery, even during global dust storms. Among the $24$ sites, Hebrus Valles, Huygens Crater, and Noctis Labyrinthus had the highest energy production potential. These findings are expected to guide further research on hybrid renewable power systems for Mars exploration.</description>

      <title>OCMDP: Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many practical applications, decision-making processes must balance the costs of acquiring information with the benefits it provides. Traditional control systems often assume full observability, an unrealistic assumption when observations are expensive. We tackle the challenge of simultaneously learning observation and control strategies in such cost-sensitive environments by introducing the Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process (OCMDP), where the policy influences the observability of the true state. To manage the complexity arising from the combined observation and control actions, we develop an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that separates the sensing and control components of the policy. This decomposition enables efficient learning in the expanded action space by focusing on when and what to observe, as well as determining optimal control actions, without requiring knowledge of the environment's dynamics. We validate our approach on a simulated diagnostic task and a realistic healthcare environment using HeartPole. Given both scenarios, the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a substantial reduction in observation costs on average, significantly outperforming baseline methods by a notable margin in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Robust Adaptive Data-Driven Control of Positive Systems with Application to Learning in SSP Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An adaptive data-driven controller is proposed and analysed for the class of infinite-horizon optimal control of positive linear system problems presented in [1]. This controller is synthesized from the solution of a "data-driven algebraic equation" constructed from the model-free Bellman equation used in Q-learning. This algebraic equation is driven by data correlation matrices that does not scale in the number of data points, making for an efficient online implementation. As a result, a sufficient condition that ensures stability and robustness against unmodeled dynamics in the plant is extracted. The derived results also allows for a quantitative characterization of the interplay between explorations and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. The class of optimal control problems considered here bears equivalence to Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems, allowing for a performance comparison between the proposed adaptive policy and model-free algorithms for learning the stochastic shortest path, as presented in the numerical experiment.</description>
