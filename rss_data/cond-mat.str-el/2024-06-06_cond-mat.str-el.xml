      <title>Theory of Correlated Insulator(s) and Superconductor at $\nu=1$ in Twisted WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of a superconducting phase, an intertwined insulating phase, and a continuous transition between the two at a commensurate filling of $\nu=1$ in bilayers of twisted WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$) at $\theta=3.65^0$ raises a number of intriguing questions about the origin of this phenomenology. Starting with a simplified three-orbital model of tWSe$_2$, including an on-site and nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, as well as a chiral-exchange interaction, we discuss the possibility of a displacement-field induced direct superconductor to quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator transition at $\nu=1$ using parton mean-field theory. We discuss the nature of these correlated insulators, their expected evolution with the displacement-field, and their phenomenological properties. Further experiments will likely help unravel the mysteries tied to this fascinating experimental platform.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern Insulators in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$: A Composite Fermion Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCIs) in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ has sparked significant interest in fractional topological matter without external magnetic fields. Unlike the flat dispersion of Landau levels, moir\'e electronic states are influenced by lattice effects within a nanometer-scale superlattice. This study examines the impact of these lattice effects on the topological phases in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$, uncovering a family of FCIs with Abelian anyonic quasiparticles. Using a composite fermion approach, we identify a sequence of FCIs with fractional Hall conductivities $\sigma_{xy} = \frac{C}{2C + 1} \frac{e^2}{h}$ linked to partial filling $\nu_{\,\text{h}}$ of holes of the topmost moir\'e valence band. These states emerge from incompressible composite fermion bands of Chern number $C$ within a complex Hofstadter spectrum. This approach explains FCIs with Hall conductivities $\sigma_{xy} = (2/3) e^2/h$ and $\sigma_{xy} = (3/5) e^2/h$ at fractional fillings $\nu_{\,\text{h}} = 2/3$ and $\nu_{\,\text{h}} = 3/5$ observed in experiments, and uncovers other fractal FCI states. The Hofstadter spectrum reveals new phenomena, distinct from Landau levels, including a higher-order Van Hove singularity (HOVHS) at half-filling, leading to novel quantum phase transitions. This work offers a comprehensive framework for understanding FCIs in transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e systems and highlights mechanisms for topological quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensional Antiferromagnetic Spin Fluctuations in the Spin-triplet Superconductor Candidate CeRh$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tetragonal heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ ($T_{\rm c}=0.3$ K) exhibits an exceptionally high critical field of 14 T for $\textbf{B} \parallel \textbf{c}$. It undergoes a field-driven first-order phase transition between superconducting (SC) states, potentially transitioning from spin-singlet to spin-triplet superconductivity. To elucidate the underlying pairing mechanism, we probe spin fluctuations in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ using neutron scattering. We find dynamic $(\pi,\pi)$ antiferromagnetic spin correlations with an anisotropic quasi-two-dimensional correlation volume. Our data place an upper limit of 0.31 $\mu_{\rm B}$ on the staggered magnetization of corresponding N\'{e}el orders at $T=0.08$ K. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, treating Ce $4f$ electrons as core states, show that the AFM wave vector connects significant areas of the Fermi surface. Our findings show the dominant excitations in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ for $\hbar\omega&lt; 1.2$~meV are magnetic and indicate superconductivity in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ is mediated by AFM spin fluctuations associated with a proximate quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Correlated Electronic Structure and Incipient Flat Bands of the Kagome Superconductor CsCr3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials exhibit many novel phenomena emerging from the interplay between lattice geometry, electronic structure, and topology. A prime example is the vanadium-based kagome materials AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs) with superconductivity and unconventional charge-density wave (CDW). More interestingly, the substitution of vanadium by chromium further introduces magnetism and enhances the correlation effect in CsCr3Sb5 which likewise exhibits superconductivity under pressure and competing density-wave state. Here we systematically investigate the electronic structure of CsCr3Sb5 using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (APRES) and ab-initio calculations. Overall, the measured electronic structure agrees with the theoretical calculation. Remarkably, Cr 3d orbitals exhibit incoherent electronic states and contribute to incipient flat bands close to the Fermi level. The electronic structure shows a minor change across the magnetic transition at 55 K, suggesting a weak interplay between the local magnetic moment and itinerant electrons. Furthermore, we reveal a drastic enhancement of the electron scattering rate across the magnetic transition, which is relevant to the semiconducting-like transport property of the system at high temperatures. Our results suggest that CsCr3Sb5 is a strongly correlated Hund's metal with incipient flat bands near the Fermi level, which provides an electronic basis for understanding its novel properties in comparison to the non-magnetic and weakly correlated AV3Sb5.</description>

      <title>Effects of Kitaev Interaction on Magnetic Orders and Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the effects of Kitaev interaction on magnetic orders and anisotropy in both triangular and honeycomb lattices. Our study highlights the critical role of the Kitaev interaction in modulating phase boundaries and predicting new phases, e.g., zigzag phase in triangular lattice and AABB phase in honeycomb lattice, which are absent with pure Heisenberg interactions. Moreover, we reveal the special state-dependent anisotropy of Kitaev interaction, and develop a general method that can determine the presence of Kitaev interaction in different magnets. It is found that the Kitaev interaction does not induce anisotropy in some magnetic orders such as ferromagnetic order, while can cause different anisotropy in other magnetic orders. Furthermore, we emphasize that the off-diagonal $\Gamma$ interaction also contributes to anisotropy, competing with the Kitaev interaction to reorient spin arrangements. Our work establishes a framework for comprehensive understanding the impact of Kitaev interaction on ordered magnetism.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion crystal formation and temperature -- magnetic field phase diagram of the frustrated tirangular-lattice Heisenberg magnet with easy-axis masugnetic anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the skyrmion-crystal (SkX) formation and various multiple-$q$ phases encompassing the SkX phase are investigated by extensive Monte Carlo simulations on the frustrated $J_1$-$J_3$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg model with the weak easy-axis magnetic anisotropy. Phase diagram in the temperature $T$ vs. magnetic-field $H$ plane are constructed, leading to a rich variety of multiple-$q$ phases. The anisotropy stabilizes the SkX state down to $T=0$ at intermediate fields, while in the lower-field range the SkX state becomes only metastable, and new multiple-$q$ states with a broken $C_3$ symmetry are instead stabilized. Implications to experiments are discussed.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases in Half-Integer Higher Spin $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground state properties of antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ chains with half-integer spins ranging from $S=\frac{3}{2}$ to $S=\frac{11}{2}$ using the density-matrix renormalization group method. We map out the ground-state phase diagrams as a function of $\frac{J_2}{J_1}$ containing topological phases with alternating $\frac{2S-1}{2}$ and $\frac{2S+1}{2}$ valence bonds. We identify these topological phases and their boundaries by calculating the string order parameter, the dimer order parameter, and the spin gap for those high-$S$ systems in thermodynamic limit (finite size scaling). We find that these topological regions narrow down inversely with $S$ and converge to a single point at $\frac{J_2}{J_1}=\frac{1}{4}$ in the classical limit -- a critical threshold between commensurate and incommensurate orders. In addition, we extend the discussion of the Majumder-Ghosh state, previously noted only for $S=\frac{1}{2}$, and speculate its possible presence as a ground state in half-integer high spin systems over a substantial range of $\frac{J_2}{J_1}$ values.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature spin dynamics and absence of magnetic order in layered $\alpha$-RuI$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The triangular-lattice system $\alpha$-RuI$_3$ is isostructural to the widely-studied $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ compound which was identified as a potential Kitaev system but exhibits, instead of spin liquid behaviour, a magnetically ordered zig-zag ground state which sets in below 14~K. Here we show experimentally that, in contrast, the spins in $\alpha$-RuI$_3$ remain dynamic down to at least 50~mK. We study the spin dynamics using muon-spin relaxation methods and determine the presence of low-frequency fluctuations which are characteristic of a two-dimensional system.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Altermagnetic Phases through Quantum Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently delimited altermagnetic phase is characterized by zero net magnetization but momentum-dependent collinear spin-splitting. To explore the intriguing physical effects and potential applications of altermagnets, it is essential to analyze their Fermi surface properties, encompassing both configurations and spin textures. Here, we conduct a Fermiology study on metallic altermagnets and demonstrate that the collinear spin-split features of their Fermi surfaces can be clearly revealed through quantum oscillation measurements. By introducing a transverse Zeeman field to remove the spin-degenerate lines in the momentum space, the Fermi surface undergoes a Lifshitz transition, giving rise to spin-flipped cyclotron motion between orbits with opposite spins. Accordingly, the Lifshitz-Onsager quantization yields two sets of Landau levels, leading to frequency splitting of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in conductivity. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, the Zeeman field causes two separate cyclotron orbits to merge at the Lifshitz transition point before splitting again. This results in the two original frequencies discontinuously changing into a single frequency equal to their sum. Our work unveils a unique and universal signature of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces that can be probed through quantum oscillation measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple lattice spin model that is written in terms of the well-known four-dimensional $\gamma$-matrix representation of the Clifford algebra. The local spins with a four-dimensional Hilbert space transform in a spinorial $(1/2,0) \oplus (0,1/2)$ representation of $SO(4)$, a symmetry of our model. When studied on a chain, and as a function of a transverse field tuning parameter, our model undergoes a quantum phase transition from a valence bond solid phase to a critical phase that is described by an $SU(2)_1$ WZW field theory.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Asymmetry in non-Abelian Anyonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons, a promising platform for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation, adhere to the charge super-selection rule (cSSR), which imposes restrictions on physically allowed states and operations. However, the ramifications of cSSR and fusion rules in anyonic quantum information theory remain largely unexplored. In this study, we unveil that the information-theoretic characteristics of anyons diverge fundamentally from those of non-anyonic systems such as qudits, bosons, and fermions and display intricate structures. In bipartite anyonic systems, pure states may have different marginal spectra, and mixed states may contain pure marginal states. More striking is that in a pure entangled state, parties may lack equal access to entanglement. This entanglement asymmetry is manifested in quantum teleportation employing an entangled anyonic state shared between Alice and Bob, where Alice can perfectly teleport unknown quantum information to Bob, but Bob lacks this capability. These traits challenge conventional understanding, necessitating new approaches to characterize quantum information and correlations in anyons. We expect that these distinctive features will also be present in non-Abelian lattice gauge field theories. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of the information-theoretic aspects of anyons and may lead to realizations of quantum communication and cryptographic protocols where one party holds sway over the other.</description>

      <title>Higher-Matter and Landau-Ginzburg Theory of Higher-Group Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher-matter is defined by higher-representation of a symmetry algebra, such as the $p$-form symmetries, higher-group symmetries or higher-categorical symmetries. In this paper, we focus on the cases of higher-group symmetries, which are formulated in terms of the strictification of weak higher-groups. We systematically investigate higher-matter charged under 2-group symmetries, defined by automorphism 2-representations. Furthermore, we construct a Lagrangian formulation of such higher-matter fields coupled to 2-group gauge fields in the path space of the spacetime manifold. We interpret such model as the Landau-Ginzburg theory for 2-group symmetries, and discuss the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 2-group symmetries under this framework. Examples of discrete and continuous 2-groups are discussed. Interestingly, we find that a non-split 2-group symmetry can admit an SSB to a split 2-group symmetry, where the Postnikov class is trivialized. We also briefly discuss the strictification of weak 3-groups, weak 3-group gauge fields and 3-representations in special cases.</description>

      <title>Floquet Theory in an Irradiated Nodal Surface Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nodal surface semimetal (NSSM) features symmetry enforced band crossings along a surface within the three-dimensional (3D) Brillouin zone. The topological robustness of the same does not always come with nonzero Berry fluxes around nodal surfaces. Irrespective of that, however, light irradiation on such system can result in interesting dynamic behavior. We find that depending on the state of polarization, one can obtain additional Weyl points/ nodal surfaces in the Floquet Hamiltonian that the time periodic system gives rise to. For simplicity we only consider two band spinless models without any spin orbit coupling, the main emphasis being to understand the low energy behavior close to the band crossings and its evolution in a Floquet system in the high frequency limit. There we find the nodal surfaces to perish or get duplicated or triplicated for different polarization scenario or different NSSM Hamiltonians. One findings open up important directions on what out of equilibrium NSSM systems has to offer in many active fields including quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Harmonic generation with topological edge states and electron-electron interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been found previously that the presence or absence of topological edge states in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model has a huge impact on harmonic generation spectra. More specifically, the yield of harmonics for harmonic orders that correspond to photon energies below the band gap is many orders of magnitude different in the trivial and topological phase. It is shown in this work that this effect is still present if electron-electron interaction is taken into account, i.e., if a Hubbard term is added to the SSH Hamiltonian. To that end, finite SSH-Hubbard chains at half filling are considered that are short enough to be accessible to exact diagonalization but already showing edge states in the topological phase. We show that the huge difference in the harmonic yield between the trivial and the topological phase can be reproduced with few-level models employing only the many-body ground state and a few excited many-body states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a systematic investigation of the correlated topological superconductors (TSCs), especially their non-trivial Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Compared to the non-interacting MZMs, the emerged correlated MZMs become projected MZMs. To prove this, we study the topological superconducting nanowire under the Hubbard and Hatsugai-Kohmoto interactions. Both of them become correlated TSCs under a magnetic field. Their topological properties are numerically computed by the Wilson loop and entanglement spectrum. We successfully extract the projected MZMs connecting the ground state and excited state through exact diagonalization. We also extend our results to the spinful Kitaev chain. Our results can provide a new perspective and understanding of the correlated MZMs.</description>

If it is a so-called intrinsic higher-order topological insulator or superconductor then it displays boundary modes at hinges or corners protected by the crystalline symmetry and the bulk topology. We explain the mechanism behind that using operator K-theory. Specifically, we derive a groupoid $C^\ast$-algebra that 1) encodes the dynamics of the electrons in the infinite size limit of a crystal; 2) remembers the boundary conditions at the crystal's boundaries, and 3) accepts a natural action by the point symmetries of the atomic lattice. The filtrations of the groupoid's unit space by closed subsets that are invariant under the groupoid and point group actions supply equivariant co-filtrations of the groupoid $C^\ast$-algebra. We show that specific derivations of the induced spectral sequences in twisted equivariant K-theories enumerate all non-trivial higher-order bulk-boundary correspondences.</description>

      <title>High-precision and low-depth eigenstate property estimation: theory and resource estimation</title>

Abstract: Estimating the eigenstate properties of quantum many-body systems is a long-standing, challenging problem for both classical and quantum computing. For the task of eigenstate preparation, quantum signal processing (QSP) has established near-optimal query complexity $O( \Delta^{-1} \log(\epsilon^{-1}) )$ by querying the block encoding of the Hamiltonian $H$ where $\Delta$ is the energy gap and $\epsilon$ is the target precision. However, QSP is challenging for both near-term noisy quantum computers and early fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQC), which are limited by the number of logical qubits and circuit depth. To date, early FTQC algorithms have focused on querying the perfect time evolution $e^{-iHt}$. It remains uncertain whether early FTQC algorithms can maintain good asymptotic scaling at the gate level. Moreover, when considering qubit connectivity, the circuit depth of existing FTQC algorithms may scale suboptimally with system size. Here, we present a full-stack design of a random sampling algorithm for estimating the eigenenergy and the observable expectations on the eigenstates, which can achieve high precision and good system size scaling. The gate complexity has a logarithmic dependence on precision $ {O}(\log^{1+o(1)} (1/\epsilon))$ for generic Hamiltonians, which cannot achieved by methods using Trottersiation to realise $e^{-iHt}$ like in QETU. For $n$-qubit lattice Hamiltonians, our method achieves near-optimal system size dependence with the gate complexity $O(n^{1+o(1)})$. When restricting the qubit connectivity to a linear nearest-neighbour architecture, The method shows advantages in circuit depth, with $O(n^{o(1)})$ for lattice models and $O(n^{2+o(1)})$ for electronic structure problems. We compare the resource requirements (CNOT gates, T gates and qubit numbers) by phase estimation, QSP, and QETU, in lattice and molecular problems.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Theory and the Sum of Squares</title>

Abstract: The sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy is a powerful technique based on semi-definite programming that can be used for both classical and quantum optimization problems. This hierarchy goes under several names; in particular, in quantum chemistry it is called the reduced density matrix (RDM) method. We consider the ability of this hierarchy to reproduce weak coupling perturbation theory for three different kinds of systems: spin (or qubit) systems, bosonic systems (the anharmonic oscillator), and fermionic systems with quartic interactions. For such fermionic systems, we show that degree-$4$ SoS (called $2$-RDM in quantum chemsitry) does not reproduce second order perturbation theory but degree-$6$ SoS ($3$-RDM) does (and we conjecture that it reproduces third order perturbation theory). Indeed, we identify a fragment of degree-$6$ SoS which can do this, which may be useful for practical quantum chemical calculations as it may be possible to implement this fragment with less cost than the full degree-$6$ SoS. Remarkably, this fragment is very similar to one studied by Hastings and O'Donnell for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations lead to glassy electron dynamics in the good metal regime of electron doped KTaO3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the central challenges in condensed matter physics is to comprehend systems that have strong disorder and strong interactions. In the strongly localized regime, their subtle competition leads to glassy electron dynamics which ceases to exist well before the insulator-to-metal transition is approached as a function of doping. Here, we report on the discovery of glassy electron dynamics deep inside the good metal regime of an electron-doped quantum paraelectric system: KTaO$_3$. We reveal that upon excitation of electrons from defect states to the conduction band, the excess injected carriers in the conduction band relax in a stretched exponential manner with a large relaxation time, and the system evinces simple aging phenomena - a telltale sign of glassy dynamics. Most significantly, we observe a critical slowing down of carrier dynamics below 35 K, concomitant with the onset of quantum paraelectricity in the undoped KTaO$_3$. Our combined investigation using second harmonic generation technique, density functional theory and phenomenological modeling demonstrates quantum fluctuation-stabilized soft polar modes as the impetus for the glassy behavior. This study addresses one of the most fundamental questions regarding the potential promotion of glassiness by quantum fluctuations and opens a route for exploring glassy dynamics of electrons in a well-delocalized regime.</description>

      <title>Crystalline topological defects within response theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal defects can highlight interesting quantum features by coupling to the low-energy Hamiltonian $H$. Here we show that independently of this $H$ coupling, topological crystalline defects can generate new features by directly modifying the response theory of electric field probes such as Raman scattering. To show this we consider an antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 model $H_{spin}$ on a zigzag chain. Crystalline domain walls between two zigzag domains appear as at most local defects in $H_{spin}$, but as topological (not locally creatable) defects in the Raman operator $R$ of inelastic photon scattering. Using time evolving block decimation (TEBD) numerics, mean field, and bosonization, we show that a finite density of crystalline domain walls shifts the entire Raman signal to produce an effective gap. This lattice-defect-induced Raman gap closes and reopens in applied magnetic fields. We discuss the effect in terms of photons sensing the lattice defects within $R$ as spin-dimerization domain walls, with $Z_2$ character, and a resulting shift of the probed wavevector from $q=0$ to $\pi+\delta q$, giving an $\textit{O}(1)$ change in contrast to local defects. The magneto-Raman singularity from topological lattice defects here relies on the $H_{spin}$ spinon liquid state, suggesting future applications using lattice topological defects to modify response-theory operators independently of $H$ and thereby generate new probes of quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum phase transitions and composite excitations of antiferromagnetic quantum spin trimer chains in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advancements in theoretical and experimental studies on the high-energy excitations, we theoretically explore the quantum phase transition and composite dynamics of the antiferromagnetic trimer chains in a magnetic field using the exact diagonalization, density matrix renormalization group, time-dependent variational principle and cluster perturbation theory. We measure the entanglement entropy to uncover the phase diagram, encompassing the XY-I, $1/3$ magnetization plateau, XY-II and ferromagnetic phases. Both critical XY-I and XY-II phases are both described by the conformal field theory with the central charge $c \simeq 1$. By analyzing the dynamical structure factor, we elucidate the distinct features of spin dynamics across different phases. In the regime of weak intertrimer interaction, we identify the intermediate-energy and high-energy modes in the XY-I and $1/3$ magnetization plateau phases as the internal trimer excitations, corresponding to the propagation of doublon and quarton, respectively. Notably, the application of a magnetic field splits the high-energy spectra into two branches labeled as the upper quarton and lower quarton. Furthermore, we also explore the spin dynamics of a trimerized model closely related to the quantum magnet \ce{Na_2Cu_3Ge_4O_12}, and discuss the possibility of the quarton Bose-Einstein condensation. Our results can be verified in the inelastic neutron scattering experiments and provide deep insights for exploring the high-energy exotic excitations.</description>

      <title>Quenched pair breaking by interlayer correlations as a key to superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with $T_\mathrm{c} \simeq 80~\mathrm{K}$ under high pressure opens up a new route to high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ superconductivity. This material realizes a bilayer square lattice model featuring a strong interlayer hybridization unlike many unconventional superconductors. A key question in this regard concerns how electronic correlations driven by the interlayer hybridization affect the low-energy electronic structure and the concomitant superconductivity. Here, we demonstrate using a cluster dynamical mean-field theory that the interlayer electronic correlations (IECs) induce a Lifshitz transition resulting in a change of Fermi surface topology. By solving an appropriate gap equation, we further show that the leading pairing instability, $s \pm$-wave, is enhanced by the IECs. The underlying mechanism is the quenching of a strong ferromagnetic channel, resulting from the Lifshitz transition driven by the IECs. Based on this picture, we provide a possible reason of why superconductivity emerges only under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using quantum singular value transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering quantum information from a noisy quantum system is one of the central challenges in quantum information science and fundamental physics. The key to this goal is explicitly constructing a decoder. In this paper, we provide two explicit decoding quantum circuits that are both capable of recovering quantum information when a decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. The decoders are constructed by using the fixed-point amplitude amplification algorithm based on the quantum singular value transformation, which significantly extends an approach by Yoshida and Kitaev in a specific noise model to general situations. We also show that the proposed decoding circuits reduce the computational cost compared to a previously known explicit decoder. Our constructions not only show an intriguing intersection between decoders and quantum algorithms but also reveal the power of an algorithmic approach to recovering quantum information.</description>

      <title>Simulating Floquet scrambling circuits on trapped-ion quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum many-body dynamics spread initially localized quantum information across the entire system. Information scrambling refers to such a process, whose simulation is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We demonstrate the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the interferometric protocol for calculating out-of-time-ordered correlators to study the scrambling property of a one-dimensional kicked-Ising model on 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum processors. The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states.</description>
