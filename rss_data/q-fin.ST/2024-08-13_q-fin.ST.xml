      <title>A GCN-LSTM Approach for ES-mini and VX Futures Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel data-driven network framework for forecasting problems related to E-mini S\&amp;P 500 and CBOE Volatility Index futures, in which products with different expirations act as distinct nodes. We provide visual demonstrations of the correlation structures of these products in terms of their returns, realized volatility, and trading volume. The resulting networks offer insights into the contemporaneous movements across the different products, illustrating how inherently connected the movements of the future products belonging to these two classes are. These networks are further utilized by a multi-channel Graph Convolutional Network to enhance the predictive power of a Long Short-Term Memory network, allowing for the propagation of forecasts of highly correlated quantities, combining the temporal with the spatial aspect of the term structure.</description>

      <title>Strong denoising of financial time-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a method for significantly improving the signal to noise ratio in financial data. The approach relies on combining a target variable with different context variables and use auto-encoders (AEs) to learn reconstructions of the combined inputs. The objective is to obtain agreement among pairs of AEs which are trained on related but different inputs and for which they are forced to find common ground. The training process is set up as a "conversation" where the models take turns at producing a prediction (speaking) and reconciling own predictions with the output of the other AE (listening), until an agreement is reached. This leads to a new way of constraining the complexity of the data representation generated by the AE. Unlike standard regularization whose strength needs to be decided by the designer, the proposed mutual regularization uses the partner network to detect and amend the lack of generality of the learned representation of the data. The integration of alternative perspectives enhances the de-noising capacity of a single AE and allows us to discover new regularities in financial time-series which can be converted into profitable trading strategies.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning in High-frequency Market Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a new and comprehensive theoretical analysis for the application of reinforcement learning (RL) in high-frequency market making. We bridge the modern RL theory and the continuous-time statistical models in high-frequency financial economics. Different with most existing literature on methodological research about developing various RL methods for market making problem, our work is a pilot to provide the theoretical analysis. We target the effects of sampling frequency, and find an interesting tradeoff between error and complexity of RL algorithm when tweaking the values of the time increment $\Delta$ $-$ as $\Delta$ becomes smaller, the error will be smaller but the complexity will be larger. We also study the two-player case under the general-sum game framework and establish the convergence of Nash equilibrium to the continuous-time game equilibrium as $\Delta\rightarrow0$. The Nash Q-learning algorithm, which is an online multi-agent RL method, is applied to solve the equilibrium. Our theories are not only useful for practitioners to choose the sampling frequency, but also very general and applicable to other high-frequency financial decision making problems, e.g., optimal executions, as long as the time-discretization of a continuous-time markov decision process is adopted. Monte Carlo simulation evidence support all of our theories.</description>
