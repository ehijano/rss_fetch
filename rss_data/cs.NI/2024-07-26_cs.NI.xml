      <title>Thermal Radiation (TR) mode: A Deployment Perspective for 5G NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 5G New Radio NR technology is under standardization process by 3GPP to provide outline for a new radio interface for the next generation of cellular networks. The aim of the 5G networks include not only to provide enhanced capacity coverage but also support advanced services such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication URLLC massive Machine Type Communication mMTC. Key features of NR include Ultra lean carrier design to minimize the power consumption by limiting the always-on signal transmissions and to reduce interference in the neighboring cells . Another feature is the use of massive number of antennas for transmission as well as reception of signals. This rise in the number of antennas to provide a greater coverage brings about various challenges and impact in the system. With the increase in investigations in the mmWave frequencies, there is a need to investigate the health hazards they have on human body and the environment at large. This paper intends to provide an insight into the harmful impacts of Radio Frequency RF fields. The radiation metric to study the RF impact for far field is power density and for near field is Specific Absorption Rate SAR. These are the two main EM radiation metrics to find out the exposure due to uplink and downlink phenomenon in mobile communications. Mobile communication systems are addressed particularly to discuss the Electromagnetic EM Radiation impact as smart phones are used in close proximity to the body. A proposal in the form of Thermal Radiation TR mode is given to reduce the radiations emitted from a mobile phone. The performance of the proposed mode is validated from the results by achieving reduced power density, complexity and exposure ratio.</description>

      <title>Green and Safe 6G Wireless Networks: A Hybrid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the wireless internet access being increasingly popular with services such as HD video streaming and so on, the demand for high data consuming applications is also rising. This increment in demand is coupled with a proportional rise in the power consumption. It is required that the internet traffic is offloaded to technologies that serve the users and contribute in energy consumption. There is a need to decrease the carbon footprint in the atmosphere and also make the network safe and reliable. In this article we propose a hybrid system of RF (Radio Frequency) and VLC (Visible Light Communication) for indoor communication that can provide communication along with illumination with least power consumption. The hybrid network is viable as it utilizes power with respect to the user demand and maintains the required Quality of ServiceQoS and Quality of Experience QoE for a particular application in use. This scheme aims for Green Communication and reduction in Electromagnetic EM Radiation. A comparative analysis for RF communication, Hybrid RF+ VLC and pure VLC is made and simulations are carried out using Python, Scilab and MathWorks tool. The proposal achieves high energy efficiency of about 37% low Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) lower incident and absorbed power density complexity and temperature elevation in human body tissues exposed to the radiation. It also enhances the battery lifetime of the mobile device in use by increasing the lifetime approximately by 7 hours as validated from the obtained results. Thus the overall network reliability and safety factor is enhanced with the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Design, Key Techniques and System-Level Simulation for NB-IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a promising technology designated specially by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to meet the growing demand of massive machine-type communications (mMTC). More and more industrial companies choose NB-IoT network as the solution to mMTC due to its unique design and technical specification released by 3GPP. In order to evaluate the performance of NB-IoT network, we design a system-level simulation for NB-IoT network in this paper. In particular, the structure of system-level simulator are divided into four parts, i.e., initialization, pre-generation, main simulation loop and post-processing. Moreover, three key techniques are developed in the implementation of NB-IoT network by accounting for enhanced coverage, massive connection and low-power consumption. Simulation results demonstrate the cumulative distribution function curves of signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio are fully compliant with industrial standard, and the performance of throughput explains how NB-IoT network realize massive connection at the cost of data rate.</description>

      <title>Online Learning for Autonomous Management of Intent-based 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing complexity of networks and the variety of future scenarios with diverse and often stringent performance requirements call for a higher level of automation. Intent-based management emerges as a solution to attain high level of automation, enabling human operators to solely communicate with the network through high-level intents. The intents consist of the targets in the form of expectations (i.e., latency expectation) from a service and based on the expectations the required network configurations should be done accordingly. It is almost inevitable that when a network action is taken to fulfill one intent, it can cause negative impacts on the performance of another intent, which results in a conflict. In this paper, we aim to address the conflict issue and autonomous management of intent-based networking, and propose an online learning method based on the hierarchical multi-armed bandits approach for an effective management. Thanks to this hierarchical structure, it performs an efficient exploration and exploitation of network configurations with respect to the dynamic network conditions. We show that our algorithm is an effective approach regarding resource allocation and satisfaction of intent expectations.</description>

      <title>Adaptable Deep Joint Source-and-Channel Coding for Small Satellite Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth observation with small satellites serves a wide range of relevant applications. However, significant advances in sensor technology (e.g., higher resolution, multiple spectrums beyond visible light) in combination with challenging channel characteristics lead to a communication bottleneck when transmitting the collected data to Earth. Recently, joint source coding, channel coding, and modulation based on neuronal networks has been proposed to combine image compression and communication. Though this approach achieves promising results when applied to standard terrestrial channel models, it remains an open question whether it is suitable for the more complicated and quickly varying satellite communication channel. In this paper, we consider a detailed satellite channel model accounting for different shadowing conditions and train an encoder-decoder architecture with realistic Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. In addition, to reduce the overhead associated with applying multiple neural networks for various channel states, we leverage attention modules and train a single adaptable neural network that covers a wide range of different channel conditions. Our evaluation results show that the proposed approach achieves similar performance when compared to less space-efficient schemes that utilize separate neuronal networks for differing channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Signaling Rate and Performance of RIS Reconfiguration and Handover Management in Next Generation Mobile Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of signaling rate and performance for an efficient control and management of RIS reconfigurations and handover in next generation mobile networks. To this end, we first analytically determine the rates of RIS reconfigurations and handover using a stochastic geometry network model. We derive closed-form expressions of these rates while taking into account static obstacles (both known and unknown), self-blockage, RIS location density, and variations in the angle and direction of user mobility. Based on the rates derived, we analyze the signaling rates of a sample novel signaling protocol, which we propose as an extension of an handover signaling protocol standard in mobile networks. The results quantify the impact of known and unknown obstacles on the RIS and handover reconfiguration rate as function of device density and mobility. We use the proposed analysis to evaluate the signaling overhead due to RIS reconfigurations, as well as to dimension the related RIS control plane server capacity in the network management system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analytical model to derive the closed form expressions of RIS reconfiguration rates, along with handover rates, and relate its statistical properties to the signaling rate and performance in next generation mobile networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resilience Optimization in 5G RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resilience is defined as the ability of a network to resist, adapt, and quickly recover from disruptions, and to continue to maintain an acceptable level of services from users' perspective. With the advent of future radio networks, including advanced 5G and upcoming 6G, critical services become integral to future networks, requiring uninterrupted service delivery for end users. Unfortunately, with the growing network complexity, user mobility and diversity, it becomes challenging to scale current resilience management techniques that rely on local optimizations to large dense network deployments. This paper aims to address this problem by globally optimizing the resilience of a dense multi-cell network based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, our proposed solution can dynamically tilt cell antennas and reconfigure transmit power to mitigate outages and increase both coverage and service availability. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to simultaneously satisfy resiliency constraints while maximizing the service quality in the network area in order to minimize the impact of outages on neighbouring cells. Extensive simulations then demonstrate that with our proposed solution, the average service availability in terms of user throughput can be increased by up to 50-60% on average, while reaching a coverage availability of 99% in best cases.</description>

      <title>Guided-Mutation Genetic Algorithm for Mobile IoT Network Relay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a communication scheme which allows various objects to exchange several types of information, enabling functions such as home automation, production management, healthcare, etc. In addition, energy-harvesting (EH) technology is considered for IoT environment in order to reduce the need for management and enhance maintainability. Moreover, since environments considering outdoor elements such as pedestrians, vehicles and drones have been on the rise recently, it is important to consider mobility when designing an IoT network management scheme. However, calculating the optimal relaying topology is considered as an NP-hard problem, and finishing computation for mobility environment before the channel status changes is important to prevent delayed calculation results. In this article, our objective is to calculate a sub-optimal relaying topology for stationary and mobile system within reasonable computation time. To achieve our objective, we validate an iterative balancing time slot allocation algorithm introduced in the previous study, and propose a guided-mutation genetic algorithm (GMGA) that modulates the mutation rate based on the channel status for rational exploration. Additionally, we propose a mobility-aware iterative relaying topology algorithm, which calculates relaying topology in a mobility environment using an inheritance of the sub-optimal relaying topology calculations. Simulation results verify that our proposed scheme effectively solves formulated IoT network problems compared to other conventional schemes, and also effectively handles IoT environments including mobility in terms of minimum rate budget and computation time.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model-based Incentive Mechanism with Prospect Theory for Edge AIGC Services in 6G IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fusion of the Internet of Things (IoT) with Sixth-Generation (6G) technology has significant potential to revolutionize the IoT landscape. With the ultra-reliable and low-latency communication capabilities of 6G, 6G-IoT networks can transmit high-quality and diverse data to enhance edge learning. Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) harnesses advanced AI algorithms to automatically generate various types of content. The emergence of edge AIGC integrates with edge networks, facilitating real-time provision of customized AIGC services by deploying AIGC models on edge devices. However, the current practice of edge devices as AIGC Service Providers (ASPs) lacks incentives, hindering the sustainable provision of high-quality edge AIGC services amidst information asymmetry. In this paper, we develop a user-centric incentive mechanism framework for edge AIGC services in 6G-IoT networks. Specifically, we first propose a contract theory model for incentivizing ASPs to provide AIGC services to clients. Recognizing the irrationality of clients towards personalized AIGC services, we utilize Prospect Theory (PT) to capture their subjective utility better. Furthermore, we adopt the diffusion-based soft actor-critic algorithm to generate the optimal contract design under PT, outperforming traditional deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>A Physical-Layer Orchestration Framework for Open System Models of Autonomous RISs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To obviate the control of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and related overhead, recent works envisioned the concept of autonomous RISs: Intelligent devices capable of autonomously deciding their reflection states. This paradigm is enabled by hybrid RIS (HRIS), a hardware solution that integrates sensing and channel estimation (CHEST) capabilities, enabling autonomous operation. Autonomous RISs operate independently alongside other network entities, promoting open communication system models for RISs. However, this autonomy introduces a significant challenge: How to schedule the operation of the autonomous RIS over time and frequency to minimize its impact on the network? This paper introduces a physical layer (PHY) orchestration framework within a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) network to address this challenge. Our framework highlights an engineering trade-off termed the "autonomous RIS trade-off," which examines the performance implications of autonomy. Through mathematical analysis and numerical results, we describe the HRIS feasibility region, illustrating the conditions under which autonomous RISs are viable when properly deployed.</description>

      <title>Implementing and Evaluating Security in O-RAN: Interfaces, Intelligence, and Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (RAN) is a networking paradigm that builds on top of cloud-based, multi-vendor, open and intelligent architectures to shape the next generation of cellular networks for 5G and beyond. While this new paradigm comes with many advantages in terms of observatibility and reconfigurability of the network, it inevitably expands the threat surface of cellular systems and can potentially expose its components to several cyber attacks, thus making securing O-RAN networks a necessity. In this paper, we explore the security aspects of O-RAN systems by focusing on the specifications and architectures proposed by the O-RAN Alliance. We address the problem of securing O-RAN systems with a holistic perspective, including considerations on the open interfaces used to interconnect the different O-RAN components, on the overall platform, and on the intelligence used to monitor and control the network. For each focus area we identify threats, discuss relevant solutions to address these issues, and demonstrate experimentally how such solutions can effectively defend O-RAN systems against selected cyber attacks. This article is the first work in approaching the security aspect of O-RAN holistically and with experimental evidence obtained on a state-of-the-art programmable O-RAN platform, thus providing unique guideline for researchers in the field.</description>
