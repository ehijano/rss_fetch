      <title>Dynamical generation of geometric squeezing in interacting Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the rotating frequency of a non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) confined in a weak anisotropic harmonic potential is suddenly quenched to its trapping frequency, the condensate evolves from its ground state to a single-mode squeezed state with exponentially growing quantum fluctuation anisotropy. Such a squeezed state is called the geometrically squeezed state. However, for interacting BECs with two-body collisions, a similar quench only results in quantum fluctuations oscillating periodically without squeezing. In this work, we identify superfluid stability as the key factor behind this non-squeezing phenomenon, with the periodic oscillations arising from collective excitations of a stable collective excitation mode. By strategically breaking the stability criteria, we propose a dynamical approach for generating squeezing that can exponentially suppress quantum fluctuations in a relatively short time, surpassing the efficiency of existing experimental preparation schemes.</description>

      <title>Four-mode quantum sensing and Fisher information in a spin-orbit-coupled Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-mode squeezing and entanglement are important resources in quantum metrology and sensing. For spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensates subject to spin-orbit coupling (SOC), previous studies on spin squeezing have been limited to two-mode systems. In this work, we demonstrate that such a system can naturally construct a four-mode model spanning an $\mathfrak{su}(4)$ algebra with six SU(2) subspaces. Using spin squeezing parameters and quantum Fisher information matrices, we analyze the dynamical evolution of coherent spin states. The results show that, beyond two-mode models, the SOC-induced four-mode couplings give rise to richer entanglement-enhanced sensing approaching the Heisenberg limit across various SU(2) subspaces. Additionally, by tuning a single system parameter (the Raman Rabi frequency), one can selectively control the optimal measurement directions across different subspaces.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Doppler effect in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that two-component Bose-Einstein condensed mixtures, in presence of a persistent current, exhibit a non trivial Doppler shift of the sound velocities. The peculiarity is due to the inter-species interaction and the possibility of generating a counter-flow persistent current. Analytic predictions are derived by using superfluid hydrodynamics. While the existence of anomalous Doppler shifts at finite temperature has been discussed a long time ago in the case of superfluid Helium-4, an experimental verification of the effect is still missing. For this reason, we also propose a protocol for the measurement of the Doppler shifts, based on the density-density response function. The dynamical protocol is simulated by means of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations.</description>

      <title>Reentrant topology and reverse pumping in a quasiperiodic flux ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases of matter are known to be unstable against strong onsite disorder in one dimension. In this work, however, we propose that in the case of a topological ladder, an onsite quasiperiodic disorder under proper conditions, first destroys the initial topological phase and subsequently, induces another topological phase through a gap-closing point. Remarkably, by allowing a staggered flux piercing through the plaquettes of the ladder, the gapless point bifurcates into two gapless critical lines, resulting in a trivial gapped phase sandwiched between the two topological phases. This results in a scenario where the system first undergoes a transition from one topological phase to a trivial phase and then to the other topological phase as a function of the quasiperiodic disorder strength. Such disorder induced re-entrant topological phase transition reveals a phenomenon of direction reversal in the topological transport, which we identify through Thouless charge pumping.</description>

      <title>Absence of dissipation-free topological edge states in quadratic open fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a no-go theorem that generic quadratic open fermionic systems, governed by Lindblad master equations, cannot host dissipation-free topological edge states. Drawing an analogy to topological insulators and superconductors, we map the Lindbladian to a first-quantized matrix representation that encodes the band structure, whose zero-energy topological edge modes are exactly dissipation-free. This matrix, however, is always adiabatically connected to a topologically trivial matrix, even under symmetry constraints. We formulate s rigorous adiabatic path to demonstrate this property. Thus, there is no robust dissipation-free edge modes protected by the bulk topology in quadratic open fermions, under any unitary or anti-unitary symmetries. Our result applies to generic quadratic fermionic Lindbladians, requiring only gapped bulk and bounded spectrum for technical convenience. Our result establish a definitive boundary for the existence of robust topological phenomena in open fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of a Bilayer Superfluid with Interlayer Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the coupling between different degrees of freedom in many-body systems is a powerful technique for engineering novel phases of matter. We create a bilayer system of two-dimensional (2D) ultracold Bose gases and demonstrate the controlled generation of bulk coherence through tunable interlayer Josephson coupling. We probe the resulting correlation properties of both phase modes of the bilayer system: the symmetric phase mode is studied via a noise-correlation method, while the antisymmetric phase fluctuations are directly captured by matter-wave interferometry. The measured correlation functions for both of these modes exhibit a crossover from short-range to quasi-long-range order above a coupling-dependent critical point, thus providing direct evidence of bilayer superfluidity mediated by interlayer coupling. We map out the phase diagram and interpret it with renormalization-group theory and Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, we elucidate the underlying mechanism through the observation of suppressed vortex excitations in the antisymmetric mode.</description>

      <title>Temperature Measurement via Time Crystal Frequencies in One-Dimensional Quantum Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for temperature measurement by analyzing the frequency of generated time crystals in one-dimensional (1D) quantum droplets. The system consists of a binary Bose-Einstein condensate mixture confined in a driven quasi-periodic optical lattice (QOL) with repulsive cubic effective mean-field and attractive quadratic beyond-mean-field interactions. By solving the 1D extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation, we derive the exact analytical wavefunction and investigate the droplet dynamics under different driving conditions. Specifically, we examine three cases: (i) constant driving frequency with linearly increasing QOL depth, (ii) constant QOL depth with linearly varying driving frequency, and (iii) constant driving frequency with sinusoidally modulated QOL depth. Fast Fourier Transform analysis reveals harmonic density oscillations, confirming time crystal formation. Additionally, we establish a non-trivial correlation between time crystal frequency and system temperature, demonstrating that an increase in time crystal frequency leads to oscillatory variations in the magnitude of the droplet's negative temperature. Finally, numerical stability analysis confirms that the obtained solutions remain robust, ensuring their feasibility for experimental realization.</description>

      <title>Effective two- and three-body interactions between dressed impurities in a tilted double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact and scaling of effective interactions between two and three impurity atoms, induced by a bosonic medium, on their density distributions. To facilitate the detection of mediated interactions, we propose a setup where impurities are trapped in a tilted double-well potential, while the medium is confined to a ring. The tilt of the potential breaks the spatial inversion symmetry allowing us to exploit the population of the energetically elevated well as a probe of induced interactions. For two impurities, the interaction with the medium reduces the impurity population at the energetically elevated well, which we interpret as evidence of induced impurity-impurity attraction. Furthermore, the impact of an induced three-body interaction is unveiled by comparing the predictions of an effective three-body model with many-body simulations. We extend our study for induced interactions to a three-component mixture containing distinguishable impurities. Our results suggest pathways to detect and tune induced two- and three-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved dynamics of the amplitude Schmid-Higgs mode in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spatially-resolved dynamics of the collective amplitude Schmid-Higgs (SH) mode in disordered $s$-wave superconductors and fermionic superfluids. By analyzing the analytic structure of the zero-temperature SH susceptibility in the complex frequency plane, we find that when the coherence length greatly exceeds the mean free path: (i) the SH response at fixed wave vectors exhibits late-time oscillations decaying as $1/t^2$ with frequency $2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the superconducting gap; (ii) sub-diffusive oscillations with a dynamical exponent $z{=}4$ emerge at late times and large distances; and (iii) spatial oscillations at fixed frequency decay exponentially, with a period that diverges as the frequency approaches $2\Delta$ from above. When the coherence length is comparable to the mean free path, additional exponentially-decaying oscillations at fixed wave vectors appear with frequency above $2\Delta$. Furthermore, we show that the SH mode induces an extra peak in the third-harmonic generation current at finite wave-vectors. The frequency of this peak is shifted from the conventional resonance at $\Delta$, thereby providing an unambiguous signature of order parameter amplitude dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy dark matter halos with repulsive self-interactions: coherent soliton and halo vortex network with moderate self-coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the impact of repulsive self-interactions of moderate strength on fuzzy dark matter halos focusing on the core and granule size, the spatial dependence of the field's coherence, the turbulent vortex tangle and the oscillation frequency of the central soliton. Our analysis extends across the range from quantum-pressure-dominated to self-interaction-dominated stabilisation of the gravitationally bound solitonic core. Within this examined range of self-coupling strengths, we find that mergers with a given initial spatial configuration and an increasing self-interaction strength $g$, result in cores with increased size that exhibit a reduced central density and oscillate with decreased frequency. All of these features are in accordance with expectations from the study of isolated Self-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (SFDM) solitons. The characteristic size of the granules in the surrounding halo also grows but by a much smaller amount relative to the core; accordingly, typical inter-vortex distances are also only mildly affected. We also measure the total length of the vortex network which, although less robust, shows no clear dependence on increasing $g$ and no signs of decay over the timescales of our simulations. Measures of coherence of the field behave as in the non-interacting case, again clearly separating the coherent core form the quasi-coherent halo. Interestingly, we observe a relative increase of incoherent fluctuations coexisting with the coherent mode at the centre of the halo with increasing self-coupling strength, a phenomenon also observed in laboratory condensates at non-zero temperature.</description>
