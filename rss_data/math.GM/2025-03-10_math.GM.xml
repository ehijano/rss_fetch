      <title>The new Fermat-type factorization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let n be any odd natural number other than a perfect square, in this article it is demonstrated that this new factorization algorithm is much more efficient than the implementation technique [2,3 p.1470], described in this article, of the Fermat's factorization algorithm [1 p.6,3 p.1470], implementation technique which I call the Fermat's factorization method (like the title, translated into English, of the reference document [2] published in Italian) and which is, among the implementation techniques [1 pp.6-8,2,3 pp.1470-1471] of the Fermat's factorization algorithm, the one with which a smaller iterations number occurs to identify the factors, trivial or non-trivial, of n (except for the circumstance in which two factors, trivial or non-trivial, of n are so close to each other that they are identified at the 1st iteration with each of the implementation techniques of the Fermat's factorization algorithm). In fact, through the way in which the Euler's function [4] is applied to the Fermat's factorization method, we arrive at this new factorization algorithm with which we obtain the certain reduction in the iterations number (except for the cases in which two factors of n are so close to each other that they are identified at the 1st iteration with the Fermat's factorization method) compared to the iterations number that occurs with the Fermat's factorization method. Furthermore, in this article I represent the hypotheses field according to which it will eventually be possible to further reduce the iterations number. Finally and always in relation to this new factorization algorithm, in this article I represent in detail the limit iterations number, which is smaller than the iterations number that occurs to reach the condition x - y = 1 which characterizes the pair of trivial factors of n, beyond which it is no longer possible for pairs of non-trivial factors of n to occur.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04437v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents expressions for sums of powers of sine and cosine in terms of the basis for the field extension obtained by adjoining the sine or cosine to the field of rational numbers.</description>

      <title>Sums of Powers of Sine and Generalized Bernoulli Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We produce formulas for $$\sum_{j=1}^{2^{n-2}}\frac{1}{\sin^s\left(\frac{(2j-1)\pi}{2^n}\right)}$$ in terms of Generalized Bernoulli and Euler polynomials and use one of the formulas to produce a nice integral representation of the Riemann zeta function.</description>
