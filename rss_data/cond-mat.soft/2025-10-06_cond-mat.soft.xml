      <title>Turbulent Dynamics in Active Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate numerically the polar ordering dynamics in the active elastic solid model (AES) and find classic signatures of turbulent dynamics: power-law scaling for the energy spectrum and non-Gaussian statistics of velocity increments. However, there is no energy cascade, in line with previous findings for active turbulence in fluids. The results extend the concept of active turbulence to solid systems and are expected to be important for understanding active biological solids, such as bacterial colonies and migrating epithelial monolayers.</description>

      <title>Learning Microswimmer Collision Dynamics and Predicting Diffusivities using a Neural-Network-Assisted Boltzmann Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a neural-network--assisted Boltzmann framework that learns the binary-collision map of microswimmers from data and uses it to evaluate collision integrals efficiently. Using a representative model swimmer, the learned map provides quantitative predictions for rotational and translational diffusivities and allows a linear-stability analysis of the isotropic state against polar ordering in dilute suspensions. The resulting predictions closely match direct simulations in the dilute regime. The present approach is model agnostic: once two-body collision data are available -- either from simulations or experiments -- the same surrogate can be used to perform these evaluations across dilute conditions, as long as two-body collision processes dominate. Because the workflow relies only on pre- and post-collision statistics, it can be applied directly to a wide range of biological and synthetic colloidal swimmer systems.</description>

      <title>Heterogenous Dynamics in a Polymer Solution Revealed through Measurement of Ultraslow Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding solution-phase aggregation and dynamics in complex fluids is critical for material processing, yet widely used dynamic light scattering (DLS) fails for strongly attenuating systems such as conjugated polymers. We use X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to probe the dynamics of a polymer, PM7, in toluene, revealing unexpected oscillations in the autocorrelation function that show vertical flow during measurement. Despite the relatively low X-ray absorption, measured flow velocities scale with X-ray beam power and suggest convective transport. Our analyses reveal both mobile and static scatterers that together produce oscillatory, heterodyne features in the measured correlation functions. Finite element simulations predict flow velocities much larger than observed, suggesting that entanglements of the aggregates slow their motion. These results provide a direct measurement of ultra-slow convection and highlight the need to explicitly account for even modest beam heating in interpreting XPCS results. Moreover, the observation of distinct scatterer populations underscores the structural complexity of conjugated polymer solutions.</description>

      <title>Percolation and criticality of systems with competing interactions on Bethe lattices: limitations and potential strengths of cluster schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random clusters introduced by Fortuin and Kasteleyn (FK) and analyzed by Coniglio and Klein (CK) for Ising and related models have led first Swendsen and Wang and then Wolff to formulate remarkably efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes that weaken the critical slowing down. In frustrated models, however, no standard way to produce a comparable gain at small frustration -- let alone efficiently sample the large frustration regime -- has yet been identified. In order to understand why formulating appropriate cluster criteria for frustrated models has thus far been elusive, we here study minimal short-range attractive and long-range repulsive as well as spin-glass models on Bethe lattices. Using a generalization of the CK approach and the cavity-field method, the appropriateness and limitations of the FK--CK type clusters are identified. We find that a standard, constructive cluster scheme is then inoperable, and that the frustration range over which generalized FK--CK clusters are even definable is finite. These results demonstrate the futility of seeking constructive cluster schemes for frustrated systems but leaves open the possibility that alternate approaches could be devised.</description>

      <title>Capillary lubrication of a spherical particle near a fluid interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lubricated motion of an object near a deformable boundary presents striking subtleties arising from the coupling between the elasticity of the boundary and lubricated flow, including but not limited to the emergence of a lift force acting on the object despite the zero Reynolds number. In this study, we characterize the hydrodynamic forces and torques felt by a sphere translating in close proximity to a fluid interface, separating the viscous medium of the sphere's motion from an infinitely-more-viscous medium. We employ lubrication theory and perform a perturbation analysis in capillary compliance. The dominant response of the interface owing to surface tension results in a long-ranged interface deformation, which leads to a modification of the forces and torques with respect to the rigid reference case, that we characterise in details with scaling arguments and numerical integrations.</description>

      <title>Theory of Reversed Ripening in Active Phase Separating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ripening dynamics in passive systems is governed by the theory of Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW). Here, we present an analog theory for reversed ripening in active systems. To derive the dynamic theory for the droplet size distribution, we consider a minimal ternary emulsion with one active reaction, leading to one conserved quantity. Even for cases where single droplets constantly grow, coupling many droplets via the conserved density in the far field leads to a self-organized reversal of ripening and, thus, a monodisperse emulsion. For late times, we find a scaling ansatz leading to the collapse of the rescaled size distributions, different from the LSW theory. This scaling behavior arises from a stable fixed point in the single droplet dynamics and may capture the late-time behavior of many active matter systems exhibiting reversed ripening.</description>

      <title>Topological transition from a hopfion to a toron via flexoelectric self-polarization in chiral liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of topological defects in apolar chiral liquid crystals cause orientational distortions, leading to non-uniform strain. This non-uniform strain generates an electric polarization response due to the flexoelectric effect, which induces an internal electric field. Associated to this electric field is an electrostatic self-energy, which has a back-reaction on the director field. Calculation of this internal electric field and its resulting back-reaction on the director field is complicated. We propose a method to do such, adapting a method recently developed to study the magnetostatic self-interaction effect on skyrmions in chiral ferromagnets. Bloch skyrmions in chiral magnets are solenoidal and are unaffected by the magnetostatic self-interaction. However, Bloch skyrmions in liquid crystals yield non-solenoidal flexoelectric polarization and, thus, are affected by the electrostatic self-interaction. Additionally, as the flexoelectric coefficients are increased in strength, a transition from a hopfion to a toron is observed in three-dimensional confined systems.</description>

      <title>Tracer diffusion coefficients in a sheared granular gas. Exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffusion of tracer particles immersed in a granular gas under uniform shear flow (USF) is analyzed within the framework of the inelastic Boltzmann equation. Two different but complementary approaches are followed to achieve exact results. First, we maintain the structure of the Boltzmann collision operator but consider inelastic Maxwell models (IMM). Using IMM allows us to compute the collisional moments of the Boltzmann operator without knowing the velocity distribution functions of the granular binary mixture explicitly. Second, we consider a kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres (IHS). This kinetic model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of IHS. We solve the Boltzmann--Lorentz kinetic equation for tracer particles using a generalized Chapman--Enskog--like expansion around the shear flow distribution. This reference distribution retains all hydrodynamic orders in the shear rate. The mass flux is obtained to first order in the deviations of the concentration, pressure, and temperature from their values in the reference state. Due to the velocity space anisotropy induced by the shear flow, the mass flux is expressed in terms of tensorial quantities rather than the conventional scalar diffusion coefficients. The exact results derived here are compared with those previously obtained for IHS by using different approximations [JSTAT P02012 (2007)]. The comparison generally shows reasonable quantitative agreement, especially for IMM results. Finally, we study segregation by thermal diffusion as an application of the theory. The phase diagrams illustrating segregation are shown and compared with IHS results, demonstrating qualitative agreement.</description>
