      <title>Hacia una moderna "republica de las ideas" via un nuevo ecosistema de comunicacion cientifica (Toward a modern "Republic of Ideas" via a new Ecosystem of Scientific Communication)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contemporary academic ecosystem, heir to the Enlightenment's "Republic of Letters," finds itself in a state of profound and unsustainable crisis. That order, based on the free flow of correspondence and the disinterested pursuit of knowledge, has been supplanted by a system teetering under the weight of its own contradictions. This work embarks on a fundamental redesign to articulate an innovative and coherent framework for scientific communication. To this end, four distinct but complementary schools of thought are synthesized: From Ordoliberalism, we take the rigor of designing an "economic constitution" that prevents the concentration of power and fosters fair competition. From Humanistic Economics, we extract the telos, or normative purpose (human flourishing and shared prosperity). From Digital Humanism, we derive the technological ethos, ensuring that the infrastructure serves human dignity. Finally, from Decentralized Science (DeSci), we take the set of architectural tools (smart contracts, DAOs, tokens) capable of building this new order from the ground up. The narrative arc is deliberate: Part 1 offers an anatomy of decay, using the Uddin demand as a scalpel to dissect the economic, institutional, and epistemic pathologies of the current system. Part 2 articulates the philosophical constitution of the new republic. Part 3 details the architectural blueprint and technological infrastructure of this new order. Part 4 subjects this design to rigorous stress tests to forge its resilience and antifragility. Part 5 charts a strategic roadmap for the transition, a plausible path to navigate from the status quo to full community sovereignty. Finally, Part 6 brings the book full circle, returning to the foundational vision. This is a call to action to build the New Republic of Ideas that the pursuit of truth deserves in the 21st century.</description>
