      <title>Classification of four-dimensional anti-dendriform algebras whose associated associative algebra has the center of dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the classification of anti-dendriform algebras that are associated with associativity. They are characterized as algebras with two operations whose sum is associative. In the paper all four-dimensional complex anti-dendriform algebras associated to four-dimensional associative algebras with one-dimensional center are classified</description>

      <title>Prime rings having nontrivial centralizers of (skew) traces of Lie ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a prime ring with center $Z(R)$ and with involution $*$. Given an additive subgroup $A$ of $R$, let $T(A):=\{x+x^*\mid x\in A\}$ and $K_0(A):=\{x-x^*\mid x\in A\}$. Let $L$ be a non-abelian Lie ideal of $R$. It is proved that if $d$ is a nonzero derivation of $R$ satisfying $d(T(L))=0$ (resp. $d(K_0(L))=0$), then $T(R)^2\subseteq Z(R)$ (resp. $K_0(R)^2\subseteq Z(R)$). These results are applied to the study of $d(T(M))=0$ and $d(K_0(M))=0$ for noncentral $*$-subrings $M$ of a division ring $R$ such that $M$ is invariant under all inner automorphisms of $R$, and for noncentral additive subgroups $M$ of a prime ring $R$ containing a nontrivial idempotent such that $M$ is invariant under all special inner automorphisms of $R$. The obtained results generalize some main theorems in recent three papers due to M. Chacron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper explores the concept of the rank of a bicomplex matrix, delving into four distinct types of ranks and investigating conditions under which these ranks are equivalent. It also defines and analyzes the concept of idempotent row space and idempotent column space of a bicomplex matrix. Some examples and counter examples have been presented to substantiate the study.</description>

      <title>On structural connections between sandpile monoids and weighted Leavitt path algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the relations between a sandpile graph, its sandpile monoid and the weighted Leavitt path algebra associated with it. Namely, we show that the lattice of all idempotents of the sandpile monoid $\text{SP}(E)$ of a sandpile graph $E$ is both isomorphic to the lattice of all nonempty saturated hereditary subsets of $E$, the lattice of all order-ideals of $\text{SP}(E)$ and the lattice of all ideals of the weighted Leavitt path algebra $L_{K}(E, \omega)$ generated by vertices. Also, we describe the sandpile group of a sandpile graph $E$ via archimedean classes of $\text{SP}(E)$, and prove that all maximal subgroups of $\text{SP}(E)$ are exactly the Grothendieck groups of these archimedean classes. Finally, we give the structure of the Leavitt path algebra $L_{K}(E)$ of a sandpile graph $E$ via a finite chain of graded ideals being invariant under every graded automorphism of $L_{K}(E)$, and completely describe the structure of $L_{K}(E)$ such that the lattice of all idempotents of $\text{SP}(E)$ is a chain. Consequently, we completely describe the structure of the weighted Leavitt path algebra of a sandpile graph $E$ such that $\text{SP}(E)$ has exactly two idempotents.</description>

      <title>An Upper Bound on the Length of an Algebra and Its Application to the Group Algebra of the Dihedral Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal A$ be an $\mathbb F$-algebra and let $\mathcal S$ be its generating set. The length of $\mathcal S$ is the smallest number $k$ such that $\mathcal A$ equals the $\mathbb F$-linear span of all products of length at most $k$ of elements from $\mathcal S$. The length of $\mathcal A$, denoted by $l(\mathcal A)$, is defined to be the maximal length of its generating set. In this paper, it is shown that the $l(\mathcal A)$ does not exceed the maximum of $\dim \mathcal A / 2$ and $m(\mathcal A)-1$, where $m(\mathcal A)$ is the largest degree of the minimal polynomial among all elements of the algebra $\mathcal A$. For arbitrary odd $n$, it is proven that the length of the group algebra of the dihedral group of order $2n$ equals $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and characterise completely dg-separable dg-extensions $\varphi:(A,d_A)\rightarrow (B,d_B)$. We completely characterise the case of graded commutative dg-division algebras in characteristic different from $2$. We prove that for a dg-separable extension a short exact sequence of dg-modules over $(B,d_B)$ splits if and only if the restriction to $(A,d_A)$ splits, giving that $(B,d_B)$ is acyclic and $\ker(d_B)$ graded-semisimple in case $(A,d_A)$ is a graded commutative dg-division algebra with $d_A=0$.</description>

      <title>Permutation clones that preserve relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutation clones generalise permutation groups and clone theory. We investigate permutation clones defined by relations, or equivalently, the automorphism groups of powers of relations. We find many structural results on the lattice of all relationally defined permutation clones on a finite set. We find all relationally defined permutation clones on two element set.
  We show that all maximal borrow closed permutation clones are either relationally defined or cancellatively defined.
  Permutation clones generalise clones to permutations of $A^n$. Emil Je\v{r}\'{a}bek found the dual structure to be weight mappings $A^k\rightarrow M$ to a commutative monoid, generalising relations. We investigate the case when the dual object is precisely a relation, equivalently, that $M={\mathbb B}$, calling these relationally defined permutation clones.
  We determine the number of relationally defined permutation clones on two elements (13).
  We note that many infinite classes of clones collapse when looked at as permutation clones.</description>

      <title>Commuting graphs of completely simple semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the commuting graph of a Rees matrix semigroup over a group and investigate its properties: diameter, clique number, girth, chromatic number and knit degree. The maximum size of a commutative subsemigroup of a Rees matrix semigroup over a group is presented, and its largest commutative subsemigroups are exhibited. We use the knowledge we obtained from the commuting graph of this semigroup construction to deduce results regarding the properties of commuting graphs of completely simple semigroups. We also characterize the graphs that arise as commuting graphs of completely simple semigroups. In the process of obtaining these results we are also able to restrict the possible values for some properties of commuting graphs of groups.</description>

      <title>Matsumoto--Yor processes on Jordan algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The process $(\int_0^t e^{2b_s-b_t}\, ds\ ;\ t\ge 0)$ where $b$ is a real Brownian motion is known as the geometric 2M-X Matsumoto--Yor process, and it enjoys a miraculous Markov property. We provide a generalization of this process to the context of Jordan algebras, and we prove the Markov property.
  Our Markov process occurs as a limit of a sequence of Markov chains on the cone of squares which involve AX+B Markov chains whose invariant probability measures classically provide a Dufresne--type identity for a perpetuity. In particular, the paper gives in a generalization to any symmetric cones of the initial matrix generalization of Matsumoto--Yor process and Dufresne identity by Rider--Valko.</description>

      <title>A Model Theoretic Perspective on Matrix Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.09024v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper natural necessary and sufficient conditions for quantifier elimination of matrix rings $M_n(K)$ in the language of rings expanded by two unary functions, naming the trace and transposition, are identified. This is used together with invariant theory to prove quantifier elimination when $K$ is an intersection of real closed fields. On the other hand, it is shown that finding a natural \textit{definable} expansion with quantifier elimination of the theory of $M_n({\mathbb C})$ is closely related to the infamous simultaneous conjugacy problem in matrix theory. Finally, for various natural structures describing dimension-free matrices it is shown that no such elimination results can hold by establishing undecidability results.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this short note is to completely answer Questions 2.34 and 2.35 of arXiv:1806.01127. In particular, we show that a finite strong-nil skew brace $B$ of abelian type need not be right-nilpotent, but that this is the case if~$B$ is of nilpotent type and $b\ast b=0$ for all $b\in B$ (our examples show that this is the best possible result).</description>

      <title>Topological closure of formal power series ideals and application to topological rewriting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate formal power series ideals and their relationship to topological rewriting theory. Since commutative formal power series algebras are Zariski rings, their ideals are closed for the adic topology defined by the maximal ideal generated by the indeterminates. We provide a constructive proof of this result which, given a formal power series in the topological closure of an ideal, consists in computing a cofactor representation of the series with respect to a standard basis of the ideal. We apply this result in the context of topological rewriting theory, where two natural notions of confluence arise: topological confluence and infinitary confluence. We give explicit examples illustrating that in general, infinitary confluence is a strictly stronger notion than topological confluence. Using topological closure of ideals, we finally show that in the context of rewriting theory on commutative formal power series, infinitary and topological confluences are equivalent when the monomial order considered is compatible with the degree.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macaulay representations of Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras of dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of a tilting or silting object is an important feature for an algebraic triangulated category since it gives an equivalence with the derived category of a ring. By applying tilting theory, we study Cohen-Macaulay representations of $\mathbb N$-graded Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras $A=\bigoplus_{i\in \mathbb N}A_i$, where do not assume that $A_0$ is a field. This is a large class of noncommutative Gorenstein rings containing Gorenstein orders. In this paper, we concentrate on the case where $A$ has dimension one. Under the assumptions that $A$ is ring-indecomposable and $A_0$ has finite global dimension, we show that the stable category $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ always admits an (explicitly constructed) silting object. We also show that $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a tilting object if and only if either $A$ is Artin-Schelter regular or the average Gorenstein parameter $p^A_\mathrm{av} \in {\mathbb Q}$ of $A$ is non-positive. These results are far-reaching generalizations of the results of Buchweitz, Iyama, and Yamaura. We give two different proofs of the second result; one is based on Orlov-type semiorthogonal decompositions, and the other is based on a more direct calculation. We apply our results to a Gorenstein tiled order $A$ to prove that $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}A$ is equivalent to the derived category of the incidence algebra of an (explicitly constructed) poset. We also apply our results and Koszul duality to prove that the derived category $\mathsf{D}^\mathrm{b}(\operatorname{\mathsf{qgr}} B)$ of a smooth noncommutative projective quadric hypersurface $\operatorname{\mathsf{qgr}} B$ admits an (explicitly constructed) tilting object, which contains the tilting object of $\operatorname{\underline{\mathsf{CM}}}^{\mathbb Z}B$ due to Smith and Van den Bergh as a direct summand.</description>

      <title>On left braces in which every subbrace is an ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce and study the class of all left braces in which every subbrace is an ideal. We call them Dedekind left braces. It is proved that every finite Dedekind left brace is centrally nilpotent. Structural results about Dedekind left braces and a complete description of those ones whose additive group is elementary abelian are also shown. As a consequence, every hypermultipermutational Dedekind left brace whose additive group is elementary abelian is multipermutational of level $2$. A new class of left braces, the extraspecial left braces, is introduced and plays a prominent role in our approach.</description>
