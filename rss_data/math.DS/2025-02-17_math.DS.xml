      <title>On Cantor sets with arbitrary Hausdorff and packing measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every couple of Hausdorff functions $\psi, \varphi$ verifying some mild assumptions, we construct a compact subset $ K $ of the Baire space such that the $\varphi$-Hausdorff measure and the $\psi$-packing measure on $ K $ are both finite and positive. We then embed such examples in any infinite-dimensional Banach space to answer positively to a question of Fan on the existence of metric spaces with arbitrary scales.</description>

      <title>Contact de Rham cohomology and Hodge structures transversal to the Reeb foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\beta$ be a contact form on a compact smooth manifold $X$ and $v_\beta$ its Reeb vector field. The paper applies general results of different authors about Hodge structures that are transversal to a given foliation to the special case of $1$-dimensional foliation generated by the Reeb flow $v_\beta$. Theses applications are available for the Reeb flows on {\sf closed} manifolds $X$. In contrast, for the Reeb flows on manifolds with boundary, little is known about the Hodge structures transversal to the $v_\beta$-flow. We are trying to fill in this gap.\smallskip
  The de Rham differential complex $\Omega_{\mathsf b}^\ast(X, v_\beta)$ of, so called, {\sf basic} relative to $v_\beta$-flow differential forms is in the focus of this investigation. By definition, the basic forms vanish when being contracted with $v_\beta$, and so do their differentials.
  In particular, we investigate when the $2$-form $d\beta$ and its powers deliver nontrivial elements in the basic de Rham cohomology $H^\ast_{\mathsf{basic}\,d\mathcal{R}}(X, v_\beta)$ of the differential complex $\Omega_{\mathsf b}^\ast(X, v_\beta)$. Answers to these questions seem to contrast sharply the cases of a closed $X$ and a $X$ with boundary. %we prove that when a $v_\beta$-flow admits a Lyapunov function, then the basic de Rham cohomology $H^\ast_{\mathsf{basic}\,d\mathcal{R}}(X, v_\beta)$ of the complex $\Omega_{\mathsf b}^\ast(X, v_\beta)$ are topological invariants of $X$.
  On the other hand, building on work of Ra\'{z}ny \cite{Raz}, we show that on closed manifolds, equipped with a transversal to the Reeb flow Hodge structure that satisfies the {\sf Basic Hard Lefschetz property}, the basic de Rham cohomology $H^\ast_{\mathsf{basic}\,d\mathcal{R}}(X, v_\beta)$ are topological invariants of $X$.</description>

      <title>A note on limsup sets of annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the set of points in infinitely many max-norm annuli centred at rational points in $\mathbb R^{n}$. We give Jarn\'ik-Besicovitch type theorems for this set in terms of Hausdorff dimension. Interestingly, we find that if the outer radii are decreasing sufficiently slowly, dependent only on the dimension $n$, and the thickness of the annuli is decreasing rapidly then the dimension of the set tends towards $n-1$. We also consider various other forms of annuli including rectangular annuli and quasi-annuli described by the difference between balls of two different norms. Our results are deduced through a novel combination of a version of Cassel's Scaling Lemma and a generalisation of the Mass Transference Principle, namely the Mass transference principle from rectangles to rectangles due to Wang and Wu (Math. Ann. 2021).</description>

      <title>Algorithms and topological invariants for dynamic systems. III. Algorithms for Recognition and Classification of 2-Dimensional Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct algorithms and topological invariants that allow us to distinguish the topological type of a surface, as well as functions and vector fields for their topological equivalence. In the first part (arXiv:2501.15657), we discused basic concepts of diferential topology. In the second part (arXiv:2502.00506 ) we discused the main discrete topological structures used in the topological theory of dynamic systems. In third part we construct algorithms that allow us recognise 2-manifolds and 3-manifolds in simplicial complexes and regular CW-complex and detreminate topological type for 2-manifolds (connectivity, type of orientability, genus, number of boundary component).</description>

      <title>Discovering Polynomial and Quadratic Structure in Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems with quadratic or polynomial drift exhibit complex dynamics, yet compared to nonlinear systems in general form, are often easier to analyze, simulate, control, and learn. Results going back over a century have shown that the majority of nonpolynomial nonlinear systems can be recast in polynomial form, and their degree can be reduced further to quadratic. This process of polynomialization/quadratization reveals new variables (in most cases, additional variables have to be added to achieve this) in which the system dynamics adhere to that specific form, which leads us to discover new structures of a model. This chapter summarizes the state of the art for the discovery of polynomial and quadratic representations of finite-dimensional dynamical systems. We review known existence results, discuss the two prevalent algorithms for automating the discovery process, and give examples in form of a single-layer neural network and a phenomenological model of cell signaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.00544v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convergence analysis for general degenerate and non-reversible stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We apply the Lyapunov method to analyze the Fokker-Planck equation, in which the Lyapunov functional is chosen as a weighted relative Fisher information functional. We derive a structure condition and formulate the Lyapunov constant explicitly. We prove the exponential convergence result for the probability density function towards its invariant distribution in the $L_1$ distance. Two examples are presented: underdamped Langevin dynamics with variable diffusion matrices and three oscillator chain models with nearest-neighbor couplings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we shall use the abstract bifurcation theorems developed by the author in previous papers to study bifurcations of solutions for Lagrangian systems on manifolds linearly or nonlinearly dependent on parameters under various boundary value conditions. As applications, many bifurcation results for geodesics on Finsler and Riemannian manifolds are derived.</description>

      <title>On the Folklore set and Dirichlet spectrum for matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Folklore set of Dirichlet improvable matrices in $\mathbb R^{m\times n}$ which are neither singular nor badly approximable. We prove the non-emptiness for all positive integer pairs $m,n$ apart from $\{m,n\}=\{ 1,1\}$ and $\{m,n\}=\{ 2,3\}$ in a constructive manner. For a wide range of integer pairs $(m,n)$ we construct subsets of the Folklore set with an exact prescribed Dirichlet constant (in some right neighbourhood of $0$). This enables us to provide information on the Dirichlet Spectrum of matrices. The key technique of our construction is to build first vectors of a given Diophantine type, and then to show that most `liftings' to matrices will preserve this Diophantine type. This is a variant of a method introduced by Moshchevitin for uniform approximation. Our technique is often also applicable to arbitrary norms. As a corollary, we obtain lower bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of these sets. These statements complement previous results of the middle-named author (Selecta Math. 2023), Beresnevich et. al. (Adv. Math. 2023), and Das et. al. (Adv. Math. 2024).</description>

Abstract: We study the class of cubic Hamiltonian vector fields whose associated Kahan-Hirota-Kimura (KHK) maps preserve the original Hamiltonian function. Our analysis focuses on these fields in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^4$, extending to a family of fields in $\mathbb{R}^6$. Additionally, we investigate various properties of these fields, including the existence of additional first integrals of a specific type, their role as Lie symmetries of the corresponding KHK map, and the symplecticity of these maps.</description>

      <title>Stochastic volatility model with long memory for water quantity-quality dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Water quantity and quality are vital indices for assessing fluvial environments. These indices are highly variable over time and include sub-exponential memory, where the influences of past events persist over long durations. Moreover, water quantity and quality are interdependent, with the former affecting the latter. However, this relationship has not been thoroughly studied from the perspective of long-memory processes, which this paper aims to address. We propose applying a new stochastic volatility model, a system of infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations, to describe dynamic asset prices in finance and economics. Although the stochastic volatility model was originally developed for phenomena unrelated to the water environment, its mathematical universality allows for an interdisciplinary reinterpretation: river discharge is analogous to volatility, and water quality to asset prices. Moreover, the model's infinite-dimensional nature enables the analytical description of sub-exponential memory. The moments and autocorrelations of the model are then obtained analytically. We mathematically analyze the stochastic volatility model and investigate its applicability to the dynamics of water quantity and quality. Finally, we apply the model to real time-series data from a river in Japan, demonstrating that it effectively captures both the memory and the correlation of water quality indices to river discharge. This approach, grounded in infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equations, represents a novel contribution to the modelling and analysis of environmental systems where long memory processes play a role.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptation and learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain can rapidly adapt to new contexts and learn from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence algorithms have struggled to mimic. Inspired by oscillatory rhythms of the mechanical structures of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm that is based on oscillations in link strengths and associates learning with the coordination of these oscillations. We find that this paradigm yields rapid adaptation and learning in artificial neural networks. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, endowing the network with the ability to sense subtle context changes in an unsupervised manner. In other words, the network generates the missing contextual tokens required to perform as a generalist AI architecture capable of predicting dynamics in multiple contexts. Oscillations also allow the network to extrapolate dynamics to never-seen-before contexts. These capabilities make our learning paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of learning and cognition. Furthermore, learning through link coordination is agnostic to the specifics of the neural network architecture, hence our study opens the door for introducing rapid adaptation and learning capabilities into leading AI models.</description>
