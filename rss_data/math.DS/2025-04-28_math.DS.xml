      <title>The dimension spectrum of the infinitely generated Apollonian gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the infinitely generated Apollonian gasket has full Hausdorff dimension spectrum. Our proof, which is computer assisted, relies on an iterative technique introduced by the first three authors in [3] and on a flexible method for rigorously estimating Hausdorff dimensions of limit sets of conformal iterated function systems, which we recently developed in [5]. Another key ingredient in our proof is obtaining reasonably sized distortion constants for the (infinite) Apollonian iterated function system.</description>

      <title>Etale equivalence relations with certain prescribed torsion in their homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a non-cyclic simple dimension group D and a subgroup E of Q/Z, we produce a minimal \'etale equivalence relation R such that H_0(\R) is isomorphic to D \oplus E, where H_0(R) denotes the zeroth homology group of R. The equivalence relation R arises by combining tail-equivalence on a Bratteli diagram with a partial homeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Group actions with almost normal stabilizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider minimal group actions of countable groups on compact Hausdorff spaces by homeomorphisms. We show that the existence of a point with finite stabilizer imposes strong restrictions on the dynamics: the residual set of points then has stabilizers conjugate to the same almost normal subgroup of the acting group. Under certain conditions on the acting group such an action also has no essential holonomy. If the acting group is residually finite, we show that every group action with finite almost normal stabilizers with no essential holonomy arises as an almost finite-to-one factor of an essentially free action.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Control of Additional Food Provided Prey-Predator Systems exhibiting Holling Type-III Functional Response and Intra-specific Competition among Predators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of predator-prey systems influenced by intra-specific competition and additional food resources have increasingly become a subject of rigorous study in the realm of mathematical biology. In this study, we consider an additional food provided prey-predator model exhibiting Holling type-III functional response and the intra-specific competition among predators. We prove the existence and uniqueness of global positive solutions for the proposed model. We study the existence and stability of equilibrium points and further explore the possible bifurcations. We numerically depict the presence of Hysteresis loop in the system. We further study the global dynamics of the system and discuss the consequences of providing additional food. Later, we do the time-optimal control studies with respect to the quality and quantity of additional food as control variables by transforming the independent variable in the control system. We show that the findings of these dynamics and control studies emphasises the role of additional food and intra-specific competition in bio-control of pests.</description>

      <title>Recent progress on pointwise normality of self-similar measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is an exposition of recent results and methods on the prevalence of normal numbers in the support of self-similar measures on the line. We also provide an essentially self-contained proof of a recent Theorem that the Rajchman property (decay of the Fourier transform) implies that typical elements in the support of the measure are normal to all bases; as no decay rate is required, this improves the classical criterion of Davenport, Erdos, and LeVeque (1964). Open problems regarding effective equidistribution, non-integer bases, and higher order correlations, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Ergodic theorems for bilinear averages, Roth's Theorem and Corners along fractional powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every $c\in(1,23/22)$, every probability space $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$ equipped with two commuting measure-preserving transformations $T,S\colon X\to X$ and every $f,g\in L^{\infty}_{\mu}(X)$ we have that the $L^2_{\mu}(X)$-limit \[ \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf(T^{\lfloor n^c\rfloor}x)g(S^{\lfloor n^c\rfloor}x) \] equals the $L^2_{\mu}(X)$-limit $\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^Nf(T^{n}x)g(S^{n}x)$. The approach is based on the author's recently developed technique which may be thought of as a change of variables. We employ it to establish several new results along fractional powers including a Roth-type result for patterns of the form $x,x+\lfloor y^c \rfloor,x+2\lfloor y^c \rfloor$ as well as its ''corner'' counterpart. The quantitative nature of the former result allows us to recover the analogous one in the primes. Our considerations give partial answers to Problem 29 and Problem 30 from Frantzikinakis' open problems survey on multiple ergodic averages. Notably, we cover more general sparse orbits $(\lfloor h(n)\rfloor)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, where $h$ belongs to the class of the so-called $c$-regularly varying functions, addressing for example even the orbit $(\lfloor n\log n\rfloor)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of polynomial generalized Li\'enard system near the origin and infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all topological phase portraits of the polynomial generalized Li\'enard system, determined by three arbitrary polynomials, at the origin and the infinity. This yields a complete characterization of monodromy at the origin and the infinity. Moreover, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the local center via Cherkas' method. When the origin is the only equilibrium and it is a center, there are 5 global phase portraits, including two types of global center. Further, we prove that the global center is not isochronous.</description>

      <title>Heat kernels, intrinsic contractivity and ergodicity of discrete-time Markov chains killed by potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study discrete-time Markov chains on countably infinite state spaces, which are perturbed by rather general confining (i.e.\ growing at infinity) potentials. Using a discrete-time analogue of the classical Feynman--Kac formula, we obtain two-sided estimates for the $n$-step heat kernels $u_n(x,y)$ of the perturbed chain. These estimates are of the form $u_n(x,y)\asymp \lambda_0^n\phi_0(x)\widehat\phi_0(y)+F_n(x,y)$, where $\phi_0$ (and $\widehat\phi_0$) are the (dual) eigenfunctions for the lowest eigenvalue $\lambda_0$; the perturbation $F_n(x,y)$ is explicitly given, and it vanishes if either $x$ or $y$ is in a bounded set. The key assumptions are that the chain is uniformly lazy and that the \enquote{direct step property} (DSP) is satisfied. This means that the chain is more likely to move from state $x$ to state $y$ in a single step rather than in two or more steps. Starting from the form of the heat kernel estimate, we define the intrinsic (or ground-state transformed) chains and we introduce time-dependent ultracontractivity notions -- asymptotic and progressive intrinsic ultracontractivity -- which we can link to the growth behaviour of the confining potential; this allows us to consider arbitrarily slow growing potentials. These new notions of ultracontractivity also lead to a characterization of uniform (quasi-)ergodicity of the perturbed and the ground-state transformed Markov chains. At the end of the paper, we give various examples that illustrate how our findings relate to existing models, e.g.\ nearest-neighbour walks on infinite graphs, subordinate processes or non-reversible Markov chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use generalized Chebyshev polynomials, associated with the root system $A_2$, to provide a new semi-iterative method for accelerating simple iterative methods for solving linear systems. We apply this semi-iterative method to the Jacobi method, and give an example. There are certain restrictions but the resulting acceleration is rather high.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study a one parameter family of rational maps obtained by applying the Chebyshev-Halley root finding algorithms. We show that the dynamics near parameters where the family presents some degeneracy might be understood from the point of view of singular perturbations. More precisely, we relate the dynamics of those maps with the one of the McMullen family $M_{\lambda}(z)=z^4 + \lambda /z^2$, using quasi-conformal surgery.</description>

      <title>New results on tilings via cup products and Chern characters on tiling spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cohomology rings of tiling spaces $\Omega$ given by cubical substitutions. While there have been many calculations before of cohomology groups of such tiling spaces, the innovation here is that we use computer-assisted methods to compute the cup-product structure. This leads to examples of substitution tilings with isomorphic cohomology groups but different cohomology rings. Part of the interest in studying the cup product comes from Bellissard's gap-labeling conjecture, which is known to hold in dimensions $\le 3$, but where a proof is known in dimensions $\ge 4$ only when the Chern character from $K^0(\Omega)$ to $H^*(\Omega,\mathbb{Q})$ lands in $H^*(\Omega,\mathbb{Z})$. Computation of the cup product on cohomology often makes it possible to compute the Chern character. We introduce a natural generalization of the gap-labeling conjecture, called the equivariant gap-labeling conjecture, which applies to tilings with a finite symmetry group. Again this holds in dimensions $\le 3$, but we are able to show that it fails in general in dimensions $\ge 4$. This, plus some of our cup product calculations, makes it plausible that the gap-labeling conjecture might fail in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the local stability of the elapsed-time model in terms of the transmission delay and interconnection strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elapsed-time model describes the behavior of interconnected neurons through the time since their last spike. It is an age-structured non-linear equation in which age corresponds to the elapsed time since the last discharge, and models many interesting dynamics depending on the type of interactions between neurons. We investigate the linearized stability of this equation by considering a discrete delay, which accounts for the possibility of a synaptic delay due to the time needed to transmit a nerve impulse from one neuron to the rest of the ensemble. We state a stability criterion that allows to determine if a steady state is linearly stable or unstable depending on the delay and the interaction between neurons. Our approach relies on the study of the asymptotic behavior of related Volterra-type integral equations in terms of theirs Laplace transforms. The analysis is complemented with numerical simulations illustrating the change of stability of a steady state in terms of the delay and the intensity of interconnections.</description>

      <title>Averaging principle for slow-fast systems of rough differential equations via controlled paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the strong averaging principle for a slow-fast system of rough differential equations. The slow and the fast component of the system are driven by a rather general random rough path and Brownian rough path, respectively. These two driving noises are assumed to be independent. A prominent example of the driver of the slow component is fractional Brownian rough path with Hurst parameter between 1/3 and 1/2. We work in the framework of controlled path theory, which is one of the most widely-used frameworks in rough path theory. To prove our main theorem, we carry out Khas'minskii's time-discretizing method in this framework.</description>

      <title>Line zonotopes: A tool for state estimation and fault diagnosis of unbounded and descriptor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10239v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes new methods for set-based state estimation and active fault diagnosis (AFD) of linear descriptor systems (LDS). Unlike intervals, ellipsoids, and zonotopes, constrained zonotopes (CZs) can directly incorporate linear static constraints on state variables - typical of descriptor systems - into their mathematical representation, leading to less conservative enclosures. However, for LDS that are unstable or not fully observable, a bounded representation cannot ensure a valid enclosure of the states over time. To address this limitation, we introduce line zonotopes, a new representation for unbounded sets that retains key properties of CZs, including polynomial time complexity reduction methods, while enabling the description of strips, hyperplanes, and the entire n-dimensional Euclidean space. This extension not only generalizes the use of CZs to unbounded settings but can also enhance set-based estimation and AFD in both stable and unstable scenarios. Additionally, we extend the AFD method for LDS from Rego et al. (2020) to operate over reachable tubes rather than solely on the reachable set at the final time of the considered horizon. This reduces conservatism in input separation and enables more accurate fault diagnosis based on the entire output sequence. The advantages of the proposed methods over existing CZ-based approaches are demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>New Formula for Entropy Solutions for Scalar Hyperbolic Conservation Laws with Flux Functions of Convexity Degeneracy and Global Dynamic Patterns of Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with a new solution formula and its applications to the analysis of properties of entropy solutions of the Cauchy problem for one-dimensional scalar hyperbolic conservation laws, wherein the flux functions exhibit convexity degeneracy and the initial data are in $L^\infty$. We first introduce/validate the novel formula for entropy solutions for the Cauchy problem, which generalizes the Lax-Oleinik formula. Then, by employing this formula, we obtain a series of fine properties of entropy solutions and discover several new structures and phenomena, which include: (i) Series of results on the fine structures of entropy solutions, especially including the new criteria for all six types of initial waves for the Cauchy problem, the new structures of entropy solutions inside the backward characteristic triangle, and the new features of the formation and development of shocks such as all five types of continuous shock generation points, along with their criteria and the optimal regularities of the corresponding resulting shocks; (ii) Series of results on the global structures of entropy solutions, including the four new invariants of entropy solutions, the new criteria for the locations and speeds of divides, and the exact determination of the global structures of entropy solutions; (iii) Series of new results on the asymptotic behaviors of entropy solutions, including the asymptotic profiles and decay rates of entropy solutions for initial data in $L^\infty$, respectively in the $L^\infty$--norm and the $L^p_{{\rm loc}}$--norm. Through these results above, we obtain the global dynamic patterns of entropy solutions for scalar hyperbolic conservation laws with the flux functions satisfying (1.3) and general initial data in $L^\infty$. Moreover, the new solution formula is also extended to more general scalar hyperbolic conservation laws.</description>
