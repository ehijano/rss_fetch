      <title>Ordinal Classification with Distance Regularization for Robust Brain Age Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Age is one of the major known risk factors for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Detecting AD early is crucial for effective treatment and preventing irreversible brain damage. Brain age, a measure derived from brain imaging reflecting structural changes due to aging, may have the potential to identify AD onset, assess disease risk, and plan targeted interventions. Deep learning-based regression techniques to predict brain age from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans have shown great accuracy recently. However, these methods are subject to an inherent regression to the mean effect, which causes a systematic bias resulting in an overestimation of brain age in young subjects and underestimation in old subjects. This weakens the reliability of predicted brain age as a valid biomarker for downstream clinical applications. Here, we reformulate the brain age prediction task from regression to classification to address the issue of systematic bias. Recognizing the importance of preserving ordinal information from ages to understand aging trajectory and monitor aging longitudinally, we propose a novel ORdinal Distance Encoded Regularization (ORDER) loss that incorporates the order of age labels, enhancing the model's ability to capture age-related patterns. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that this framework reduces systematic bias, outperforms state-of-art methods by statistically significant margins, and can better capture subtle differences between clinical groups in an independent AD dataset. Our implementation is publicly available at ***.</description>

      <title>Medical Unlearnable Examples: Securing Medical Data from Unauthorized Traning via Sparsity-Aware Local Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, there has been a significant increase in the generation and storage of sensitive medical data. This abundance of data, in turn, has propelled the advancement of medical AI technologies. However, concerns about unauthorized data exploitation, such as training commercial AI models, often deter researchers from making their invaluable datasets publicly available. In response to the need to protect this hard-to-collect data while still encouraging medical institutions to share it, one promising solution is to introduce imperceptible noise into the data. This method aims to safeguard the data against unauthorized training by inducing degradation in model generalization. Although existing methods have shown commendable data protection capabilities in general domains, they tend to fall short when applied to biomedical data, mainly due to their failure to account for the sparse nature of medical images. To address this problem, we propose the Sparsity-Aware Local Masking (SALM) method, a novel approach that selectively perturbs significant pixel regions rather than the entire image as previous strategies have done. This simple-yet-effective approach significantly reduces the perturbation search space by concentrating on local regions, thereby improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of data protection for biomedical datasets characterized by sparse features. Besides, we have demonstrated that SALM maintains the essential characteristics of the data, ensuring its clinical utility remains uncompromised. Our extensive experiments across various datasets and model architectures demonstrate that SALM effectively prevents unauthorized training of deep-learning models and outperforms previous state-of-the-art data protection methods.</description>

      <title>How Suboptimal is Training rPPG Models with Videos and Targets from Different Body Sites?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote camera measurement of the blood volume pulse via photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a compelling technology for scalable, low-cost, and accessible assessment of cardiovascular information. Neural networks currently provide the state-of-the-art for this task and supervised training or fine-tuning is an important step in creating these models. However, most current models are trained on facial videos using contact PPG measurements from the fingertip as targets/ labels. One of the reasons for this is that few public datasets to date have incorporated contact PPG measurements from the face. Yet there is copious evidence that the PPG signals at different sites on the body have very different morphological features. Is training a facial video rPPG model using contact measurements from another site on the body suboptimal? Using a recently released unique dataset with synchronized contact PPG and video measurements from both the hand and face, we can provide precise and quantitative answers to this question. We obtain up to 40 % lower mean squared errors between the waveforms of the predicted and the ground truth PPG signals using state-of-the-art neural models when using PPG signals from the forehead compared to using PPG signals from the fingertip. We also show qualitatively that the neural models learn to predict the morphology of the ground truth PPG signal better when trained on the forehead PPG signals. However, while models trained from the forehead PPG produce a more faithful waveform, models trained from a finger PPG do still learn the dominant frequency (i.e., the heart rate) well.</description>

      <title>Solving General Noisy Inverse Problem via Posterior Sampling: A Policy Gradient Viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving image inverse problems (e.g., super-resolution and inpainting) requires generating a high fidelity image that matches the given input (the low-resolution image or the masked image). By using the input image as guidance, we can leverage a pretrained diffusion generative model to solve a wide range of image inverse tasks without task specific model fine-tuning. To precisely estimate the guidance score function of the input image, we propose Diffusion Policy Gradient (DPG), a tractable computation method by viewing the intermediate noisy images as policies and the target image as the states selected by the policy. Experiments show that our method is robust to both Gaussian and Poisson noise degradation on multiple linear and non-linear inverse tasks, resulting into a higher image restoration quality on FFHQ, ImageNet and LSUN datasets.</description>

      <title>A General Method to Incorporate Spatial Information into Loss Functions for GAN-based Super-resolution Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown great performance on super-resolution problems since they can generate more visually realistic images and video frames. However, these models often introduce side effects into the outputs, such as unexpected artifacts and noises. To reduce these artifacts and enhance the perceptual quality of the results, in this paper, we propose a general method that can be effectively used in most GAN-based super-resolution (SR) models by introducing essential spatial information into the training process. We extract spatial information from the input data and incorporate it into the training loss, making the corresponding loss a spatially adaptive (SA) one. After that, we utilize it to guide the training process. We will show that the proposed approach is independent of the methods used to extract the spatial information and independent of the SR tasks and models. This method consistently guides the training process towards generating visually pleasing SR images and video frames, substantially mitigating artifacts and noise, ultimately leading to enhanced perceptual quality.</description>

      <title>NeuralOCT: Airway OCT Analysis via Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a popular modality in ophthalmology and is also used intravascularly. Our interest in this work is OCT in the context of airway abnormalities in infants and children where the high resolution of OCT and the fact that it is radiation-free is important. The goal of airway OCT is to provide accurate estimates of airway geometry (in 2D and 3D) to assess airway abnormalities such as subglottic stenosis. We propose $\texttt{NeuralOCT}$, a learning-based approach to process airway OCT images. Specifically, $\texttt{NeuralOCT}$ extracts 3D geometries from OCT scans by robustly bridging two steps: point cloud extraction via 2D segmentation and 3D reconstruction from point clouds via neural fields. Our experiments show that $\texttt{NeuralOCT}$ produces accurate and robust 3D airway reconstructions with an average A-line error smaller than 70 micrometer. Our code will cbe available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>D-Net: Dynamic Large Kernel with Dynamic Feature Fusion for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical transformers have achieved significant success in medical image segmentation due to their large receptive field and capabilities of effectively leveraging global long-range contextual information. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can also deliver a large receptive field by using large kernels, enabling them to achieve competitive performance with fewer model parameters. However, CNNs incorporated with large convolutional kernels remain constrained in adaptively capturing multi-scale features from organs with large variations in shape and size due to the employment of fixed-sized kernels. Additionally, they are unable to utilize global contextual information efficiently. To address these limitations, we propose Dynamic Large Kernel (DLK) and Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) modules. The DLK module employs multiple large kernels with varying kernel sizes and dilation rates to capture multi-scale features. Subsequently, a dynamic selection mechanism is utilized to adaptively highlight the most important spatial features based on global information. Additionally, the DFF module is proposed to adaptively fuse multi-scale local feature maps based on their global information. We integrate DLK and DFF in a hierarchical transformer architecture to develop a novel architecture, termed D-Net. D-Net is able to effectively utilize a multi-scale large receptive field and adaptively harness global contextual information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that D-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art models in the two volumetric segmentation tasks, including abdominal multi-organ segmentation and multi-modality brain tumor segmentation.

      <title>EAGLE: An Edge-Aware Gradient Localization Enhanced Loss for CT Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) image reconstruction is crucial for accurate diagnosis and deep learning approaches have demonstrated significant potential in improving reconstruction quality. However, the choice of loss function profoundly affects the reconstructed images. Traditional mean squared error loss often produces blurry images lacking fine details, while alternatives designed to improve may introduce structural artifacts or other undesirable effects. To address these limitations, we propose Eagle-Loss, a novel loss function designed to enhance the visual quality of CT image reconstructions. Eagle-Loss applies spectral analysis of localized features within gradient changes to enhance sharpness and well-defined edges. We evaluated Eagle-Loss on two public datasets across low-dose CT reconstruction and CT field-of-view extension tasks. Our results show that Eagle-Loss consistently improves the visual quality of reconstructed images, surpassing state-of-the-art methods across various network architectures. Code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/sypsyp97/Eagle_Loss}.</description>

      <title>ContourDiff: Unpaired Image Translation with Contour-Guided Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately translating medical images across different modalities (e.g., CT to MRI) has numerous downstream clinical and machine learning applications. While several methods have been proposed to achieve this, they often prioritize perceptual quality with respect to output domain features over preserving anatomical fidelity. However, maintaining anatomy during translation is essential for many tasks, e.g., when leveraging masks from the input domain to develop a segmentation model with images translated to the output domain. To address these challenges, we propose ContourDiff, a novel framework that leverages domain-invariant anatomical contour representations of images. These representations are simple to extract from images, yet form precise spatial constraints on their anatomical content. We introduce a diffusion model that converts contour representations of images from arbitrary input domains into images in the output domain of interest. By applying the contour as a constraint at every diffusion sampling step, we ensure the preservation of anatomical content. We evaluate our method by training a segmentation model on images translated from CT to MRI with their original CT masks and testing its performance on real MRIs. Our method outperforms other unpaired image translation methods by a significant margin, furthermore without the need to access any input domain information during training.</description>

      <title>MicroDiffusion: Implicit Representation-Guided Diffusion for 3D Reconstruction from Limited 2D Microscopy Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volumetric optical microscopy using non-diffracting beams enables rapid imaging of 3D volumes by projecting them axially to 2D images but lacks crucial depth information. Addressing this, we introduce MicroDiffusion, a pioneering tool facilitating high-quality, depth-resolved 3D volume reconstruction from limited 2D projections. While existing Implicit Neural Representation (INR) models often yield incomplete outputs and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) excel at capturing details, our method integrates INR's structural coherence with DDPM's fine-detail enhancement capabilities. We pretrain an INR model to transform 2D axially-projected images into a preliminary 3D volume. This pretrained INR acts as a global prior guiding DDPM's generative process through a linear interpolation between INR outputs and noise inputs. This strategy enriches the diffusion process with structured 3D information, enhancing detail and reducing noise in localized 2D images. By conditioning the diffusion model on the closest 2D projection, MicroDiffusion substantially enhances fidelity in resulting 3D reconstructions, surpassing INR and standard DDPM outputs with unparalleled image quality and structural fidelity. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/MicroDiffusion.</description>

      <title>COVID-CT-H-UNet: a novel COVID-19 CT segmentation network based on attention mechanism and Bi-category Hybrid loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2019, the global COVID-19 outbreak has emerged as a crucial focus in healthcare research. Although RT-PCR stands as the primary method for COVID-19 detection, its extended detection time poses a significant challenge. Consequently, supplementing RT-PCR with the pathological study of COVID-19 through CT imaging has become imperative. The current segmentation approach based on TVLoss enhances the connectivity of afflicted areas. Nevertheless, it tends to misclassify normal pixels between certain adjacent diseased regions as diseased pixels. The typical Binary cross entropy(BCE) based U-shaped network only concentrates on the entire CT images without emphasizing on the affected regions, which results in hazy borders and low contrast in the projected output. In addition, the fraction of infected pixels in CT images is much less, which makes it a challenge for segmentation models to make accurate predictions. In this paper, we propose COVID-CT-H-UNet, a COVID-19 CT segmentation network to solve these problems. To recognize the unaffected pixels between neighbouring diseased regions, extra visual layer information is captured by combining the attention module on the skip connections with the proposed composite function Bi-category Hybrid Loss. The issue of hazy boundaries and poor contrast brought on by the BCE Loss in conventional techniques is resolved by utilizing the composite function Bi-category Hybrid Loss that concentrates on the pixels in the diseased area. The experiment shows when compared to the previous COVID-19 segmentation networks, the proposed COVID-CT-H-UNet's segmentation impact has greatly improved, and it may be used to identify and study clinical COVID-19.</description>

      <title>Could We Generate Cytology Images from Histopathology Images? An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automation in medical imaging is quite challenging due to the unavailability of annotated datasets and the scarcity of domain experts. In recent years, deep learning techniques have solved some complex medical imaging tasks like disease classification, important object localization, segmentation, etc. However, most of the task requires a large amount of annotated data for their successful implementation. To mitigate the shortage of data, different generative models are proposed for data augmentation purposes which can boost the classification performances. For this, different synthetic medical image data generation models are developed to increase the dataset. Unpaired image-to-image translation models here shift the source domain to the target domain. In the breast malignancy identification domain, FNAC is one of the low-cost low-invasive modalities normally used by medical practitioners. But availability of public datasets in this domain is very poor. Whereas, for automation of cytology images, we need a large amount of annotated data. Therefore synthetic cytology images are generated by translating breast histopathology samples which are publicly available. In this study, we have explored traditional image-to-image transfer models like CycleGAN, and Neural Style Transfer. Further, it is observed that the generated cytology images are quite similar to real breast cytology samples by measuring FID and KID scores.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Adapter: Adapting Segment Anything Model (SAM) for Ambiguous Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) gained significant success in natural image segmentation, and many methods have tried to fine-tune it to medical image segmentation. An efficient way to do so is by using Adapters, specialized modules that learn just a few parameters to tailor SAM specifically for medical images. However, unlike natural images, many tissues and lesions in medical images have blurry boundaries and may be ambiguous. Previous efforts to adapt SAM ignore this challenge and can only predict distinct segmentation.It may mislead clinicians or cause misdiagnosis, especially when encountering rare variants or situations with low model confidence. In this work, we propose a novel module called the Uncertainty-aware Adapter, which efficiently fine-tuning SAM for uncertainty-aware medical image segmentation. Utilizing a conditional variational autoencoder, we encoded stochastic samples to effectively represent the inherent uncertainty in medical imaging. We designed a new module on a standard adapter that utilizes a condition-based strategy to interact with samples to help SAM integrate uncertainty. We evaluated our method on two multi-annotated datasets with different modalities: LIDC-IDRI (lung abnormalities segmentation) and REFUGE2 (optic-cup segmentation). The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms all the previous methods and achieves the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on both benchmarks. We also demonstrated that our method can generate diverse segmentation hypotheses that are more realistic as well as heterogeneous.</description>

      <title>Channel-wise Feature Decorrelation for Enhanced Learned Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging Learned Compression (LC) replaces the traditional codec modules with Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which are trained end-to-end for rate-distortion performance. This approach is considered as the future of image/video compression, and major efforts have been dedicated to improving its compression efficiency. However, most proposed works target compression efficiency by employing more complex DNNS, which contributes to higher computational complexity. Alternatively, this paper proposes to improve compression by fully exploiting the existing DNN capacity. To do so, the latent features are guided to learn a richer and more diverse set of features, which corresponds to better reconstruction. A channel-wise feature decorrelation loss is designed and is integrated into the LC optimization. Three strategies are proposed and evaluated, which optimize (1) the transformation network, (2) the context model, and (3) both networks. Experimental results on two established LC methods show that the proposed method improves the compression with a BD-Rate of up to 8.06%, with no added complexity. The proposed solution can be applied as a plug-and-play solution to optimize any similar LC method.</description>

Abstract: Topological accuracy in medical image segmentation is a highly important property for downstream applications such as network analysis and flow modeling in vessels or cell counting. Recently, significant methodological advancements have brought well-founded concepts from algebraic topology to binary segmentation. However, these approaches have been underexplored in multi-class segmentation scenarios, where topological errors are common. We propose a general loss function for topologically faithful multi-class segmentation extending the recent Betti matching concept, which is based on induced matchings of persistence barcodes. We project the N-class segmentation problem to N single-class segmentation tasks, which allows us to use 1-parameter persistent homology making training of neural networks computationally feasible. We validate our method on a comprehensive set of four medical datasets with highly variant topological characteristics. Our loss formulation significantly enhances topological correctness in cardiac, cell, artery-vein, and Circle of Willis segmentation.</description>

      <title>A Spectrum-based Image Denoising Method with Edge Feature Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image denoising stands as a critical challenge in image processing and computer vision, aiming to restore the original image from noise-affected versions caused by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors. This process is essential for applications that rely on the high quality and clarity of visual information, such as image restoration, visual tracking, and image registration, where the original content is vital for performance. Despite the development of numerous denoising algorithms, effectively suppressing noise, particularly under poor capture conditions with high noise levels, remains a challenge. Image denoising's practical importance spans multiple domains, notably medical imaging for enhanced diagnostic precision, as well as surveillance and satellite imagery where it improves image quality and usability. Techniques like the Fourier transform, which excels in noise reduction and edge preservation, along with phase congruency-based methods, offer promising results for enhancing noisy and low-contrast images common in modern imaging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Semantic-Enhanced Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing image super-resolution (SR) is a crucial task to restore high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) observations. Recently, the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) has shown promising performance in image reconstructions by overcoming problems inherent in generative models, such as over-smoothing and mode collapse. However, the high-frequency details generated by DDPM often suffer from misalignment with HR images due to the model's tendency to overlook long-range semantic contexts. This is attributed to the widely used U-Net decoder in the conditional noise predictor, which tends to overemphasize local information, leading to the generation of noises with significant variances during the prediction process. To address these issues, an adaptive semantic-enhanced DDPM (ASDDPM) is proposed to enhance the detail-preserving capability of the DDPM by incorporating low-frequency semantic information provided by the Transformer. Specifically, a novel adaptive diffusion Transformer decoder (ADTD) is developed to bridge the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder through regulating the noise prediction with the global contextual relationships and long-range dependencies in the diffusion process. Additionally, a residual feature fusion strategy establishes information exchange between the two decoders at multiple levels. As a result, the predicted noise generated by our approach closely approximates that of the real noise distribution.Extensive experiments on two SR and two semantic segmentation datasets confirm the superior performance of the proposed ASDDPM in both SR and the subsequent downstream applications. The source code will be available at https://github.com/littlebeen/ASDDPM-Adaptive-Semantic-Enhanced-DDPM.</description>

      <title>A lightweight deep learning pipeline with DRDA-Net and MobileNet for breast cancer classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and early detection of breast cancer is essential for successful treatment. This paper introduces a novel deep-learning approach for improved breast cancer classification in histopathological images, a crucial step in diagnosis. Our method hinges on the Dense Residual Dual-Shuffle Attention Network (DRDA-Net), inspired by ShuffleNet's efficient architecture. DRDA-Net achieves exceptional accuracy across various magnification levels on the BreaKHis dataset, a breast cancer histopathology analysis benchmark. However, for real-world deployment, computational efficiency is paramount. We integrate a pre-trained MobileNet model renowned for its lightweight design to address computational. MobileNet ensures fast execution even on devices with limited resources without sacrificing performance. This combined approach offers a promising solution for accurate breast cancer diagnosis, paving the way for faster and more accessible screening procedures.</description>

      <title>Interactive $360^{\circ}$ Video Streaming Using FoV-Adaptive Coding with Temporal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $360^{\circ}$ video streaming, FoV-adaptive coding that allocates more bits for the predicted user's field of view (FoV) is an effective way to maximize the rendered video quality under the limited bandwidth. We develop a low-latency FoV-adaptive coding and streaming system for interactive applications that is robust to bandwidth variations and FoV prediction errors. To minimize the end-to-end delay and yet maximize the coding efficiency, we propose a frame-level FoV-adaptive inter-coding structure. In each frame, regions that are in or near the predicted FoV are coded using temporal and spatial prediction, while a small rotating region is coded with spatial prediction only. This rotating intra region periodically refreshes the entire frame, thereby providing robustness to both FoV prediction errors and frame losses due to transmission errors. The system adapts the sizes and rates of different regions for each video segment to maximize the rendered video quality under the predicted bandwidth constraint. Integrating such frame-level FoV adaptation with temporal prediction is challenging due to the temporal variations of the FoV. We propose novel ways for modeling the influence of FoV dynamics on the quality-rate performance of temporal predictive coding.We further develop LSTM-based machine learning models to predict the user's FoV and network bandwidth.The proposed system is compared with three benchmark systems, using real-world network bandwidth traces and FoV traces, and is shown to significantly improve the rendered video quality, while achieving very low end-to-end delay and low frame-freeze probability.</description>

      <title>Multiple Teachers-Meticulous Student: A Domain Adaptive Meta-Knowledge Distillation Model for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Image classification can be considered one of the key pillars of medical image analysis. Deep learning (DL) faces challenges that prevent its practical applications despite the remarkable improvement in medical image classification. The data distribution differences can lead to a drop in the efficiency of DL, known as the domain shift problem. Besides, requiring bulk annotated data for model training, the large size of models, and the privacy-preserving of patients are other challenges of using DL in medical image classification. This study presents a strategy that can address the mentioned issues simultaneously. Method: The proposed domain adaptive model based on knowledge distillation can classify images by receiving limited annotated data of different distributions. The designed multiple teachers-meticulous student model trains a student network that tries to solve the challenges by receiving the parameters of several teacher networks. The proposed model was evaluated using six available datasets of different distributions by defining the respiratory motion artefact detection task. Results: The results of extensive experiments using several datasets show the superiority of the proposed model in addressing the domain shift problem and lack of access to bulk annotated data. Besides, the privacy preservation of patients by receiving only the teacher network parameters instead of the original data and consolidating the knowledge of several DL models into a model with almost similar performance are other advantages of the proposed model. Conclusions: The proposed model can pave the way for practical clinical applications of deep classification methods by achieving the mentioned objectives simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Simple 2D Convolutional Neural Network-based Approach for COVID-19 Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the use of deep learning techniques for analyzing lung Computed Tomography (CT) images. Classic deep learning approaches face challenges with varying slice counts and resolutions in CT images, a diversity arising from the utilization of assorted scanning equipment. Typically, predictions are made on single slices which are then combined for a comprehensive outcome. Yet, this method does not incorporate learning features specific to each slice, leading to a compromise in effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose an advanced Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) framework specifically tailored for CT scans. It aims to filter out out-of-distribution (OOD) data within the entire CT scan, allowing us to select essential spatial-slice features for analysis by reducing data redundancy by 70\%. Additionally, we introduce a Kernel-Density-based slice Sampling (KDS) method to enhance stability during training and inference phases, thereby accelerating convergence and enhancing overall performance. Remarkably, our experiments reveal that our model achieves promising results with a simple EfficientNet-2D (E2D) model. The effectiveness of our approach is confirmed on the COVID-19-CT-DB datasets provided by the DEF-AI-MIA workshop.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of YOLOv9, the latest version of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series, has led to its widespread adoption across various scenarios. This paper is the first to apply the YOLOv9 algorithm model to the fracture detection task as computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) to help radiologists and surgeons to interpret X-ray images. Specifically, this paper trained the model on the GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset and extended the training set using data augmentation techniques to improve the model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the mAP 50-95 of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, the YOLOv9 model increased the value from 42.16% to 43.73%, with an improvement of 3.7%. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/RuiyangJu/YOLOv9-Fracture-Detection.</description>

      <title>A Dynamically Weighted Loss Function for Unsupervised Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image segmentation is the foundation of several computer vision tasks, where pixel-wise knowledge is a prerequisite for achieving the desired target. Deep learning has shown promising performance in supervised image segmentation. However, supervised segmentation algorithms require a massive amount of data annotated at a pixel level, thus limiting their applicability and scalability. Therefore, there is a need to invest in unsupervised learning for segmentation. This work presents an improved version of an unsupervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based algorithm that uses a constant weight factor to balance between the segmentation criteria of feature similarity and spatial continuity, and it requires continuous manual adjustment of parameters depending on the degree of detail in the image and the dataset. In contrast, we propose a novel dynamic weighting scheme that leads to a flexible update of the parameters and an automatic tuning of the balancing weight between the two criteria above to bring out the details in the images in a genuinely unsupervised manner. We present quantitative and qualitative results on four datasets, which show that the proposed scheme outperforms the current unsupervised segmentation approaches without requiring manual adjustment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) represents a challenging condition for medical providers today. The cause is currently unknown, the impact on a patient's daily life is significant, and it is increasing in prevalence. Traditional approaches for medical image diagnosis such as standard deep learning algorithms are limited by the relatively small amount of data and difficulty in generalization. As a response, two methods have arisen that seem to perform well: Diffusion and Multi-Domain methods with current research efforts favoring diffusion methods. For the EoE dataset, we discovered that a Multi-Domain Adversarial Network outperformed a Diffusion based method with a FID of 42.56 compared to 50.65. Future work with diffusion methods should include a comparison with Multi-Domain adaptation methods to ensure that the best performance is achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the emergence of Covid-19 in late 2019, medical image analysis using artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a crucial research area, particularly with the utility of CT-scan imaging for disease diagnosis. This paper contributes to the 4th COV19D competition, focusing on Covid-19 Detection and Covid-19 Domain Adaptation Challenges. Our approach centers on lung segmentation and Covid-19 infection segmentation employing the recent CNN-based segmentation architecture PDAtt-Unet, which simultaneously segments lung regions and infections. Departing from traditional methods, we concatenate the input slice (grayscale) with segmented lung and infection, generating three input channels akin to color channels. Additionally, we employ three 3D CNN backbones Customized Hybrid-DeCoVNet, along with pretrained 3D-Resnet-18 and 3D-Resnet-50 models to train Covid-19 recognition for both challenges. Furthermore, we explore ensemble approaches and testing augmentation to enhance performance. Comparison with baseline results underscores the substantial efficiency of our approach, with a significant margin in terms of F1-score (14 %). This study advances the field by presenting a comprehensive methodology for accurate Covid-19 detection and adaptation, leveraging cutting-edge AI techniques in medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>StainDiffuser: MultiTask Dual Diffusion Model for Virtual Staining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining is the most commonly used for disease diagnosis and tumor recurrence tracking. Hematoxylin excels at highlighting nuclei, whereas eosin stains the cytoplasm. However, H&amp;E stain lacks details for differentiating different types of cells relevant to identifying the grade of the disease or response to specific treatment variations. Pathologists require special immunohistochemical (IHC) stains that highlight different cell types. These stains help in accurately identifying different regions of disease growth and their interactions with the cell's microenvironment. The advent of deep learning models has made Image-to-Image (I2I) translation a key research area, reducing the need for expensive physical staining processes. Pix2Pix and CycleGAN are still the most commonly used methods for virtual staining applications. However, both suffer from hallucinations or staining irregularities when H&amp;E stain has less discriminate information about the underlying cells IHC needs to highlight (e.g.,CD3 lymphocytes). Diffusion models are currently the state-of-the-art models for image generation and conditional generation tasks. However, they require extensive and diverse datasets (millions of samples) to converge, which is less feasible for virtual staining applications.Inspired by the success of multitask deep learning models for limited dataset size, we propose StainDiffuser, a novel multitask dual diffusion architecture for virtual staining that converges under a limited training budget. StainDiffuser trains two diffusion processes simultaneously: (a) generation of cell-specific IHC stain from H&amp;E and (b) H&amp;E-based cell segmentation using coarse segmentation only during training. Our results show that StainDiffuser produces high-quality results for easier (CK8/18,epithelial marker) and difficult stains(CD3, Lymphocytes).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image information is restricted by the dynamic range of the detector, which can be addressed using multi-exposure image fusion (MEF). The conventional MEF approach employed in ptychography is often inadequate under conditions of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or variations in illumination intensity. To address this, we developed a Bayesian approach for MEF based on a modified Poisson noise model that considers the background and saturation. Our method outperforms conventional MEF under challenging experimental conditions, as demonstrated by the synthetic and experimental data. Furthermore, this method is versatile and applicable to any imaging scheme requiring high dynamic range (HDR).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in the use of Denoising Diffusion Models (DDM) as priors for solving inverse Bayesian problems has recently increased significantly. However, sampling from the resulting posterior distribution poses a challenge. To solve this problem, previous works have proposed approximations to bias the drift term of the diffusion. In this work, we take a different approach and utilize the specific structure of the DDM prior to define a set of intermediate and simpler posterior sampling problems, resulting in a lower approximation error compared to previous methods. We empirically demonstrate the reconstruction capability of our method for general linear inverse problems using synthetic examples and various image restoration tasks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the need for rapid and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis during the global pandemic, we present a two-stage framework that leverages pseudo labels for domain adaptation to enhance the detection of COVID-19 from CT scans. By utilizing annotated data from one domain and non-annotated data from another, the model overcomes the challenge of data scarcity and variability, common in emergent health crises. The innovative approach of generating pseudo labels enables the model to iteratively refine its learning process, thereby improving its accuracy and adaptability across different hospitals and medical centres. Experimental results on COV19-CT-DB database showcase the model's potential to achieve high diagnostic precision, significantly contributing to efficient patient management and alleviating the strain on healthcare systems. Our method achieves 0.92 Macro F1 Score on the validation set of Covid-19 domain adaptation challenge.</description>

      <title>MLVICX: Multi-Level Variance-Covariance Exploration for Chest X-ray Self-Supervised Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is potentially useful in reducing the need for manual annotation and making deep learning models accessible for medical image analysis tasks. By leveraging the representations learned from unlabeled data, self-supervised models perform well on tasks that require little to no fine-tuning. However, for medical images, like chest X-rays, which are characterized by complex anatomical structures and diverse clinical conditions, there arises a need for representation learning techniques that can encode fine-grained details while preserving the broader contextual information. In this context, we introduce MLVICX (Multi-Level Variance-Covariance Exploration for Chest X-ray Self-Supervised Representation Learning), an approach to capture rich representations in the form of embeddings from chest X-ray images. Central to our approach is a novel multi-level variance and covariance exploration strategy that empowers the model to detect diagnostically meaningful patterns while reducing redundancy effectively. By enhancing the variance and covariance of the learned embeddings, MLVICX promotes the retention of critical medical insights by adapting both global and local contextual details. We demonstrate the performance of MLVICX in advancing self-supervised chest X-ray representation learning through comprehensive experiments. The performance enhancements we observe across various downstream tasks highlight the significance of the proposed approach in enhancing the utility of chest X-ray embeddings for precision medical diagnosis and comprehensive image analysis. For pertaining, we used the NIH-Chest X-ray dataset, while for downstream tasks, we utilized NIH-Chest X-ray, Vinbig-CXR, RSNA pneumonia, and SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax datasets. Overall, we observe more than 3% performance gains over SOTA SSL approaches in various downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Covid-19 detection from CT scans using EfficientNet and Attention mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual diagnosis and analysis of COVID-19 through the examination of lung Computed Tomography (CT) scan images by physicians tends to result in inefficiency, especially with high patient volumes and numerous images per patient. We address the need for automation by developing a deep learning model-based pipeline for COVID-19 detection from CT scan images of the lungs. The Domain adaptation, Explainability, and Fairness in AI for Medical Image Analysis Workshop and COVID-19 Diagnosis Competition (DEF-AI-MIA COV19D) provides an opportunity to assess our designed pipeline for COVID-19 detection from CT scan images. The proposed pipeline incorporates EfficientNet with an Attention mechanism with a pre-processing step. Our pipeline outperforms last year's teams on the validation set of the competition dataset.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Frequency-based Upsampling and Refining for Compressed Video Quality Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video compression artifacts arise due to the quantization operation in the frequency domain. The goal of video quality enhancement is to reduce compression artifacts and reconstruct a visually-pleasant result. In this work, we propose a hierarchical frequency-based upsampling and refining neural network (HFUR) for compressed video quality enhancement. HFUR consists of two modules: implicit frequency upsampling module (ImpFreqUp) and hierarchical and iterative refinement module (HIR). ImpFreqUp exploits DCT-domain prior derived through implicit DCT transform, and accurately reconstructs the DCT-domain loss via a coarse-to-fine transfer. Consequently, HIR is introduced to facilitate cross-collaboration and information compensation between the scales, thus further refine the feature maps and promote the visual quality of the final output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules via ablation experiments and visualized results. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that HFUR achieves state-of-the-art performance for both constant bit rate and constant QP modes.</description>

      <title>Overfitted image coding at reduced complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Overfitted image codecs offer compelling compression performance and low decoder complexity, through the overfitting of a lightweight decoder for each image. Such codecs include Cool-chic, which presents image coding performance on par with VVC while requiring around 2000 multiplications per decoded pixel. This paper proposes to decrease Cool-chic encoding and decoding complexity. The encoding complexity is reduced by shortening Cool-chic training, up to the point where no overfitting is performed at all. It is also shown that a tiny neural decoder with 300 multiplications per pixel still outperforms HEVC. A near real-time CPU implementation of this decoder is made available at https://orange-opensource.github.io/Cool-Chic/.</description>

      <title>WIA-LD2ND: Wavelet-based Image Alignment for Self-supervised Low-Dose CT Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In clinical examinations and diagnoses, low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is crucial for minimizing health risks compared with normal-dose computed tomography (NDCT). However, reducing the radiation dose compromises the signal-to-noise ratio, leading to degraded quality of CT images. To address this, we analyze LDCT denoising task based on experimental results from the frequency perspective, and then introduce a novel self-supervised CT image denoising method called WIA-LD2ND, only using NDCT data. The proposed WIA-LD2ND comprises two modules: Wavelet-based Image Alignment (WIA) and Frequency-Aware Multi-scale Loss (FAM). First, WIA is introduced to align NDCT with LDCT by mainly adding noise to the high-frequency components, which is the main difference between LDCT and NDCT. Second, to better capture high-frequency components and detailed information, Frequency-Aware Multi-scale Loss (FAM) is proposed by effectively utilizing multi-scale feature space. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT denoising datasets demonstrate that our WIA-LD2ND, only uses NDCT, outperforms existing several state-of-the-art weakly-supervised and self-supervised methods.</description>

      <title>MoreStyle: Relax Low-frequency Constraint of Fourier-based Image Reconstruction in Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of single-source domain generalization (SDG) in medical image segmentation is crucial due to frequent domain shifts in clinical image datasets. To address the challenge of poor generalization across different domains, we introduce a Plug-and-Play module for data augmentation called MoreStyle. MoreStyle diversifies image styles by relaxing low-frequency constraints in Fourier space, guiding the image reconstruction network. With the help of adversarial learning, MoreStyle further expands the style range and pinpoints the most intricate style combinations within latent features. To handle significant style variations, we introduce an uncertainty-weighted loss. This loss emphasizes hard-to-classify pixels resulting only from style shifts while mitigating true hard-to-classify pixels in both MoreStyle-generated and original images. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MoreStyle effectively helps to achieve good domain generalization ability, and has the potential to further boost the performance of some state-of-the-art SDG methods.</description>

      <title>Object Segmentation-Assisted Inter Prediction for Versatile Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern video coding standards, block-based inter prediction is widely adopted, which brings high compression efficiency. However, in natural videos, there are usually multiple moving objects of arbitrary shapes, resulting in complex motion fields that are difficult to compactly represent. This problem has been tackled by more flexible block partitioning methods in the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard, but the more flexible partitions require more overhead bits to signal and still cannot be made arbitrary shaped. To address this limitation, we propose an object segmentation-assisted inter prediction method (SAIP), where objects in the reference frames are segmented by some advanced technologies. With a proper indication, the object segmentation mask is translated from the reference frame to the current frame as the arbitrary-shaped partition of different regions without any extra signal. Using the segmentation mask, motion compensation is separately performed for different regions, achieving higher prediction accuracy. The segmentation mask is further used to code the motion vectors of different regions more efficiently. Moreover, segmentation mask is considered in the joint rate-distortion optimization for motion estimation and partition estimation to derive the motion vector of different regions and partition more accurately. The proposed method is implemented into the VVC reference software, VTM version 12.0. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to 1.98%, 1.14%, 0.79%, and on average 0.82%, 0.49%, 0.37% BD-rate reduction for common test sequences, under the Low-delay P, Low-delay B, and Random Access configurations, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Spatial-Temporal Progressive Fusion Network for Breast Lesion Segmentation in Ultrasound Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound video-based breast lesion segmentation provides a valuable assistance in early breast lesion detection and treatment. However, existing works mainly focus on lesion segmentation based on ultrasound breast images which usually can not be adapted well to obtain desirable results on ultrasound videos. The main challenge for ultrasound video-based breast lesion segmentation is how to exploit the lesion cues of both intra-frame and inter-frame simultaneously. To address this problem, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Progressive Fusion Network (STPFNet) for video based breast lesion segmentation problem. The main aspects of the proposed STPFNet are threefold. First, we propose to adopt a unified network architecture to capture both spatial dependences within each ultrasound frame and temporal correlations between different frames together for ultrasound data representation. Second, we propose a new fusion module, termed Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF), to fuse spatial and temporal cues together for lesion detection. MSFF can help to determine the boundary contour of lesion region to overcome the issue of lesion boundary blurring. Third, we propose to exploit the segmentation result of previous frame as the prior knowledge to suppress the noisy background and learn more robust representation. In particular, we introduce a new publicly available ultrasound video breast lesion segmentation dataset, termed UVBLS200, which is specifically dedicated to breast lesion segmentation. It contains 200 videos, including 80 videos of benign lesions and 120 videos of malignant lesions. Experiments on the proposed dataset demonstrate that the proposed STPFNet achieves better breast lesion detection performance than state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>3R-INN: How to be climate friendly while consuming/delivering videos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consumption of a video requires a considerable amount of energy during the various stages of its life-cycle. With a billion hours of video consumed daily, this contributes significantly to the greenhouse gas emission. Therefore, reducing the end-to-end carbon footprint of the video chain, while preserving the quality of experience at the user side, is of high importance. To contribute in an impactful manner, we propose 3R-INN, a single light invertible network that does three tasks at once: given a high-resolution grainy image, it Rescales it to a lower resolution, Removes film grain and Reduces its power consumption when displayed. Providing such a minimum viable quality content contributes to reducing the energy consumption during encoding, transmission, decoding and display. 3R-INN also offers the possibility to restore either the high-resolution grainy original image or a grain-free version, thanks to its invertibility and the disentanglement of the high frequency, and without transmitting auxiliary data. Experiments show that, while enabling significant energy savings for encoding (78%), decoding (77%) and rendering (5% to 20%), 3R-INN outperforms state-of-the-art film grain synthesis and energy-aware methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the rescaling task on different test-sets.</description>

      <title>PAON: A New Neuron Model using Pad\'e Approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are built upon the classical McCulloch-Pitts neuron model, which is essentially a linear model, where the nonlinearity is provided by a separate activation function. Several researchers have proposed enhanced neuron models, including quadratic neurons, generalized operational neurons, generative neurons, and super neurons, with stronger nonlinearity than that provided by the pointwise activation function. There has also been a proposal to use Pade approximation as a generalized activation function. In this paper, we introduce a brand new neuron model called Pade neurons (Paons), inspired by the Pade approximants, which is the best mathematical approximation of a transcendental function as a ratio of polynomials with different orders. We show that Paons are a super set of all other proposed neuron models. Hence, the basic neuron in any known CNN model can be replaced by Paons. In this paper, we extend the well-known ResNet to PadeNet (built by Paons) to demonstrate the concept. Our experiments on the single-image super-resolution task show that PadeNets can obtain better results than competing architectures.</description>

      <title>denoiSplit: a method for joint image splitting and unsupervised denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present denoiSplit, a method to tackle a new analysis task, i.e. the challenge of joint semantic image splitting and unsupervised denoising. This dual approach has important applications in fluorescence microscopy, where semantic image splitting has important applications but noise does generally hinder the downstream analysis of image content. Image splitting involves dissecting an image into its distinguishable semantic structures. We show that the current state-of-the-art method for this task struggles in the presence of image noise, inadvertently also distributing the noise across the predicted outputs. The method we present here can deal with image noise by integrating an unsupervised denoising sub-task. This integration results in improved semantic image unmixing, even in the presence of notable and realistic levels of imaging noise. A key innovation in denoiSplit is the use of specifically formulated noise models and the suitable adjustment of KL-divergence loss for the high-dimensional hierarchical latent space we are training. We showcase the performance of denoiSplit across 4 tasks on real-world microscopy images. Additionally, we perform qualitative and quantitative evaluations and compare results to existing benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of using denoiSplit: a single Variational Splitting Encoder-Decoder (VSE) Network using two suitable noise models to jointly perform semantic splitting and denoising.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Cervical Cancer Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Inspection with Acetic Acid (VIA) remains the most feasible cervical cancer screening test in resource-constrained settings of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which are often performed screening camps or primary/community health centers by nurses instead of the preferred but unavailable expert Gynecologist. To address the highly subjective nature of the test, various handheld devices integrating cameras or smartphones have been recently explored to capture cervical images during VIA and aid decision-making via telemedicine or AI models. Most studies proposing AI models retrospectively use a relatively small number of already collected images from specific devices, digital cameras, or smartphones; the challenges and protocol for quality image acquisition during VIA in resource-constrained camp settings, challenges in getting gold standard, data imbalance, etc. are often overlooked. We present a novel approach and describe the end-to-end design process to build a robust smartphone-based AI-assisted system that does not require buying a separate integrated device: the proposed protocol for quality image acquisition in resource-constrained settings, dataset collected from 1,430 women during VIA performed by nurses in screening camps, preprocessing pipeline, and training and evaluation of a deep-learning-based classification model aimed to identify (pre)cancerous lesions. Our work shows that the readily available smartphones and a suitable protocol can capture the cervix images with the required details for the VIA test well; the deep-learning-based classification model provides promising results to assist nurses in VIA screening; and provides a direction for large-scale data collection and validation in resource-constrained settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To make a more accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, we propose a straightforward yet effective model. Firstly, we analyse the characteristics of 3D CT scans and remove the non-lung parts, facilitating the model to focus on lesion-related areas and reducing computational cost. We use ResNeSt50 as the strong feature extractor, initializing it with pretrained weights which have COVID-19-specific prior knowledge. Our model achieves a Macro F1 Score of 0.94 on the validation set of the 4th COV19D Competition Challenge $\mathrm{I}$, surpassing the baseline by 16%. This indicates its effectiveness in distinguishing between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases, making it a robust method for COVID-19 detection.</description>

      <title>OUCopula: Bi-Channel Multi-Label Copula-Enhanced Adapter-Based CNN for Myopia Screening Based on OU-UWF Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myopia screening using cutting-edge ultra-widefield (UWF) fundus imaging is potentially significant for ophthalmic outcomes. Current multidisciplinary research between ophthalmology and deep learning (DL) concentrates primarily on disease classification and diagnosis using single-eye images, largely ignoring joint modeling and prediction for Oculus Uterque (OU, both eyes). Inspired by the complex relationships between OU and the high correlation between the (continuous) outcome labels (Spherical Equivalent and Axial Length), we propose a framework of copula-enhanced adapter convolutional neural network (CNN) learning with OU UWF fundus images (OUCopula) for joint prediction of multiple clinical scores. We design a novel bi-channel multi-label CNN that can (1) take bi-channel image inputs subject to both high correlation and heterogeneity (by sharing the same backbone network and employing adapters to parameterize the channel-wise discrepancy), and (2) incorporate correlation information between continuous output labels (using a copula). Solid experiments show that OUCopula achieves satisfactory performance in myopia score prediction compared to backbone models. Moreover, OUCopula can far exceed the performance of models constructed for single-eye inputs. Importantly, our study also hints at the potential extension of the bi-channel model to a multi-channel paradigm and the generalizability of OUCopula across various backbone CNNs.</description>

      <title>Holographic Phase Retrieval via Wirtinger Flow: Cartesian Form with Auxiliary Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new gradient method for holography, where a phase-only hologram is parameterized by not only the phase but also amplitude. The key idea of our approach is the formulation of a phase-only hologram using an auxiliary amplitude. We optimize the parameters using the so-called Wirtinger flow algorithm in the Cartesian domain, which is a gradient method defined on the basis of the Wirtinger calculus. At the early stage of optimization, each element of the hologram exists inside a complex circle, and it can take a large gradient while diverging from the origin. This characteristic contributes to accelerating the gradient descent. Meanwhile, at the final stage of optimization, each element evolves along a complex circle, similar to previous state-of-the-art gradient methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods, primarily due to the optimization of the amplitude.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative enhancement to the Sphere as Prior Generative Adversarial Network (SP-GAN) model, a state-of-the-art GAN designed for point cloud generation. A novel method is introduced for point cloud generation that elevates the structural integrity and overall quality of the generated point clouds by incorporating topological priors into the training process of the generator. Specifically, this work utilizes the K-means algorithm to segment a point cloud from the repository into clusters and extract centroids, which are then used as priors in the generation process of the SP-GAN. Furthermore, the discriminator component of the SP-GAN utilizes the identical point cloud that contributed the centroids, ensuring a coherent and consistent learning environment. This strategic use of centroids as intuitive guides not only boosts the efficiency of global feature learning but also substantially improves the structural coherence and fidelity of the generated point clouds. By applying the K-means algorithm to generate centroids as the prior, the work intuitively and experimentally demonstrates that such a prior enhances the quality of generated point clouds.</description>

      <title>FH-TabNet: Multi-Class Familial Hypercholesterolemia Detection via a Multi-Stage Tabular Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated levels of Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or its associated genes. Early-stage and accurate categorization of FH is of significance allowing for timely interventions to mitigate the risk of life-threatening conditions. Conventional diagnosis approach, however, is complex, costly, and a challenging interpretation task even for experienced clinicians resulting in high underdiagnosis rates. Although there has been a recent surge of interest in using Machine Learning (ML) models for early FH detection, existing solutions only consider a binary classification task solely using classical ML models. Despite its significance, application of Deep Learning (DL) for FH detection is in its infancy, possibly, due to categorical nature of the underlying clinical data. The paper addresses this gap by introducing the FH-TabNet, which is a multi-stage tabular DL network for multi-class (Definite, Probable, Possible, and Unlikely) FH detection. The FH-TabNet initially involves applying a deep tabular data learning architecture (TabNet) for primary categorization into healthy (Possible/Unlikely) and patient (Probable/Definite) classes. Subsequently, independent TabNet classifiers are applied to each subgroup, enabling refined classification. The model's performance is evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation illustrating superior performance in categorizing FH patients, particularly in the challenging low-prevalence subcategories.</description>

      <title>Lost in Translation? Translation Errors and Challenges for Fair Assessment of Text-to-Image Models on Multilingual Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmarks of the multilingual capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) models compare generated images prompted in a test language to an expected image distribution over a concept set. One such benchmark, "Conceptual Coverage Across Languages" (CoCo-CroLa), assesses the tangible noun inventory of T2I models by prompting them to generate pictures from a concept list translated to seven languages and comparing the output image populations. Unfortunately, we find that this benchmark contains translation errors of varying severity in Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese. We provide corrections for these errors and analyze how impactful they are on the utility and validity of CoCo-CroLa as a benchmark. We reassess multiple baseline T2I models with the revisions, compare the outputs elicited under the new translations to those conditioned on the old, and show that a correction's impactfulness on the image-domain benchmark results can be predicted in the text domain with similarity scores. Our findings will guide the future development of T2I multilinguality metrics by providing analytical tools for practical translation decisions.</description>

      <title>Defense Against Adversarial Attacks on No-Reference Image Quality Models with Gradient Norm Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) is to estimate the quality score of an input image without additional information. NR-IQA models play a crucial role in the media industry, aiding in performance evaluation and optimization guidance. However, these models are found to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which introduce imperceptible perturbations to input images, resulting in significant changes in predicted scores. In this paper, we propose a defense method to improve the stability in predicted scores when attacked by small perturbations, thus enhancing the adversarial robustness of NR-IQA models. To be specific, we present theoretical evidence showing that the magnitude of score changes is related to the $\ell_1$ norm of the model's gradient with respect to the input image. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a norm regularization training strategy aimed at reducing the $\ell_1$ norm of the gradient, thereby boosting the robustness of NR-IQA models. Experiments conducted on four NR-IQA baseline models demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in reducing score changes in the presence of adversarial attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this work marks the first attempt to defend against adversarial attacks on NR-IQA models. Our study offers valuable insights into the adversarial robustness of NR-IQA models and provides a foundation for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Binary Noise for Binary Tasks: Masked Bernoulli Diffusion for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high performance of denoising diffusion models for image generation has paved the way for their application in unsupervised medical anomaly detection. As diffusion-based methods require a lot of GPU memory and have long sampling times, we present a novel and fast unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on latent Bernoulli diffusion models. We first apply an autoencoder to compress the input images into a binary latent representation. Next, a diffusion model that follows a Bernoulli noise schedule is employed to this latent space and trained to restore binary latent representations from perturbed ones. The binary nature of this diffusion model allows us to identify entries in the latent space that have a high probability of flipping their binary code during the denoising process, which indicates out-of-distribution data. We propose a masking algorithm based on these probabilities, which improves the anomaly detection scores. We achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to other diffusion-based unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms while significantly reducing sampling time and memory consumption. The code is available at https://github.com/JuliaWolleb/Anomaly_berdiff.</description>

      <title>IDF-CR: Iterative Diffusion Process for Divide-and-Conquer Cloud Removal in Remote-sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning technologies have demonstrated their effectiveness in removing cloud cover from optical remote-sensing images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exert dominance in the cloud removal tasks. However, constrained by the inherent limitations of convolutional operations, CNNs can address only a modest fraction of cloud occlusion. In recent years, diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) proficiency in image generation and reconstruction due to their formidable generative capabilities. Inspired by the rapid development of diffusion models, we first present an iterative diffusion process for cloud removal (IDF-CR), which exhibits a strong generative capabilities to achieve component divide-and-conquer cloud removal. IDF-CR consists of a pixel space cloud removal module (Pixel-CR) and a latent space iterative noise diffusion network (IND). Specifically, IDF-CR is divided into two-stage models that address pixel space and latent space. The two-stage model facilitates a strategic transition from preliminary cloud reduction to meticulous detail refinement. In the pixel space stage, Pixel-CR initiates the processing of cloudy images, yielding a suboptimal cloud removal prior to providing the diffusion model with prior cloud removal knowledge. In the latent space stage, the diffusion model transforms low-quality cloud removal into high-quality clean output. We refine the Stable Diffusion by implementing ControlNet. In addition, an unsupervised iterative noise refinement (INR) module is introduced for diffusion model to optimize the distribution of the predicted noise, thereby enhancing advanced detail recovery. Our model performs best with other SOTA methods, including image reconstruction and optical remote-sensing cloud removal on the optical remote-sensing datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-Time Fast Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Detection Using Dynamic Vision Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are gaining popularity in civil and military applications. However, uncontrolled access to restricted areas threatens privacy and security. Thus, prevention and detection of UAVs are pivotal to guarantee confidentiality and safety. Although active scanning, mainly based on radars, is one of the most accurate technologies, it can be expensive and less versatile than passive inspections, e.g., object recognition. Dynamic vision sensors (DVS) are bio-inspired event-based vision models that leverage timestamped pixel-level brightness changes in fast-moving scenes that adapt well to low-latency object detection. This paper presents F-UAV-D (Fast Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Detector), an embedded system that enables fast-moving drone detection. In particular, we propose a setup to exploit DVS as an alternative to RGB cameras in a real-time and low-power configuration. Our approach leverages the high-dynamic range (HDR) and background suppression of DVS and, when trained with various fast-moving drones, outperforms RGB input in suboptimal ambient conditions such as low illumination and fast-moving scenes. Our results show that F-UAV-D can (i) detect drones by using less than &lt;15 W on average and (ii) perform real-time inference (i.e., &lt;50 ms) by leveraging the CPU and GPU nodes of our edge computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, the fields of high-energy physics (HEP) experimentation and phenomenological studies have seen the integration of machine learning (ML) and its specialized branch, deep learning (DL). This survey offers a comprehensive assessment of these applications within the realm of various DL approaches. The initial segment of the paper introduces the fundamentals encompassing diverse particle physics types and establishes criteria for evaluating particle physics in tandem with learning models. Following this, a comprehensive taxonomy is presented for representing HEP images, encompassing accessible datasets, intricate details of preprocessing techniques, and methods of feature extraction and selection. Subsequently, the focus shifts to an exploration of available artificial intelligence (AI) models tailored to HEP images, along with a concentrated examination of HEP image classification pertaining to Jet particles. Within this review, a profound investigation is undertaken into distinct ML and DL proposed state-of-the art (SOTA) techniques, underscoring their implications for HEP inquiries. The discussion delves into specific applications in substantial detail, including Jet tagging, Jet tracking, particle classification, and more. The survey culminates with an analysis concerning the present status of HEP grounded in DL methodologies, encompassing inherent challenges and prospective avenues for future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>HyperColorization: Propagating spatially sparse noisy spectral clues for reconstructing hyperspectral images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral cameras face challenging spatial-spectral resolution trade-offs and are more affected by shot noise than RGB photos taken over the same total exposure time. Here, we present a colorization algorithm to reconstruct hyperspectral images from a grayscale guide image and spatially sparse spectral clues. We demonstrate that our algorithm generalizes to varying spectral dimensions for hyperspectral images, and show that colorizing in a low-rank space reduces compute time and the impact of shot noise. To enhance robustness, we incorporate guided sampling, edge-aware filtering, and dimensionality estimation techniques. Our method surpasses previous algorithms in various performance metrics, including SSIM, PSNR, GFC, and EMD, which we analyze as metrics for characterizing hyperspectral image quality. Collectively, these findings provide a promising avenue for overcoming the time-space-wavelength resolution trade-off by reconstructing a dense hyperspectral image from samples obtained by whisk or push broom scanners, as well as hybrid spatial-spectral computational imaging systems.</description>

      <title>State space representations of the Roesser type for convolutional layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the perspective of control theory, convolutional layers (of neural networks) are 2-D (or N-D) linear time-invariant dynamical systems. The usual representation of convolutional layers by the convolution kernel corresponds to the representation of a dynamical system by its impulse response. However, many analysis tools from control theory, e.g., involving linear matrix inequalities, require a state space representation. For this reason, we explicitly provide a state space representation of the Roesser type for 2-D convolutional layers with $c_\mathrm{in}r_1 + c_\mathrm{out}r_2$ states, where $c_\mathrm{in}$/$c_\mathrm{out}$ is the number of input/output channels of the layer and $r_1$/$r_2$ characterizes the width/length of the convolution kernel. This representation is shown to be minimal for $c_\mathrm{in} = c_\mathrm{out}$. We further construct state space representations for dilated, strided, and N-D convolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-shot imaging with femtosecond X-ray lasers is a powerful measurement technique that can achieve both high spatial and temporal resolution. However, its accuracy has been severely limited by the difficulty of applying conventional noise-reduction processing. This study uses deep learning to validate noise reduction techniques, with autoencoders serving as the learning model. Focusing on the diffraction patterns of nanoparticles, we simulated a large dataset treating the nanoparticles as composed of many independent atoms. Three neural network architectures are investigated: neural network, convolutional neural network and U-net, with U-net showing superior performance in noise reduction and subphoton reproduction. We also extended our models to apply to diffraction patterns of particle shapes different from those in the simulated data. We then applied the U-net model to a coherent diffractive imaging study, wherein a nanoparticle in a microfluidic device is exposed to a single X-ray free-electron laser pulse. After noise reduction, the reconstructed nanoparticle image improved significantly even though the nanoparticle shape was different from the training data, highlighting the importance of transfer learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D human body reconstruction has been a challenge in the field of computer vision. Previous methods are often time-consuming and difficult to capture the detailed appearance of the human body. In this paper, we propose a new method called \emph{Ultraman} for fast reconstruction of textured 3D human models from a single image. Compared to existing techniques, \emph{Ultraman} greatly improves the reconstruction speed and accuracy while preserving high-quality texture details. We present a set of new frameworks for human reconstruction consisting of three parts, geometric reconstruction, texture generation and texture mapping. Firstly, a mesh reconstruction framework is used, which accurately extracts 3D human shapes from a single image. At the same time, we propose a method to generate a multi-view consistent image of the human body based on a single image. This is finally combined with a novel texture mapping method to optimize texture details and ensure color consistency during reconstruction. Through extensive experiments and evaluations, we demonstrate the superior performance of \emph{Ultraman} on various standard datasets. In addition, \emph{Ultraman} outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of human rendering quality and speed. Upon acceptance of the article, we will make the code and data publicly available.</description>

      <title>Private, fair and accurate: Training large-scale, privacy-preserving AI models in medical imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01622v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) models are increasingly used in the medical domain. However, as medical data is highly sensitive, special precautions to ensure its protection are required. The gold standard for privacy preservation is the introduction of differential privacy (DP) to model training. Prior work indicates that DP has negative implications on model accuracy and fairness, which are unacceptable in medicine and represent a main barrier to the widespread use of privacy-preserving techniques. In this work, we evaluated the effect of privacy-preserving training of AI models regarding accuracy and fairness compared to non-private training. For this, we used two datasets: (1) A large dataset (N=193,311) of high quality clinical chest radiographs, and (2) a dataset (N=1,625) of 3D abdominal computed tomography (CT) images, with the task of classifying the presence of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Both were retrospectively collected and manually labeled by experienced radiologists. We then compared non-private deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and privacy-preserving (DP) models with respect to privacy-utility trade-offs measured as area under the receiver-operator-characteristic curve (AUROC), and privacy-fairness trade-offs, measured as Pearson's r or Statistical Parity Difference. We found that, while the privacy-preserving trainings yielded lower accuracy, they did largely not amplify discrimination against age, sex or co-morbidity. Our study shows that -- under the challenging realistic circumstances of a real-life clinical dataset -- the privacy-preserving training of diagnostic deep learning models is possible with excellent diagnostic accuracy and fairness.</description>

      <title>Cross-Shaped Windows Transformer with Self-supervised Pretraining for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Detection in Bi-parametric MRI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biparametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI) has demonstrated promising results in prostate cancer (PCa) detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Recently, transformers have achieved competitive performance compared to CNNs in computer vision. Large scale transformers need abundant annotated data for training, which are difficult to obtain in medical imaging. Self-supervised learning (SSL) utilizes unlabeled data to generate meaningful semantic representations without the need for costly annotations, enhancing model performance on tasks with limited labeled data. We introduce a novel end-to-end Cross-Shaped windows (CSwin) transformer UNet model, CSwin UNet, to detect clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in prostate bi-parametric MR imaging (bpMRI) and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed self-supervised pre-training framework. Using a large prostate bpMRI dataset with 1500 patients, we first pretrain CSwin transformer using multi-task self-supervised learning to improve data-efficiency and network generalizability. We then finetune using lesion annotations to perform csPCa detection. Five-fold cross validation shows that self-supervised CSwin UNet achieves 0.888 AUC and 0.545 Average Precision (AP), significantly outperforming four comparable models (Swin UNETR, DynUNet, Attention UNet, UNet). Using a separate bpMRI dataset with 158 patients, we evaluate our method robustness to external hold-out data. Self-supervised CSwin UNet achieves 0.79 AUC and 0.45 AP, still outperforming all other comparable methods and demonstrating good generalization to external data.</description>

      <title>RDA-INR: Riemannian Diffeomorphic Autoencoding via Implicit Neural Representations</title>

Abstract: Diffeomorphic registration frameworks such as Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) are used in computer graphics and the medical domain for atlas building, statistical latent modeling, and pairwise and groupwise registration. In recent years, researchers have developed neural network-based approaches regarding diffeomorphic registration to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of traditional methods. In this work, we focus on a limitation of neural network-based atlas building and statistical latent modeling methods, namely that they either are (i) resolution dependent or (ii) disregard any data/problem-specific geometry needed for proper mean-variance analysis. In particular, we overcome this limitation by designing a novel encoder based on resolution-independent implicit neural representations. The encoder achieves resolution invariance for LDDMM-based statistical latent modeling. Additionally, the encoder adds LDDMM Riemannian geometry to resolution-independent deep learning models for statistical latent modeling. We showcase that the Riemannian geometry aspect improves latent modeling and is required for a proper mean-variance analysis. Furthermore, to showcase the benefit of resolution independence for LDDMM-based data variability modeling, we show that our approach outperforms another neural network-based LDDMM latent code model. Our work paves a way to more research into how Riemannian geometry, shape/image analysis, and deep learning can be combined.</description>

      <title>Swin UNETR++: Advancing Transformer-Based Dense Dose Prediction Towards Fully Automated Radiation Oncology Treatments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of Radiation Oncology is uniquely positioned to benefit from the use of artificial intelligence to fully automate the creation of radiation treatment plans for cancer therapy. This time-consuming and specialized task combines patient imaging with organ and tumor segmentation to generate a 3D radiation dose distribution to meet clinical treatment goals, similar to voxel-level dense prediction. In this work, we propose Swin UNETR++, that contains a lightweight 3D Dual Cross-Attention (DCA) module to capture the intra and inter-volume relationships of each patient's unique anatomy, which fully convolutional neural networks lack. Our model was trained, validated, and tested on the Open Knowledge-Based Planning dataset. In addition to metrics of Dose Score $\overline{S_{\text{Dose}}}$ and DVH Score $\overline{S_{\text{DVH}}}$ that quantitatively measure the difference between the predicted and ground-truth 3D radiation dose distribution, we propose the qualitative metrics of average volume-wise acceptance rate $\overline{R_{\text{VA}}}$ and average patient-wise clinical acceptance rate $\overline{R_{\text{PA}}}$ to assess the clinical reliability of the predictions. Swin UNETR++ demonstrates near-state-of-the-art performance on validation and test dataset (validation: $\overline{S_{\text{DVH}}}$=1.492 Gy, $\overline{S_{\text{Dose}}}$=2.649 Gy, $\overline{R_{\text{VA}}}$=88.58%, $\overline{R_{\text{PA}}}$=100.0%; test: $\overline{S_{\text{DVH}}}$=1.634 Gy, $\overline{S_{\text{Dose}}}$=2.757 Gy, $\overline{R_{\text{VA}}}$=90.50%, $\overline{R_{\text{PA}}}$=98.0%), establishing a basis for future studies to translate 3D dose predictions into a deliverable treatment plan, facilitating full automation.</description>

Abstract: Background and objective: Uncertainty quantification is a pivotal field that contributes to realizing reliable and robust systems. It becomes instrumental in fortifying safe decisions by providing complementary information, particularly within high-risk applications. existing studies have explored various methods that often operate under specific assumptions or necessitate substantial modifications to the network architecture to effectively account for uncertainties. The objective of this paper is to study Conformal Prediction, an emerging distribution-free uncertainty quantification technique, and provide a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and limitations inherent in various methods within the medical imaging field.

      <title>Learning Exhaustive Correlation for Spectral Super-Resolution: Where Spatial-Spectral Attention Meets Linear Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectral super-resolution that aims to recover hyperspectral image (HSI) from easily obtainable RGB image has drawn increasing interest in the field of computational photography. The crucial aspect of spectral super-resolution lies in exploiting the correlation within HSIs. However, two types of bottlenecks in existing Transformers limit performance improvement and practical applications. First, existing Transformers often separately emphasize either spatial-wise or spectral-wise correlation, disrupting the 3D features of HSI and hindering the exploitation of unified spatial-spectral correlation. Second, existing self-attention mechanism always establishes full-rank correlation matrix by learning the correlation between pairs of tokens, leading to its inability to describe linear dependence widely existing in HSI among multiple tokens. To address these issues, we propose a novel Exhaustive Correlation Transformer (ECT) for spectral super-resolution. First, we propose a Spectral-wise Discontinuous 3D (SD3D) splitting strategy, which models unified spatial-spectral correlation by integrating spatial-wise continuous splitting strategy and spectral-wise discontinuous splitting strategy. Second, we propose a Dynamic Low-Rank Mapping (DLRM) model, which captures linear dependence among multiple tokens through a dynamically calculated low-rank dependence map. By integrating unified spatial-spectral attention and linear dependence, our ECT can model exhaustive correlation within HSI. The experimental results on both simulated and real data indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Codes and pretrained models will be available later.</description>

Abstract: The incorporation of LiDAR technology into some high-end smartphones has unlocked numerous possibilities across various applications, including photography, image restoration, augmented reality, and more. In this paper, we introduce a novel direction that harnesses LiDAR depth maps to enhance the compression of the corresponding RGB camera images. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the initial exploration in this particular research direction. Specifically, we propose a Transformer-based learned image compression system capable of achieving variable-rate compression using a single model while utilizing the LiDAR depth map as supplementary information for both the encoding and decoding processes. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating LiDAR yields an average PSNR gain of 0.83 dB and an average bitrate reduction of 16% as compared to its absence.</description>

      <title>Boosting Neural Representations for Videos with a Conditional Decoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising approach for video storage and processing, showing remarkable versatility across various video tasks. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage their representation capabilities, primarily due to inadequate alignment of intermediate features during target frame decoding. This paper introduces a universal boosting framework for current implicit video representation approaches. Specifically, we utilize a conditional decoder with a temporal-aware affine transform module, which uses the frame index as a prior condition to effectively align intermediate features with target frames. Besides, we introduce a sinusoidal NeRV-like block to generate diverse intermediate features and achieve a more balanced parameter distribution, thereby enhancing the model's capacity. With a high-frequency information-preserving reconstruction loss, our approach successfully boosts multiple baseline INRs in the reconstruction quality and convergence speed for video regression, and exhibits superior inpainting and interpolation results. Further, we integrate a consistent entropy minimization technique and develop video codecs based on these boosted INRs. Experiments on the UVG dataset confirm that our enhanced codecs significantly outperform baseline INRs and offer competitive rate-distortion performance compared to traditional and learning-based codecs. Code is available at https://github.com/Xinjie-Q/Boosting-NeRV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated feature extraction from MRI brain scans and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease are ongoing challenges. With advances in 3D imaging technology, 3D data acquisition is becoming more viable and efficient than its 2D counterpart. Rather than using feature-based vectors, in this paper, for the first time, we suggest a pipeline to extract novel covariance-based descriptors from the cortical surface using the Ricci energy optimization. The covariance descriptors are components of the nonlinear manifold of symmetric positive-definite matrices, thus we focus on using the Gaussian radial basis function to apply manifold-based classification to the 3D shape problem. Applying this novel signature to the analysis of abnormal cortical brain morphometry allows for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. Experimental studies performed on about two hundred 3D MRI brain models, gathered from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our descriptors in achieving remarkable classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Adversarial Training with Prior Knowledge Distillation for Robust Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural network-based image compression (NIC) has achieved excellent performance, but NIC method models have been shown to be susceptible to backdoor attacks. Adversarial training has been validated in image compression models as a common method to enhance model robustness. However, the improvement effect of adversarial training on model robustness is limited. In this paper, we propose a prior knowledge-guided adversarial training framework for image compression models. Specifically, first, we propose a gradient regularization constraint for training robust teacher models. Subsequently, we design a knowledge distillation based strategy to generate a priori knowledge from the teacher model to the student model for guiding adversarial training. Experimental results show that our method improves the reconstruction quality by about 9dB when the Kodak dataset is elected as the backdoor attack object for psnr attack. Compared with Ma2023, our method has a 5dB higher PSNR output at high bitrate points.</description>

Abstract: This work addresses the Brain Magnetic Resonance Image Synthesis for Tumor Segmentation (BraSyn) challenge, which was hosted as part of the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge in 2023. In this challenge, researchers are invited to synthesize a missing magnetic resonance image sequence, given other available sequences, to facilitate tumor segmentation pipelines trained on complete sets of image sequences. This problem can be tackled using deep learning within the framework of paired image-to-image translation. In this study, we propose investigating the effectiveness of a commonly used deep learning framework, such as Pix2Pix, trained under the supervision of different image-quality loss functions. Our results indicate that the use of different loss functions significantly affects the synthesis quality. We systematically study the impact of various loss functions in the multi-sequence MR image synthesis setting of the BraSyn challenge. Furthermore, we demonstrate how image synthesis performance can be optimized by combining different learning objectives beneficially.</description>

      <title>Biophysics Informed Pathological Regularisation for Brain Tumour Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved brain tumour segmentation techniques; however, the results still lack confidence and robustness as they solely consider image data without biophysical priors or pathological information. Integrating biophysics-informed regularisation is one effective way to change this situation, as it provides an prior regularisation for automated end-to-end learning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that designs brain tumour growth Partial Differential Equation (PDE) models as a regularisation with deep learning, operational with any network model. Our method introduces tumour growth PDE models directly into the segmentation process, improving accuracy and robustness, especially in data-scarce scenarios. This system estimates tumour cell density using a periodic activation function. By effectively integrating this estimation with biophysical models, we achieve a better capture of tumour characteristics. This approach not only aligns the segmentation closer to actual biological behaviour but also strengthens the model's performance under limited data conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive experiments on the BraTS 2023 dataset, showcasing significant improvements in both precision and reliability of tumour segmentation.</description>

      <title>Histo-Genomic Knowledge Distillation For Cancer Prognosis From Histopathology Whole Slide Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Histo-genomic multi-modal methods have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm, demonstrating significant potential for improving cancer prognosis. However, genome sequencing, unlike histopathology imaging, is still not widely accessible in underdeveloped regions, limiting the application of these multi-modal approaches in clinical settings. To address this, we propose a novel Genome-informed Hyper-Attention Network, termed G-HANet, which is capable of effectively distilling the histo-genomic knowledge during training to elevate uni-modal whole slide image (WSI)-based inference for the first time. Compared with traditional knowledge distillation methods (i.e., teacher-student architecture) in other tasks, our end-to-end model is superior in terms of training efficiency and learning cross-modal interactions. Specifically, the network comprises the cross-modal associating branch (CAB) and hyper-attention survival branch (HSB). Through the genomic data reconstruction from WSIs, CAB effectively distills the associations between functional genotypes and morphological phenotypes and offers insights into the gene expression profiles in the feature space. Subsequently, HSB leverages the distilled histo-genomic associations as well as the generated morphology-based weights to achieve the hyper-attention modeling of the patients from both histopathology and genomic perspectives to improve cancer prognosis. Extensive experiments are conducted on five TCGA benchmarking datasets and the results demonstrate that G-HANet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art WSI-based methods and achieves competitive performance with genome-based and multi-modal methods. G-HANet is expected to be explored as a useful tool by the research community to address the current bottleneck of insufficient histo-genomic data pairing in the context of cancer prognosis and precision oncology.</description>

Abstract: Deep optical optimization has recently emerged as a new paradigm for designing computational imaging systems using only the output image as the objective. However, it has been limited to either simple optical systems consisting of a single element such as a diffractive optical element (DOE) or metalens, or the fine-tuning of compound lenses from good initial designs. Here we present a DeepLens design method based on curriculum learning, which is able to learn optical designs of compound lenses ab initio from randomly initialized surfaces without human intervention, therefore overcoming the need for a good initial design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by fully automatically designing both classical imaging lenses and a large field-of-view extended depth-of-field computational lens in a cellphone-style form factor, with highly aspheric surfaces and a short back focal length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models excel in creating realistic images, yet their dependency on extensive datasets for training presents significant challenges, especially in domains where data collection is costly or challenging. Current data-efficient methods largely focus on GAN architectures, leaving a gap in training other types of generative models. Our study introduces "phased data augmentation" as a novel technique that addresses this gap by optimizing training in limited data scenarios without altering the inherent data distribution. By limiting the augmentation intensity throughout the learning phases, our method enhances the model's ability to learn from limited data, thus maintaining fidelity. Applied to a model integrating PixelCNNs with VQ-VAE-2, our approach demonstrates superior performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets. This represents an important step forward in the efficient training of likelihood-based models, extending the usefulness of data augmentation techniques beyond just GANs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Face Detection with Audio-Based Region Proposals for Human-Robot Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient face detection is critical to provide natural human-robot interactions. However, computer vision tends to involve a large computational load due to the amount of data (i.e. pixels) that needs to be processed in a short amount of time. This is undesirable on robotics platforms where multiple processes need to run in parallel and where the processing power is limited by portability constraints. Existing solutions often involve reducing image quality which can negatively impact processing. The literature also reports methods to generate regions of interest in images from pixel data. Although it is a promising idea, these methods often involve heavy vision algorithms. In this paper, we evaluate how audio can be used to generate regions of interest in optical images to reduce the number of pixels to process with computer vision. Thereby, we propose a unique attention mechanism to localize a speech source and evaluate its impact on an existing face detection algorithm. Our results show that the attention mechanism reduces the computational load and offers an interesting trade-off between speed and accuracy. The proposed pipeline is flexible and can be easily adapted to other applications such as robot surveillance, video conferences or smart glasses.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic Computing promises orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared to traditional von Neumann computing paradigm. The goal is to develop an adaptive, fault-tolerant, low-footprint, fast, low-energy intelligent system by learning and emulating brain functionality which can be realized through innovation in different abstraction layers including material, device, circuit, architecture and algorithm. As the energy consumption in complex vision tasks keep increasing exponentially due to larger data set and resource-constrained edge devices become increasingly ubiquitous, spike-based neuromorphic computing approaches can be viable alternative to deep convolutional neural network that is dominating the vision field today. In this book chapter, we introduce neuromorphic computing, outline a few representative examples from different layers of the design stack (devices, circuits and algorithms) and conclude with a few exciting applications and future research directions that seem promising for computer vision in the near future.</description>

      <title>Exposure Bracketing is All You Need for Unifying Image Restoration and Enhancement Tasks</title>

Abstract: It is highly desired but challenging to acquire high-quality photos with clear content in low-light environments. Although multi-image processing methods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made significant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus on specific restoration or enhancement problems, being insufficient in exploiting multi-image. Motivated by that multi-exposure images are complementary in denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we propose to utilize exposure bracketing photography to unify restoration and enhancement tasks in this work. Due to the difficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we suggest a solution that first pre-trains the model with synthetic paired data and then adapts it to real-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally modulated recurrent network (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are proposed. Moreover, we construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs and collect real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios. Experiments on both datasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art multi-image processing ones. The dataset, code, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/cszhilu1998/BracketIRE.</description>

      <title>Control and Automation for Industrial Production Storage Zone: Generation of Optimal Route Using Image Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital image processing (DIP) is of great importance in validating and guaranteeing parameters that ensure the quality of mass-produced products. Therefore, this article focused on developing an industrial automation method for a zone of a production line model using the DIP. The neo-cascade methodology employed allowed for defining each of the stages in an adequate way, ensuring the inclusion of the relevant methods for its development, which finally incurred in the modeling, design, implementation, and testing of an optimal route generation system for a warehouse area, using DIP with optimization guidelines, in conjunction with an embedded platform and the connection to programmable logic controllers (PLCs) for its execution. The system was based on the OpenCV library; tool focused on artificial vision, which was implemented on an object-oriented programming (OOP) platform based on Java language. It generated the optimal route for the automation of processes in a scale warehouse area, using the segmentation of objects and the optimization of flow in networks as pillars, ending with the connection to PLCs as a method of action, which in case of implementation would eliminate constraints such as process inefficiency, the use of manpower to perform these tasks, inadequate use of resources, among others</description>
