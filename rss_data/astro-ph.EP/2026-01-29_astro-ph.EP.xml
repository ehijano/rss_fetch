      <title>The CO snow line favours strong clumping by the streaming instability in protoplanetary discs with porous grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The radial drift and fragmentation of small dust grains in protoplanetary discs impedes their growth past centimetre sizes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to overcome these planet formation barriers, such as dust porosity or the streaming instability (SI), which is today regarded as the most promising mechanism to form planetesimals. Aims: Here, we examine whether the conditions for the SI to lead to strong clumping, the first step in planetesimal formation, are realised in protoplanetary discs containing porous grains. Methods: We used results from previous simulations of the evolution of porous grains subjected to growth, fragmentation, compaction and bouncing in protoplanetary discs. In the ensuing disc structures, we determined the regions where the dust-to-gas ratio exceeds the critical value for strong clumping found in simulations of the SI including external turbulence. Results: We find that the conditions for strong clumping are met within the first hundred thousand years in large regions of protoplanetary discs containing porous grains, provided that the CO snow line is taken into account. If the CO snow line is neglected, the conditions are met only very close to the inner disc edge early on, or over large areas well after 200,000 yr.</description>

      <title>Exomoons and Exorings with the Habitable Worlds Observatory II: Finding Endor with Lunar Eclipses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant planets in the habitable zone may host exomoons with conditions conducive to life. In this paper we describe a method by which the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) could detect such moons: broadband reflected-light lunar eclipses (e.g., the moon passing into the shadow of the planet). We find that an Earth-like moon orbiting a Jovian-size planet at 1au can outshine its host planet near 1 micron, producing frequent (days time-scale) lunar eclipses with depths of order 50%. We determine that single eclipse events out to $\sim$12pc may be detectable for Earth-like moons around giant planets, down to $0.9R_\oplus$. Detection of smaller moons, $\sim$0.5$R_\oplus$ (corresponding to about the size of Mars or Ganymede), may be possible, but would generally require multiple events for most systems. These several-hour events provide a clear pathway to detecting habitable moons with HWO, given sufficient stare-time on each system to detect lunar eclipses. The occurrence rate of habitable exomoons remains unconstrained, however, making the ultimate yield uncertain. HWO will be capable of placing the first meaningful constraints on the frequency of habitable exomoons around giant planets; if it is non-negligible, HWO could also search for life on these worlds, possibly with lunar eclipse spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>H$_2^{18}$O in the terrestrial planet-forming regions of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotopologues play an important role in solar system cosmochemistry studies, revealing details of early planet formation physics and chemistry. Oxygen isotopes, as measured in solar system materials, reveal evidence for both mass-dependent fractionation processes and a mass-independent process commonly attributed to isotope-selective photodissociation of CO in the solar nebula. The sensitivity of JWST's MIRI-MRS enables studies of isotopologues in the terrestrial planet-forming regions around nearby young stars. We report here on a search for H$_2^{18}$O in 22 disks from the JDISC Survey with evidence for substantial water vapor reservoirs, with the goal of measuring H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O ratios, and potentially revealing the predicted enhancement of H$_2^{18}$O caused by isotope-selective photodissociation. We find marginal detections of H$_2^{18}$O in six disks, and a more significant detection of H$_2^{18}$O in the disk around WSB 52. Modeling of the detected H$_2^{18}$O lines assuming an ISM ratio of H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O predicts H$_2^{18}$O features consistent with observations for four of the modeled disks, but stronger H$_2^{18}$O features than are observed in three of the modeled disks, which includes WSB 52. Therefore, these latter three disks require a higher H$_2^{16}$O/H$_2^{18}$O ratio than the ISM in the water-emitting region, in contrast to long-standing theoretical expectations. We suggest that either the H$_2^{18}$O-rich water has been removed from the emitting region and replaced by H$_2^{18}$O-poor water formed by reactions with $^{18}$O-poor CO, or that the gas-phase water is depleted in $^{18}$O via mass-dependent fractionation processes at the water snowline.</description>

      <title>Orbital stability of compact three-planet systems III. The role of three-body resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational surveys show that at least ~ 30% of short-period multiplanetary systems host tightly packed planets, some of which are locked in stable chains of mean-motion resonances. Despite recent progress, the dynamical stability of these systems remains only partially understood. Numerical simulations have established a general exponential increase in system lifetime with orbital separation, with mean-motion resonances playing a key role in regulating stability. Tightly packed three-planet systems exhibit a distinctive behavior not seen in higher-multiplicity systems: a small yet significant region of phase space is anomalously stable. This study investigates the dynamics of extremely compact three-planet systems, focusing on anomalously long-lived configurations and their connection to resonant chains observed in exoplanetary systems. We perform numerical integrations of coplanar, initially circular, equal-mass three-planet systems over stellar-lifetime timescales and at high resolution in orbital separation, and interpret the results in the context of recent analytical work. We identify regions of phase space hosting anomalously stable orbits, including systems surviving multiple orders of magnitude longer than predicted by the exponential trend. We demonstrate a clear link between stability and isolated three-body mean-motion resonances, showing that extremely compact systems can remain stable when captured into a small subset of isolated zeroth-order resonances. Stability further depends on the initial orbital longitudes and on the interplay between the three-body and two-body resonance networks.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent $N$-body simulation of Planetesimal-Driven Migration. II. The effect of PDM on planet formation from a planetesimal disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the canonical planet formation theory, planets form "in-situ" within a planetesimal disk via runaway and oligarchic growth. This theory, however, cannot naturally account for the formation timescale of ice giants or the existence of diverse exoplanetary systems. Planetary migration is a key to resolving these problems. One well-known mechanism of planetary migration is planetesimal-driven migration (PDM), which can let planets undergo significant migration through gravitational scattering of planetesimals. In our previous paper (Jinno et al. 2024, PASJ, 76, 1309), we investigated the migration of a single planet through PDM, addressing previously unexplored aspects of both the gravitational interactions among planetesimals and the interactions with disk gas. Here we perform the first high-resolution simulations of planet formation from a large-scale planetesimal disk, incorporating planet-gas disk interactions, planet-planetesimal interactions, gravitational interactions among all planetesimals, and physical collisions between planetesimals to investigate the role of PDM in the planet formation process. Our results show that protoplanets undergo dynamic inward/outward migrations during the runaway growth stage via PDM. Moreover, orbital repulsion combined with PDM tends to make two groups of protoplanets, outer ones going outward and inner ones going inward. Such dynamic migration significantly influences the early stages of planetary formation. These findings provide a viable pathway for the formation of Earth-like planets and ice giants' cores. Furthermore, they suggest that a standard protoplanetary disk model can account for the planetary migration necessary to explain diverse exoplanetary systems without the need for additional hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Observations of the temporal evolution of Saturn's stratosphere following the Great Storm of 2010-2011. II. Latitudinal distribution of CO and stratospheric winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saturn's Great Storm of 2010-2011 has produced two stratospheric hot spots, the "beacons," that eventually merged to produce a gigantic one in April and May 2011. This beacon perturbed stratospheric temperatures, hydrocarbon, and water abundances for several years. We aim to assess whether the beacon induced any perturbation in another oxygen species, namely CO. A second goal is to measure how the vortex perturbed the stratospheric wind regime. We conducted interferometric observations of Saturn in the submillimeter range with SMA and ALMA to spatially resolve the CO (J=3-2) and (J=2-1) emissions, respectively. We used a previously determined CO vertical profile as a template, to search for (i) the meridional distribution of CO and (ii) variations of the CO abundance associated with the storm. The high spatial and spectral resolutions of the ALMA observations enabled us to retrieve the winds from the Doppler shifts induced by the winds on the lines. Despite limitations resulting from the removal of baseline ripples, we find a relatively constant meridional distribution of CO. The average CO mole fraction implied by the adopted and rescaled 220-year-old-comet-impact vertical profile is (1.7$\pm$0.7)$\times10^{-7}$ at 0.3\,mbar, i.e., where the contribution functions peak. We also find that the CO abundance has not been noticeably altered in the beacon. The winds measured at 1\,mbar show striking differences with those measured in 2018, after the demise of the beacon. We find the signature of the vortex as an anticyclonic feature. The equatorial prograde jet is 100 to 200 m.s$^{-1}$ slower, and broader in latitude, than in quiescent conditions. We also detect several prograde jets in the southern hemisphere. Finally, we detect a retrograde jet at 74$^\circ$N which could be a polar jet caused by the interaction of the Saturn magnetosphere with its atmosphere.</description>

Abstract: Earth-like planets orbiting in the habitable zone of K- to G-type stars create an RV effect in amplitude of less than 1 \si{\meter\per\second} and have orbital periods of hundreds of days. Only long-term RV surveys with sub-meter per second precision instruments can explore the outer regions of Sun-like stars and look for Earth-like planets and super-Earths. We present the analysis of the K-type star HD 176986. It has a brightness of V=8.45 mag and a distance from the Sun of d = 27.88 pc. This star hosts a known planetary system of two super-Earths. We joined historical datasets with new data collected in an ongoing blind search program. We took advantage of recently developed tools for RV extraction and stellar activity filtering. The analysis of activity indicators permits us to determine the period of the magnetic cycle of the star alongside its rotation period. We performed a joint analysis of RVs and activity indicators through multidimensional GPs to better constrain the activity model in RVs and avoid overfitting. We detected a new planet orbiting the star and retrieved the two known planets. HD 176986 b has an orbital period of 6.49164$^{+0.00030}_{-0.00029}$ d and a minimum mass of 5.36 $\pm$ 0.44 M$\oplus$. HD 176986 c has an orbital period of P$_c$ = 16.8124 $\pm$ 0.0015 d and a minimum mass of 9.75$_{-0.64}^{+0.65}$ M$\oplus$. HD 176986 d has an orbital period of 61.376$^{+0.051}_{-0.049}$ d and a minimum mass of 6.76$_{-0.92}^{+0.91}$ M$\oplus$. From the analysis of activity indicators, we find evidence of a magnetic cycle with a period of 2432$_{-59}^{+64}$ d, along with a rotation period of 36.05 $_{-0.71}^{+0.67}$ d. We discover a new planet in the multi-planet system orbiting the K-type star HD 176986. All the planets have minimum masses compatible with super-Earths or mini-Neptunes.</description>

      <title>Climates of Terrestrial Exoplanets and Biosignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the climates of terrestrial exoplanets and the detectability of biosignatures is an inherently interdisciplinary challenge, requiring the integration of insights from Solar System exploration, exoplanet observations and climate science. Building from Earth as the only known inhabited planet, NCCR PlanetS has developed models, tools and observational strategies to assess planetary environments far beyond direct reach. Between 2018 and 2025, PlanetS made major contributions across theory, modelling, instrumentation and mission preparation. On the modelling side, the Generic Planetary Climate Model enabled climate studies across a wide range of planetary regimes, from early Venus to temperate terrestrial exoplanets including Proxima b, incorporating advanced developments such as a dynamical slab ocean. In parallel, the THOR global climate model was developed to avoid Earth-centric assumptions and to stably simulate diverse atmospheric regimes. PlanetS has also advanced atmospheric retrieval techniques combining forward modelling, Bayesian inference and machine learning, applied to targets ranging from Solar System bodies to exoplanet phase curves and directly imaged spectra. These efforts have helped assess the scientific return of future missions, notably the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets (LIFE) and to define instrumental requirements for detecting Earth-like atmospheres and biosignatures. Within the Solar System, PlanetS contributed key technologies for biosignature detection, including ORIGIN and SenseLife, enabling in-situ and remote detection of organics, isotopic ratios and microstructures. Finally, PlanetS has played a major role in preparing the next generation of observatories, from JWST, VLT and ELT instruments to LIFE and the Habitable Worlds Observatory. Together, these contributions form an integrated framework advancing the search for life beyond Earth.</description>

      <title>On the rotational properties of M-type asteroids: recent evidence for higher rotation rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotational dynamics of asteroids carry important information about their internal structure, collisional history and material composition. This work investigates whether metallic (M-type) asteroids exhibit systematically higher rotation rates than the broader asteroid population. Using recent Mahlke's taxonomy and a multi-method statistical approach that combines classical hypothesis testing, regression modeling, and resampling techniques, we consistently find evidence that metallic asteroids rotate, on average, faster. The results remain robust across different ways of controlling for asteroid size and sampling biases. While limitations remain due to sample size, heterogeneous data sources, and possible selection effects, the convergence of independent methods strengthens the conclusion that metallic composition is associated with higher rotation rates. This finding supports the hypothesis that metallic bodies possess greater internal cohesion, with implications for the formation and collisional evolution of small bodies in the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Extreme winds on the emerging dayside of an ultrahot Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy provides a unique opportunity to directly probe atmospheric dynamics by resolving Doppler shifts of planetary signal as a function of orbital phases. Using the optical spectrometer Keck Planet Finder (KPF), we carry out a pilot study on high-resolution phase curve spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-9 b. We spectrally and temporally resolve its dayside emission from post-transit to pre-eclipse (orbital phase phi = 0.1 - 0.45). The signal strength and width increase with orbital phases as the dayside rotates into view. The net Doppler shift varies progressively from -13.4 +/- 0.6 to -0.4 +/- 1.0 km/s, the extent of which exceeds its rotation velocity of 6.4 +/- 0.1 km/s, providing unambiguous evidence of atmospheric winds. We devise a retrieval framework to fit the full time-series spectra, accounting for the variation of line profiles due to the rotation and winds. We retrieve a supersonic day-to-night wind speed up to 11.7 +/- 0.6 km/s on the emerging dayside, representing the most extreme atmospheric winds in hot Jupiters to date. Comparison to 3D circulation models reveals a weak atmospheric drag, consistent with relatively efficient heat recirculation as also supported by space-based phase curve measurements. Additionally, we retrieve the dayside chemistry (including Fe i, Fe ii, Ti i, Ti ii, Ca i, Ca ii, Mg i, and Si i) and temperature structure, and place constraints on the nightside thermal profile. Our high-resolution phase curve spectra and the measured supersonic winds provide excellent benchmarks for extreme physics in circulation models, demonstrating the power of this technique in understanding climates of hot Jupiters.</description>

      <title>Stellar and orbital characterization of three low mass M dwarf binary stars with dynamical spectroscopy from the Habitable Zone Planet Finder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical models of low-mass stars continue to be discrepant with observations when used to examine the mass-radius relationship and other physical parameters of individual stars. High-resolution spectroscopy that leads to dynamical measurements of binary stars can directly improve these models. We have been using the Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph to monitor binary stars with M dwarf components. Here, we measure the orbital and stellar parameters for three such systems: LSPM J0515+5911, NLTT 43564, and NLTT 45468. Each system has dozens of spectra obtained over a baseline of several years. None of the systems appear to be eclipsing, so our ability to turn them into true benchmark binaries with purely dynamical measurements is limited. We use literature photometry to estimate each system's spectral energy distribution and utilize models in combination with detection limits of our spectroscopic measurements to probe characteristics of the companions. LSPM J0515+5911 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary with period of $126.948 \pm 0.029$ days and derived minimum masses, $M_1\sin^3i =0.058 \pm 0.002$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2\sin^3i = 0.046 \pm 0.001$ $M_\odot$ for the primary and secondary components, respectively. We solved NLTT 43564 with period of $1877 \pm 24$ days and NLTT 45468 with period of $9.686 \pm 0.001$ days as single lined systems, and modeled the primary masses to be $M_1 = 0.32\pm{0.02}$ $M_\odot$ and $M_1 = 0.35^{+0.02}_{-0.07}$ $M_\odot$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Spatial distribution of organics in the Horsehead nebula: signposts of chemistry driven by atomic carbon</title>

Abstract: (Abridged) Complex organic molecules (COMs) are considered essential precursors to prebiotic species. While COMs were once expected to be efficiently destroyed under UV-irradiated conditions, detections in photodissociation regions (PDRs) have challenged this view. However, the mechanisms by which UV radiation contributes to their formation are still uncertain. Here, we present moderately resolved maps of simple and complex organic molecules at the UV-illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula, obtained by combining ALMA and IRAM 30m single-dish observations at $\sim 15^{\prime\prime}$ resolution. We analyze the spatial distribution of species such as C$^{17}$O, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, CH$_3$CN, and HC$_3$N. By incorporating previous C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O single-dish data as well as PdBI maps of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH, we derive profiles of gas density, temperature, thermal pressure, and column densities of the organic species as a function of distance from the UV source. Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry$-$possibly seeded by grain-surface products$-$cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation Improvements in Giant Exoplanet Evolutionary and Structural Models</title>

Abstract: Many evolutionary models of giant exoplanets still rely on simplifying assumptions that are no longer adequate given detailed constraints from Jupiter, Saturn, and modern exoplanet observations. Here, we identify the key physical improvements required for next-generation planetary evolution models using our code, \texttt{APPLE}, which enables systematic emulation and extension of legacy studies. We quantify the effects of updated equations of state, helium rain, fuzzy cores, non-adiabatic and compositionally inhomogeneous envelopes, and improved atmospheric boundary conditions by first isolating the impact of each physical ingredient and then constructing combined baseline models for planets with masses between 0.3 and 4~$M_{\rm Jup}$ to assess their collective influence on planetary structure and observable properties. We find that the adoption of modern equations of state and realistic heavy-element distributions leads to systematic, but sometimes subtle, differences ($\sim 5$ to 10\%) in radius evolution, while helium rain and the treatment of convection can significantly alter thermal histories and atmospheric compositions (by $\sim$ 5 to 20\%). These updated physical processes must be incorporated into the next-generation exoplanet evolutionary models to achieve physically consistent interpretations of planetary observations.</description>

      <title>Beyond solar metallicity: How enhanced solid content in disks re-shape low-mass planet torques</title>

Abstract: The migration of low-mass planets is tightly controlled by the torques exerted by both gas and solids in their natal disks. While canonical models assume a solar solid-to-gas mass ratio (epsilon=0.01) and neglect the back-reaction of solid component of the disk, recent work suggests that enhanced metallicity can radically alter these torques. We quantify how elevated metallicities (epsilon=0.03 and epsilon=0.1) modify the gas and solid torques, test widely used linear scaling prescriptions, and identify the regimes where solid back-reaction becomes decisive. We performed global, 2D hydrodynamic simulations that treat solid material as a pressureless fluid fully coupled to the gas through drag and include the reciprocal back-reaction force. The planet was maintained on a fixed circular orbit, thus we computed static torques. The Stokes number was varied from 0.01 to 10, three surface-density slopes (p=0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) and three accretion efficiencies (eta=0, 10, and 100%) were explored. Torques, obtained by rescaling canonical epsilon=0.01 results, were compared with direct simulations. Solid torques scale linearly with epsilon, but gas torques deviate by 50-100% and can even reverse sign for St&lt;=1 in epsilon=0.1 disks. These are due to strong, feedback-driven, asymmetric gas perturbations in the co-orbital region, amplified by rapid planetary accretion. Solid back-reaction in high-metallicity environments can dominate the migration torque budget of low-mass planets. Simple metallicity rescalings are therefore unreliable for St&lt;=2, implying that precise migration tracks - particularly in metal-rich disks -- require simulations that fully couple solid and gas dynamics. These results highlight metallicity as a key parameter in shaping the early orbital architecture of planetary systems.</description>
