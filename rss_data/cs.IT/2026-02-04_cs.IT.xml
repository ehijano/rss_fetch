      <title>Precoding-Oriented CSI Feedback Design with Mutual Information Regularized VQ-VAE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient channel state information (CSI) compression at the user equipment plays a key role in enabling accurate channel reconstruction and precoder design in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. A key challenge lies in balancing the CSI feedback overhead with the achievable downlink rate, i.e., maximizing the utility of limited feedback to maintain high system performance. In this work, we propose a precoding-oriented CSI feedback framework based on a vector quantized variational autoencoder, augmented with an information-theoretic regularization. To achieve this, we introduce a differentiable mutual information lower-bound estimator as a training regularizer to promote effective utilization of the learned codebook under a fixed feedback budget. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves rates comparable to variable-length neural compression schemes, while operating with fixed-length feedback. Furthermore, the learned codewords exhibit significantly more uniform usage and capture interpretable structures that are strongly correlated with the underlying channel state information.</description>

      <title>Rate-Distortion Analysis of Optically Passive Vision Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of remote vision sensors for autonomous decision-making poses the challenge of transmitting high-volume visual data over resource-constrained channels in real-time. In robotics and control applications, many systems can quickly destabilize, which can exacerbate the issue by necessitating higher sampling frequencies. This work proposes a novel sensing paradigm in which an event camera observes the optically generated cosine transform of a visual scene, enabling high-speed, computation-free video compression inspired by modern video codecs. In this study, we simulate this optically passive vision compression (OPVC) scheme and compare its rate-distortion performance to that of a standalone event camera (SAEC). We find that the rate-distortion performance of the OPVC scheme surpasses that of the SAEC and that this performance gap increases as the spatial resolution of the event camera increases.</description>

      <title>Straggler-Aware Coded Polynomial Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) in distributed computing systems enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial computations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. However, existing CPA schemes are restricted to an idealized setting in which the system cannot tolerate stragglers. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems with a pre-specified non-straggler pattern, where exact recovery is required for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main results show that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than that required by polynomial codes based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA. We identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. When the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large, we further show that this threshold is necessary in a generic sense. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations verify our theoretical results by demonstrating a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted intersection threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterization of entropy functions is of fundamental importance in information theory. By imposing constraints on their Shannon outer bound, i.e., the polymatroidal region, one obtains the faces of the region and entropy functions on them with special structures. In this paper, we characterize entropy functions on 2-dimensional faces of polymatroid region of degree n with one extreme ray containing rank-1 matroid. We classify all such 2-dimensional faces with another extreme ray containing a matroid into four types.</description>

      <title>Universal Costas Matrices: Towards a General Framework for Costas Array Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Costas arrays are a special type of permutation matrices with ideal autocorrelation and low cross-correlation properties, making them valuable for radar, wireless communication, and integrated sensing and communication applications. This paper presents a novel unified framework for analyzing and discovering new Costas arrays. We introduce Universal Costas Matrices (UCMs) and Universal Costas Frequency Matrices (UCFMs) and investigate their structural characteristics. A framework integrating UCMs and UCFMs is proposed to pave the way for future artificial intelligence-assisted Costas array discovery. Leveraging the structural properties of UCMs and UCFMs, a reconstruction-based search method is developed to generate UCMs from UCFMs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly accelerates the search process and enhances structural insight into Costas array generation.</description>

      <title>On (Im)possibility of Network Oblivious Transfer via Noisy Channels and Non-Signaling Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the fundamental limits of implementing network oblivious transfer via noisy multiple access channels and broadcast channels between honest-but-curious parties when the parties have access to general tripartite non-signaling correlations. By modeling the shared resource as an arbitrary tripartite non-signaling box, we obtain a unified perspective on both the channel behavior and the resulting correlations. Our main result demonstrates that perfect oblivious transfer is impossible. In the asymptotic regime, we further show that even negligible leakage cannot be achieved, as repeated use of the resource amplifies the receiver(s)'s ability to distinguish messages that were not intended for him/them. In contrast, the receiver(s)'s own privacy is not subject to a universal impossibility limitation.</description>

      <title>Generative Decompression: Optimal Lossy Decoding Against Distribution Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses optimal decoding strategies in lossy compression where the assumed distribution for compressor design mismatches the actual (true) distribution of the source. This problem has immediate relevance in standardized communication systems where the decoder acquires side information or priors about the true distribution that are unavailable to the fixed encoder. We formally define the mismatched quantization problem, demonstrating that the optimal reconstruction rule, termed generative decompression, aligns with classical Bayesian estimation by taking the conditional expectation under the true distribution given the quantization indices and adapting it to fixed-encoder constraints. This strategy effectively performs a generative Bayesian correction on the decoder side, strictly outperforming the conventional centroid rule. We extend this framework to transmission over noisy channels, deriving a robust soft-decoding rule that quantifies the inefficiency of standard modular source--channel separation architectures under mismatch. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to task-oriented decoding, showing that the optimal strategy shifts from conditional mean estimation to maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection. Experimental results on Gaussian sources and deep-learning-based semantic classification demonstrate that generative decompression closes a vast majority of the performance gap to the ideal joint-optimization benchmark, enabling adaptive, high-fidelity reconstruction without modifying the encoder.</description>

      <title>Secure Decentralized Pliable Index Coding for Target Data Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Pliable Index Coding (DPIC) problem addresses efficient information exchange in distributed systems where clients communicate among themselves without a central server. An important consideration in DPIC is the heterogeneity of side-information and demand sizes. Although many prior works assume homogeneous settings with identical side-information cardinality and single message demands, these assumptions limit real-world applicability where clients typically possess unequal amounts of prior information. In this paper, we study DPIC problem under heterogeneous side-information cardinalities. We propose a transmission scheme that coordinates client broadcasts to maximize coding efficiency while ensuring that each client achieves a common target level $T$. In addition, we impose a strict security constraint that no client acquires more than the target $T$ number of messages, guaranteeing that each client ends up with exactly $T$ messages. We analyze the communication cost incurred by the proposed scheme under this security constraint.</description>

      <title>Sleep or Transmit: Dual-Mode Energy-Efficient Design for NOMA-Enabled Backscatter Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices demands communication systems that are both spectrally efficient and energy frugal. Backscatter communication (BackCom) is an attractive low-power paradigm, but its spectral efficiency declines in dense deployments. This paper presents an uplink BackCom design that integrates non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and maximizes system energy efficiency (EE). In a bistatic network where multiple backscatter nodes (BNs) harvest RF energy and alternate between sleep and active modes, we formulate a fractional program with coupled time, power, and reflection variables and develop a Dinkelbach-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with closed-form updates. Analysis reveals two operating modes depending on power availability, circuit demands and propagation conditions. Simulations show the proposed design adapts the time allocation, achieving up to 8% higher EE than fixed-power and 68% than no-sleep baselines, and delivering up to 127% EE gains over orthogonal multiple access (OMA). These results establish NOMA-enabled BackCom as a scalable, energy efficient solution for large-scale IoT deployments.</description>

      <title>Joint single-shot ToA and DoA estimation for VAA-based BLE ranging with phase ambiguity: A deep learning-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation methods rely on multi-antenna arrays, which are costly to implement on size-constrained Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. Virtual antenna array (VAA) techniques enable DoA estimation with a single antenna, making angle estimation feasible on such devices. However, BLE only provides a single-shot two-way channel frequency response (CFR) with a binary phase ambiguity issue, which hinders the direct application of VAA. To address this challenge, we propose a unified model that combines VAA with BLE two-way CFR, and introduce a neural network based phase recovery framework that employs row / column predictors with a voting mechanism to resolve the ambiguity. The recovered one-way CFR then enables super resolution algorithms such as MUSIC for joint time of arrival (ToA) and DoA estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance under non-uniform VAAs, with mean square errors approaching the Cramer Rao bound at SNR $\geq$ 5 dB.</description>

      <title>Relaxed Triangle Inequality for Kullback-Leibler Divergence Between Multivariate Gaussian Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is not a proper distance metric and does not satisfy the triangle inequality, posing theoretical challenges in certain practical applications. Existing work has demonstrated that KL divergence between multivariate Gaussian distributions follows a relaxed triangle inequality. Given any three multivariate Gaussian distributions $\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_2$, and $\mathcal{N}_3$, if $KL(\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_2)\leq \epsilon_1$ and $KL(\mathcal{N}_2, \mathcal{N}_3)\leq \epsilon_2$, then $KL(\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_3)&lt; 3\epsilon_1+3\epsilon_2+2\sqrt{\epsilon_1\epsilon_2}+o(\epsilon_1)+o(\epsilon_2)$. However, the supremum of $KL(\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_3)$ is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate the relaxed triangle inequality for the KL divergence between multivariate Gaussian distributions and give the supremum of $KL(\mathcal{N}_1, \mathcal{N}_3)$ as well as the conditions when the supremum can be attained. When $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ are small, the supremum is $\epsilon_1+\epsilon_2+\sqrt{\epsilon_1\epsilon_2}+o(\epsilon_1)+o(\epsilon_2)$. Finally, we demonstrate several applications of our results in out-of-distribution detection with flow-based generative models and safe reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>When Efficient Communication Explains Convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much recent work has argued that the variation in the languages of the world can be explained from the perspective of efficient communication; in particular, languages can be seen as optimally balancing competing pressures to be simple and to be informative. Focusing on the expression of meaning -- semantic typology -- the present paper asks what factors are responsible for successful explanations in terms of efficient communication. Using the Information Bottleneck (IB) approach to formalizing this trade-off, we first demonstrate and analyze a correlation between optimality in the IB sense and a novel generalization of convexity to this setting. In a second experiment, we manipulate various modeling parameters in the IB framework to determine which factors drive the correlation between convexity and optimality. We find that the convexity of the communicative need distribution plays an especially important role. These results move beyond showing that efficient communication can explain aspects of semantic typology into explanations for why that is the case by identifying which underlying factors are responsible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the quickest change detection of quantum states in a universal setting: specifically, where the post-change quantum state is not known a priori. We establish the asymptotic optimality of a two-stage approach in terms of worst average delay to detection. The first stage employs block POVMs with classical outputs that preserve quantum relative entropy to arbitrary precision. The second stage leverages a recently proposed windowed-CUSUM algorithm that is known to be asymptotically optimal for quickest change detection with an unknown post-change distribution in the classical setting.</description>

      <title>Estimating measures of information processing during cognitive tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cognition is increasingly framed in terms of information processing, yet most fMRI analyses focus on activation or functional connectivity rather than quantifying how information is stored and transferred. To remedy this problem, we propose a framework for estimating measures of information processing: active information storage (AIS), transfer entropy (TE), and net synergy from task-based fMRI. AIS measures information maintained within a region, TE captures directed information flow, and net synergy contrasts higher-order synergistic to redundant interactions. Crucially, to enable this framework we utilised a recently developed approach for calculating information-theoretic measures: the cross mutual information. This approach combines resting-state and task data to address the challenges of limited sample size, non-stationarity and context in task-based fMRI. We applied this framework to the working memory (N-back) task from the Human Connectome Project (470 participants). Results show that AIS increases in fronto-parietal regions with working memory load, TE reveals enhanced directed information flows across control pathways, and net synergy indicates a global shift to redundancy. This work establishes a novel methodology for quantifying information processing in task-based fMRI.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Approximate Message Passing Algorithms for Rectangular Spiked Matrix Models with Rotationally Invariant Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm for signal estimation in the rectangular spiked matrix model with general rotationally invariant (RI) noise. We establish a rigorous state evolution that exactly characterizes the high-dimensional dynamics of the algorithm. Building on this framework, we derive an optimal variant of OAMP that minimizes the predicted mean-squared error at each iteration. For the special case of i.i.d. Gaussian noise, the fixed point of the proposed OAMP algorithm coincides with that of the standard AMP algorithm. For general RI noise models, we conjecture that the optimal OAMP algorithm is statistically optimal within a broad class of iterative methods, and achieves Bayes-optimal performance in certain regimes.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Multi-Model Fusion for Target-Oriented Adaptive Sampling in Materials Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target-oriented discovery under limited evaluation budgets requires making reliable progress in high-dimensional, heterogeneous design spaces where each new measurement is costly, whether experimental or high-fidelity simulation. We present an information-theoretic framework for target-oriented adaptive sampling that reframes optimization as trajectory discovery: instead of approximating the full response surface, the method maintains and refines a low-entropy information state that concentrates search on target-relevant directions. The approach couples data, model beliefs, and physics/structure priors through dimension-aware information budgeting, adaptive bootstrapped distillation over a heterogeneous surrogate reservoir, and structure-aware candidate manifold analysis with Kalman-inspired multi-model fusion to balance consensus-driven exploitation and disagreement-driven exploration. Evaluated under a single unified protocol without dataset-specific tuning, the framework improves sample efficiency and reliability across 14 single- and multi-objective materials design tasks spanning candidate pools from $600$ to $4 \times 10^6$ and feature dimensions from $10$ to $10^3$, typically reaching top-performing regions within 100 evaluations. Complementary 20-dimensional synthetic benchmarks (Ackley, Rastrigin, Schwefel) further demonstrate robustness to rugged and multimodal landscapes.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Distributed Combining Design for Near-Field Cell-Free XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the low-complexity distributed combining scheme design for near-field cell-free extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (CF XL-MIMO) systems. Firstly, we construct the uplink spectral efficiency (SE) performance analysis framework for CF XL-MIMO systems over centralized and distributed processing schemes. Notably, we derive the centralized minimum mean-square error (CMMSE) and local minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) combining schemes over arbitrary channel estimators. Then, focusing on the CMMSE and LMMSE combining schemes, we propose five low-complexity distributed combining schemes based on the matrix approximation methodology or the symmetric successive over relaxation (SSOR) algorithm. More specifically, we propose two matrix approximation methodology-aided combining schemes: Global Statistics \&amp; Local Instantaneous information-based MMSE (GSLI-MMSE) and Statistics matrix Inversion-based LMMSE (SI-LMMSE). These two schemes are derived by approximating the global instantaneous information in the CMMSE combining and the local instantaneous information in the LMMSE combining with the global and local statistics information by asymptotic analysis and matrix expectation approximation, respectively. Moreover, by applying the low-complexity SSOR algorithm to iteratively solve the matrix inversion in the LMMSE combining, we derive three distributed SSOR-based LMMSE combining schemes, distinguished from the applied information and initial values.</description>

      <title>Statistics Approximation-Enabled Distributed Beamforming for Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a distributed beamforming approach for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output networks, referred to as Global Statistics \&amp; Local Instantaneous information-based minimum mean-square error (GSLI-MMSE). The scenario with multi-antenna access points (APs) is considered over three different channel models: correlated Rician fading with fixed or random line-of-sight (LoS) phase-shifts, and correlated Rayleigh fading. With the aid of matrix inversion derivations, we can construct the conventional MMSE combining from the perspective of each AP, where global instantaneous information is involved. Then, for an arbitrary AP, we apply the statistics approximation methodology to approximate instantaneous terms related to other APs by channel statistics to construct the distributed combining scheme at each AP with local instantaneous information and global statistics. With the aid of uplink-downlink duality, we derive the respective GSLI-MMSE precoding schemes. Numerical results showcase that the proposed GSLI-MMSE scheme demonstrates performance comparable to the optimal centralized MMSE scheme, under the stable LoS conditions, e.g., with static users having Rician fading with a fixed LoS path.</description>

      <title>A Narrowband Fully-Analog Multi-Antenna Transmitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a narrowband fully-analog $N$-antenna transmitter that emulates the functionality of a narrowband fully-digital $N$-antenna transmitter. Specifically, in symbol interval $m$, the proposed fully-analog transmitter synthesizes an arbitrary complex excitation vector $\bm x[m]\in\mathbb{C}^N$ with prescribed total power $\|\bm x[m]\|_2^2=P$ from a single coherent RF tone, using only tunable phase-control elements embedded in a passive interferometric programmable network. The programmable network is excited through one input port while the remaining $N - 1$ input ports are impedance matched. In the ideal lossless case, the network transfer is unitary and therefore redistributes RF power among antenna ports without dissipative amplitude control.
  The synthesis task is posed as a unitary state-preparation problem: program a unitary family so that $\bm V(\bm\varphi)\bm e_1=\bm c$, where $\bm c=\bm x/\sqrt{P}$ and $\|\bm c\|_2=1$. We provide a constructive realization and a closed-form programming rule: a binary magnitude-splitting tree allocates the desired per-antenna magnitudes $|c_n|$ using $N -1$ tunable split ratios, and a per-antenna output phase bank assigns the target phases using $N$ tunable phase shifts. The resulting architecture uses $2N-1$ real tunable degrees of freedom and admits a deterministic $O(N)$ programming procedure with no iterative optimization, enabling symbol-by-symbol updates when the chosen phase-control technology supports the required tuning speed.
  Using representative COTS components, we model the RF-front-end DC power of the proposed fully-analog transmitter and compare it against an equivalent COTS fully-digital array. For $N\le 16$, the comparison indicates significant RF-front-end power savings for the fully-analog architecture.
  The results in this paper are intended as a proof-of-concept for a narrowband fully-analog transmitter.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of ANS Entropy Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS) is a class of entropy encoders that had an immense impact on the data compression, substituting arithmetic and Huffman coding. It was studied by different authors but the precise asymptotics of its redundancy (in relation to the entropy) was not completely understood. We obtain optimal bounds for the redundancy of the tabled ANS (tANS), the most popular ANS variant. Given a sequence $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ of symbols from an alphabet $\{0,1,\ldots,\sigma-1\}$ such that each symbol $a$ occurs in it $f_a$ times and $n=2^r$, the tANS encoder using Duda's ``precise initialization'' to fill tANS tables transforms this sequence into a bit string of the following length (the frequencies are not included in the encoding): $\sum\limits_{a\in[0..\sigma)}f_a\cdot\log\frac{n}{f_a}+O(\sigma+r)$, where $O(\sigma+r)$ can be bounded by $\sigma\log e+r$. The $r$-bit term is an artifact indispensable to ANS; the rest incurs a redundancy of $O(\frac{\sigma}{n})$ bits per symbol. We complement this by examples showing that an $\Omega(\sigma+r)$ redundancy is necessary. We argue that similar examples exist for most adequate initialization methods for tANS. Thus, we refute Duda's conjecture that the redundancy is $O(\frac{\sigma}{n^2})$ bits per symbol. We also propose a variant of the range ANS (rANS), called rANS with fixed accuracy, parameterized by $k\ge 1$ that in certain conditions might be faster than the standard rANS because it avoids slow explicit division operations. We bound the redundancy for our rANS variant by $\frac{n}{2^k-1}\log e+r+k$.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Universal Hypothesis Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16299v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hoeffding's formulation and solution to the universal hypothesis testing (UHT) problem had a profound impact on many subsequent works dealing with asymmetric hypotheses. In this work, we introduce a quantum universal hypothesis testing framework that serves as a quantum analog to Hoeffding's UHT. Motivated by Hoeffding's approach, which estimates the empirical distribution and uses it to construct the test statistic, we employ quantum state tomography to reconstruct the unknown state prior to forming the test statistic. Leveraging the concentration properties of quantum state tomography, we establish the exponential consistency of the proposed test: the type II error probability decays exponentially quickly, with the exponent determined by the trace distance between the true state and the nominal state.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Coded Polynomial Aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial evaluations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems and introduce a straggler-aware CPA framework with pre-specified non-straggler patterns, where exact recovery is required only for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations reveal a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted threshold, providing empirical evidence that the bound is tight in practice.</description>

      <title>A Search for High-Threshold Qutrit Magic State Distillation Routines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the best attainable threshold for qudit magic state distillation is directly related to the question of whether or not contextuality is sufficient for universal quantum computation. We show that the performance of a qudit correcting code for magic state distillation is captured by its complete weight enumerator. For the qutrit strange state -- a maximally magic non-stabilizer state -- the performance of a code is captured by its simple weight enumerator. This result allows us to carry out an extensive search for high-threshold magic state distillation routines for the strange state. Our search covers all $[[n,1]]_3$ qutrit stabilizer codes with a complete set of transversal Clifford gates for $n\leq 23$, and all $[[n,1]]_3$ stabilizer codes with a transversal $H^2$ gate with $n \leq 9$ qudits. For $n=23$, we find over 600 CSS codes that can distill the qutrit strange state with cubic noise suppression. While none of these codes surpass the threshold of the 11-qutrit Golay code, their existence suggests that, for large codes, the ability to distill the qutrit strange state is somewhat generic.</description>

      <title>The Variance Paradox: How AI Reduces Diversity but Increases Novelty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diversity of human expression is the raw material of discovery. Generative artificial intelligence threatens this resource even as it promises to accelerate innovation, a paradox now visible across science, culture, and professional work. We propose a framework to explain this tension. AI systems compress informational variance through statistical optimization, and users amplify this effect through epistemic deference. We call this process the AI Prism. Yet this same compression can enable novelty. Standardized forms travel across domain boundaries, lowering translation costs and creating opportunities for recombination that we term the Paradoxical Bridge. The interaction produces a U-shaped temporal dynamic, an initial decline in diversity followed by recombinant innovation, but only when humans actively curate rather than passively defer. The framework generates testable predictions about when compression constrains versus amplifies creativity. As AI becomes infrastructure for knowledge work, managing this dynamic is essential. Without intervention, the conditions for recovery may not arrive.</description>

      <title>Martingale Projections and Quantum Decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called super/sub-martingale projections as a family of endomorphisms defined on unions of Polish spaces. Such projections allow us to identify martingales as collections of transformations that relate path-valued random variables to each other under conditional expectations. In this sense, super/sub-martingale projections are random functionals that (i) are boundedness preserving and (ii) satisfy a conditional expectation criterion similar to that of the classical martingale theory. As an application to the theory of open quantum systems, we prove (a) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a supermartingale projection on the density matrix gives rise to decoherence, and (b) that any system-environment interaction that manifests a submartingale projection gives rise an increase in Shannon-Wiener information. It follows (c) that martingale projections in an open quantum system give rise both to quantum decoherence and to information gain.</description>

      <title>EVODiff: Entropy-aware Variance Optimized Diffusion Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation but suffer from slow inference and training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based solvers for DMs accelerate denoising inference, they often lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\% (from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

      <description>arXiv:2511.01467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum differential privacy (QDP) by defining a notion of the order of informativeness between pairs of quantum states. In particular, we show that if the hypothesis testing divergence of one pair dominates over that of the other pair, then this dominance holds for every $f$-divergence. This approach completely characterizes $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-QDP mechanisms by identifying the most informative $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP quantum state pairs. We apply this to study precise limits for privatized hypothesis testing and privatized quantum parameter estimation, including tight upper-bounds on the quantum Fisher information under QDP. Finally, we establish near-optimal contraction bounds for differentially private quantum channels with respect to the hockey-stick divergence.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution via Charge Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04188v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that charge teleportation serves as a superior observable for Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET)-based cryptographic primitives. While following the LOCC protocol structure of earlier proposals, we show that decoding key bits via local charge rather than energy provides exact bit symmetry and enhanced robustness: by Local Operations and Classical Communication (LOCC) on an entangled many-body ground state, Alice's one-bit choice steers the sign of a local charge shift at Bob, which directly encodes the key bit. Relative to energy teleportation schemes, the charge signal is bit-symmetric, measured in a single basis, and markedly more robust to realistic noise and model imperfections. We instantiate the protocol on transverse-field Ising models, star-coupled and one-dimensional chain, obtain closed-form results for two qubits, and for larger systems confirm performance via exact diagonalization, circuit-level simulations, and a proof-of-principle hardware run. We quantify resilience to classical bit flips and local quantum noise, identifying regimes where sign integrity, and hence key correctness, is preserved. These results position charge teleportation as a practical, low-rate QKD primitive compatible with near-term platforms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first prove that any interior point of an open interval of the real line can be interpreted as Fr\'echet means with respect to corresponding metric distances, thus extending the result of [Dinh et al., Mathematical Intelligencer 47.2 (2025)] which was restricted to intervals on the positive reals by using the family of power means: Our generic construction relies on the concept of scales of means that we demonstrate with the scale of exponential means and the scale of radical means. Second, we interpret those Fr\'echet means geometrically as the center of mass of any two distinct points on the Euclidean line expressed in various coordinate systems: Namely, by interpreting the Euclidean line as a 1D Hessian Riemannian manifold, we introduce pairs of dual Fr\'echet/Karcher means related by convex duality in dual coordinate systems. This result yields us to consider squared Hessian metrics in arbitrary dimension: We prove that these squared Hessian metrics amount to Euclidean geometry with the Riemannian center of mass expressed in primal coordinate systems as multivariate quasi-arithmetic means coinciding with left-sided Bregman centroids.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel tomography and estimation by local test</title>

Abstract: We study the estimation of an unknown quantum channel $\mathcal{E}$ with input dimension $d_1$, output dimension $d_2$ and Kraus rank at most $r$. We establish a connection between the query complexities in two models: (i) access to $\mathcal{E}$, and (ii) access to a random dilation of $\mathcal{E}$. Specifically, we show that for parallel (possibly coherent) testers, access to dilations does not help. This is proved by constructing a local tester that uses $n$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ yet faithfully simulates the tester with $n$ queries to a random dilation. As application, we show that:
  - $O(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$.
  Moreover, when $rd_2=d_1$, we show that the Heisenberg scaling $O(1/\varepsilon)$ can be achieved, even if $\mathcal{E}$ is not a unitary channel:
  - $O(\min\{d_1^{2.5}/\varepsilon,d_1^2/\varepsilon^2\})$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$, and $O(d_1^2/\varepsilon)$ queries suffice for the case of Choi state trace norm error $\varepsilon$.
  - $O(\min\{d_1^{1.5}/\varepsilon,d_1/\varepsilon^2\})$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for tomography of the mixed state $\mathcal{E}(|0\rangle\langle 0|)$ to within trace norm error $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Hallucination is a Consequence of Space-Optimality: A Rate-Distortion Theorem for Membership Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00906</link>

Abstract: Large language models often hallucinate with high confidence on "random facts" that lack inferable patterns. We formalize the memorization of such facts as a membership testing problem, unifying the discrete error metrics of Bloom filters with the continuous log-loss of LLMs. By analyzing this problem in the regime where facts are sparse in the universe of plausible claims, we establish a rate-distortion theorem: the optimal memory efficiency is characterized by the minimum KL divergence between score distributions on facts and non-facts. This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified "closed world" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression.</description>

      <title>Approximating Univariate Factored Distributions via Message-Passing Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) commonly arise in communication systems, particularly in bilinear joint estimation and detection problems. Although the product of GMMs is still a GMM, as the number of factors increases, the number of components in the resulting product GMM grows exponentially. To obtain a tractable approximation for a univariate factored probability density function (PDF), such as a product of GMMs, we investigate iterative message-passing algorithms. Based on Belief Propagation (BP), we propose a Variable Duplication and Gaussian Belief Propagation (VDBP)-based algorithm. The key idea of VDBP is to construct a multivariate measurement model whose marginal posterior is equal to the given univariate factored PDF. We then apply Gaussian BP (GaBP) to transform the global inference problem into local ones. Expectation propagation (EP) is another branch of message passing algorithms. In addition to converting the global approximation problem into local ones, it features a projection operation that ensures the intermediate functions (messages) belong to a desired family. Due to this projection, EP can be used to approximate the factored PDF directly. However, even if every factor is integrable, the division operation in EP may still cause the algorithm to fail when the mean and variance of a non-integrable belief are required. Therefore, this paper proposes two methods that combine EP with our previously proposed techniques for handling non-integrable beliefs to approximate univariate factored distributions.</description>
