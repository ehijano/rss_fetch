      <title>High-order Accurate Implicit-Explicit Time-Stepping Schemes for Wave Equations on Overset Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New implicit and implicit-explicit time-stepping methods for the wave equation in second-order form are described with application to two and three-dimensional problems discretized on overset grids. The implicit schemes are single step, three levels in time, and based on the modified equation approach. Second and fourth-order accurate schemes are developed and they incorporate upwind dissipation for stability on overset grids. The fully implicit schemes are useful for certain applications such as the WaveHoltz algorithm for solving Helmholtz problems where very large time-steps are desired. Some wave propagation problems are geometrically stiff due to localized regions of small grid cells, such as grids needed to resolve fine geometric features, and for these situations the implicit time-stepping scheme is combined with an explicit scheme: the implicit scheme is used for component grids containing small cells while the explicit scheme is used on the other grids such as background Cartesian grids. The resulting partitioned implicit-explicit scheme can be many times faster than using an explicit scheme everywhere. The accuracy and stability of the schemes are studied through analysis and numerical computations.</description>

      <title>An inexact augmented Lagrangian algorithm for unsymmetric saddle-point systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented Lagrangian (AL) methods are a well known class of algorithms for solving constrained optimization problems. They have been extended to the solution of saddle-point systems of linear equations. We study an AL (SPAL) algorithm for unsymmetric saddle-point systems and derive convergence and semi-convergence properties, even when the system is singular. At each step, our SPAL requires the exact solution of a linear system of the same size but with an SPD (2,2) block. To improve efficiency, we introduce an inexact SPAL algorithm. We establish its convergence properties under reasonable assumptions. Specifically, we use a gradient method, known as the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method, to solve the linear system at each iteration. We call the result the augmented Lagrangian BB (SPALBB) algorithm and study its convergence. Numerical experiments on test problems from Navier-Stokes equations and coupled Stokes-Darcy flow show that SPALBB is more robust and efficient than BICGSTAB and GMRES. SPALBB often requires the least CPU time, especially on large systems.</description>

      <title>One-Pass Randomized Algorithm with Practical Rangefinder for Low-Rank Approximation to Quaternion Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As its real/complex counterparts, randomized algorithms for low-rank approximation to quaternion matrices received attention recently. For large-scale problems, however, existing quaternion orthogonalization methods are not efficient, leading to slow rangefinders. By relaxing orthonormality while maintaining favaroable condition numbers, this work proposes two practical quaternion rangefinders that take advantage of mature scientific computing libraries to accelerate heavy computations. They are then incorporated into the quaternion version of a well-known one-pass algorithm. Theoretically, we establish the probabilistic error bound, and demonstrate that the error is proportional to the condition number of the rangefinder. Besides Gaussian, we also allow quaternion sub-Gaussian test matrices. Key to the latter is the derivation of a deviation bound for extreme singular values of a quaternion sub-Gaussian matrix. Numerical experiments indicate that the one-pass algorithm with the proposed rangefinders work efficiently while only sacrificing little accuracy. In addition, we tested the algorithm in an on-the-fly 3D Navier-Stokes equation data compression to demonstrate its efficiency in large-scale applications.</description>

      <title>Superiority of stochastic symplectic methods via the law of iterated logarithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superiority of stochastic symplectic methods over non-symplectic counterparts has been verified by plenty of numerical experiments, especially in capturing the asymptotic behaviour of the underlying solution process. How can one theoretically explain this superiority? This paper gives an answer to this problem from the perspective of the law of iterated logarithm, taking the linear stochastic Hamiltonian system in Hilbert space as a test model. The main contribution is twofold. First, by fully utilizing the time-change theorem for martingales and the Borell--TIS inequality, we prove that the upper limit of the exact solution with a specific scaling function almost surely equals some non-zero constant, thus confirming the validity of the law of iterated logarithm. Second, we prove that stochastic symplectic fully discrete methods asymptotically preserve the law of iterated logarithm, but non-symplectic ones do not. This reveals the good ability of stochastic symplectic methods in characterizing the almost sure asymptotic growth of the utmost fluctuation of the underlying solution process. Applications of our results to the linear stochastic oscillator and the linear stochastic Schrodinger equation are also presented.</description>

      <title>A GPU-accelerated Cartesian grid method is proposed for solving the heat, wave, and Schrodinger equations on irregular domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a second-order method for solving general elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) on irregular domains using GPU acceleration, based on Ying's kernel-free boundary integral (KFBI) method. The method addresses limitations imposed by CFL conditions in explicit schemes and accuracy issues in fully implicit schemes for the Laplacian operator. To overcome these challenges, the paper employs a series of second-order time discrete schemes and splits the Laplacian operator into explicit and implicit components. Specifically, the Crank-Nicolson method discretizes the heat equation in the temporal dimension, while the implicit scheme is used for the wave equation. The Schrodinger equation is treated using the Strang splitting method. By discretizing the temporal dimension implicitly, the heat, wave, and Schrodinger equations are transformed into a sequence of elliptic equations. The Laplacian operator on the right-hand side of the elliptic equation is obtained from the numerical scheme rather than being discretized and corrected by the five-point difference method. A Cartesian grid-based KFBI method is employed to solve the resulting elliptic equations. GPU acceleration, achieved through a parallel Cartesian grid solver, enhances the computational efficiency by exploiting high degrees of parallelism. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves second-order accuracy for the heat, wave, and Schrodinger equations. Furthermore, the GPU-accelerated solvers for the three types of time-dependent equations exhibit a speedup of 30 times compared to CPU-based solvers.</description>

      <title>Average energy dissipation rates of explicit exponential Runge-Kutta methods for gradient flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified theoretical framework to examine the energy dissipation properties at all stages of explicit exponential Runge-Kutta (EERK) methods for gradient flow problems. The main part of the novel framework is to construct the differential form of EERK method by using the difference coefficients of method and the so-called discrete orthogonal convolution kernels. As the main result, we prove that an EERK method can preserve the original energy dissipation law unconditionally if the associated differentiation matrix is positive semi-definite. A simple indicator, namely average dissipation rate, is also introduced for these multi-stage methods to evaluate the overall energy dissipation rate of an EERK method such that one can choose proper parameters in some parameterized EERK methods or compare different kinds of EERK methods. Some existing EERK methods in the literature are evaluated from the perspective of preserving the original energy dissipation law and the energy dissipation rate. Some numerical examples are also included to support our theory.</description>

      <title>Saving proof-of-work by hierarchical block structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the current POW based consensus algorithm of the Bitcoin network suffers from a fundamental economic discrepancy between the real world transaction (txn) costs incurred by miners and the wealth that is being transacted. Put simply, whether one transacts 1 satoshi or 1 bitcoin, the same amount of electricity is needed when including this txn into a block. The notorious Bitcoin blockchain problems such as its high energy usage per txn or its scalability issues are, either partially or fully, mere consequences of this fundamental economic inconsistency. We propose making the computational cost of securing the txns proportional to the wealth being transferred, at least temporarily.
  First, we present a simple incentive based model of Bitcoin's security. Then, guided by this model, we augment each txn by two parameters, one controlling the time spent securing this txn and the second determining the fraction of the network used to accomplish this. The current Bitcoin txns are naturally embedded into this parametrized space. Then we introduce a sequence of hierarchical block structures (HBSs) containing these parametrized txns. The first of those HBSs exploits only a single degree of freedom of the extended txn, namely the time investment, but it allows already for txns with a variable level of trust together with aligned network fees and energy usage. In principle, the last HBS should scale to tens of thousands timely txns per second while preserving what the previous HBSs achieved.
  We also propose a simple homotopy based transition mechanism which enables us to relatively safely and continuously introduce new HBSs into the existing blockchain.
  Our approach is constructive and as rigorous as possible and we attempt to analyze all aspects of these developments, al least at a conceptual level. The process is supported by evaluation on recent transaction data.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to find the numerical solutions of one dimensional general nonlinear system of third-order boundary value problems (BVPs) for the pair of functions using Galerkin weighted residual method. We derive mathematical formulations in matrix form, in details, by exploiting Bernstein polynomials as basis functions. A reasonable accuracy is found when the proposed method is used on few examples. At the end of the study, a comparison is made between the approximate and exact solutions, and also with the solutions of the existing methods. Our results converge monotonically to the exact solutions. In addition, we show that the the derived formulations may be applicable by reducing higher order complicated BVP into a lower order system of BVPs, and the performance of the numerical solutions is satisfactory.</description>

      <title>A GPU-accelerated Cartesian grid method for PDEs on irregular domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kernel-free boundary integral (KFBI) method has successfully solved partial differential equations (PDEs) on irregular domains. Diverging from traditional boundary integral methods, the computation of boundary integrals in KFBI is executed through the resolution of equivalent simple interface problems on Cartesian grids, utilizing fast algorithms. While existing implementations of KFBI methods predominantly utilize CPU platforms, GPU architecture's superior computational capabilities and extensive memory bandwidth offer an efficient resolution to computational bottlenecks. This paper delineates the algorithms adapted for both single-GPU and multiple-GPU applications. On a single GPU, assigning individual threads can control correction, interpolation, and jump calculations. The algorithm is expanded to multiple GPUs to enhance the processing of larger-scale problems. The arrowhead decomposition method is employed in multiple-GPU settings, ensuring optimal computational efficiency and load balancing. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm is second-order accurate and efficient. Single-GPU solver speeds 50-200 times than traditional CPU while the eight GPUs distributed solver yields up to 60% parallel efficiency.</description>

      <title>Multifidelity Surrogate Models: A New Data Fusion Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multifidelity surrogate modelling combines data of varying accuracy and cost from different sources. It strategically uses low-fidelity models for rapid evaluations, saving computational resources, and high-fidelity models for detailed refinement. It improves decision-making by addressing uncertainties and surpassing the limits of single-fidelity models, which either oversimplify or are computationally intensive. Blending high-fidelity data for detailed responses with frequent low-fidelity data for quick approximations facilitates design optimisation in various domains.
  Despite progress in interpolation, regression, enhanced sampling, error estimation, variable fidelity, and data fusion techniques, challenges persist in selecting fidelity levels and developing efficient data fusion methods. This study proposes a new fusion approach to construct multi-fidelity surrogate models by constructing gradient-only surrogates that use only gradients to construct regression surfaces. Results are demonstrated on foundational example problems that isolate and illustrate the fusion approach's efficacy, avoiding the need for complex examples that obfuscate the main concept.</description>

      <title>FMint: Bridging Human Designed and Data Pretrained Models for Differential Equation Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-designed algorithms have long been fundamental in solving a variety of scientific and engineering challenges. Recently, data-driven deep learning methods have also risen to prominence, offering innovative solutions across numerous scientific fields. While traditional algorithms excel in capturing the core aspects of specific problems, they often lack the flexibility needed for varying problem conditions due to the absence of specific data. Conversely, while data-driven approaches utilize vast datasets, they frequently fall short in domain-specific knowledge. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{FMint} (Foundation Model based on Initialization), a generative pre-trained model that synergizes the precision of human-designed algorithms with the adaptability of data-driven methods. This model is specifically engineered for high-accuracy simulation of dynamical systems. Starting from initial trajectories provided by conventional methods, FMint quickly delivers highly accurate solutions. It incorporates in-context learning and has been pre-trained on a diverse corpus of 500,000 dynamical systems, showcasing exceptional generalization across a broad spectrum of real-world applications. By effectively combining algorithmic rigor with data-driven flexibility, FMint sets the stage for the next generation of scientific foundation models, tackling complex problems with both efficiency and high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quenching of stable pulses in slow-fast excitable media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop linear theory for the prediction of excitation wave quenching--the construction of minimal perturbations which return stable excitations to quiescence--for localized pulse solutions of models of excitable media. The theory requires accounting for an additional degree of freedom in the formulation of the linear theory, and a reconsideration of heuristics for choosing optimal reference states from their group representation. We compare the predictions made with the linear theory to direct numerical simulations across a family of perturbations and assess the accuracy of predictions for models with distinct stable excitation structures. We find that the theory achieves qualitative predictive power with only the effort of distinguishing a root from the asymptotic case, and achieves quantitative predictive power in many circumstances. Finally, we compare the computational cost of our prediction technique to other numerical methods for the determination of transitions in extended excitable systems.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayesian surrogate modelling with application to robust design optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surrogate models provide a quick-to-evaluate approximation to complex computational models and are essential for multi-query problems like design optimisation. The inputs of current computational models are usually high-dimensional and uncertain. We consider Bayesian inference for constructing statistical surrogates with input uncertainties and intrinsic dimensionality reduction. The surrogates are trained by fitting to data from prevalent deterministic computational models. The assumed prior probability density of the surrogate is a Gaussian process. We determine the respective posterior probability density and parameters of the posited statistical model using variational Bayes. The non-Gaussian posterior is approximated by a simpler trial density with free variational parameters and the discrepancy between them is measured using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We employ the stochastic gradient method to compute the variational parameters and other statistical model parameters by minimising the KL divergence. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of the proposed reduced dimension variational Gaussian process (RDVGP) surrogate on illustrative and robust structural optimisation problems with cost functions depending on a weighted sum of the mean and standard deviation of model outputs.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Distribution of Parameters in Differential Equations with Repeated Cross-Sectional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential equations are pivotal in modeling and understanding the dynamics of various systems, offering insights into their future states through parameter estimation fitted to time series data. In fields such as economy, politics, and biology, the observation data points in the time series are often independently obtained (i.e., Repeated Cross-Sectional (RCS) data). With RCS data, we found that traditional methods for parameter estimation in differential equations, such as using mean values of time trajectories or Gaussian Process-based trajectory generation, have limitations in estimating the shape of parameter distributions, often leading to a significant loss of data information. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method, Estimation of Parameter Distribution (EPD), providing accurate distribution of parameters without loss of data information. EPD operates in three main steps: generating synthetic time trajectories by randomly selecting observed values at each time point, estimating parameters of a differential equation that minimize the discrepancy between these trajectories and the true solution of the equation, and selecting the parameters depending on the scale of discrepancy. We then evaluated the performance of EPD across several models, including exponential growth, logistic population models, and target cell-limited models with delayed virus production, demonstrating its superiority in capturing the shape of parameter distributions. Furthermore, we applied EPD to real-world datasets, capturing various shapes of parameter distributions rather than a normal distribution. These results effectively address the heterogeneity within systems, marking a substantial progression in accurately modeling systems using RCS data.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Kernel-Free Boundary Integral Method with Operator Learning for Solving Parametric Partial Differential Equations In Complex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kernel-Free Boundary Integral (KFBI) method presents an iterative solution to boundary integral equations arising from elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). This method effectively addresses elliptic PDEs on irregular domains, including the modified Helmholtz, Stokes, and elasticity equations. The rapid evolution of neural networks and deep learning has invigorated the exploration of numerical PDEs. An increasing interest is observed in deep learning approaches that seamlessly integrate mathematical principles for investigating numerical PDEs. We propose a hybrid KFBI method, integrating the foundational principles of the KFBI method with the capabilities of deep learning. This approach, within the framework of the boundary integral method, designs a network to approximate the solution operator for the corresponding integral equations by mapping the parameters, inhomogeneous terms and boundary information of PDEs to the boundary density functions, which can be regarded as the solution of the integral equations. The models are trained using data generated by the Cartesian grid-based KFBI algorithm, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities. It accurately predicts density functions across diverse boundary conditions and parameters within the same class of equations. Experimental results demonstrate that the trained model can directly infer the boundary density function with satisfactory precision, obviating the need for iterative steps in solving boundary integral equations. Furthermore, applying the inference results of the model as initial values for iterations is also reasonable; this approach can retain the inherent second-order accuracy of the KFBI method while accelerating the traditional KFBI approach by reducing about 50% iterations.</description>

      <title>Estimating and using information in inverse problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.09095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In inverse problems, one attempts to infer spatially variable functions from indirect measurements of a system. To practitioners of inverse problems, the concept of "information" is familiar when discussing key questions such as which parts of the function can be inferred accurately and which cannot. For example, it is generally understood that we can identify system parameters accurately only close to detectors, or along ray paths between sources and detectors, because we have "the most information" for these places. Although referenced in many publications, the "information" that is invoked in such contexts is not a well understood and clearly defined quantity.
  Herein, we present a definition of information density that is based on the variance of coefficients as derived from a Bayesian reformulation of the inverse problem. We then discuss three areas in which this information density can be useful in practical algorithms for the solution of inverse problems, and illustrate the usefulness in one of these areas -- how to choose the discretization mesh for the function to be reconstructed -- using numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Error analysis for a Crouzeix-Raviart approximation of the variable exponent Dirichlet problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10687v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we examine a Crouzeix-Raviart approximation of the $p(\cdot)$-Dirichlet problem. We derive a $\textit{medius}$ error estimate, $\textit{i.e.}$, a best-approximation result, which holds for uniformly continuous exponents and implies $\textit{a priori}$ error estimates, which apply for H\"older continuous exponents and are optimal for Lipschitz continuous exponents. Numerical experiments are carried out to review the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Accelerating iterative solvers via a two-dimensional minimum residual technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12473v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with speeding up the convergence of a class of two-step iterative methods for solving linear systems of equations. To implement the acceleration technique, the residual norm associated with computed approximations for each sub-iterate is minimized over a certain two-dimensional subspace. Convergence properties of the proposed method are studied in detail. The approach is further developed to solve (regularized) normal equations arising from the discretization of ill-posed problems. The results of numerical experiments are reported to illustrate the performance of exact and inexact variants of the method on several test problems from different application areas.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of Fourier spectral methods involving non-compact operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Fredholm theory, we develop a framework to establish the convergence of spectral methods for operator equations $\mathcal L u = f$. The framework posits the existence of a left-Fredholm regulator for $\mathcal L$ and the existence of a sufficiently good approximation of this regulator. Importantly, the numerical method itself need not make use of this extra approximant. We apply the framework to Fourier finite-section and collocation-based numerical methods for solving differential equations with periodic boundary conditions and to solving Riemann--Hilbert problems on the unit circle. We also obtain improved results concerning the approximation of eigenvalues of differential operators with periodic coefficients.</description>

      <title>A multilinear Nystr\"om algorithm for low-rank approximation of tensors in Tucker format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nystr\"om method offers an effective way to obtain low-rank approximation of SPD matrices, and has been recently extended and analyzed to nonsymmetric matrices (leading to the generalized Nystr\"om method). It is a randomized, single-pass, streamable, cost-effective, and accurate alternative to the randomized SVD, and it facilitates the computation of several matrix low-rank factorizations.
  In this paper, we take these advancements a step further by introducing a higher-order variant of Nystr\"om's methodology tailored to approximating low-rank tensors in the Tucker format: the multilinear Nystr\"om technique. We show that, by introducing appropriate small modifications in the formulation of the higher-order method, strong stability properties can be obtained. This algorithm retains the key attributes of the generalized Nystr\"om method, positioning it as a viable substitute for the randomized higher-order SVD algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical matrices approximate a given matrix by a decomposition into low-rank submatrices that can be handled efficiently in factorized form. $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices refine this representation following the ideas of fast multipole methods in order to achieve linear, i.e., optimal complexity for a variety of important algorithms. The matrix multiplication, a key component of many more advanced numerical algorithms, has so far proven tricky: the only linear-time algorithms known so far either require the very special structure of HSS-matrices or need to know a suitable basis for all submatrices in advance. In this article, a new and fairly general algorithm for multiplying $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices in linear complexity with adaptively constructed bases is presented. The algorithm consists of two phases: first an intermediate representation with a generalized block structure is constructed, then this representation is re-compressed in order to match the structure prescribed by the application. The complexity and accuracy are analysed and numerical experiments indicate that the new algorithm can indeed be significantly faster than previous attempts.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we first investigate the global existence of a solution for the stochastic fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with radially symmetric initial data in a suitable energy space $H^{\alpha}$. We then show that the stochastic fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in the Stratonovich sense forms an infinite-dimensional stochastic Hamiltonian system, with its phase flow preserving symplecticity. Finally, we develop a stochastic midpoint scheme for the stochastic fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation from the perspective of symplectic geometry. It is proved that the stochastic midpoint scheme satisfies the corresponding symplectic law in the discrete sense. A numerical example is conducted to validate the efficiency of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the inverse scattering problem for time-harmonic acoustic waves in a medium with pointwise inhomogeneities. In the Foldy-Lax model, the estimation of the scatterers' locations and intensities from far field measurements can be recast as the recovery of a discrete measure from nonlinear observations. We propose a "linearize and locally optimize" approach to perform this reconstruction. We first solve a convex program in the space of measures (known as the Beurling LASSO), which involves a linearization of the forward operator (the far field pattern in the Born approximation). Then, we locally minimize a second functional involving the nonlinear forward map, using the output of the first step as initialization. We provide guarantees that the output of the first step is close to the sought-after measure when the scatterers have small intensities and are sufficiently separated. We also provide numerical evidence that the second step still allows for accurate recovery in settings that are more involved.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a VEM-fully discrete polytopal scheme with bubble stabilisation for contact mechanics with Tresca friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work performs the convergence analysis of the polytopal nodal discretisation of contact-mechanics (with Tresca friction) recently introduced in [18] in the framework of poro-elastic models in fractured porous media. The scheme is based on a mixed formulation, using face-wise constant approximations of the Lagrange multipliers along the fracture network and a fully discrete first order nodal approximation of the displacement field. The displacement field is enriched with additional bubble degrees of freedom along the fractures to ensure the inf-sup stability with the Lagrange multiplier space. It is presented in a fully discrete formulation, which makes its study more straightforward, but also has a Virtual Element interpretation. The analysis establishes an abstract error estimate accounting for the fully discrete framework and the non-conformity of the discretisation. A first order error estimate is deduced for sufficiently smooth solutions both for the gradient of the displacement field and the Lagrange multiplier. A key difficulty of the numerical analysis is the proof of a discrete inf-sup condition, which is based on a non-standard $H^{-1/2}$-norm (to deal with fracture networks) and involves the jump of the displacements, not their traces. The analysis also requires the proof of a discrete Korn inequality for the discrete displacement field which takes into account fracture networks. Numerical experiments based on analytical solutions confirm our theoretical findings</description>

      <title>Solving high-dimensional Kolmogorov backward equations with functional hierarchical tensor operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving high-dimensional partial differential equations necessitates methods free of exponential scaling in the dimension of the problem. This work introduces a tensor network approach for the Kolmogorov backward equation via approximating directly the Markov operator. We show that the high-dimensional Markov operator can be obtained under a functional hierarchical tensor (FHT) ansatz with a hierarchical sketching algorithm. When the terminal condition admits an FHT ansatz, the proposed operator outputs an FHT ansatz for the PDE solution through an efficient functional tensor network contraction procedure. In addition, the proposed operator-based approach also provides an efficient way to solve the Kolmogorov forward equation when the initial distribution is in an FHT ansatz. We apply the proposed approach successfully to two challenging time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau models with hundreds of variables.</description>

Abstract: We investigate inexact proximity operators for weakly convex functions. To this aim, we derive sum rules for proximal {\epsilon}-subdifferentials, by incorporating the moduli of weak convexity of the functions into the respective formulas. This allows us to investigate inexact proximity operators for weakly convex functions in terms of proximal {\epsilon}-subdifferentials.</description>

      <title>New asymptotic expansion formula via Malliavin calculus and its application to rough differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel generic asymptotic expansion formula of expectations of multidimensional Wiener functionals through a Malliavin calculus technique. The uniform estimate of the asymptotic expansion is shown under a weaker condition on the Malliavin covariance matrix of the target Wiener functional. In particular, the method provides a tractable expansion for the expectation of an irregular functional of the solution to a multidimensional rough differential equation driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H&lt;1/2$, without using complicated fractional integral calculus for the singular kernel. In a numerical experiment, our expansion shows a much better approximation for a probability distribution function than its normal approximation, which demonstrates the validity of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Solutions to Elliptic and Parabolic Problems via Finite Difference Based Unsupervised Small Linear Convolutional Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in leveraging deep learning and neural networks to address scientific problems, particularly in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, many neural network-based methods like PINNs rely on auto differentiation and sampling collocation points, leading to a lack of interpretability and lower accuracy than traditional numerical methods. As a result, we propose a fully unsupervised approach, requiring no training data, to estimate finite difference solutions for PDEs directly via small linear convolutional neural networks. Our proposed approach uses substantially fewer parameters than similar finite difference-based approaches while also demonstrating comparable accuracy to the true solution for several selected elliptic and parabolic problems compared to the finite difference method.</description>

      <title>Deep learning surrogate for predicting hydraulic conductivity tensors from stochastic discrete fracture-matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating 2D flow in fractured crystalline rock requires 2D stochastic discrete-fracture matrix (DFM) models. To obtain the simulation statistics of interest at an affordable computational cost, we aim to use the multilevel Monte Carlo method. To use this multiscale approach, one needs to upscale the hydraulic conductivity of the fractures by numerical homogenization. In this work, we substitute numerical homogenization with a surrogate model to speed up the computations. In particular, we resort to a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) connected to a deep feed-forward neural network. The equivalent hydraulic conductivity tensor $K_{eq}$ is predicted based on an input spatial random field (SRF) of hydraulic conductivity tensors, cross-section, and hydraulic conductivity of fractures. Three independent surrogates with the same architecture are trained using data from DFM models with three different ratios of hydraulic conductivities of fracture and bulk $K_f/K_b$. As the $K_f/K_b$ ratio increases, the multivariate $K_{eq}$ distribution becomes more complex, and thus, the prediction accuracy of the trained surrogates deteriorates. Regardless of $K_f/K_b$, however, an improvement in the prediction accuracy of the trained surrogates is noted as the considered fracture density of the modeling setup decreases. We also investigate prediction accuracy on input SRFs of different correlation lengths. Upscaling by numerical homogenization and by surrogate modeling is compared on two practical problems: upscaling of the hydraulic conductivity tensor and groundwater flow through a given surface. We obtained equally accurate results for the equivalent hydraulic tensor calculation of upscaled DFM models regardless of the upscaling method. For the groundwater flow problem, the accuracy of quantity of interest imitates the accuracy of $K_{eq}$ predictions.</description>
