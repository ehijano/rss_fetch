      <title>Relative Quantum Gravity: Localized Gravity and the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of the applicability of swampland constraints to theories of localized gravity. We find that these gravity theories can violate swampland constraints, but can be reconciled with them when coupled to a higher-dimensional gravity theory. They realize what we call $\textit{relative quantum gravity}$: to become consistent at the quantum level, these gravity theories must be defined as $\textit{relative}$ to a host higher-dimensional gravity theory.
  We show that these theories can admit global symmetries, even anomalous ones; they can violate the cobordism, completeness, weak gravity, and distance conjectures; they may admit stable non-supersymmetric AdS vacua, or dS vacua. All swampland constraints are however satisfied when these gravity theories are regarded as relative and completed by coupling them to a higher-dimensional one.
  We discuss these properties in $d$-dimensional gravity theories localized on Karch-Randall End of the World (ETW) boundaries of AdS$_{d+1}$ spacetime. For AdS$_d$ ETW branes we use the formalism of double holography to describe the appearance of the species scale and the emergence of gauge dynamics from the quantum backreaction of CFT$_d$ modes. We also study microscopically the swampland constraints in localized gravity in explicit string theory models. Concretely, we exploit the 10d supergravity solutions describing AdS$_4$ ETW branes for AdS$_5\times\mathbf{S}^5$, holographically dual to semi-infinite D3-branes ending on NS5- and D5-brane configurations, realizing 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(N)$ on half-space coupled to a 3d Gaiotto-Witten superconformal boundary CFT$_3$.</description>

      <title>Phases of String Stars in the Presence of a Spatial Circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In string theory, black holes are expected to transition into string stars as their Hawking temperature approaches the Hagedorn temperature. We study string stars and their phase transitions in the Euclidean spacetime $\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{S}_\tau^1\times\mathbb{S}_z^1$. Using the Horowitz-Polchinski (HP) effective field theory, we discover novel solutions for $d=2$. The uniform string star exhibits a scaling symmetry that results in the absence of a critical point for its transition into the non-uniform solution. For $d=4$, we show that quartic corrections to the effective action resolve the mass degeneracy of uniform string stars. At $d=5$, we find that as non-uniformity increases, the quartic terms become significant (while higher-order terms remain negligible) and reverse the direction of temperature variation, leading to a swallowtail-type phase diagram in the canonical ensemble. Extending the quartic-corrected EFT to $d=6$, we find that string stars with small non-uniformity dominate the microcanonical ensemble but not the canonical ensemble, similar to the $d=5$ case. However, in the microcanonical ensemble, the uniform string star is anomalously (un)stable when the spatial circle is larger (smaller) than the critical size.</description>

      <title>Atomic Higgsings of 6D SCFTs II: Induced Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a specific type of atomic Higgsings of the 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ theories, which we call the induced flows. For the conformal matter theory associated with a pair of nilpotent orbits, the induced flows are given by the inductions of the orbits. We also consider the induced flows for the orbi-instanton theories (as well as some little string theories) that are associated with the homomorphisms from the discrete subgroups of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ to $E_8$. This gives a physical definition of the inductions among these discrete homomorphisms, analogous to the inductions of the nilpotent orbits. We analyze the Higgs branch dimensions, the monotonicity of the Weyl anomalies (or the 2-group structure constants for LSTs) and the brane pictures under the induced flows.</description>

      <title>Crystals and Double Quiver Algebras from Jeffrey-Kirwan Residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct statistical mechanical models of crystal melting describing the flavoured Witten indices of $\mathcal{N}\ge 2$ supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. Our results can be derived from the Jeffrey-Kirwan (JK) residue formulas, and generalize the previous results for quivers corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and fourfolds to a large class of quivers satisfying the no-overlap condition, including those corresponding to some non-toric Calabi-Yau manifolds. We construct new quiver algebras which we call the double quiver Yangians/algebras, as well as their representations in terms of the aforementioned crystals. For theories with four supercharges, we compare the double quiver algebras with the existing quiver Yangians/BPS algebras, which we show can also be constructed from the JK residues. For theories with two supercharges, the double quiver algebras provide an algebraic description of the BPS states, including the information of the fixed points and their relative coefficients in the full partition functions.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hidden Conformal Symmetry in Quadratic $f(T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find the non-extremal charged rotating black holes in quadratic $f(T)$ gravity are holographically dual to two different hidden conformal field theories. The two conformal field theories can be merged to find a very general hidden conformal field theory, which is generated by the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ modular group. We also carry out the the calculation to the extremal limit of the black holes, and find the corresponding dual quantities. Contrary to the existence of two different dual conformal field theories for the extremal charged rotating black holes in Einstein gravity, we find only one dual theory exists for the extremal charged rotating black holes in quadratic $f(T)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Tree-level four-point function for a scalar field conformally coupled to Einstein's gravity on Euclidean AdS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the tree-level four-point boundary scalar correlation function for a scalar field conformally coupled to the graviton field on Euclidean AdS4. We assume that the dynamics of the graviton field is governed by the Einstein-Hilbert action. We carry out the computation in momentum space and check that the result so obtained is consistent with the conformal Ward identities.</description>

      <title>Splitting dynamics of quantized composite vortices in holographic miscible binary superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability properties and splitting dynamics of multiply quantized vortices are the subject of interest in both theoretical and experimental investigations. Going beyond the regime of validity of Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), we study the composite vortices in miscible strongly interacting binary superfluids by employing a holographic model that naturally incorporate finite temperature and dissipation. The composite vortices is classified in terms of an integer pair $(S_1, S_2)$ of phase winding numbers and can share the same vortex core, while either co-rotating or counter-rotating, leading to very diverse vortex structures. We uncover different dynamical behaviors compared to results from GPE that is valid in weak coupling limit and zero temperature. In particular, we show that the occurrence of dynamic instabilities and the instability strength are sensitive to the temperature. We identify several temperature dependent dynamical transitions in $(1,1)$, $(2,\pm 1)$ and $(2,2)$ vortices. The splitting behaviors associated with different multipolarities are demonstrated by solving the full-time evolution for slightly perturbed composite vortices. We find that the final states of all composite vortices are generally singly quantized vortices, and no additional long living vortex is formed due to strong dissipation. Our results highlight the important role of temperature and the distinction between dynamics of composite vortices in weakly interacting superfluids without dissipation and strongly interacting case with dissipation, shedding a new light on the understanding of quantum vortex and dynamical instabilities in multicomponent superfluids.</description>

      <title>On Classifying HyperK\"ahler Kummer 8-Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HyperK\"ahler spaces, including manifolds, orbifolds and conical singularities play an important role in superstring/$M$-theory and gauge theories as well as in differential and algebraic geometry. In this paper we provide hundreds of new examples of compact hyperK\"ahler orbifolds of Kummer type $T^8/G$, where $T^8$ is the maximal torus of the compact Lie group $E_8$ and $G$ a finite group of isometries whose holonomies form a subgroup of the Weyl group of $E_8$. We show that, out of all of these examples, the only orbifolds whose singularities have a known holomorphic symplectic resolution lead to manifolds diffeomorphic to the two currently known examples of compact hyperK\"ahler 8-manifolds. We also demonstrate that these methods can, when combined with theorems of Joyce, be extended to construct potentially new manifolds of $\operatorname{SU}(4)$- and $\operatorname{Spin}(7)$- holonomy. All of these examples give rise to new vacua of string/$M$-theory in two/three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quite Discrete for a fermion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Discrete Series representations of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ with half-integer scale dimension $\Delta$. At the classical level, we show that these UIRs are realised in the space of mode solutions of spinor fields with \emph{imaginary mass parameters} on a fixed two-dimensional de Sitter, dS$_{2}$, background. Upon such tuning of the mass, the field develops a fermionic shift symmetry that we characterise. We show that in the Euclidean section this manifests itself in the presence of zero-modes which preclude the definition of a Hadamard two-point function for these UIRs. We propose a Euclidean procedure to deal with the zero-modes, define a two-point function with the right singularity structure, and analyse its late-time behaviour. We end this note by proposing two interacting theories containing the fermionic discrete series in their spectrum.</description>

      <title>Foliated Asymptotically Safe Gravity -- Lorentzian Signature Fluctuations from the Wick Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety constitutes a promising mechanism for a consistent and predictive high-energy completion of the gravitational interactions. To date, most results on the interacting renormalization group fixed point underlying the construction are obtained for Euclidean signature spacetimes. In this work, we use the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) decomposition of the metric degrees of freedom and investigate the relations between the Euclidean and Lorentzian renormalization group flows resulting from the analytic continuation of the lapse function. We discuss the general conditions which guarantee the equivalence of the beta functions. These insights are illustrated based on the flow of the graviton two-point function within the Einstein-Hilbert truncation, demonstrating agreement of the Euclidean and Lorentzian settings. Hence the UV- and IR-completions identified in the Euclidean case are robust when changing spacetime signature. We take this as an important indicator that the Euclidean asymptotic safety mechanism carries over to Lorentzian signature spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic structure factor of Calogero-Sutherland fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective extended conformal field theory with symmetry W_infinity*{bar W_infinity} that describes the thermodynamic limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model is considered. The dynamic structure factor of the chiral component in the repulsive regime is determined and compared with the corresponding one of the free bosonic theory, given that both share isomorphic Hilbert spaces but differ in the time evolution of quantum states. In either case, a sharp response function peaked at only one resonant frequency is found, and the physical implications of this outcome are addressed. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between this result and the corresponding one obtained in the first quantized formulation of the Calogero-Sutherland model is provided. Complete agreement in the parameter region in which both results overlap is found. This outcome provides further support to the equivalence between the first and second quantized treatments of the Calogero-Sutherland model, in which the computational advantages from integrability in the first formulation are paralleled by those from the algebraic structure of the second.</description>

      <title>Bekenstein Bound for Approximately Local Charged States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the energy-entropy ratio inequality in quantum field theory (QFT) established by one of us from localized states to a larger class of states. The states considered in this paper can be in a charged (non-vacuum) representation of the QFT or may be only approximately localized in the region under consideration. Our inequality is $S(\Psi |\!| \Omega) \le 2\pi R \, ( \Psi, H_\rho \Psi ) + \log d(\rho) + \varepsilon$, where $S$ is the relative entropy, where $R$ is a "radius" (width) characterizing the size of the region, $d(\rho)$ is the statistical (quantum) dimension of the given charged sector $\rho$ hosting the quantum state $\Psi$, $\Omega$ is the vacuum state, $H_\rho$ is the Hamiltonian in the charged sector, and $\varepsilon$ is a tolerance measuring the deviation of $\Psi$ from the vacuum according to observers in the causal complement of the region.</description>

      <title>Quantum Scalar Field Dynamics On A Maximally Sliced Two-sided AdS Black Hole Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the semi-classical dynamics of a scalar field in the background of a black hole in an asymptotically AdS (AAdS) spacetime, in the framework of the Hamiltonian formulation of General Relativity. The small diffeomorphism (gauge) symmetries generated by the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints are completely fixed by the maximal slicing and spatial harmonic/Dirac gauge conditions after which the residual phase space degrees of freedom are gauge invariant. While many of our results are valid for AAdS$_{d+1}$ spacetimes, we mainly discuss the $d=2$ case of the static BTZ solution. We present the explicit solution for the smooth maximal slicing of the fully extended BTZ solution where the spatial slices cut across the horizons, asymptote to the usual Schwarzschild slices, do not include the past and future singularities, and for which the lapse remains non-zero at the bifurcate point. We also derive unique large diffeomorphisms that asymptote to time translations on both boundaries in the maximal slicing gauge.
  We present the solution of the scalar field wave equation in this gauge in terms of its boundary values which correspond to boundary CFT operators by the AdS/CFT dictionary. We explicitly construct the finite, time-dependent Hamiltonian in terms of a discrete set of mode functions of the scalar field that are smooth and differentiable across the horizons of the fully extended BTZ black hole. These modes mix the boundary operators from the two sides and are appropriate linear combinations of the Hartle-Hawking-Unruh modes. This Hamiltonian is an operator in the product of the two CFTs associated to the two boundaries and describes the time evolution of CFT operators. Our results are valid for evolution times smaller than the scrambling time during which the fully extended BTZ solution continues to be a valid saddle point of the quantum gravity path integral.</description>

      <title>Deep observations of the Type IIB flux landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep observations in targeted regions of the string landscape through a combination of analytic and dedicated numerical methods. Specifically, we devise an algorithm designed for the systematic construction of Type IIB flux vacua in finite regions of moduli space. Our algorithm is universally applicable across Calabi-Yau orientifold compactifications and can be used to enumerate flux vacua in a region given sufficient computational efforts. As a concrete example, we apply our methods to a two-modulus Calabi-Yau threefold, demonstrating that systematic enumeration is feasible and revealing intricate structures in vacuum distributions. Our results highlight local deviations from statistical expectations, providing insights into vacuum densities, superpotential distributions, and moduli mass hierarchies. This approach opens pathways for precise, data-driven mappings of the string landscape, complementing analytic studies and advancing the understanding of the distribution of flux vacua. This allows us to obtain different types of solutions with hierarchical suppressions, e.g.~vacua with small values of the Gukov-Vafa-Witten superpotential $|W_0|$. We find an example with $|W_0| = 5.547 \times 10^{-5}$ at large complex structure, without light directions and the use of non-perturbative effects.</description>

Abstract: In previous papers it has been shown that the coefficients of terms in the large-$N$ expansion of a certain integrated four-point correlator of superconformal primary operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory are rational sums of real-analytic Eisenstein series and "generalised Eisenstein series''. The latter are novel modular functions first encountered in the context of graviton amplitudes in type IIB superstring theory. Similar modular functions, known as two-loop modular graph functions, are also encountered in the low-energy expansion of the integrand of genus-one closed superstring amplitudes. In this paper we further develop the mathematical structure of such generalised Eisenstein series emphasising, in particular, the occurrence of $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms in their Fourier mode decomposition. We show that both the coefficients in the large-$N$ expansion of the integrated correlator and two-loop modular graph functions admit a unifying description in terms of four-dimensional lattice sums generated by theta lifts of local Maass functions, which generalise the structure of real-analytic Eisenstein series. Through the theta lift representation, we demonstrate that elements belonging to these two families of non-holomorphic modular functions can be expressed as rational linear combinations of generalised Eisenstein series for which all the $L$-values of holomorphic cusp forms precisely cancel.</description>

      <title>Quantum Perspectivism vs Nietzschean Perspectivism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a work of hard physical philosophy, where Quantum Perspectivism is shown to function as both an interpretation of quantum mechanics and a physical model for understanding Nietzsche's perspectivism. This framework combines quantum logic, the principle of complementarity, and contextuality to examine how perspectives construct reality. In this model, measurements correspond to Perspectives and Meta-Perspectives, represented as Boolean subalgebras and Hilbert sub-lattices within the Hilbert lattice, respectively. The Hilbert lattice itself is reinterpreted as Jung's Unus Mundus, a unified ontological reality. A metaphysical observation, made by a metaphysical observer, of a given system (World) is identified with the set of all corresponding meta-perspectives in the Hilbert lattice/Unus Mundus, the ocean of reality.
  Perspectives, likened to islands in this ocean, correspond to single measurements of a system, capturing the logical structure of observed properties. Meta-perspectives, analogous to continents, represent the synthesis of multiple measurements, providing a broader yet inherently incomplete understanding of the system. This structure emphasizes the complementarity and contextual dependencies of measurements while exposing the limitations of classical objectivity in the quantum domain. Advocating for a perspectival view of both the world and truth, Quantum Perspectivism unites quantum mechanics and Nietzschean philosophy into a cohesive framework for exploring the interplay between consciousness, observation, and reality.</description>

      <title>Soft symmetries of topological orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.</description>

      <title>Neutrino energy and momentum emission from magnetized dense quark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles field-theoretic methods, we investigate neutrino emission from strongly magnetized dense quark matter under conditions relevant to compact stars. We develop a customized approximation that fully accounts for the Landau-level quantization of electron states while neglecting such quantization for quarks. This approach is well-justified in dense quark matter, where the chemical potentials of up and down quarks significantly exceed those of electrons. Our analysis provides a detailed exploration of the influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino emission, including both the modification of the total emission rate and the emergence of emission asymmetry relative to the magnetic field direction. We further examine the role of temperature in smoothing the oscillatory behavior of neutrino emission as a function of magnetic field strength. Additionally, we study the interplay between the Landau-level quantization of electrons and the Fermi-liquid effects of quarks in modifying the phase space of relevant weak processes. Finally, we briefly discuss the broader implications of magnetic fields on stellar cooling processes and the potential contribution of asymmetric neutrino emission to pulsar kicks.</description>

      <title>Complementarity between Cosmic String Gravitational Waves and long lived particle searches in laboratory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are powerful witnesses to cosmic events including any period of early matter domination. If such a period of matter domination was catalysed by metastable, long-lived particles, then there will be complementary signals to ascertain the nature of dark sector in experiments detecting primordial features in the gravitational wave (GW) power spectrum and laboratory searches for long-lived particles. We give explicit examples of global and local U(1) gauge extended dark sectors to demonstrate such a complementarity as the union of the two experiments reveals more information about the dark sector than either experiment. Demanding that Higgs-portal long-lived scalar be looked for, in various experiments such as DUNE, FASER, FASER-II, MATHUSLA, SHiP, we identify the parameter space which leads to complementary observables for GW detectors such as LISA and ET.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories for dark matter pairs in the early universe: Debye mass effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In some scenarios for the early universe, non-relativistic thermal dark matter chemically decouples from the thermal environment once the temperature drops below the Hubble rate. The value at which the energy density freezes out depends on the underlying model. In a simple setting, we provide a comprehensive study of heavy fermionic dark matter interacting with the light degrees of freedom of a dark thermal sector whose temperature $T$ decreases from an initial value close to the freeze-out temperature. Different temperatures imply different hierarchies of energy scales. By exploiting the methods of non-relativistic effective field theories at finite $T$, we systematically determine the thermal and in-vacuum interaction rates. In particular, we address the impact of the Debye mass on the observables and ultimately on the dark matter relic abundance. We numerically compare the corrections to the present energy density originating from the resummation of Debye mass effects with the corrections coming from a next-to-leading order treatment of the bath-particle interactions. We observe that the fixed-order calculation of the inelastic heavy-light scattering at high temperatures provides a larger dark matter depletion, and hence an undersized yield for given benchmark points in the parameter space, with respect to the calculation where Debye mass effects are resummed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged black holes are known to suffer from an interior instability associated with the presence of the Cauchy horizon. Recently, a hairy charged black hole was proposed that avoids the formation of a Cauchy horizon. It is natural to question whether this instability might manifest in the exterior solution. In this paper, we have analyzed the stability of this black hole. Our results show that vector perturbations are stable, along with the scalar sector for $l=0$. We have also computed the corresponding quasinormal modes (QNMs) and quasibound states (QBSs). Among the six degrees of freedom identified, one exhibits a ghost-like behavior. However, this mode decouples from the other perturbations, rendering the associated instability irrelevant in the linear regime. Nonetheless, this feature could indicate a more significant issue in the nonlinear regime.</description>

      <title>Dark matter from inflationary quantum fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a scenario in which dark matter is a massive bosonic field, arising solely from quantum fluctuations generated during inflation. In this framework, dark matter exhibits primordial isocurvature perturbations with an amplitude of ${\cal O}(1)$ at small scales that are beyond the reach of current observations such as those from the CMB and large-scale structure. We derive an exact transfer function for the dark matter field perturbations during the radiation dominated era. Based on this result, we also derive approximate expressions of the transfer function in some limiting cases where we confirm that the exact transfer function reproduces known behaviors. Assuming a monochromatic initial power spectrum, we use the transfer function to identify the viable parameter space defined by the dark matter mass and the length scale of perturbations. A key prediction of this scenario is copious formation of subsolar mass dark matter halos at high redshifts. Observational confirmation of a large population of such low-mass halos will support for the hypothesis that dark matter originated purely from inflationary quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Is excess smoothing of Planck CMB ansiotropy data partially responsible for evidence for dark energy dynamics in other $w(z)$CDM parametrizations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spatially-flat dynamical dark energy parametrizations, $w(z)$CDM, with redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ expressed using three different quadratic and other polynomial forms (as functions of $1-a$, where $a$ is the scale factor), without and with a varying cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing consistency parameter $A_L$. We use Planck CMB anisotropy data (P18 and lensing) and a large, mutually-consistent non-CMB data compilation that includes Pantheon+ type Ia supernova, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Hubble parameter ($H(z)$), and growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, but not recent DESI BAO data. The six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations show higher consistency between the CMB and non-CMB data constraints compared to the XCDM ($+A_L$) and $w_0 w_a$CDM ($+A_L$) cases. Constraints from the most-restrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data compilation on the six $w(z)$CDM ($+A_L$) parametrizations indicate that dark energy dynamics is favored over a cosmological constant by $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, but only by $\gtrsim 1\sigma$ when $A_L$ is allowed to vary (and $A_L&gt;1$ at $\sim2\sigma$ significance). Non-CMB data dominate the P18+lensing+non-CMB compilation at low $z$ and favor quintessence-like dark energy. At high $z$ P18+lensing data dominate, favoring phantom-like dark energy with significance from $1.5\sigma$ to $2.9 \sigma$ when $A_L = 1$, and from $1.1\sigma$ to $1.8\sigma$ when $A_L$ varies. These results suggest that the observed excess weak lensing smoothing of some of the Planck CMB anistropy multipoles is partially responsible for the $A_L = 1$ cases $\gtrsim 2\sigma$ evidence for dark energy dynamics over a cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: We study the relationship between TsT transformations, marginal deformations of string theory on AdS$_3$ backgrounds, and irrelevant deformations of 2d CFTs. We show that TsT transformations of NS-NS backgrounds correspond to instantaneous deformations of the worldsheet action by the antisymmetric product of two Noether currents, holographically mirroring the definition of the $T\bar{T}$, $J\bar{T}$, $T\bar{J}$, and $J\bar{J}$ deformations of 2d CFTs. Applying a TsT transformation to string theory on BTZ $\times S^3\times M^4$ we obtain a general class of rotating black string solutions, including the Horne-Horowitz and the Giveon-Itzhaki-Kutasov ones as special cases, which we show are holographically dual to thermal states in single-trace $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs. We also find a smooth solution interpolating between global AdS$_3$ in the IR and a linear dilaton background in the UV that is interpreted as the NS-NS ground state in the dual $T\bar{T}$-deformed CFT. This background suggests the existence of an upper bound on the deformation parameter above which the solution becomes complex. We find that the worldsheet spectrum, the thermodynamics of the black strings (in particular their Bekenstein-Hawking entropy), and the critical value of the deformation parameter match the corresponding quantities obtained from single-trace $T\bar{T}$ deformations.</description>

Abstract: We show that observables in QED-type theories can be realized in terms of a combinatorial structure called chord diagrams. One advantage of this combinatorial representation is that it simplifies the study of the asymptotic behavior of corresponding Green functions. Particularly, using the new representation, there is no need to use the standard approach of singularity analysis. This relation also reveals the unexplained correlation between the number of Feynman diagrams in Yukawa theory and the diagrams in quenched QED.</description>

Abstract: We generate a class of string backgrounds by a sequence of TsT transformations of the NS1-NS5 system that we argue are holographically dual to states in a single-trace $T\bar T + J\bar T + T\bar J$-deformed CFT$_2$. The new string backgrounds include general rotating black hole solutions with two $U(1)$ charges as well as a smooth solution without a horizon that is interpreted as the ground state. As evidence for the correspondence we (i) derive the long string spectrum and relate it to the spectrum of the dual field theory; (ii) show that the black hole thermodynamics can be reproduced from single-trace $T\bar T + J\bar T + T\bar J$-deformed CFTs; and (iii) show that the energy of the ground state matches the energy of the vacuum in the dual theory. We also study geometric properties of these new spacetimes and find that for some choices of the parameters the three-dimensional Ricci scalar in the Einstein frame can become positive in a region outside the horizon before reaching closed timelike curves and singularities.</description>

Abstract: Dabholkar, Murthy and Zagier (DMZ) proved that there is a canonical decomposition of a meromorphic Jacobi form of integral index for $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$ with poles on torsion points into polar and finite parts, and showed that the finite part is a mock Jacobi form. In this paper we generalize the results of DMZ to meromorphic Jacobi forms of rational index for congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}(2, \mathbb{Z})$. As an application, we establish that a large class of single-centered black hole degeneracies in CHL models are given by the Fourier coefficients of mock Jacobi forms. In this process we refine the result of DMZ regarding the set of charges for which the single-centered black hole degeneracies are given by a mock modular form. In particular, in the case studied by DMZ, we present examples of charges for which the single-centered degeneracies are not captured by the mock modular form of the expected index.</description>

Abstract: In this note we analyze the semi-classical quantization of D3 branes in three different holographic backgrounds in type IIB string theory. The first background is Euclidean AdS$_5$ with $S^1\times S^3$ boundary accompanied with a twist to preserve supersymmetry. We work out the spectrum of fluctuations around the classical D3-brane configuration, compute its one-loop partition function, and match to the non-perturbative correction to the superconformal index of ${\cal N}=4$ SYM. We then study Euclidean D3-branes in the Pilch-Warner geometry dual to the IR Leigh-Strassler fixed point of ${\cal N}=1^*$ with the aim to find non-perturbative corrections to its index. Finally we study Euclidean D3-branes in the non-geometric ${\cal N}=2$ J-fold background which is dual to the gauging of the 3D Gaiotto-Witten SCFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-field models of accelerated expansion with nearly flat potentials, despite being able to provide observationally viable explanations for the early-time cosmic inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration, are in strong tension with string theory evidence and the associated de Sitter swampland constraints. It has recently been argued that in an open universe, where the spatial curvature is negative (i.e., with $\Omega_k&gt;0$), a new stable fixed point arises, which may lead to viable single-field-based accelerated expansion with an arbitrarily steep potential. Here, we show, through a dynamical systems analysis and a Bayesian statistical inference of cosmological parameters, that the additional cosmological solutions based on the new fixed point do not render steep-potential, single-field, accelerated expansion observationally viable. We mainly focus on quintessence models of dark energy, but we also argue that a similar conclusion can be drawn for cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>3D $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity from Virasoro TQFT: Gravitational partition function and Out-of-time-order correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the partition functions of $\mathcal{N}=1$ SUGRA for different boundary topologies, i.e. sphere and torus, using super-Virasoro TQFT. We use fusion and modular kernels of the super-Liouville theory to compute the necklace-channel conformal block and showcase formalism by proving that the inner product holds for superconformal blocks, defined as states in the Hilbert space. Finally, we compute the out-of-time-order correlator for the torus topology with superconformal primary insertions as matter using the tools of super-Virasoro TQFT and investigate its early-time behaviour.</description>

      <title>Kalb-Ramond field, black holes and black strings in (2 + 1)D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New rotating dilaton black hole and black string solutions in three spacetime dimensions are obtained. The background spacetime interpolates between Anti-de Sitter and a (an asymptotically) flat spacetime. The new black strings are characterized by their masses, angular momenta and axion charges. The uncharged black string solutions have only a single horizon. They contain a curvature singularity enclosed inside their horizons. Thus, they are also black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity. On the other hand, the charged black string solutions have two horizons. They may or may not contain a curvature singularity depending on the ratio of their inner and outer horizons radii. When they contain a singularity, the singularity is enclosed inside their inner horizons. We also obtain, in addition to the uncharged black strings, other new black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity by applying duality transformation on the new charged black strings. The black holes are described by their masses and angular momenta. We find that their masses can be made negative by adjusting, using the gauge ambiguity, the asymptotic value of the Kalb-Ramond field in the black strings. We show that their angular momenta do not depend on their horizons radii. We also discuss black hole and black string solutions with a curvature singularity at or beyond their outer or event horizons.</description>

      <title>Unifying error-correcting code/Narain CFT correspondences via lattices over integers of cyclotomic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) that correspond to code lattices for quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) over integers of cyclotomic fields $Q(\zeta_p)$ $(\zeta_p=e^{\frac{2\pi i}p})$ for general prime $p\geq 3$. This code-lattice construction is a generalization of more familiar ones such as Construction A${}_C$ for ternary codes and (after the generalization stated below) Construction A for binary codes, containing them as special cases. This code-lattice construction is redescribed in terms of root and weight lattices of Lie algebras, which allows to construct lattices for codes over rings $Z_q$ with non-prime $q$. Corresponding Narain CFTs are found for codes embedded into quotient rings of root and weight lattices of $ADE$ series, except $E_8$ and $D_k$ with $k$ even. In a sense, this provides a unified description of the relationship between various QECCs over $F_p$ (or $Z_q$) and Narain CFTs. A further extension on constructing the $E_8$ lattice from codes over the Mordell-Weil groups of extremal rational elliptic surfaces is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Truncating Dyson-Schwinger Equations Based on Lefschetz Thimble Decomposition and Borel Resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the zero-dimensional prototype of the path integrals in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, with the action $S(\phi)=\frac{\sigma }{2}\phi^{2}+\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^{4}$. Using the Lefschetz thimble decomposition and the saddle point expansion, we derive multiple asymptotic formal series of the correlation function associated with the perturbative and non-perturbative saddle points. Furthermore, we reconstruct the exact correlation function employing the Borel resummation. We then consider how to truncate the Dyson-Schwinger (DS) equations beginning with the perturbation expansion of the correlation functions, analogous to the one obtained from the Feynmann diagram in higher dimensions. For the case $\sigma&lt;0$, we find that although the asymptotic series around the perturbative saddle point is Borel summable, it does not capture the full information. Consequently, contributions from non-perturbative saddle points must be included to ensure a complete truncation procedure.</description>

      <title>Path integral of free fields and the determinant of Laplacian in warped space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of computing the determinant of Klein-Gordon operator $\Delta = -\nabla^2 + M^2$ on Euclideanized $AdS_3$ with the Euclideanized time coordinate compactified with period $\beta$, $H_3/Z$, by explicitly computing its eigenvalues and computing their product. Upon assuming that eigenfunctions are normalizable on $H_3/Z$, we found that there are no such eigenfunctions. Upon closer examination, we discover that the intuition that $H_3/Z$ is like a box with normalizable eigenfunctions was false, and that there is, instead, a set of eigenfunctions which forms a continuum. Somewhat to our surprise, we find that there is a different operator $\tilde \Delta = r^2 \Delta$, which has the property that (1) the determinant of $\Delta$ and the determinant of $r^2 \Delta$ have the same dependence on $\beta$, and that (2) the Green's function of $\Delta$ can be spectrally decomposed into eigenfunctions of $\tilde \Delta$. We identify the $\tilde \Delta$ operator as the ``weighted Laplacian'' in the context of warped compactifications, and comment on possible applications.</description>

      <title>To stealth or not to stealth: Thermodynamics of stealth black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Euclidean methods we investigate the thermodynamics of stealth black hole solutions, which are solutions that geometrically are indistinguishable from those of general relativity, however they are accompanied by a non-trivial additional field that does not back-react to the metric. We find that in general, one can observe shifts in the mass and/or the entropy of such black holes, hence, at least at the thermodynamic level, the stealth solutions may be distinguished by the those of general relativity. We also point out an example, the {\it{bona fide stealth}}, where a non-trivial scalar field can accompany an (A)dS-Schwarzschild black hole without altering the thermodynamic quantities. We point out that thermodynamic discrepancies arise due to the additional boundary terms emanating from the stealth fields, where care should be given in order for the theory at hand to possess a well-defined variational procedure.</description>

Abstract: We probe four dimensional accelerating black holes with D-brane and build up the notion of metallic holography for spacetime with negative cosmological constant. We explore various thermodynamic entities associated with the boundary QFT at low temperatures and finite chemical potential. The DC conductivity in the boundary QFT is enhanced due to the effects of black hole acceleration in the bulk counterpart. We further compute resistivity in different temperature regime, which reveals a new quantum liquid phase with dynamic critical exponent $ z=3 $.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the 3d ${\cal N}=5$ Chern-Simons-Matter theory with orthosymplectic gauge group and its gravity dual from the perspective of generalized symmetries. We derive the corresponding 4d symmetry topological field theory from the gravity dual and relate the allowed boundary conditions to the different variants of the 3d theory. Concentrating on a specific variant that has a discrete non-abelian global symmetry, we explain how the structure of this symmetry arises from brane dynamics.</description>

      <title>New Examples of Abelian D4D2D0 Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the methods of \cite{Alexandrov:2023zjb} to compute generating series of D4D2D0 indices with a single unit of D4 charge for several compact Calabi-Yau threefolds, assuming modularity of these indices. Our examples include a $\mathbb{Z}_{7}$ quotient of R{\o}dland's pfaffian threefold, a $\mathbb{Z}_{5}$ quotient of Hosono-Takagi's double quintic symmetroid threefold, the $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ quotient of the bicubic intersection in $\mathbb{P}^{5}$, and the $\mathbb{Z}_{5}$ quotient of the quintic hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^{4}$. For these examples we compute GV invariants to the highest genus that available boundary conditions make possible, and for the case of the quintic quotient alone this is sufficiently many GV invariants for us to make one nontrivial test of the modularity of these indices. As discovered in \cite {Alexandrov:2023zjb}, the assumption of modularity allows us to compute terms in the topological string genus expansion beyond those obtainable with previously understood boundary data. We also consider five multiparameter examples with $h^{1,1}&gt;1$, for which only a single index needs to be computed for modularity to fix the rest. We propose a modification of the formula in \cite{Alexandrov:2022pgd} that incorporates torsion to solve these models. Our new examples are only tractable because they have sufficiently small triple intersection and second Chern numbers, which happens because all of our examples are suitable quotient manifolds. In an appendix we discuss some aspects of quotient threefolds and their Wall data.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of a 3D Field-Theoretic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the discrete as well as the continuous symmetry transformations for a three $(2+1)$-dimensional $(3D)$ combined system of the free Abelian 1-form and 2-form gauge theories within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism and establish their relevance in the context of the algebraic structures that are obeyed by the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry. In fact, our present field-theoretic system respects six continuous symmetry transformations and a couple of very useful discrete duality symmetry transformations. Out of the above six continuous symmetry transformations four are off-shell nilpotent (i.e. fermionic) in nature and two are bosonic. The algebraic structures, obeyed by the symmetry operators, are reminiscent of the algebra satisfied by the de Rham cohomological operators. Hence, our present $3D$ field-theoretic system provides a perfect example for Hodge theory where there is convergence of ideas from the physical aspects of the BRST formalism and mathematical ingredients that are connected with the cohomological operators of differential geometry at the algebraic level. One of the highlights of our present investigation is the appearance of a pseudo-scalar field in our theory (on the symmetry ground alone) which carries the negative kinetic term. Thus, it is one of the possible candidates for the ``phantom" fields of the cyclic, bouncing and self-accelerated cosmological models of the Universe.</description>

Abstract: We study the collinear factorization of off-shell scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills (sYM) theory. These are constructed starting from six-dimensional N = (1,1) sYM, taking advantage of an available unconstrained spinor-helicity formalism combined with a unitarity-cut sewing procedure. After generalized dimensional reduction, their collinear behavior is dissected with assistance from the Method of Regions. We then construct off-shell splitting amplitudes directly using the same techniques, establishing equivalence to the amplitude analysis. The calculations are performed at one-loop order.</description>

Abstract: We construct a dilaton Weyl multiplet for $N = 3$ conformal supergravity in four dimensions. We couple an on-shell vector multiplet to the standard Weyl multiplet and use the field equations of the vector multiplet to replace some of the components of the auxiliary fields of the standard Weyl multiplet with the fields of the vector multiplet and some dual gauge fields. The R-symmetry of the multiplet is $SU(2) \times U(1) \times U(1)$. Furthermore, we gauge fix one of the two $U(1)$ symmetries and rewrite the result for the dilaton Weyl multiplet with $SU(2) \times U(1)$ R-symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of quantum fluctuations on the event horizon area and their implications for corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. These quantum corrections are incorporated into the framework of large-scale gravitational systems, utilizing the holographic principle to derive modified Friedmann equations. By redefining the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, our model predicts significant alterations to the Friedmann equations within specific parameter ranges, offering novel perspectives on cosmological scales. Using distance modulus data from the Pantheon supernova sample, we demonstrate the model's potential to constrain the parameters governing quantum corrections and address unresolved cosmological issues. Crucially, our analysis reveals that quantum fluctuations can increase the area of the event horizon by up to 47\%. Beyond this threshold, theoretical predictions encounter substantial challenges when compared with observational data. This approach bridges quantum gravity and observational cosmology, opening new avenues for testing and refining theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05964v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing, in the IR limit, these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <title>QCD with background electromagnetic fields on the lattice: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review provides a comprehensive summary of results on the physics of strongly interacting matter in the presence of background electromagnetic fields, obtained via numerical lattice simulations of the underlying theory, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Lattice QCD has guided our understanding of magnetized quarks and gluons via landmark results on the phase diagram, the equation of state, the confinemenent mechanism, anomalous transport phenomena as well as many more fascinating effects. Some of the lattice results lead to completely new paradigms in the description of hot magnetized quark matter and provided useful insights to a broad high-energy particle physics community. Since the first lattice QCD simulations with background fields, this field has been established as an independent research direction. We present the current status and recent developments of this field, together with an outlook including open questions to be answered in the near future.</description>

      <title>Neutrino cosmology after DESI: tightest mass upper limits, preference for the normal ordering, and tension with terrestrial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements have led to tight upper limits on the neutrino mass sum, potentially in tension with oscillation constraints requiring $\sum m_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.06\,{\text{eV}}$. Under the physically motivated assumption of positive $\sum m_{\nu}$, we study the extent to which these limits are tightened by adding other available cosmological probes, and robustly quantify the preference for the normal mass ordering over the inverted one, as well as the tension between cosmological and terrestrial data. Combining DESI data with Cosmic Microwave Background measurements and several late-time background probes, the tightest $2\sigma$ limit we find without including a local $H_0$ prior is $\sum m_{\nu}&lt;0.05\,{\text{eV}}$. This leads to a strong preference for the normal ordering, with Bayes factor relative to the inverted one of $46.5$. Depending on the dataset combination and tension metric adopted, we quantify the tension between cosmological and terrestrial observations as ranging between $2.5\sigma$ and $5\sigma$. These results are strenghtened when allowing for a time-varying dark energy component with equation of state lying in the physically motivated non-phantom regime, $w(z) \geq -1$, highlighting an interesting synergy between the nature of dark energy and laboratory probes of the mass ordering. If these tensions persist and cannot be attributed to systematics, either or both standard neutrino (particle) physics or the underlying cosmological model will have to be questioned.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Time Variation of the Fine-structure Constant with Quasars Detected by LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The [O III] $\lambda\lambda\ 4960,5008$ emission lines in the optical spectra of galaxies and quasars have been widely used to investigate the possible variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ over cosmic time. In this work, we utilize the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) quasar survey, for the first time, to measure the relative $\alpha$ variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in time through the [O III] doublet method. From the LAMOST Data Release 9 quasar catalog, we refine a sample of 209 quasar spectra with strong and narrow [O III] emission lines over a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.8$. Analysis on all of the 209 spectra obtains $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-4}$, which suggests that there is no evidence of varying $\alpha$ on the explored cosmological timescales. Assuming a linear variation, the mean rate of change in $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is limited to be $(-3.4 \pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13}$ $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ in the last 7.0 Gyr. While our LAMOST-based constraint on $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is not competitive with those of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar observations, our analysis serves to corroborate the results of SDSS with another independent survey.</description>

      <title>On destabilising quasi-normal modes with a radially concentrated perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore some aspects of the spectral instability of back hole quasi-normal modes, using a specific model as an example. The model is that of a small bump perturbation to the effective potential of linear axial gravitational waves on a Schwarzschild background, and our focus is on three different aspects of the instability: identifying and distinguishing between the two different types of instabilities studied previously in the literature, quantifying the size of the perturbations applied to the system and testing the validity of the pseudospectral numerical method in providing a convergent result for this measure, and finally, relating the size and other features of the perturbation to the degree of destabilisation of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>A third law of black hole mechanics for supersymmetric black holes and a quasi-local mass-charge inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been proved that a third law of black hole mechanics does not hold for Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to a massless charged scalar field: there exist solutions that describe gravitational collapse to form an exactly extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in finite time. In this paper it is proved that such solutions do not exist in theories with matter fields satisfying a local mass-charge inequality. In such a theory, if a 2-surface has the same metric, extrinsic curvature, and Maxwell field as a cross-section of an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om horizon then this surface cannot have a compact interior and so cannot be a horizon cross-section of a black hole formed in gravitational collapse. This result is proved using spinorial techniques, which are also used to prove a mass-charge inequality for a modified version of the Dougan-Mason quasi-local mass.</description>

      <title>Pair creation, backreaction, and resummation in strong fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit particle creation in strong fields, and backreaction on those fields, from an amplitudes perspective. We describe the strong field by an initial coherent state of photons which we explicitly evolve in time, thus going beyond the background field approximation, and then consider observables which quantify the effects of backreaction. We present expressions for the waveform, vacuum persistence probability, and number of produced photons at next-to-leading order, all of which are impacted by backreaction, along with the number and statistics of produced pairs. We find that converting between in-out (amplitude) and in-in (expectation value) expressions requires explicit resummation of an infinite number of disconnected loop diagrams.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave and Quantum Graviton Interferometer Arm Detection of Gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the quantum and classical descriptions of gravitational wave detection in interferometers like LIGO. We demonstrate that a graviton scattering and quantum optics model succeeds in explaining the observed arm displacements, while the classical gravitational wave approach and a quantum graviton energy method also successfully predict the correct results. We provide a detailed analysis of why the quantum graviton energy approach succeeds, highlighting the importance of collective behavior and the quantum-classical correspondence in gravitational wave physics. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion about the quantum nature of gravity and its observable effects in macroscopic physics.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation at the zero temperature limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the thermal radiation derived by Hawking can be smoothly extended to the $T=0$ limit for Kerr black holes. The emission of the modes with $\omega &gt; m\Omega $ comes to a halt as the surface gravity vanishes. However, Kerr black holes smoothly continue to radiate both in bosonic and fermionic modes with $\omega &lt; m\Omega$, at the $T=0$ limit. We derive explicit expressions for the absorption probabilities which imply that the highest rate of emission pertains to the modes with $\omega=(m\Omega)/2$, both for bosonic and fermionic cases. At the zero limit of thermal radiation, the number of emitted particles vanishes as $\omega \to 0$, which strictly differentiates it from the non-thermal radiation of soft particles by extremal Kerr black holes. We also note that the thermal radiation at the zero limit, drives the black hole away from extremality in accord with the third law and the cosmic censorship conjecture</description>

      <title>Quantum information in Riemannian spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a diffeomorphism-invariant formulation of differential entropy for Riemannian spaces, addressing the lack of a fine-grained, coordinate-independent notion of information for continuous variables in physical space. We extend this formulation to the quantum domain by generalizing Wigner's quasiprobability density function to arbitrary Riemannian spaces and analytically continuing Shannon's differential entropy to include contributions from intermediate virtual quantum states. To demonstrate this framework, we compute the quantum phase space entropy of the harmonic oscillator energy eigenstates in Minkowski and anti-de Sitter geometries. Additionally, we derive a generalized quantum entropic uncertainty relation, extending the Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski inequality to curved backgrounds. This work bridges concepts from information theory, geometry, and quantum physics to provide a systematic approach to studying quantum information in continuous and curved sample spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum K-theory of Quiver Varieties at Roots of Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Psi(\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q)$ be the fundamental solution matrix of the quantum difference equation in the equivariant quantum K-theory for Nakajima variety $X$. In this work, we prove that the operator $$ \Psi(\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q) \Psi\left(\mathbb{z}^p,\mathbb{a}^p,q^{p^2}\right)^{-1} $$ has no poles at the primitive complex $p$-th roots of unity $\zeta_p$ in the curve counting parameter $q$. As a byproduct, we show that the eigenvalues of the iterated product of the operators ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}}$ from the quantum difference equation on $X$ $$ {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z},\mathbb{a},q) {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z} q^{\mathcal{L}},\mathbb{a},q) \cdots {\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z} q^{(p-1)\mathcal{L}},\mathbb{a},q) $$ evaluated at $\zeta_p$ are described by the Bethe equations for $X$ in which all variables are substituted by their $p$-th powers.
  Finally, upon a reduction of the quantum difference equation on $X$ to the quantum differential equation over the field with finite characteristic, the above iterated product transforms into a Grothendiek-Katz $p$-curvature of the corresponding differential connection whereas ${\bf M}_{\mathcal{L}} (\mathbb{z}^p,\mathbb{a}^p,q^p)$ becomes a certain Frobenius twist of that connection. In this way, we are reproducing, in part, the statement of a theorem by Etingof and Varchenko.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory Calculation of LIGO-like Compton Scattering and Experiment Proposal for Graviton Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the lack of a universally accepted quantum gravity theory, gravitons are considered the quantum noise in gravitational waves. Wave mediation requires that gravitons be in a coherence state, with an abundance number of order $\sim10^{79}$. Thus, the detection of coherent-state gravitons may be possible in a LIGO-like experiment via Compton scattering with a nanospherical test mass. This work presents the associating scattering amplitude calculation using effective field theory, calculating a total cross section approximately $100 ~\mathrm{cm^2}$ for a coherence state and $\sim10^{-81}~\mathrm{m^2}$ for a single graviton. An experiment proposal involving levitation techniques of a nanosphere is given in full description.</description>
