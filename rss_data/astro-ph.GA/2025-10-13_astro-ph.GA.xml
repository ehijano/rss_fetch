      <title>Elusive Plunges and Heavy Intermediate-mass-ratio Inspirals from Single and Binary Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most massive galaxies in the Universe also host the largest supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with masses of $10^9 \: \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and above. During their hierarchical assembly, these galaxies have experienced only a few major mergers at low redshift, but have accreted many low-mass galaxies across cosmic time, possibly hosting intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs). If some of these IMBHs migrate to the galactic center, they may form compact subsystems around the central SMBH. We investigate the evolution of such subsystems, consisting of ten $10^5 \: \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ IMBHs at three different concentrations around a $10^9 \: \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ SMBH. We evolve these systems both in isolation and in the presence of a companion SMBH, using \texttt{MSTAR}, a regularized integration method including relativistic effects up to post-Newtonian order 3.5PN. Our analysis focuses on gravitational--wave--driven intermediate--mass--ratio inspirals (heavy IMRIs) and direct plunges. We show that perturbations from a secondary SMBH enhance the number of IMBH direct plunges by more than a factor of two, making them the dominant merger channel. These plunges and IMRIs with a central $10^9 \: \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ SMBH will contribute to SMBH growth but will likely evade detection with future gravitational-wave interferometers and pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). However, for galaxies with lower--mass SMBHs ($M_\bullet \lesssim 10^8 \:\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$), heavy IMRIs will be detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and can provide direct observational constraints on the existence of IMBHs, while the more numerous plunges will still remain hidden.</description>

      <title>The dark matter wake of a galactic bar revealed by multichannel Singular Spectral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way is known to contain a stellar bar, as are a significant fraction of disc galaxies across the universe. Our understanding of bar evolution, both theoretically and through analysis of simulations indicates that bars both grow in amplitude and slow down over time through interaction and angular momentum exchange with the galaxy's dark matter halo. Understanding the physical mechanisms underlying this coupling requires modelling of the structural deformations to the potential that are mutually induced between components. In this work we use Basis Function Expansion (BFE) in combination with multichannel Singular Spectral Analysis (mSSA) as a non-parametric analysis tool to illustrate the coupling between the bar and the dark halo in a single high-resolution isolated barred disc galaxy simulation. We demonstrate the power of mSSA to extract and quantify explicitly coupled dynamical modes, determining growth rates, pattern speeds and phase lags for different stages of evolution of the stellar bar and the dark matter response. BFE &amp; mSSA together grant us the ability to explore the importance and physical mechanisms of bar-halo coupling, and other dynamically coupled structures across a wide range of dynamical environments.</description>

      <title>BEES: Quasar lifetime measurements from extended rest-optical emission line nebulae at $z\sim6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of quasar lifetimes at high redshift indicate that the earliest billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have only been active as luminous quasars for less than a million years. Recently, extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around $z\sim6$ quasars have revealed that these short observed lifetimes are unlikely a sightline-dependent effect. However, the interpretation of Ly$\alpha$ emission is not straightforward due to its resonant nature. In this work, we use rest-frame optical emission lines, which more directly trace photoionization by the quasar, to unambiguously validate the short line-of-sight quasar lifetimes observed at early cosmic epochs. We use deep James Webb Space Telescope/NIRSpec IFU observations of five $z\sim 6$ quasars with small proximity zones to search for their extended emission line nebulae in H$\alpha$ and [O III]$5007$, and detect extended emission in both emission lines around four quasars in our sample. We then use the light-crossing time of these nebulae to measure quasar lifetimes along transverse sightlines. Using their H$\alpha$ nebulae, we also confirm that recombination is likely the dominant emission mechanism behind their previously detected Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. Our results confirm the existence of high-redshift quasars with extremely short lifetimes, $t_{\rm Q} \lesssim 10^{5}\ {\rm yr}$, hosting billion-solar-mass black holes, indicating that rapid accretion is likely responsible for the assembly of SMBHs in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>MaNGA AGN dwarf galaxies (MAD) -- IV. Revealing hidden AGN in dwarf galaxies with radio observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass black holes hosted by dwarf galaxies offer valuable insights into galaxy formation and the growth of the massive black holes found in massive galaxies. Their detection as AGN is challenging due to their low luminosity and compact size. This can be circumvented employing multi-wavelength observational strategies, such as combining optical and radio observations, which enables the detection of AGN features that may be hidden in single-wavelength analyses We aim to detect any jet-like emission indicative of the presence of an AGN in a sample of four dwarf galaxies with AGN signatures based on spatially resolved emission line diagnostic diagrams with SDSS MaNGA. Confirming the presence of an AGN will prove IFU spectroscopy to be a resourceful tool for identifying hidden or switched-off AGN. Using VLA radio observations, we image the radio emission of the four dwarf galaxies and derive their integrated radio flux and luminosity. We compare these to that expected from star formation processes to determine the origin of the radio emission and probe if it is consistent with the results of the emission line diagnostic diagrams. We find that one out of the four galaxies shows AGN radio emission consistent with the analysis of the MaNGA IFU data. The kinetic jet power of this source is Qjet ~ 1e42 erg / s, indicating that dwarf galaxies can host radio jets as powerful as those of massive radio galaxies. This galaxy exhibits an AGN outflow able to escape the gravitational bound produced by the dark matter halo, along with a decrease in the star formation rate of the central region. This suggests the presence of negative feedback from the AGN, which could be suppressing star formation. The other three galaxies exhibit regions of radio emission consistent with a stellar origin and overlapping with the star-forming regions found in the IFU spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Resolving stellar populations, star formation, and ISM conditions with JWST in a large spiral galaxy at z $\sim$ 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic noon represents the prime epoch of galaxy assembly, and a sweet spot for observations with the James Webb Telescope (JWST) and ground-based near-IR integral-field unit (IFU) spectrographs. This work analyses JWST NIRSpec Micro Shutter Array (MSA), NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) of K20-ID7, a large spiral, star-forming (SF) galaxy at z=2.2, with evidence for radial gas inflows. By exploiting the synergy with ground-based IFU ERIS observations, we conduct a comprehensive and resolved study of the interstellar medium (ISM) and stellar properties, from rest optical to near-IR, via emission-line diagnostics, resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of high-resolution imaging, and Pa$\beta$ line detection in NIRCam WFSS data. Our analysis reveals massive ($M_{\star}\simeq$(0.67-3.5)$\times$10$^{9}$ $M_{\odot}$) SF clumps with star formation rates (SFRs) ~3-24 $M_{\odot}$/yr, and quite low dust attenuation ($A_V\simeq$0.4), electron density ($n_{e}$&lt;300 cm$^{-3}$), and ionisation (log(U)$\simeq -3.0$). The central bulge turns out to be modestly massive ($M_{\star}$=(7$\pm$3)$\times$10$^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$), heavily obscured ($A_V$=6.43$\pm$0.55), and likely to have formed most of its stellar mass in the past (SFR=82$\pm$42 $M_{\odot}$/yr over the last 100 Myr), yet still forming stars at a lower rate (SFR=12$\pm$8 M$_{\odot}$/yr over the last 10 Myr). We infer a metallicity 12+log(O/H)~8.54 and an apparent enhancement of the N/O abundance (log(N/O)$\simeq -1.0$) in all distinct galaxy regions, a likely consequence of dilution effects due to radial inflows of metal-poor gas. We measure a sub-solar sulfur abundance (log(S/O)$\simeq$-1.9). Finally, the radial stellar age profile reveals older stellar populations in the inner galaxy regions compared to the outskirts, pointing to an inside-out growth of K20-ID7.</description>

      <title>GATOS IX: A Detailed Assessment and Treatment of Emission Line Contamination in JWST/MIRI Images of Nearby Seyfert Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband mid-infrared (MIR) imaging with high spatial resolution is useful to study extended dust structures in the circumnuclear regions of nearby AGN. However, broadband imaging filters cannot distinguish dust continuum emission from emission lines, and so accounting for the emission line contamination becomes crucial in studying extended dust in these environments.This paper uses Cycle 1 MIR imaging from JWST/MIRI and spectroscopy from JWST/MRS for 11 local Seyfert galaxies, as part of the Galactic Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). Three of the objects (NGC 3081, NGC 5728, and NGC 7172) exist in both datasets, allowing direct measurement of the line emission using the spectroscopy for these objects. We find that extended MIR emission persists on scales of 100s of parsecs after the removal of contamination from emission lines. Further, the line contamination levels vary greatly between objects (from 5% to 30% in the F1000W filter), and across filters, so cannot be generalised across a sample and must be carefully treated for each object and band. We also test methods to estimate the line contamination when only MRS spectroscopy or MIRI imaging is available, using pre-JWST ancillary data. We find that these methods estimate the contamination within 10 percentage points. This paper serves as a useful guide for methods to quantify and mitigate for emission line contamination in MIRI broadband imaging</description>

      <title>Probing the Physics of Dusty Outflows through Complex Organic Molecules in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy-scale outflows are of critical importance for galaxy formation and evolution. Dust grains are the main sites for the formation of molecules needed for star formation but are also important for the acceleration of outflows that can remove the gas reservoir critical for stellar mass growth. Using the MIRI medium-resolution integral field spectrograph aboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we detect the 3.28 $\mu$m aromatic and the 3.4 $\mu$m aliphatic hydrocarbon dust features in absorption in a redshift 4.601 hot dust-obscured galaxy, blue-shifted by $\Delta$V=$-5250^{+276}_{-339}$ kms$^{-1}$ from the systemic redshift of the galaxy. The extremely high velocity of the dust indicates that the wind was accelerated by radiation pressure from the central quasar. These results pave a novel way for probing the physics of dusty outflows in active galaxies at early cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Starburst galaxies in the Hydra I cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new catalog of 196 galaxies of the nearby Hydra I cluster out to $\sim$1.75$\rm r_{200}$, consisting of broad u,g,r,i,z along with narrowband H${\alpha}$ measurements. These deep optical images were obtained with the DECam camera (CTIO) and reach down to a surface brightness limit of $\mu( 3\sigma;10''\times10'')$=26.9 mag $\rm arcsec^2$ in the g band. We also report the HI properties for 89 cluster members detected with MeerKAT. A color magnitude diagram (CMD) shows a bimodal distribution typical of a cluster population, more evolved than those found in isolation. We combine optical H${\alpha}$ and WISE infrared data to compare the star formation history at two distinct timescales. Differences in the star forming activity depicted by both populations manifest as starburst in 24 found members. Of these, 18 starburst galaxies have neutral gas measurements, and show disturbed HI disks that suggest an environmentally-triggered boost in star formation within the last 10$^7$ yrs. Processes such as ram pressure stripping or tidal interactions may underlie their enhanced star-forming activity and asymmetric disks. Since Hydra's dynamical history is unclear, we examine the spatial and velocity distribution of the sample. We reveal a possible link between the large scale structure feeding the Hydra I cluster and the heightened star-forming activity of the starburst galaxies. This feeding pattern matches the few substructure that has been identified in Hydra in previous works, and may explain its origin. Our results portray a picture of a cluster with an evolved nature, plus a population of new infalling galaxies that manifest the impact of their first contact with the cluster environment through star formation, color, morphology and gas content transformations.</description>

      <title>Detection of Quadruple Structure Near the ASCC 32 Region via Machine Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple structures within stellar groups are an intriguing subject for theoretical and observational studies of stellar formation. With the accuracy and completeness of data from Gaia Data Release 3, we now have new opportunities to detect reliable members of stellar groups across a larger field of view than in previous studies. In this work, using machine learning methods and high-accuracy data, we investigate the possibility of detecting multiple structures within 500 arcmin of ASCC 32. We first applied DBSCAN to proper motion and parallax, as multiple structures tend to share similar values for these parameters. Next, we applied GMM to position, proper motion, and parallax for the members detected by DBSCAN. This approach allowed us to identify a filamentary structure among the DBSCAN-detected members. This structure contains all stellar groups previously identified in this region. Subsequently, based on the BIC score, we applied GMM to this filamentary structure. Since multiple structures exhibit distinct positional distributions, GMM was able to effectively separate all groups within the filament. Our methods successfully identified ASCC 32, OC 0395, and HSC 1865 within a 500 arcmin radius. Additionally, we found two distinct substructures within ASCC 32. These four groups exhibit a single main-sequence distribution in the CMD, with proper motion values within three times the standard deviation and slightly differing parallax values, despite having distinct spatial structures. Furthermore, these four groups share the same radial velocity distribution. We provide documentation demonstrating the formation of these stellar groups as a multiple structure, with improved membership identification compared to previous studies.</description>

      <title>Water Maser Disk and a Supermassive Black Hole at the Nucleus of the Active Galaxy NGC 7738</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of water vapor masers in the nucleus of the LINER galaxy NGC 7738. The red- and blue-shifted and newly detected systemic maser features show an almost edge-on disk located at a distance of ${0.031}\mbox{-}{0.222}$ pc from the galactic center and rotating with a velocity of $324\mbox{-}454$ km s$^{-1}$ . The velocity field of the disk indicates sub-Keplerian rotation, suggesting a non-negligible disk mass. The Mestel disk model reveals the central and disk masses to be $(1.2 \pm 0.4) \times 10^6$ $M_{\odot}$ and $(4.7 \pm 1.5) \times10^6$ $M_{\odot}$, respectively. The mean volume density within the inner radius of the disk [$(1.2 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$ $\mathrm{pc^{-3}}$] strongly suggests the existence of a supermassive black hole at the center.</description>

      <title>JWST Catches a Strongly Gravitationally Lensed AGN In Transition from Type II to Type I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has enabled the discovery of a statistical sample of obscured (type II) active galactic nuclei (AGN) at cosmic noon. Studies comparing those type II AGN with type I AGN at that epoch have reinforced the long-standing idea of an evolutionary link between those classes of objects. Mergers, the idea goes, disturb the morphologies and angular momentum of galaxies. The disruption of angular momentum allows material to be funneled toward galactic cores, sparking AGN activity and potentially also a burst of star-formation. That material enshrouds the galactic nucleus, leading to a type II AGN. Later, AGN feedback clears the circumnuclear dust, leading to a transition into a type I AGN, and also quenches star formation. If this is a common outcome, a class of intermediate objects should exist. Such objects would be somewhat disturbed and dusty and sit below the star-forming galaxy main sequence, and their star-formation histories would show an increase in star-formation at around the time of the suspected merger. We present new JWST observations of SDSSJ2222+2745, a strongly lensed AGN at z=2.801. The lensing magnification enables a detailed study of the host galaxy spanning the rest-ultraviolet through near infrared. JWST and HST photometry, morphological models, and models of the host's spectral energy distribution reveal that SDSSJ2222+2745 is actively transitioning from a type II to type I AGN. Catching a lensed AGN at this special evolutionary phase makes SDSSJ2222+2745 a unique laboratory to study the physical processes involved in the transition and their relationships to the AGN and the host galaxy at incredible spatial-resolution down to about 20pc at z=2.801.</description>

      <title>Refining open cluster parameters with Gaia XP metallicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision of cluster parameter determination has significantly improved with the availability of homogeneous photometric Gaia data, however, challenges such as age-metallicity degeneracy and lack of spectroscopic observations remain. In this paper we investigate whether metallicities derived from low-resolution Gaia XP spectra can be effectively used to break degeneracies and improve the accuracy of OC parameter determinations.
  We analysed 20 OCs using isochrone fitting methods on Gaia DR3 photometry and metallicity estimates from several Gaia XP-based catalogues. We derived age, distance modulus, and extinction using the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC).
  We compared the parameter estimates to the values obtained in other works through isochrone fitting with spectroscopically constrained metallicities or through neural network techniques applied only to the photometry. We found the systematic difference between Gaia XP derived metallicities and those obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy to be 0.1-0.15 dex. We found a systematic age difference of &lt;0.03 +- 0.13 dex compared to isochrone fitting using high-resolution spectroscopy, and &lt;0.08 +- 0.21 dex compared to neural network-based methods, and a median individual error of ~0.065 dex.
  Despite their low resolution, Gaia XP metallicities effectively constrain parameters of clusters lacking a well-populated RGB. When used with stringent quality cuts and incorporated as priors, they allow to determine ages comparable in precision to those based on high-resolution spectroscopy and more precise than photometry-only neural network methods. These results highlight the potential of Gaia data for accurate cluster parameter analysis and detailed Galactic studies without relying on traditional spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Environmental Regulation of Dust and Star Formation Unveiled by Subaru Dual Narrow-band Imaging: Degree-scale Balmer Decrement Mapping across a z = 0.9 Supercluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a dual narrow-band imaging survey targeting the CL1604 supercluster at z = 0.9 using the Subaru Telescope. By combining the NB921 filter on HSC and the NB1244 filter on SWIMS, we can detect redshifted H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ emission lines from the supercluster. This unique technique allows us to measure both star formation rates and dust extinction for a sample of 94 emission-line galaxies across the supercluster. We find that dust extinction, estimated from the Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratio), increases with stellar mass in star-forming galaxies, whereas relatively quiescent systems exhibit comparatively low extinction. Among galaxies with intermediate masses ($10^{8.5} &lt; M_* &lt; 10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$), the dust-corrected H$\alpha$-based star formation rates align with the main sequence at this epoch. More massive galaxies, however, deviate from this relation, exhibit redder colors, and reside predominantly in higher-density environments. Although stellar mass, SFR, and galaxy color are clearly influenced by environment, we detect no strong, systematic environmental dependence of dust extinction for the whole sample.</description>

      <title>Dark gaps and resonances in barred galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark gaps, low surface brightness regions along the bar minor axis, are expected to form as a consequence of secular evolution in barred galaxies. Although several studies have proposed links between dark gap locations and dynamical resonances, the results remain inconclusive. Using DESI Legacy Imaging Survey data, we find that approximately 61% of barred galaxies exhibit pronounced dark gaps. We compare the location of dark gaps with resonance radii derived from the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to MaNGA data for the same galaxies. Our analysis shows that dark gaps do not preferentially form at specific resonances. Instead, their locations correlate with $\mathcal{R}$ $\equiv$ $R_{CR}/R_{Bar}$: slow bars tend to show shorter dark gap radii, while fast bars show longer ones. This trend reflects a tight relation between bar length and dark gap radius. However, when barred galaxies are classified by their ring morphology, certain types exhibit dark gaps that align with specific resonances. Notably, dark gaps located between the inner and outer rings are closely associated with the corotation radius. In galaxies with two dark gaps along the bar minor axis profile, the inner dark gap typically aligns with the ultraharmonic resonance, and the outer dark gap corresponds to the corotation radius. These findings suggest that some morphological types share similar $\mathcal{R}$ values and exhibit dark gaps near specific resonances. Thus, dark gaps may serve as proxies for dynamical resonances only in certain systems. Our findings may help explain the discrepancies observed in earlier studies.</description>

      <title>The Green Bank Ammonia Survey: Data Release 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of the final data release (DR2) from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey (GAS). GAS is a Large Program at the Green Bank Telescope to map all Gould Belt star-forming regions with $A_\mathrm{V} \gtrsim 7$~mag visible from the northern hemisphere in emission from NH$_3$ and other key molecular tracers. This final release includes the data for all the regions observed: Heiles Cloud 2 and B18 in Taurus; Barnard 1, Barnard 1-E, IC348, NGC 1333, L1448, L1451, and Per7/34 in Perseus; L1688 and L1689 in Ophiuchus; Orion A (North and South) and Orion B in Orion; Cepheus, B59 in Pipe; Corona Australis (CrA) East and West; IC5146; and Serpens Aquila and MWC297 in Serpens. Similar to what was presented in GAS DR1, we find that the NH$_3$ emission and dust continuum emission from Herschel correspond closely. We find that the NH$_3$ emission is generally extended beyond the typical 0.1 pc length scales of dense cores, and we find that the transition between coherent core and turbulent cloud is a common result. This shows that the regions of coherence are common throughout different star forming regions, with a substantial fraction of the high column density regions displaying subsonic non-thermal velocity dispersions. We produce maps of the gas kinematics, temperature, and NH$_3$ column densities through forward modeling of the hyperfine structure of the NH$_3$ (1,1) and (2,2) lines. We show that the NH$_3$ velocity dispersion, $\sigma_v$, and gas kinetic temperature, $T_{\rm kin}$, vary systematically between the regions included in this release, with an increase in both the mean value and spread of $\sigma_v$ and $T_{\rm kin}$ with increasing star formation activity. The data presented in this paper are publicly available via \dataset[DOI: 10.11570/24.0091]{https://doi.org/10.11570/24.0091}.</description>

      <title>The JWST-NIRCam View of Sagittarius C. III. The Extinction Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre is crucial for accurately correcting observed data and deriving the underlying stellar populations. However, extinction curves reported in the literature often show discrepancies. We aim to derive the infrared extinction curve towards the Galactic centre based on JWST-NIRCam data for the first time, using observations of the Sagittarius C region in the 1-5 $\mu$m range. We determined extinction ratios using two different methods, both based on measuring the reddening vector using the slope of red clump stars, whose intrinsic properties are well known, in observed colour-magnitude diagrams. The extinction curve derived in this work is in good agreement with previous results in the literature. We obtained the following extinction ratios relative to F162M: $A_\mathrm{F115W} : A_\mathrm{F162M} : A_\mathrm{F182M} : A_\mathrm{F212N} : A_\mathrm{F360M} : A_\mathrm{F405N} : A_\mathrm{F470N} : A_\mathrm{F480M} = 1.84 \pm 0.03 : 1.00 : 0.789 \pm 0.005 : 0.607 \pm 0.014 : 0.306 \pm 0.011 : 0.248 \pm 0.017 : 0.240 \pm 0.019 : 0.21 \pm 0.03$. Besides, we found different values of the extinction index for the short- ($\lambda \sim 1-2.5\,\mu$m, $\alpha \sim 2$) and long-wavelength ($\lambda \sim 2.5-5\,\mu$m, $\alpha \sim 1.4$) regimes, with the extinction curve flattening at longer wavelengths. Comparison with extinction curves derived both inside and outside the Galactic centre suggests that the infrared extinction curve does not significantly vary in the central regions, and shows no significant evidence for variations between different lines of sight beyond the inner Galaxy within the uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in the Shadow: The Missing High-Ionization Lines in the Earliest JWST AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered a substantial population of high-redshift, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whose properties challenge standard models of black hole growth and AGN emission. We analyze a spectroscopic sample of 34 Type 1 AGNs from the JWST Advanced Deep Survey (JADES) survey, spanning redshifts 1.7 &lt; z &lt; 9, to constrain the physical nature of the accretion flows powering these sources with broad-line diagnostics statistically for the first time. At z &gt; 5, we find a marked suppression of high-ionization emission lines (HeII, CIV, NV) relative to prominent broad Halpha and narrow [OIII] features. This contrast places strong constraints on the shape of the ionizing spectral energy distribution (SED) and on the physical conditions in the broad-line region (BLR). By comparing the observations to photoionization models based on SEDs of black holes accreting at sub-Eddington ratios, we show that standard AGN continua struggle to reproduce the observed broad line ratios and equivalent widths across a wide ionization parameter range. These results suggest the need for modified SEDs -- either intrinsically softened due to super-Eddington accretion or radiative inefficiencies in the innermost disk, or externally filtered by intervening optically thick gas that absorbs or scatters the highest-energy photons before they reach the BLR.</description>

      <title>Co-evolution of Nuclear Star Clusters and Massive Black Holes: Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in the co-evolution of massive black holes (MBHs) and nuclear star clusters (NSCs), which host diverse stellar populations across a wide range of masses. The dynamics are simulated self-consistently with GNC, which we have updated to incorporate gravitational wave orbital decay, the loss cone of a spinning MBH, and stellar evolution. Over $12$ Gyr, we investigate the evolution of the NSC with a mass-growing MBH, as well as the EMRIs of stellar black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs, brown dwarfs (BDs), and low-mass main-sequence stars (MSs), along with tidal disruption events (TDEs) involving MSs, BDs, and post-MSs. The mass growth of the MBH contributed by TDEs is typically $\sim 10^7\,M_{\odot}$, $\sim 10^6\,M_{\odot}$, and $\sim 5\times10^4\,M_{\odot}$ for massive, Milky-Way-like, and smaller NSCs, respectively. Between $40\%$ and $70\%$ of the stellar mass is lost during stellar evolution, which dominates the mass growth of the MBH if a significant fraction of the lost mass is accreted. The evolution of EMRI rates is generally affected by the cluster's size expansion or contraction, stellar population evolution, MBH mass growth, and the stellar initial mass function. The EMRI rates for compact objects peak at early epochs ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr) and then gradually decline over cosmic time. LISA-band ($0.1$ mHz) EMRIs involving compact objects around Milky-Way-like MBHs tend to have high eccentricities, while those around spinning MBHs preferentially occupy low-inclination (prograde) orbits. In contrast, MS- and BD-EMRIs usually have eccentricity and inclination distributions that are distinct from those of compact objects.</description>

      <title>HI terminal velocity curves -- Lessons learned from N-body/hydrodynamic `surrogate' models of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of an N-body/hydrodynamic `surrogate' model of the Milky Way (MW) - a model that resembles the MW in several key aspects after many Gyrs of evolution - would be extremely beneficial for Galactic Archaeology. Here we present four new `surrogate' models, all built with the Nexus framework. The simulations contain stars, dark matter and gas. Our most sophisticated model allows gas to evolve thermodynamically, and includes star formation, metal production, and stellar feedback. The other three models in this work have an isothermal gas disc. We examine these new simulations in the context of cold gas observations of the Galaxy. Our focus is the so-called `HI terminal velocity curve' - a heliocentric measurement of the maximum Vlos as a function of Galactic longitude, which dates back to the early days of radio astronomy. It is a powerful approach to indirectly estimating the gas dynamics because it does not require knowledge about the distance to individual gas clouds, which is difficult to estimate. A comparison of the terminal velocities and recovered rotation curve values in the simulations against observations suggests that our models are in need of further refinement. The gravitational torques associated with our synthetic bars are too strong, driving excessive streaming motion in the inner gas disc. This causes the simulated terminal velocity curves in the Galactic Quadrant I and IV to deviate substantially from each other, unlike what is seen in observed HI terminal velocities of the MW. We suggest possible ways forward for future models.</description>

      <title>Three Birds with One Stone: Core-Collapsed SIDM Halos as the Common Origin of Dense Perturbers in Lenses, Streams, and Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter halos of mass $\sim 10^6\,{M_\odot}$, originally simulated to explain the dense perturber of the GD-1 stellar stream, also reproduce the structural properties inferred for the dense perturber detected in the strong lensing system JVAS B1938+666 from radio observations. Furthermore, these halos are sufficiently compact and dense to gravitationally capture field stars in satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, providing a natural explanation for the origin of Fornax 6, a stellar cluster in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Our results demonstrate that observations of halos with similar masses but residing in different cosmic environments offer a powerful and complementary probe of self-interacting dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Relation Between AGN and Host Galaxy Properties in the JWST Era: II. The merger-driven evolution of Seyferts at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Paper I, we exploited the unsurpassed resolution and depth of JWST/NIRCam imagery to investigate the relationship between AGN and host-galaxy properties in the JWST era, finding a correlation between the level of spatial disturbance (as measured by shape asymmetry, $A_S$) and obscuration ($N_H$). Here in Paper II, we report an expansion of our X-ray and infrared analysis of Seyfert-luminosity host galaxies with four additional metrics to the single-metric morphology analysis of Paper I, as well as new samples of inactive control galaxies. This expanded study of one of the largest and most complete, multi-wavelength samples of AGN detected at $0.6&lt;z&lt;2.4$ in the GOODS-South and North fields, confirms that mergers surprisingly play a significant role in obscured, sub-quasar AGN host galaxies. Additionally, the pattern of morphological disturbances observed amongst the X-ray- and mid-IR-selected AGN suggests that these represent different phases of AGN evolution tied to a major-merger timeline, as opposed to distinct populations of AGN. These results indicate that mergers are important in triggering sub-quasar AGN at these redshifts.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic alignment of disks and ellipticals across hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlations between the positions and shapes of galaxies, i.e. intrinsic alignments, have been measured in many observational studies and hydrodynamical simulations. The alignments of disk galaxies in hydrodynamical simulations have been measured to be positive, null and negative with varying methodologies, samples and hydrodynamical simulations. This work compares the correlations of disks and ellipticals around all galaxies and disks around ellipticals at $z=0$ and $z=1$ for simple and reduced shapes in TNG300, Horizon-AGN and EAGLE for multiple morphological definitions in a consistent way. All types of signals are positive and robust in TNG300 and EAGLE and positive or null in Horizon-AGN, except for the disks around ellipticals correlation for reduced shapes at $z=1$ when defined by $|v/\sigma|$, which is negative. A re-weighting of the ellipticals around galaxies signals in TNG300, according to the underlying stellar mass distributions of the samples, highlights the importance of the influence of (sub-grid) physics at these non-linear scales.</description>

      <title>The evolution of CH in Planck Galactic Cold Clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methylidyne (CH) has long been considered a reliable tracer of molecular gas in the low-to-intermediate extinction range. Although extended CH 3.3 GHz emission is commonly observed in diffuse and translucent clouds, observations in cold, dense clumps are rare. In this work, we conducted high-sensitivity CH observations toward 27 PGCCs with the Arecibo 305m telescope. Toward each source, the CH data were analyzed in conjunction with $^{13}$CO (1--0), HINSA, and H$_2$ column densities. Our results revealed ubiquitous subsonic velocity dispersions of CH, in contrast to $^{13}$CO, which is predominantly supersonic. The findings suggest that subsonic CH emissions may trace dense, low-turbulent gas structures in PGCCs. To investigate environmental effects, particularly the cosmic-ray ionization rate (CRIR), we estimated CRIR upper limits from HINSA, yielding values from $(8.1\pm4.7)\times10^{-18}$ to $(2.0\pm0.8)\times10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ ($N_{H_2}$ from $(1.7\pm0.2)\times10^{21}$ to $(3.6\pm0.4)\times10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$). This result favors theoretical predictions of a cosmic-ray attenuation model, in which the interstellar spectra of low-energy CR protons and electrons match {\it Voyager} measurements, although alternative models cannot yet be ruled out. The abundance of CH decreases with increasing column density, while showing a positive dependence on the CRIR, which requires atomic oxygen not heavily depleted to dominate CH destruction in PGCCs. By fitting the abundance of CH with an analytic formula, we place constraints on atomic O abundance ($2.4\pm0.4\times10^{-4}$ with respect to total H) and C$^+$ abundance ($7.4\pm0.7\times10^{13}\zeta_2/n_{\rm H_2}$). These findings indicate that CH formation is closely linked to the C$^+$ abundance, regulated by cosmic-ray ionization, while other processes, such as turbulent diffusive transport, might also contribute a non-negligible effect.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Evolution of Bulge, Disk and Colour Gradients in HST Observations of Galaxies with 3D Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure galaxy structural properties and colour gradients using HST images to trace the evolution of galaxy components. We jointly fit 3D bulge and disk models to 2505 galaxies in GOODS-South across seven bands (bvizYJH) to IAB = 25.5, accounting for different component ellipticities and inclination-dependent dust extinction. Extinction strongly affects structural parameters and colour gradients in ~26% of the sample - primarily edge-on galaxies with central obscuration (B-band face-on optical depth tau ~ 4) that reveal clear bulge components in the near-infrared. Despite irregular morphologies, the model captures observed colour gradients well. Bulges at z ~ 1 differ markedly from z ~ 0, with typical Sersic index n ~ 1.0 and bulge-to-disc size ratio Re/hd ~ 0.15, suggesting most galaxies host pseudo-bulges formed via secular evolution. Galaxy ellipticity correlates strongly with disk scale-length and absolute magnitude, partly driven by dust extinction variations. We trace bulge and disk evolution from z ~ 0 to z ~ 2.5: bulges are redder than disks (observed-frame) at z &lt; 1.4, but colours converge at higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes. Redder galaxies show redder cores relative to their outskirts, and brighter galaxies have redder cores.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XVII: Formation and excitation of HD in photodissociation regions. Application to the Orion Bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope enabled the first detection of several rovibrational emission lines of HD in the Orion Bar, a prototypical photodissociation region. This provides an incentive to examine the physics of HD in dense and strong PDRs. Using the latest data available on HD excitation by collisional, radiative and chemical processes, our goal is to unveil HD formation and excitation processes in PDRs by comparing our state-of-the-art PDR model with observations made in the Orion Bar and discuss if and how HD can be used as a complementary tracer of physical parameters in the emitting region. We compute detailed PDR models, using an upgraded version of the Meudon PDR code, which are compared to NIRSpec data using excitation diagrams and synthetic emission spectra. The models predict that HD is mainly produced in the gas phase via the reaction D + H2 = H + HD at the front edge of the PDR and that the D/HD transition is located slightly closer to the edge than the H/H2 transition. Rovibrational levels are excited by UV pumping. In the observations, HD rovibrational emission is detected close to the H/H2 dissociation fronts of the Orion Bar and peaks where vibrationally excited H2 peaks, rather than at the maximum emission of pure rotational H2 levels. We derive an excitation temperature around Tex ~ 480 - 710 K. Due to high continuum in the Orion Bar, fringes lead to high noise levels beyond 15 $\mu$m, no pure rotational lines of HD are detected. The comparison to PDR models shows that a range of thermal pressure P = (3-9)x10$^7$ K cm$^{-3}$ with no strong constraints on the intensity of the UV field are compatible with HD observations. This range of pressure is compatible with previous estimates from H2 observations with JWST. This is the first time that observations of HD emission lines in the near-infrared are used to put constraints on the thermal pressure in the PDR.</description>

      <title>The chemodynamical memory of a major merger in a NIHAO-UHD Milky Way analogue I: A golden thread through time and space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the Milky Way's present-day structure was shaped by past major mergers is a key goal of Galactic archaeology. The chemical and dynamical structure of the Galaxy retains the imprint of such events, including a major accretion episode around 8-10 Gyr ago. Recent findings suggest that present-day orbital energy correlates with stellar chemistry and birth location within the merging progenitor galaxy. Using a high-resolution NIHAO-UHD cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue, we trace the birth positions, ages, and present-day orbits of stars accreted in its last major merger. We show that stars born in the progenitor's core are more tightly bound to the Milky Way and chemically enriched, while those from the outskirts are less bound and metal-poor. This supports the scenario proposed by Sk\'ulad\'ottir et al. (2025) using idealised simulations, now demonstrated in a cosmological context. The preserved chemodynamical memory is also evident in elemental planes such as [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn], reflecting gradients in star formation efficiency. The median abundance trends for different orbital energies are broadly similar, though less pronounced and more non-linear than the linear relations reported by Sk\'ulad\'ottir et al. (2025), with relatively good agreement at the highest metallicities. Our results reveal that spatial and temporal memory is retained across the merger -- connecting birth locations to present-day properties like a golden thread. We demonstrate that selection methods in integrals-of-motion space systematically bias progenitor reconstructions by missing its enriched core, and we outline strategies to obtain a more representative census of accreted stars.</description>

      <title>MSA-3D: Uncovering Weak AGNs and Resolved Outflows in Disguise in $z\sim1$ Star-Forming Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved rest-optical spectroscopy of 38 star-forming galaxies at 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.7 from the JWST/NIRSpec MSA-3D survey, which uses slit-stepping to build IFU-like datacubes at 0.1'' resolution. We map emission-line morphology, excitation, and kinematics of the warm ionized gas using [N II]/H$\alpha$, [S II]/H$\alpha$, and [O III]/H$\beta$. Relative to z$\sim$0 galaxies at fixed stellar mass, our sources show systematically lower [N II]/H$\alpha$ and [S II]/H$\alpha$ and elevated [O III]/H$\beta$, consistent with harder radiation fields and lower metallicities. Radially, [O III]/H$\beta$ profiles are typically flat or mildly positive, whereas [N II]/H$\alpha$ also remains flat or declines outward, mirroring metallicity trends. On kpc scales, we find a strong positive correlation between [N II]/H$\alpha$ and velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), linking local excitation to turbulent or shock-driven kinematics. Six galaxies ($\sim$ 16% of the sample) host spatially localized regions with elevated [N II]/H$\alpha$, high EW(H$\alpha$), and V_RMS = $\sqrt{V^2 + \sigma^2} &gt; 200$ km/s, indicative of weak AGN activity, shocks, or outflows. For these candidates we infer modest warm-ionized outflow rates of 1-4 Msun/yr and kinetic powers $\sim$ 0.1-1% of the AGN bolometric luminosity (from central [O III] or H$\alpha$). These values place our sample at the low-energy tail of known AGN-driven outflows yet in continuity with $\dot{M_{out}}-L_{AGN}$ scaling relations across 0 &lt; z &lt; 6. A completeness assessment shows MSA-3D is sensitive to AGN with $L_{AGN} \geq 10^{43}$ erg/s, underscoring both the promise and current limitations of detecting weak AGN activity in distant galaxies with resolved spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>REBELS-IFU: Linking damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption to [CII] emission and dust content in the EoR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral gas in galaxies during the Epoch of Reionisation regulates star formation, dust growth, and the escape of ionising photons, making it a key ingredient in understanding both galaxy assembly and reionisation. Yet, direct constraints on the HI content of galaxies at z&gt;6 have been scarce. With JWST, Ly$\alpha$ damping wings in galaxy spectra can now provide a direct probe of this neutral component. We analyse JWST/NIRSpec prism spectra of 12 UV-luminous galaxies from the REBELS-IFU program at z~6.5-7.7, deriving HI column densities by modelling Ly$\alpha$ damping wings. Significant damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption is detected in eight galaxies, with $N_{\mathrm{HI}}\gtrsim10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. We use the column densities and sizes derived for these sources to estimate their HI mass and compare with $L_{\mathrm{[CII]}}$-$M_{\mathrm{HI}}$ calibrations. The resulting HI masses show a tentative correlation with those inferred from [CII], although the [CII]-based estimates are systematically larger, suggesting that the HI reservoirs may extend beyond the [CII]-emitting gas. We also combine the DLA-based measurements with FIR-derived dust-to-gas ratios, dust attenuation, and gas-phase metallicities. No correlation is found between DLA-based and FIR-based dust-to-gas ratios, but combining the REBELS-IFU sample with literature samples at lower metallicities reveals a strong correlation between $A_{\mathrm{V}}/N_{\mathrm{HI}}$ and metallicity. These findings suggest that by $z\sim7$ massive galaxies can already host substantial, enriched reservoirs of neutral gas and dust, consistent with $A_{\mathrm{V}}$/$N_{\mathrm{HI}}$-metallicity trends at lower redshift. At the highest redshifts ($z&gt;8$), however, we see tentative evidence for systematically lower $A_{\mathrm{V}}$/$N_{\mathrm{HI}}$ at fixed metallicity, which may point to pristine gas accretion or more efficient dust destruction/expulsion.</description>

      <title>JWST COSMOS-3D: Spectroscopic Census and Luminosity Function of [O III] Emitters at 6.75&lt;z&lt;9.05 in COSMOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopically-selected [OIII]+Hb emitters catalogue at 6.75&lt;z&lt;9.05 and the resulting [OIII] 5008 \AA Luminosity Function (LF) in the COSMOS field. We leverage the 0.3 deg$^{2}$ covered to date by COSMOS-3D using NIRCam/WFSS F444W (90% of the survey) to perform the largest spectroscopic search for [OIII] emitters at 6.75&lt;z&lt;9.05. We present our catalogue of 237 [OIII] emitters and their associated completeness function. The inferred constraints on the [OIII] LF enable us to characterise the knee of the [OIII] LF, resulting in improved [OIII] LF constraints at z~7,8. Notably, we find evidence for an accelerated decline of the [OIII] luminosity density between z~7 and z~8, which could be expected if the metallicity of [OIII] emitters, as well as the cosmic star-formation rate density, is declining at these redshifts. We find that theoretical models that reproduce the z~7,8 [OIII] LF do not reproduce well the [OIII] equivalent width distribution, pointing to potential challenges in the modelling of[OIII] and other nebular lines in the early Universe. Finally, we provide the first constraints on the cosmic variance of [OIII] emitters, estimating at 15% the relative uncertainty for the z~7,8 [OIII] LF in the 0.3 deg$^2$ field. This estimate is in good agreement with that inferred from clustering, and shows that the [OIII] LF derived from smaller extragalactic legacy fields is strongly affected by cosmic variance. Our results highlight the fundamental role that wide-area JWST slitless surveys play to map the galaxy large-scale structure down into the reionisation era, serving as a springboard for a variety of science cases.</description>

      <title>Feeding the dead: neutral gas inflow with suppressed star formation in a long-quenched ancient massive galaxy at z~2.7 observed with JWST/NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the spectroscopic detection of neutral gas inflow into a massive ($M_* \simeq 4\times 10^{10} M_\odot$) quiescent galaxy observed at $z_{\rm{spec}} = 2.6576$ with JWST. From the redshifted absorption of the NaI doublet at $\lambda \lambda 5890, 5896 $ Ang, we estimate an inflow velocity $v=278^{+79}_{-79}$ km s$^{-1}$ and a column density $\log(N_{NaI}/\rm{cm^2}) = 13.02^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$. We derive the inflowing mass of the gas $M_{in} = 1.6^{+0.1}_{-0.1} \times 10^8 M_\odot$ and rate $\dot{M}_{in} = 19^{+6}_{-7} \, M_\odot \, \rm{yr}^{-1}$. The presence of several surrounding galaxies suggests that the galaxy may be accreting gas from nearby companions. However, we cannot confirm it with current data and the intergalactic medium or cosmic filaments are also viable sources of the inflowing gas. Despite the ongoing inflow, the galaxy remains quiescent, with an upper limit to the star formation rate of $0.2 \, M_\odot \, \rm{yr}^{-1}$. Moreover, its star formation history suggests that the galaxy has remained quiescent during the past $\sim1$ Gyr, with half of its stars formed by redshift $z_{50}=11^{+18}_{-3}$. We discuss that the inflow is not massive, dense, or long-lived enough to ignite significant star formation, or it is fueling low-level AGN activity instead. This is direct evidence that quiescent galaxies can accrete cold gas after their quenching while keeping their star formation subdued. Follow-up observations with JWST and ALMA will be needed to constraint the nature of the inflowing gas.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI-MRS view of the metal-poor galaxy CGCG 007-025: the spatial location of PAHs and very highly ionized gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key diagnostics of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium and are widely used to trace star formation in the mid-infrared (mid-IR). The relative strengths of mid-IR PAH emission features (e.g., 6.2, 7.7, 11.3 um) are sensitive to both the size and ionization state of the molecules and can be strongly influenced by the local radiation field. However, at low metallicities ( Z &lt; 0.2 Zsun), detecting PAHs remains notoriously difficult, likely reflecting a combination of suppressed formation and enhanced destruction mechanisms. We present new JWST/MIRI MRS observations of the metal-poor (Z = 0.1 Zsun) dwarf galaxy CGCG 007-025. We confirm the tentative PAH detection previously reported from Spitzer data and, for the first time, identify a compact (approx. 50 pc) PAH-emitting region nearly co-spatial with the newly detected [NeV](I.P. = 97 eV) emission and the galaxy's most metal-poor, strongly star-forming region. The 11.3 um PAH feature is clearly detected, while no emission is found from the other typically brighter features, suggesting a PAH population dominated by large, neutral molecules resilient to hard ionizing fields. When compared with models, mid-IR line ratios involving [NeIII], [OIV], and [NeV] can only be reproduced by a combination of star formation and AGN ionization, with the latter contributing 4--8%. The [OIV] and [NeV] luminosities exceed what massive stars or shocks can produce, highlighting a puzzling scenario in line with recent JWST observations of similar galaxies. This work provides a crucial reference for studying the physical conditions of the dust and star formation in low-metallicity starburst regions, environments typical of the early universe.</description>

      <title>JADES Dark Horse: demonstrating high-multiplex observations with JWST/NIRSpec dense-shutter spectroscopy in the JADES Origins Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec dense-shutter spectroscopy (DSS). This novel observing strategy with the NIRSpec micro-shutter assembly (MSA) deliberately permits a high number of controlled spectral overlaps to reach extreme multiplex while retaining the low background of slit spectroscopy. In a single configuration over the JADES Origins Field we opened shutters on all faint (F444W&lt;30 mag) z$_{\rm phot}$&gt;3 candidates in the MSA, prioritising emission-line science and rejecting only bright continuum sources. Using 33.6 and 35.8 ks on-source in G235M and G395M, we observed a single mask with ~850 sources, obtaining secure spectroscopic redshifts for ~540 galaxies over 2.5&lt;z&lt;8.9. The per-configuration target density in DSS mode is 4-5x higher than standard no- and low-overlap MSA strategies (&lt;200 sources), with no loss in redshift precision or accuracy. Line-flux sensitivities are 30 percent lower at fixed exposure time, matching the expected increase in background noise, but the gain in survey speed is 5x in our setup, more than justifying the penalty. The measured line sensitivity exceeds NIRCam WFSS by a minimum factor of ~5 (i.e. ~25 in exposure time) at $\lambda$~4 $\mu$m, demonstrating that controlled overlap is a compelling method to gain deep, wide-band spectra for large samples. Crucially, we envisage the MSA could deliver even higher target allocation densities than what used here. We derive Balmer-line based SFRs, gas-phase metallicities (including a large sample suitable for strong-line calibrations), and identify rare sources (mini-quenched systems and broad-line AGN). This approach is immediately applicable wherever deep imaging enables robust pre-selection and astrometry, providing an efficient method to obtain large samples of faint emission-line galaxies, a compelling middle ground between the completeness of slitless surveys and the sensitivity and bandwidth of NIRSpec/MSA.</description>

      <title>From Primordial Stars to Early Galaxies: A Semi-Analytic Model Calibrated with Aeos and Renaissance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of our semi-analytic model that follows the formation of Population III stars and their metal-enriched descendants, incorporating dark matter halo merger trees from cosmological $N$-body simulations and feedback from reionization. Our extended model is calibrated using two complementary cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: Aeos, which resolves individual Population III and II stars to $z\sim14.6$, and Renaissance, which is lower resolution but follows large-scale metal-enriched star formation to $z \sim 11$. With a combined calibration, we capture small-scale physics of primordial star formation over a large range in halo mass. We find good agreement between our calibrated model and Aeos, reproducing the evolution in number of star-forming halos and total stellar mass. Achieving this agreement requires increasing the normalization of, flattening the redshift dependence of, and adding scatter to the commonly used critical mass threshold $M_{\mathrm{crit}}$. Our treatment of the delay between Pop III stellar death and subsequent Pop II star formation emphasizes the need to account for halos that have yet to transition to Pop II, since incomplete sampling of this delay in simulations limits physically motivated calibrations. Finally, we apply our model to larger-volume dark matter only simulations and predict $\sim10$ active Pop III sources at $z = 10$ lie within the area strongly lensed by galaxy cluster MACS J0416 with a magnification exceeding $\mu &gt; 30$. These results demonstrate that semi-analytic approaches, when calibrated to hydrodynamical simulations, can provide accurate, computationally efficient predictions for the earliest stages of cosmic star formation.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Faint Milky Way Satellites Discovered in Carina, Phoenix, and Telescopium with DELVE Data Release 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of three Milky Way satellite candidates: Carina IV, Phoenix III, and DELVE 7, in the third data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE). The candidate systems were identified by cross-matching results from two independent search algorithms. All three are extremely faint systems composed of old, metal-poor stellar populations ($\tau \gtrsim 10$ Gyr, [Fe/H] $ \lesssim -1.4$). Carina IV ($M_V = -2.8;\ r_{1/2} = 40 {\rm pc}$) and Phoenix III ($M_V = -1.2;\ r_{1/2} = 19 {\rm pc}$) have half-light radii that are consistent with the known population of dwarf galaxies, while DELVE 7 ($M_V = 1.2;\ r_{1/2} = 2 {\rm pc}$) is very compact and seems more likely to be a star cluster, though its nature remains ambiguous without spectroscopic followup. The Gaia proper motions of stars in Carina IV ($M_* = 2250^{+1180}_{-830} {\rm M_\odot}$) indicate that it is unlikely to be associated with the LMC, while DECam CaHK photometry confirms that its member stars are metal-poor. Phoenix III ($M_* = 520^{+660}_{-290} {\rm M_\odot}$) is the faintest known satellite in the extreme outer stellar halo ($D_{\rm GC} &gt; 100$ kpc), while DELVE 7 ($M_* = 60^{+120}_{-40} {\rm M_\odot}$) is the faintest known satellite with $D_{\rm GC} &gt; 20$ kpc.</description>

      <title>The Sunburst Arc with JWST. IV. The importance of interaction, turbulence, and feedback for Lyman-continuum escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At present, the best opportunity for detailed Lyman Continuum escape studies is in gravitationally lensed galaxies at z &gt;= 2. Only one such galaxy currently exists in the literature with sufficient spatial magnification: The Sunburst Arc at redshift z = 2.37. Here, we present rest-frame optical JWST NIRSpec integral field observations of the Sunburst Arc that cover a large fraction of the source plane. From this dataset, we generate precise maps of ISM kinematics, dust geometry, ionization, and chemical enrichment. We find that the galaxy rotates but also shows strong, possibly dominant, signatures of turbulence, which are indicative of recent or ongoing major interaction. The cluster that leaks ionizing photons shows little variation in kinematics or dust coverage, but dramatically elevated ionization, indicating that photoionization is the predominant mechanism that creates paths for LyC escape. We conjecture that tidal stripping of H I gas due to an interaction could have removed a large portion of the neutral ISM around the LyC emitting cluster, making it easier for the cluster to completely ionize the rest.</description>

      <title>The effect of a short mean free path on HII regions and 21-cm tomography during reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the mean free path (MFP) of ionizing photons at $z=6$ find that it is significantly shorter than extrapolations from lower $z$. This has a substantial impact on the topology of reionization and thus the prospects of tomography of the 21-cm signal from upcoming radio interferometers. In this work we develop the first analytic model of reionization which explicitly incorporates the MFP as a free parameter, allowing us to transparently explore its effect on the process. Our model is based on the excursion set formalism with an ionization condition which accounts for absorptions parameterized through the MFP. With the goal of observational comparison, we include additional modifications which make our model particularly suitable for predicting one-point statistics of the ionization field (and 21-cm signal), which are among the fundamental quantities for tomography. We find that the effect of the MFP is much more significant during the later stages of reionization, and that including a shorter MFP reduces the size of HII regions by around an order of magnitude towards the end of reionization compared with analytic models which do not account for the MFP. We find that the reported MFP value produces a contrast in the 21-cm signal of $\mathcal{O}$(1 mK) or less at resolutions $\theta \sim $ 15--35 arcmin, an order of magnitude below naive estimates and up to a factor of several smaller than when using a larger MFP value extrapolated from low $z$, requiring significantly more sensitivity for imaging. We compare the contrast to noise estimates for arrays similar in size to HERA and SKA-Low and find that SKA has sufficient sensitivity for direct imaging (at the largest scales considered), while the predicted signal will be challenging for arrays similar in size to HERA. Our model indicates that more detailed sensitivity estimates are warranted in the context of a short MFP.</description>

      <title>Time-Dilation Methods for Extreme Multiscale Timestepping Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical simulations involve extreme dynamic range of timescales around 'special points' in the domain (e.g. black holes, stars, planets, disks, galaxies, shocks, mixing interfaces), where processes on small scales couple strongly to those on large scales. Adaptive resolution, multi-physics, and hybrid numerical methods have enabled tremendous progress on the spatial, physics, and numerical challenges involved. But often the limiter for following the long timescales of global evolution is the extremely short numerical timestep required in some subdomains (which leads to their dominating simulation costs). Recently several approaches have been developed for tackling this in problems where the short timescale solution is sampled and then projected as an effective subgrid model over longer timescales (e.g. 'zooming in and out'). We generalize these to a family of models where time evolution is modulated by a variable but continuous in space-and-time dilation/stretch factor $a({\bf x},\,t)$. This extends previous well-studied approaches (including reduced-speed-of-light and binary orbital dynamics methods), and ensures that the system comes to correct local steady-state solutions, and derive criteria that the dilation factor/timesteps/resolution must obey to ensure good behavior. We present a variety of generalizations to different physics or coupling scales. Compared to previous approaches, this method makes it possible to avoid imprinting arbitrary scales where there is no clear scale-separation, and couples well to Lagrangian or Eulerian methods. It is flexible and easily-implemented and we demonstrate its validity (and limitations) in test problems. We discuss the relationship between these methods and physical time dilation in GRMHD. We demonstrate how this can be used to obtain effective speedup factors exceeding $\gtrsim 10^{4}$ in multiphysics simulations.</description>

      <title>PAH Spectral Diversity in NGC 7027 and the Evolution of Aromatic Carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) constitute a significant fraction of the Universe's carbon budget, playing a key role in the cosmic carbon cycle and dominating the mid-infrared spectra of astrophysical environments in which they reside. Although PAHs are known to form in the circumstellar envelopes of post-AGB stars, their formation and evolution are still not well-understood. We aim to understand how pristine complex hydrocarbons and PAHs in circumstellar environments transition to the PAHs observed in the ISM. The mid-infrared PAH spectra (5-18 micron) of the planetary nebula, NGC 7027, are investigated using spectral cubes from JWST MIRI-MRS. We report the first detection of spatially-resolved variations of the PAH spectral profiles across class A, AB, and B in all major PAH bands (6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2 micron) within a single source, NGC 7027. These variations are linked to morphological structures within NGC 7027. Clear correlations are revealed between the 6.2, 7.7, and 8.6 micron features, where the red components (6.26, 7.8, 8.65 micron) exhibit a strong correlation and the same is found for the blue components of the 6.2 and 7.7 (6.205 and 7.6 micron). The blue component of the 8.6 (8.56 micron) appears to be independent of the other components. We link this behaviour to differences in molecular structure of their PAH subpopulations. Decomposition of the 11.2 micron band confirms two previously identified components, with the broader 11.25 micron component attributed to emission from very small grains of PAH clusters rather than PAH emission. We show that PAH profile classes generally vary with proximity to the central star's UV radiation field, suggesting class B PAHs represent more processed species while class A PAHs remain relatively pristine, challenging current notions on the spectral evolution of PAHs.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of non-singular black holes at finite size: a ray tracing approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational microlensing of various static and spherically symmetric non-singular black holes (and horizonless, non-singular compact objects of similar size). For pointlike sources we extend the parametrized post-Newtonian lensing framework to fourth order, whereas for extended sources we develop a ray tracing approach via a simple radiative transfer model. Modelling non-relativistic proper motion of the lens in front of a background star we record the apparent brightness as a function of time, resulting in a photometric lightcurve. Taking the star radius to smaller values, our numerical results approach the theoretical predictions for point-like sources. Compared to the Schwarzschild metric in an otherwise unmodified lensing geometry, we find that non-singular black hole models (and their horizonless, non-singular counterparts) at finite size tend to feature larger magnifications in microlensing lightcurves, contrary to the point-source prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has generated diverse perspectives in astronomy, with ongoing discussions between proponents and skeptics motivating this review. We examine how neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data analytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities through encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential equations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond training data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in billions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and expensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain knowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding models toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods offer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural architectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data efficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network structure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based inference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian distributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level cosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale neural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning effective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance large-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. - Emerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation models learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for research automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical applications.</description>

      <title>Selecting Clusters and Protoclusters via Stellar Mass Density: I. Method and tests on Mock HSC-SSP catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm designed to identify galaxy (proto)clusters in wide-area photometric surveys by first selecting their dominant galaxy-i.e., the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) or protoBCG-through the local stellar mass density traced by massive galaxies. We focus on its application to the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) Wide Survey to detect candidates up to $\rm z \sim 2$. In this work, we apply the method to mock galaxy catalogs that replicate the observational constraints of the HSC-SSP Wide Survey. We derive functions that describe the probability of a massive galaxy being the dominant galaxy in a structure as a function of its stellar mass density contrast within a given redshift interval. We show that galaxies with probabilities greater than 50\% yield a sample of BCGs/protoBCGs with $\gtrsim 65\%$ purity, where most of the contamination arises from galaxies in massive groups below our cluster threshold. Using the same threshold, the resulting (proto)cluster sample achieves 80\% purity and 50\% completeness for halos with $M_{\rm{halo}} \geq 10^{14} \ M_{\odot}$, reaching nearly 100\% completeness for $M_{\rm{halo}} \geq 10^{14.5} \ M_{\odot}$. We also assign probabilistic membership to surrounding galaxies based on stellar mass and distance to the dominant galaxy, from which we define the cluster richness as the number of galaxies more likely to be true members than contaminants. This allows us to derive a halo mass-richness relation. In a companion paper, we apply the algorithm to the HSC-SSP data and compare our catalog with others based on different cluster-finding techniques and X-ray detections.</description>

      <title>Selecting Clusters and Protoclusters via Stellar Mass Density: II. Application to HSC-SSP Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a selection of candidates of clusters and protoclusters of galaxies identified in the photometric data of the HSC-SSP Wide Public Data Release 3 (PDR3), spanning the redshift range $\rm 0.1 \leq z \leq 2$. The selection method, detailed in Vicentin et al. (2025), involves detecting massive galaxies located in high-density regions of matter, identified as potential central dominant galaxies, i.e., (proto)BCGs. Probabilistic criteria based on proximity to the candidate central galaxy and the expected stellar mass of member galaxies are applied to identify likely members of each structure. We produced updated photometric redshift estimates using deep learning methods trained on a dataset combining spectroscopic redshifts from the HSC-SSP Wide PDR3, high-accuracy photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog, and mid-infrared data from the unWISE catalog for matched sources. Our method achieves a predicted purity of $\sim 90\%$ in detecting (proto)clusters, with $\gtrsim 65\%$ correctly identifying the (proto)BCG. A total of 16,007 candidate (proto)clusters were identified over an effective area of $\rm \sim 850 \ deg^{2}$ within the HSC-SSP Wide footprint. Comparisons with other existing catalogs reveal a good level of consistency, while also highlighting that different methods yield complementary discoveries. We further compare richness and halo masses from our optical catalog with those from recent X-ray cluster catalogs (eROSITA and MCXC-II), finding a moderate positive correlation and a scatter of $\rm \sim 0.4$ dex. This catalog provides a valuable new set of targets for the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) instrument.</description>

      <title>Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey (WAVES): Selection of targets for the Wide survey using decision-tree classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wide-Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey (WAVES) on the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) includes two flux-limited subsurveys with very high (95\%) completeness requirements: Wide over $\sim\!1200$ deg$^2$ and Deep over $\sim\!65$ deg$^2$. Both are $Z$-band selected, respectively as $Z&lt;21.1$ and $Z&lt;21.25$ mag, and additionally redshift-limited, while the true redshifts are not known a priori but will be only measured by 4MOST. Here, we present a classification-based method to select the targets for WAVES-Wide. Rather than estimating individual redshifts for the input photometric objects, we assign probabilities of them being below $z=0.2$, the redshift limit of the subsurvey. This is done with the supervised machine learning approach of eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), trained on a comprehensive spectroscopic sample overlapping with WAVES fields. Our feature space is composed of nine VST+VISTA magnitudes from $u$ to $K_s$ and all the possible colors, but most relevant for the classification are the $g$-band and the $u-g$, $g-r$ and $J-K_s$ colors. We check the performance of our classifier both for the fiducial WAVES-Wide limits, as well as for a range of neighboring redshift and magnitude thresholds, consistently finding purity and completeness at the level of 94-95\%. We note, however, that this performance deteriorates for sources close to the selection limits, due to deficiencies of the current spectroscopic training sample and the decreasing signal-to-noise of the photometry. We apply the classifier trained on the full spectroscopic sample to 14 million photometric galaxies from the WAVES input catalog, which have all 9 bands measured. Our work demonstrates that a machine-learning classifier could be used to select a flux- and redshift-limited sample from deep photometric data.</description>

Abstract: The rapid growth of large-scale radio surveys, generating over 100 petabytes of data annually, has created a pressing need for automated data analysis methods. Recent research has explored the application of machine learning techniques to address the challenges associated with detecting and classifying radio galaxies, as well as discovering peculiar radio sources. This paper provides an overview of our investigations with the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, detailing the methodologies employed-including supervised, unsupervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised learning approaches -- and their implications for ongoing and future radio astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>Islands in Simulated Cosmos: Probing the Hubble Flow around Groups and Clusters</title>

Abstract: The local Hubble flow offers a powerful laboratory to study the interplay between cosmic expansion and gravitational dynamics. On large scales, galaxy velocities follow Hubble's law, but within groups and clusters local gravitational effects introduce significant departures from linearity. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we investigate whether dark energy leaves detectable imprints on the local velocity-radius relation. We model the kinematics with extensions of the Lemaitre-Tolman framework and apply Bayesian inference to recover halo masses and the Hubble constant H0. The fits reveal systematic biases: halo masses are underestimated with a median ratio $M_{fit}/M_{true} = 0.95 \pm 0.28$, while the inferred Hubble constant clusters around $H_0 = 64 \pm 16 km/s/Mpc$, compared to the simulation input of 67.74. This corresponds to an average 25\% uncertainty in H0 recovery from the local flow method. While the mass and expansion rate can be constrained, different model variants whether including angular momentum, friction, or altered radial scaling-remain statistically indistinguishable. Our results highlight both the promise and the limitations of using local kinematics as a precision probe of dark energy.</description>

Abstract: We summarize the properties and initial data release of the JADES Origins Field (JOF), the longest single pointing yet imaged with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This field falls within the GOODS-S region about 8' south-west of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), where it was formed initially in Cycle 1 as a parallel field of HUDF spectroscopic observations within the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). This imaging was greatly extended in Cycle 2 program 3215, which observed the JOF for 5 days in six medium-band filters, seeking robust candidates for z&gt;15 galaxies. This program also includes ultra-deep parallel NIRSpec spectroscopy (up to 91 hours on-source, summing over the dispersion modes) on the HUDF. Cycle 3 observations from program 4540 added 20 hours of NIRCam slitless spectroscopy and F070W imaging to the JOF. With these three campaigns, the JOF was observed for 380 open-shutter hours with NIRCam using 15 imaging filters and 2 grism bandpasses. Further, parts of the JOF have deep 43 hr MIRI observations in F770W. Taken together, the JOF is one of the most compelling deep fields available with JWST and a powerful window into the early Universe. This paper presents the second data release from JADES, featuring the imaging and catalogs from the year 1 JOF observations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Cosmic Gems Arc at $z\sim10$ with JWST NIRCam</title>

Abstract: We present recent JWST NIRCam imaging observations of SPT0615-JD (also known as the Cosmic Gems Arc), lensed by the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0615-5746. The 5 arcsec long arc is the most highly magnified $z&gt;10$ galaxy known. It straddles the lensing critical curve and reveals five star clusters with radii of $\sim 1$ pc or less. We measure the full arc to have F200W 24.5 AB mag, consisting of two mirror images, each 25.3 AB mag with a median magnification of $\mu \sim 60^{+17}_{-8}$ (delensed 29.7 AB mag, $M_{UV} = -17.8$). The galaxy has an extremely strong Lyman break F115W$-$F200W $&gt;3.2$ mag ($2\sigma$ lower limit), is undetected in all bluer filters ($&lt; 2\sigma$), and has a very blue continuum slope redward of the break ($\beta = -2.7 \pm 0.1$). This results in a photometric redshift $z_{phot} = 10.2 \pm 0.2$ (95% confidence) with no significant likelihood below $z&lt;9.8$. Based on spectral energy distribution fitting to the total photometry, we estimate an intrinsic stellar mass of $M_{*} \sim 2.4 - 5.6 \times 10^{7} M_{\odot}$, young mass-weighted age of $\sim 21 - 79$ Myr, low dust content ($A_V &lt; 0.15$), and a low metallicity of $\lesssim 1\%~Z_{\odot}$. We identify a fainter third counterimage candidate within 2.2 arcsec of the predicted position, lensed to AB mag 28.4 and magnified by $\mu \sim 2$, suggesting the fold arc may only show $\sim 60$% of the galaxy. SPT0615-JD is a unique laboratory to study star clusters observed within a galaxy just 460 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>The impact of supernova feedback on metallicity-gradient evolution in cosmological simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tracing the cosmic path of galaxies requires an understanding of their chemical enrichment and merging histories. One of the most important constraints is the internal structure of galaxies, notably the internal distribution of elements acting as fossils in extra-galactic archaeology. Using our cosmological chemodynamical simulations, which include all relevant physical processes and the latest nucleosynthesis yields, we investigate the evolution of radial metallicity gradients of stellar populations and the interstellar medium within each galaxy. This work explores the role of supernova feedback on the metallicity gradients by comparing three feedback models, ejecting energy in thermal, stochastic and mechanical forms. At $z=0$, the mechanical feedback model produces the gradient--mass relations of stars and gas both in excellent agreement with observations; gradients are the steepest at intermediate-mass ($M_*\sim10^{10}M_\odot$) and become flatter in massive galaxies probably by major mergers. For each model, we predict similar gradient--mass relations up to $z=4$ and find that the mechanical feedback model gives flatter gradients of both stars and gas for lower-mass galaxies ($M_*&lt;10^{10}M_\odot$) possibly due to the suppression of star formation and metal ejection by stellar feedback. With all feedback models, most galaxies have negative gas-phase metallicity gradients up to $z=5$, suggesting an inside-out growth, which is consistent with other cosmological simulations but not with recent observations at $z\sim1$--2.5. We find a mild redshift evolution of gradients up to $z=4$, while there seems to be an evolutionary transition at $z=5$ where the metallicity gradients become steep for gas and stars. These should be investigated with higher-resolution simulations and observations.</description>

      <title>Grain alignment and dust evolution physics with polarisation (GRADE-POL). I. Dust polarisation modelling for isolated starless cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarisation of light induced by aligned interstellar dust serves as a significant tool in investigating cosmic magnetic fields, dust properties, and poses a challenge in characterising the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background and other sources. To establish dust polarisation as a reliable tool, the physics of the grain alignment process needs to be studied thoroughly. The Magnetically enhanced Radiative Torque (MRAT) alignment is the only mechanism that can induce highly efficient alignment of grains with magnetic fields required by polarisation observations of the diffuse interstellar medium. Our numerical modelling of dust polarisation using the MRAT theory demonstrated that the alignment efficiency of starlight polarisation ($p_{\rm ext}/A_{\rm V}$) and the degree of thermal dust polarisation ($p_{\rm em}$) first decrease slowly with increasing visual extinction ($A_{\rm V}$) and then falls steeply as $\propto A^{-1}_{\rm V}$ at large $A_{\rm V}$ due to the loss of grain alignment, which explains the phenomenon known as polarisation holes. Visual extinction at the transition from shallow to steep slope ($A^{\rm loss}_{\rm V}$) increases with the maximum grain size. By applying physical profiles suitable for a starless core 109 in the Pipe Nebula (Pipe-109), our model successfully reproduces the existing observations of starlight polarisation at R-band ($0.65\,\mu$m) and H-band ($1.65\,\mu$m), as well as emission polarisation at submillimetre ($870\,\mu$m). Successful modelling of observational data requires perfect alignment of large grains as evidence of the MRAT mechanism, and larger maximum size with higher elongation at higher $A_{\rm V}$. The latter reveals the first evidence for the new model of anisotropic grain growth induced by magnetic grain alignment.</description>

      <title>Central densities of dark matter halos in FIRE-2 simulations of low-mass galaxies with cold dark matter and self-interacting dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the central density structure of dark matter halos in cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models using simulations that are part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. For simulated halos of dwarf galaxy scale ($M_{\rm halo}(z=0)\approx 10^{10}\,M_\odot$), we study the central structure in both dissipationless simulations and simulations with full FIRE-2 galaxy formation physics. As has been demonstrated extensively in recent years, both baryonic feedback and self-interactions can convert central cusps into cores, with the former process doing so in a manner that depends sensitively on stellar mass at fixed $M_{\rm halo}$. Whether the two processes (baryonic feedback and self-interactions) are distinguishable, however, remains an open question. Here we demonstrate that, compared to feedback-induced cores, SIDM-induced cores transition more quickly from the central region of constant density to the falling density at larger radial scales. This result holds true even when including identical galaxy formation modeling in SIDM simulations as is used in CDM simulations, since self-interactions dominate over galaxy formation physics in establishing the central structure of SIDM halos in this mass regime. The change in density profile slope as a function of radius therefore holds the potential to discriminate between self-interactions and galaxy formation physics as the driver of core formation in dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Impulsive mixing of stellar populations in dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the response of mono-energetic stellar populations with initially isotropic kinematics to impulsive and adiabatic changes to an underlying dark matter potential. Half-light radii expand and velocity dispersions decrease as enclosed dark matter is removed. The details of this expansion and cooling depend on the time scale on which the underlying potential changes. In the adiabatic regime, the product of half-light radius and average velocity dispersion is conserved. We show that the stellar populations maintain centrally isotropic kinematics throughout their adiabatic evolution, and their densities can be approximated by a family of analytical radial profiles. Metallicity gradients within the galaxy flatten as dark matter is slowly removed. In the case of strong impulsive perturbations, stellar populations develop power-law-like density tails with radially biased kinematics. We show that the distribution of stellar binding energies within the dark matter halo substantially widens after an impulsive perturbation, no matter the sign of the perturbation. This allows initially energetically separated stellar populations to mix, to the extent that previously chemo-dynamically distinct populations may masquerade as a single population with large metallicity and energy spread. Finally, we show that in response to an impulsive perturbation, stellar populations that are deeply embedded in cored dark matter halos undergo a series of damped oscillations before reaching a virialised equilibrium state, driven by inefficient phase mixing in the harmonic potentials of cored halos. This slow return to equilibrium adds substantial systematic uncertainty to dynamical masses estimated from Jeans modeling or the virial theorem.</description>

      <title>The role of turbulence in setting the phase of the ISM and implications for the star formation rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the link between star formation, turbulence and the thermal state of the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM). We analyse a suite of stratified box simulations modelling a realistic ISM that aims to probe environments similar to those found in the Milky Way. Turbulence is injected through stellar feedback and an external large-scale driving force. We find that star formation can be either boosted or reduced when increasing the external driving strength, depending on the environment. When the density is sufficiently high, warm neutral gas naturally transitions to the cold phase, leading to high cold neutral medium (CNM) fractions of around 40\%. Under these conditions, excessive large-scale driving leads to a slight reduction of the CNM fraction and an increase in the amount of gas that is thermally unstable. What limits the star formation in this regime is a reduced fraction of dense gas due to additional turbulent support against collapse. For low density regions, overdensities in which cooling is efficient are much rarer and we find that star formation is regulated by the formation of cold gas. In such cases, turbulence can significantly boost star formation by compressing gas in shocks and increasing the CNM fraction dramatically. In our simulations we see an increase from almost no CNM to up to a fraction of 15 \% when including external turbulence driving; leading to an associated increase in the star formation rate. We provide a model to quantify this behaviour and predict the CNM fraction by combining the standard ISM cooling/heating model with the density PDF generated by turbulence. The change in the dominant limiting process for star formation between low- and intermediate-density environments provides a natural explanation for the observed break in the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation around column densities of 9\,\Msun\, pc$^{-2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the survey design and initial results from the Parallel Ionizing Emissivity (PIE) survey. PIE is a large HST survey designed to detect Lyman continuum (LyC) emitting galaxies at 3.1$&lt;$ z $&lt;$3.5 and stack their images in order to measure average LyC escape fractions as a function of galaxy properties. PIE has imaged 37 independent fields in three filters (F336W, F625W and F814W), of which 18 are observed with a fourth band (F475W) from the accompanying PIE+ program. We use photometric colors to select candidate Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at 3.1$&lt;$ z $&lt;$3.5, which can be followed up using ground-based spectrographs to confirm their redshifts. Unlike previous surveys, we use many independent fields to remove biases caused by correlated absorption in the IGM. In this paper, we describe the survey design, photometric measurements, and the use of mock galaxy samples to optimize our color selection. With 3 filters, we can select a galaxy sample of which $\approx$90\% are LBGs and over 30\% lie in the 3.1$&lt;$ z $&lt;$3.5 range for which we can detect uncontaminated LyC emission in F336W. We also use mock IGM sightlines to measure the expected transmission of the IGM, which will allow us to determine escape fractions from our stacked galaxies. We color-select $\approx$1400 galaxies, and predict that this includes $\approx$80 LyC-emitting galaxies and $\approx$500 that we can use in stacking. Finally, we present the Keck/LRIS spectrum of a galaxy at z $\approx$ 2.99, demonstrating that we can confirm the redshifts of z $\sim$ 3 galaxies from the ground.</description>

      <title>An Observed Evidence for the Primordial Origin of Galaxy Sizes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an observational evidence supporting the scenario that the protogalactic angular momenta play an important role in molding the optical sizes of present galaxies. Analyzing the NASA-Sloan Atlas catalog in the redshift range of $0.02\le z&lt;0.09$, we observationally determine the probability density distributions, $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$, where $r_{50}$ and $r_{90}$ denote the galaxy sizes enclosing $50\%$ and $90\%$ of their $r$-band luminosities, respectively. Both of the distributions are found to be well described by a bimodal Gamma mixture model, which is consistent with the recent numerical results. Classifying the local galaxies by their ratios, $r_{50}/r_{90}$, we also show that for the case of late-type galaxies with $r_{50}/r_{90}\ge 0.45$ both of $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$ exhibit no bimodal feature, following a unimodal Gamma model. Assuming the existence of a linear causal correlation between $\{r_{50},r_{90}\}$ of the late-type galaxies and the primordial spin factor, $\tau$, defined as the degree of misalignments between the initial tidal and protogalaxy inertia tensors, we reconstruct the probability density distributions, $p(\tau)$, directly from the observationally determined $p(r_{50})$ and $p(r_{90})$ of the late-type galaxies. It is shown that the reconstructed $p(\tau)$ is in an excellent agreement with the real distribution of $\tau$ that was determined at the protogalactic stages by numerical experiments. A critical implication of our result on reconstructing the initial conditions from observable galaxy sizes is discussed.</description>

      <title>Investigations of MWISP Clumps: 13CO Clump Source Catalog and Physical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive catalogs of $^{13}$CO clumps from the Milky Way Imaging Scroll Painting (MWISP) project. By developing an equivalent global detection scheme integrated with the FacetClumps algorithm, we successfully extract 71,661 molecular clumps across a high-resolution $^{13}$CO data cube spanning 2310 deg$^2$ from the MWISP Phase I survey. To determine accurate distances, we design an automatic hierarchical distance decision method using signal regions as fundamental objects, effectively resolving the kinematic distance ambiguity problem and obtaining reliable measurements for 97.94% of the sample. Statistical analysis reveals that 65.3% of clumps are gravitationally bound, accounting for approximately 96.3% of the statistical total mass. Scaling relation analysis across multiple surveys reveals universal power-law behaviors in clump populations. Maser-associated clumps exhibit modified parameter distributions and scaling relations, revealing how active star formation alters clump dynamics and structure. These extensive catalogs establish a foundation for investigating molecular clump properties, star formation processes, and Galactic evolution.</description>

      <title>Metallicity of the double Red Clump in the Milky Way Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a reanalysis of the metallicity of the double red clump (RC) stars from the Milky Way bulge. Two leading explanations for the existence of the double RC concern possible differences in chemical composition (multiple populations of stars) or distance (X-shaped bulge). We aim to verify the chemical composition hypothesis by determining the mean metallicity of each RC. We use infrared photometric data and metallicities from a previous study (that are based on the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System spectra). In contrast with previous studies, we assign stars to RCs or the red giant branch using a Bayesian approach. Our resulting difference between mean metallicity of the two RCs equals: $0.23^{+0.19}_{-0.24}$ or $0.28^{+0.17}_{-0.18}~\mathrm{dex}$, if the red giant branch bump is included or not, respectively. Because of the high statistical error, the result does not confirm the multiple populations hypothesis.</description>

      <title>The Draco Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy in the First Year of DESI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spatial distribution, kinematics, and metallicity of stars in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We identify 155 high probability members of Draco using line of sight velocity and metallicity information derived from DESI spectroscopy along with {\it Gaia} DR3 proper motions. We find a mean line of sight velocity of $ -290.62\pm0.80$ km s$^{-1}$ with dispersion = $9.57^{+0.66}_{-0.62}$ km s$^{-1}$ and mean metallicity $\rm{[Fe/H]}$ = $-2.10\pm0.04$, consistent with previous results. We also find that Draco has a steep metallicity gradient within the half-light radius, and a metallicity gradient that flattens beyond the half-light radius. We identify eight high probability members outside the King tidal radius, four of which we identify for the first time. These extra-tidal stars are not preferentially aligned along the orbit of Draco. We compute an average surface brightness of 34.02 mag $\rm arcsec^{-2}$ within an elliptical annulus from the King tidal radius of 48.1 arcmin to 81 arcmin.</description>

      <title>Matching JWST UV Luminosity Functions with Refined $\Lambda$CDM Halo Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of unexpectedly massive and luminous galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$, posing a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm. In this work, we address the tension between early JWST observations of luminous high-redshift galaxies and predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by revisiting the physics of dark matter halo formation. Employing refined halo mass functions derived by Del Popolo \textit{et al.} (DP1 and DP2) that incorporate angular momentum, dynamical friction, and redshift-dependent collapse barriers, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the abundance of massive halos at $z \gtrsim 7$ compared to the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) formalism. Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity, we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from $z = 7$ to $14$ with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model requires implausibly high efficiencies. Our results suggest that the JWST overabundance problem stems not from new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, but from oversimplified treatments of gravitational collapse, highlighting the critical role of small-scale dissipative dynamics in early structure formation.</description>

      <title>Searching for Free-Floating Planets with TESS: Results from Sectors 61-65</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though free-floating planets (FFPs) may outpopulate their bound counterparts in the terrestrial-mass range, they remain one of the least explored exoplanet demographics. Due to their negligible electromagnetic emission at all wavelengths, the only observational technique able to detect these worlds is gravitational microlensing. Microlensing by terrestrial-mass FFPs induces rare, short-duration magnifications of background stars, requiring high-cadence, wide-field surveys to detect these events. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), though designed to detect close-bound exoplanets via transits, boasts a Full-Frame Image cadence as short as 200 seconds and has monitored hundreds of millions of stars, providing a unique dataset in which to search for rare short-duration transients. We have performed a preliminary search for FFP microlensing in 7.5 million light curves from TESS Sectors 61 - 65. We find one short-duration event with a light curve morphology consistent with expectations for a low-mass FFP, but in tension with the expected FFP abundance in this mass range. We consider possible false positive interpretations of this event such as stellar flares, hearbeat binaries, and centrifugal breakout. We find that all interpretations pose some challenges, and discuss the possibility that the event may constitute a first example of a new class of pernicious false positives that future space-based microlensing efforts will encounter. Our ongoing search through the TESS dataset will significantly support the upcoming hunt for rogue worlds with dedicated space-based microlensing surveys, and our results may be used alongside these surveys to place interesting constraints on the spatial distribution of FFPs in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): a spectroscopic VLT monitoring survey of massive stars in the SMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14593v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surveys in the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud revealed that the majority of massive stars will interact with companions during their lives. However, knowledge of the binary properties of massive stars at low metallicity, which approaches the conditions of the Early Universe, remains sparse. We present the Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) campaign - an ESO large programme designed to obtain 25 epochs of spectroscopy for 929 massive stars in the SMC - the lowest metallicity conditions in which multiplicity is probed to date (Z = 0.2 Zsun). BLOeM will provide (i) the binary fraction, (ii) the orbital configurations of systems with periods P &lt; 3 yr, (iii) dormant OB+BH binaries, and (iv) a legacy database of physical parameters of massive stars at low metallicity.
  The stars are observed with the LR02 setup of the giraffe instrument of the Very Large Telescope (3960-4570A, resolving power R=6200; typical signal-to-noise ratio S/N=70-100). This paper utilises the first 9 epochs obtained over a three-month time. We describe the survey and data reduction, perform a spectral classification of the stacked spectra, and construct a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the sample via spectral-type and photometric calibrations. The sample covers spectral types from O4 to F5, spanning the effective temperature and luminosity ranges 6.5&lt;Teff/kK&lt;45 and 3.7&lt;log L/Lsun&lt;6.1 and initial masses 8&lt;Mini/Msun&lt;80. It comprises 159 O-type stars, 331 early B-type (B0-3) dwarfs and giants (luminosity classes V-III), 303 early B-type supergiants (II-I), and 136 late-type supergiants. At least 82 stars are Oe/Be stars: 20 O-type and 62 B-type (13% and 11% of the respective samples). In addition, it includes 4 high-mass X-ray binaries, 3 stars resembling luminous blue variables, 2 bloated stripped-star candidates, 2 candidate magnetic stars, and 74 eclipsing binaries.</description>

      <title>A new sample of massive B-type contact binary candidates from the OGLE survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive contact binaries (CBs) are key to understanding close-binary evolution and stellar mergers, yet their study has been limited by the scarcity of observed systems, particularly of B-type binaries expected to dominate this class. We bridge this gap by mining a large sample of massive CB candidates from the OGLE-IV database, increasing their known numbers in the Magellanic Clouds by nearly an order of magnitude. Using main-sequence colour-magnitude limits, an observationally informed period-luminosity-colour relation for CBs, and a high morph-parameter cut ($c\geq0.7$), we identified 68 O- and B-type binaries that exhibit smooth, sinusoidal light curves with nearly equal eclipse depths. We then isolated a bona fide sample of 37 CB candidates (28 in the LMC and 9 in the SMC) that match theoretical colour-magnitude and period distributions derived from an extensive grid of MESA binary models. The bona fide sample, dominated by B-type systems with $P\approx0.6-1$ d, agrees with the predicted population and may contain many $q\approx1$ binaries, as expected from models showing mass equalization preceding temperature equalization during nuclear-timescale contact. Synthetic PHOEBE light curves of contact and near-contact phases of MESA models reveal a degeneracy between these configurations, suggesting possible misidentifications among these systems. Spectroscopic follow-up is required to test these predictions and refine the evolutionary framework of massive CBs.</description>

      <title>A Time-Dependent Solution for GSN 069 Disk Evolution and the Nature of Long-Lived Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of a fully \textit{time-dependent} relativistic disk model-based on the light curve fitting package FitTeD-into the X-ray spectral fitting environment, pyXspec. This implementation enables simultaneous fitting of multi-epoch and multi-wavelength spectral data, where the only free parameters are those describing the black hole and the initial conditions, while the subsequent evolution is governed by the dynamical equations of an evolving accretion flow. We use it fit seven epochs of X-ray spectra and two epochs of UV spectra of the 'long-lived' tidal disruption event (TDE) and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069, from 2010 through late-2019. Our results show that such 'long-lived', X-ray-bright TDEs-of which GSN 069 is a prime, but not unique, example-can naturally be explained within the same framework as events with shorter-lived X-ray emission, like ASASSN-14li and AT2019dsg. Their distinction lies in the `viscous' timescale parameter-tied to the disk's angular momentum transport efficiency-which should be treated as a free parameter when modeling the disk evolution of transient events. We examine the implications for QPE models by tracking the time evolution of disk properties such as mass surface density and accretion rate. We argue that existing QPE models may not be able to reproduce the observed connection between the presence (2018) or absence (2014) of eruptions and the disk properties. In the context of orbiter-disk collision models, the change in mass surface density appears insufficient to explain the needed variation in the eruption's temperature. The absence of eruptions in GSN 069 in 2014 remains a challenge for QPE models.</description>

      <title>Prospects for dark matter observations in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) orbiting the Milky Way are widely regarded as systems supported by velocity dispersion against self-gravity, and as prime targets for the search for indirect dark matter (DM) signatures in the GeV-to-TeV $\gamma$-ray range owing to their lack of astrophysical $\gamma$-ray background. We present forecasts of the sensitivity of the forthcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to annihilating or decaying DM signals in these targets. An original selection of candidates is performed from the current catalogue of known objects, including both classical and ultra-faint dSphs. For each, the expected DM content is derived using the most comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic data available, within a consistent framework of analysis. This approach enables the derivation of novel astrophysical factor profiles for indirect DM searches, which are compared with results from the literature. From an initial sample of 64 dSphs, eight promising targets are identified -- Draco I, Coma Berenices, Ursa Major II, Ursa Minor and Willman 1 in the North, Reticulum II, Sculptor and Sagittarius II in the South -- for which different DM density models yield consistent expectations, leading to robust predictions. CTAO is expected to provide the strongest limits above $\sim$10 TeV, reaching velocity-averaged annihilation cross sections of $\sim$5$\times$10$^{-25}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and decay lifetimes up to $\sim$10$^{26}$ s for combined limits. The dominant uncertainties arise from the imprecise determination of the DM content, particularly for ultra-faint dSphs. Observation strategies are proposed that optimise either deep exposures of the best candidates or diversified target selections.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Consequences of an Electroweak $\eta_{\rm w}$ Pseudo-Scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02310</link>

Abstract: Recently, it has been suggested that the spectrum of physical states in the Standard Model may include an ultralight pseudo-scalar, denoted by $\eta_{\rm w}$, in analogy with the $\eta'$ state arising from the strong interactions. We find that typical expectations for the properties of $\eta_{\rm w}$ get challenged by astrophysical constraints on the couplings of ultralight bosons. Our strongest limit sets a lower bound of $\mathcal{O}({\rm 100~TeV})$ on the decay constant of the hypothesized pseudo-scalar. We also briefly discuss whether $\eta_{\rm w}$ could be a dark matter candidate, or the origin of dark energy, but conclude that those identifications appear unlikely. Given the important implications of a potentially overlooked $\eta_{\rm w}$ state for a more complete understanding of the electroweak interactions and a fundamental description of Nature, further theoretical and phenomenological investigations of this possibility and its associated physics are warranted.</description>

      <title>How precisely can we measure the ages of subgiant and giant stars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise stellar ages are fundamental to Galactic archaeology. However, obtaining reliable age estimates and uncertainties for field stars has been a long-standing challenge. We test the fidelity of ages from recent catalogs of giants and subgiants using wide binaries, whose components formed at the same time and thus should have consistent inferred ages. We find that subgiant ages based on spectroscopic metallicities from Xiang &amp; Rix (2022) are generally consistent within their reported uncertainties, implying that fractional uncertainties of 5-10% are realistically achievable. In contrast, we find that published photometric subgiant ages underestimate true uncertainties by factors of 2-3. Spectroscopic age estimates for red giant and red clump stars also show reliable uncertainties, but are generally less precise (25-30%). These results demonstrate that accurate metallicity and $\alpha$-element abundances are essential for precise subgiant ages and establish wide binaries as a powerful, model-independent benchmark for calibrating stellar age measurements in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.</description>
