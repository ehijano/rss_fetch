      <title>Coadjoint-orbit effective field theory of a Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a bosonized effective field theory for a 2d Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field using the coadjoint orbit approach, which was recently developed as a nonlinear bosonization method in phase space for Fermi liquids and non-Fermi liquids. We show that by parametrizing the phase space with the guiding center and the mechanical momentum, and by using techniques in noncommutative field theory, the physics of Landau levels and Landau level degeneracy ($N_{\Phi}$) naturally arises. For a parabolic dispersion, the resulting theory describes $N_{\Phi}$ flavors of free chiral bosons propagating in \emph{momentum space}. In addition, the action contains a linear term in the bosonic field, which upon mode expansion becomes a topological $\theta$-term. By properly quantizing this theory, we reproduce the well-known thermal and magnetic responses of a Fermi surface, including linear-in-$T$ specific heat, Landau diamagnetism, and the de Haas-van Alphen effect. {In particular, the de Haas-van Alphen effect is shown to be a direct consequence of the topological $\theta$-term.} Our theory paves the way toward understanding correlated gapless fermionic systems in a magnetic field using the powerful approach of bosonization.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced charge, spin, and orbital order in the two-orbital extended Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium control of electronically ordered hidden phases may lead to the development of ultrafast switches and memory devices. In this study, we demonstrate tunable hidden orders in the photo-doped two-orbital extended Hubbard model. Using steady-state nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory, we clarify the coexistence and interplay of nonthermal charge, spin, and orbital order. The hidden state at low effective temperature and sufficiently high photo-doping is reminiscent of Kugel-Khomskii order in the two-orbital Hubbard model at $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{3}{4}$ filling, but it emerges out of a nonequilibrium charge ordered state and exhibits a different magnetic structure. A low-energy effective Hamiltonian is used to analyze the exchange processes which stabilize the nonthermal order.</description>

      <title>Using $k$-means to sort spectra: electronic order mapping from scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging techniques have a unique ability to probe the inhomogeneity of material properties whether driven by compositional variation or other forms of phase segregation. In the doped cuprates, iridates, and related materials, scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements have found the emergence of pseudogap 'puddles' from the macroscopically Mott insulating phase with increased doping. However, categorizing this hyperspectral data by electronic order is not trivial, and has often been done with ad hoc methods. In this paper we demonstrate the utility of $k$-means, a simple and easy-to-use unsupervised clustering method, as a tool for classifying heterogeneous scanning tunneling spectroscopy data by electronic order for Rh-doped Sr$_2$IrO$_{4}$, a cuprate-like material. Applied to STM data acquired within the Mott phase, $k$-means successfully identified areas of Mott order and of pseudogap order. The unsupervised nature of $k$-means limits avenues for bias, and provides clustered spectral shapes without a priori knowledge of the physics. Additionally, we demonstrate successful use of $k$-means as a preprocessing tool to constrain phenomenological function fitting. Clustering the data allows us to reduce the fitting parameter space, limiting over-fitting. We suggest $k$-means as a fast, simple model for processing hyperspectral data on materials of mixed electronic order.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Excitations in the Diluted Two-dimensional S = 1/2 Heisenberg Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the excitation spectrum of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the randomly diluted square lattice by analytic continuation of QMC data. At dilution fractions $p=1/16$ and $p=1/8$, the dynamic structure factor $S({\bf q},\omega)$ exhibits a damped magnon peak with anomalous dispersion near ${\bf q}=(0,0)$ and $(\pi,\pi)$, a non-dispersive low-energy localization peak, and a second dispersive peak between these two features. A magnon with anomalous dispersion, close to our result, was predicted in spin wave and $T$-matrix theory [A. Chernyshev et al., PRB {\bf 65}, 104407 (2002)], above the localization energy. However, no intermediate dispersive mode was predicted. Analyzing spectral functions in real space for individual vacancy realizations by energy tomography, we find that these excitations are concentrated on a small subset of the spins adjacent to vacancies. We argue that the low-energy excitations are those of a sparse random network of effective moments at a fraction of the vacancies. There is a shift in magnon spectral weight distribution, from the spins away from vacancies at high energy to those adjacent to vacancies at lower energy. We also analyze the Anderson quantum rotor excitation at $\omega \propto N^{-1}$ (with $N=L^2$ the system size), which in the clean system is visible in $S({\bf q},\omega)$ only at ${\bf q}=(\pi,\pi)$ but spreads through the Brillouin zone when $p&gt;0$. Weight close to ${\bf q}=(0,0)$ and $(\pi,\pi)$ is explained by local sublattice imbalance within a dimer-monomer model but there is also structure arising from correlated singlet fluctuations, which we demonstrate by enhancing said fluctuations with four-spin couplings. All spectral features found here should be observable by elastic neutron scattering experiments on layered quantum antiferromagnets doped with nonmagnetic impurities.</description>

      <title>Interplay between electronic and lattice superstructures in La$_{2-x}$Ca$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex oxides are well known to develop oxygen ordering patterns with well defined periodicities, but their interplay with electronic correlations remains largely unexplored. Here, we report resonant and non-resonant x-ray diffraction data indicating a four-unit-cell periodic superstructure related to oxygen vacancy ordering in La$_{2-x}$Ca$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$ films with doping levels from the underdoped ($x = 0.15$) to the extremely overdoped ($x = 0.50$) regime. Whereas the lattice superstructure is temperature independent up to 300 K, a strongly temperature dependent electronic charge density wave (CDW) is observed in the underdoped and slightly overdoped regimes ($x\leq0.20$). The periodicity, in-plane and out-of-plane correlation lengths of the CDW are locked in by the lattice superstructure. Our results highlight the necessity to consider lattice and electronic energetics on equal footing in the high-temperature oxygen-disordered phase to explain oxygen ordering phenomena in complex oxides.</description>

      <title>Stable magic angle in twisted Kane-Mele materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that flat bands and van Hove singularities near the magic angle can be stabilized against angle disorder in the twisted Kane-Mele model. With continuum model and maximally localized Wannier function approaches, we identify a quadratic dispersion relationship between the bandwidth, interaction parameters versus the twist angle, in contrast to twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). Introducing Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling to TBG greatly reduces the fractional Chern insulator indicator and enhances the stability of fractional Chern states near the magic angle, as confirmed by exact diagonalization calculations. Moreover, in twisted bilayer Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ with intrinsic Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling, we identify a topological flat band at a large twist angle around 4 degrees.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium control of kagome metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic quantum order in kagome metals, i.e., quantum materials with a Fermi liquid parent state of electrons on a kagome lattice, has appeared as a vibrant emerging field of condensed matter physics. Already in a small kagome material subclass such as vanadium-based compounds $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs), the first wave of experimental exploration has brought about manifold evidence for hitherto largely elusive phenomena such as high-temperature charge ordering with orbital currents, nematic order, cascades of charge ordering transitions with hierarchies of ordering vectors, and unconventional superconductivity. We argue that kagome metals promise to be a prototypical ground for the non-equilibrium analysis of quantum order through time-dependent parameter control and manipulation. In particular, we propose to investigate the nematic character of kagome quantum order through light and strain pulses, as well as the nature of time-reversal symmetry breaking and chirality through properly polarized laser pulses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method to study critical properties near classical and quantum phase transitions. Our method applies ideas of the Tensor Renormalization Group to obtain an improved action which is used to extract critical properties by performing Monte Carlo simulations on relatively small system sizes. We demonstrate this method on the XY model in three dimensions. Our method may provide a framework with which to efficiently study universal properties in a large class of phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Cooper-pair splitters as circuit elements for realizing topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in materials and fabrication of superconducting devices allows the exploration of novel quantum effects in synthetic superconducting systems beyond conventional Josephson junction arrays. As an example, we introduce a new circuit element, the Y-splitter, a superconducting loop with three leads and three Josephson junctions, smaller or comparable in size to the superconducting coherence length of the material. By tuning magnetic flux through an array of Y-splitters, Cooper-pair transport can be made to interfere destructively, while spatially separated split Cooper pairs propagate coherently. We consider an array of Y-splitters connected in a two-dimensional star [Archimedean (3,$12^2$)] geometry, deformable into the kagome lattice, and find a rich phase diagram that includes topological superconducting phases with Chern numbers $\pm 2$. Experimental realization appears feasible.</description>

      <title>Adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulations with compressed circuits and fewer measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) method performs real-time evolution of quantum states using automatically generated parameterized quantum circuits that often contain substantially fewer gates than Trotter circuits. Here we report an improved version of the method, which we call AVQDS(T), by porting the Tiling Efficient Trial Circuits with Rotations Implemented Simultaneously (TETRIS) technique. The algorithm adaptively adds layers of disjoint unitary gates to the ansatz circuit so as to keep the McLachlan distance, a measure of the accuracy of the variational dynamics, below a fixed threshold. We perform benchmark noiseless AVQDS(T) simulations of quench dynamics in local spin models demonstrating that the TETRIS technique significantly reduces the circuit depth and two-qubit gate count. We also show a method based on eigenvalue truncation to solve the linear equations of motion for the variational parameters with enhanced noise resilience. Finally, we propose a way to substantially alleviate the measurement overhead of AVQDS(T) while maintaining high accuracy by synergistically integrating quantum circuit calculations on quantum processing units with classical calculations using, e.g., tensor networks to evaluate the quantum geometric tensor. We showcase that this approach enables AVQDS(T) to deliver more accurate results than simulations using a fixed ansatz of comparable final depth for a significant time duration with fewer quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics in 2d HCFTs on the curved background: the case of q-M\"obius Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will explore the dynamical property of non-equilibrium phenomena induced by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theory (2d holographic CFT) Hamiltonian on the curved spacetime by studying the time dependence of the entanglement entropy and mutual information. Here, holographic CFT is the CFT having the gravity dual. We will start from the boundary and thermofield double states, evolve the systems in Euclidean time with the Hamiltonian on the curved background, and then evolve them in real-time with the same Hamiltonian. We found that the early- and late-time entanglement structure depends on the curved background, while the entanglement growth does not, and is linear. Furthermore, in the gravity dual for the thermofield double state, this entanglement growth is due to the linear growth of the wormhole, while in the one for the boundary state, it is due to the in-falling of the end of the world brane to the black hole. We discussed the low temperature system can be regarded as the dynamical system induced by the multi-joining quenches. We also discussed the effective description of the high temperature system, called line tension picture.</description>

      <title>DMRG Analysis of Magnetic Order in the Zigzag Edges of Hexagonal CrN Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite temperature magnetic order at the edges of hexagonal CrN nanoribbons by using the density-functional theory combined with the density-matrix renormalization group method. Moreover, the spin-dependent transport in nanoribbons is calculated within the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. We find out that the zigzag edges have lower energy with respect to armchair edges. The zigzag edge of CrN nanoribbon shows half metallic electronic character which is the same as for the 2D monolayer. The localized electronic states on the zigzag edges reduce the electronic band gap energy for spin down electrons. The ab-initio electronic results are mapped into an effective 1D Heisenberg spin model up to the next nearest neighbor exchange interaction term. For zigzag ribbons, the nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor magnetic exchange are around $10$ to $12$, and $-2$ to $0$~meV/Cr atom, respectively. The finite spin correlation length in 1D nanoribbons drops sharply to zero with temperature. The absence of long range spin correlations at the edges is a practical drawback for future room temperature 2D spintronic devices. The maximally localized Wannier functions are used for band interpolation and spin-dependent transport calculations by using the semi-classical Boltzmann equation. We show that zigzag edges of CrN are perfect spin filter under both electron and hole doping.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Coexistence of Spin States in [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$ Complexes on Au(111) using ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07014v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the electronic structure and stability of spin states of the [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$ molecule in both gas phase and on a Au(111) substrate using density functional theory +U (DFT+U) calculations. We find that the stability of the Fe$^{2+}$ ion's spin states is significantly influenced by the Hubbard U parameter. In the gas phase, the low-spin (LS, S=0) state is found to be energetically favorable for U(Fe) $\leq$ 3 eV, whereas the high-spin (HS, S=2) state is stabilized for U(Fe) &gt; 3 eV. Interaction with the Au(111) substrate is found to elevate the critical U for the spin-state transition to 3.5 eV. Additionally, we perform L-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) calculations based on time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) for both HS and LS states. The calculated XAS suggests that the HS state more closely aligns with the experimental observations, indicating the potential coexistence of the HS state as the initial state during the X-ray excitation process. These findings enrich our understanding of spin-state dynamics in [Fe-(tpy-ph)$_2$]$^{2+}$.</description>

      <title>Strain-Tuned Magnetic Frustration in a Square Lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ Material</title>

Abstract: Magnetic frustration is a route that can lead to the emergence of novel ground states, including spin liquids and spin ices. Such frustration can be introduced through either the geometry of lattice structures or by incompatible exchange interactions. Identifying suitable strategies to control the degree of magnetic frustration in real systems is an active field of research. In this study, we devise a design principle for the tuning of frustrated magnetism on the square lattice through the manipulation of nearest (NN) and next-nearest neighbor (NNN) antiferromagnetic (AF) exchange interactions. By studying the magnon excitations in epitaxially-strained La$_2$NiO$_4$ films using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) we show that, in contrast to the cuprates, the dispersion peaks at the AF zone boundary. This indicates the presence of an AF-NNN spin interaction. Using first principles simulations and an effective spin-model, we demonstrate the AF-NNN coupling to be a consequence of the two-orbital nature of La$_2$NiO$_4$. Our results demonstrate that compressive strain can enhance this coupling, providing a design principle for the tunability of frustrated magnetism on a square lattice.</description>

Abstract: Density oscillations in quantum fluids can reveal their fundamental characteristic features. In this work, we study the density oscillation of incompressible fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids created by flux insertion. For the model Laughlin state, we find that the complex oscillations seen in various density profiles in real space can be universally captured by a simple damped oscillator model in the occupation-number space. It requires only two independent fitting parameters or characteristic length scales: the decay length and the oscillation wave number. Realistic Coulomb quasiholes can be viewed as Laughlin quasiholes dressed by magnetorotons, which can be modeled by a generalized damped oscillator model. Our work reveals the fundamental connections between the oscillations seen in various aspects of FQH fluids such as in the density of quasiholes, edge, and the pair correlation function. The presented model is useful for the study of quasihole sizes for their control and braiding in experiments and large-scale numerical computation of variational energies.</description>

      <title>Octupolar edge state in an $e_g$ orbital system on a square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tight-binding model for $e_g$ orbitals on a square lattice is investigated. We consider only the nearest-neighbor hopping and the model is characterized by two hopping parameters, $t_1$ and $t_2$. There are Dirac points in the electronic band structure and the type of the Dirac points (type-I or type-II) depends on the ratio $t_2/t_1$. For the case of the type-I Dirac points, edge states appear for a lattice with edges perpendicular to the $[11]$ direction. The edge states at a certain momentum along the edges have octupole moments with opposite signs between the right and left edges. Thus, these edge states can be called helical octupolar edge states. This study bridges the research fields of topological phenomena and multipole physics.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic magnetic and quadrupolar H-T phase diagram of CeRh2As2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tetragonal heavy fermion compound CeRh2As2 has intriguing low temperature symmetry breaking phases whose nature is unclear. The unconventional superconducting phase is complemented by other normal state phases which presumably involve ordering of 4f electron multipoles supported by the Kramers doublets split by the tetragonal crystal electric field (CEF). The most striking aspect is the pronounced anisotropic H-T phase boundary for in-plane and out-of plane field direction. Using a localized 4f CEF model we demonstrate that its essential features can be understood as the result of competing low field easy-plane magnetic order and field-induced quadrupolar order of XY type. We present calculations based on a coupled multipole random-phase approximation (RPA) response function approach as well as a molecular field treatment in the ordered regime. We use an analytical approach for a reduced quasi-quartet model and numerical calculations for the complete CEF level scheme. We discuss the quantum critical properties as function of multipolar control parameters and explain the origin of a pronounced a-c anisotropy of the H-T phase diagram. Finally the field and temperature evolution of multipolar order parameters is derived and the high field phase diagram is predicted.</description>

      <title>Theory of Coulomb driven nematicity in a multi-valley two-dimensional electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in a semiconductor host with two valleys related by an underlying $C_4$ rotational symmetry are studied using Hartree-Fock (HF) and various other many-body approaches. A familiar artifact of the HF approach is a degeneracy between the valley polarized - ``Ising nematic'' - and spin polarized - ferromagnetic - phases, which is inconsistent with recent variational Monte Carlo (VMC) results. Correlation effects, computed either within the random phase approximation (RPA) or the T-matrix approximation, enhance the valley susceptibility relative to the spin susceptibility. Extrapolating the results to finite interaction strength, we find a direct first-order transition from a symmetry-unbroken state to a spin unpolarized Ising nematic fluid with full valley polarization, in qualitative agreement with VMC. The RPA results are also reminiscent of experiments on the corresponding 2DEG in AlAs heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible Gauge Symmetry in (2+1)d Topological Orders: A String-Net Model Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for understanding symmetries in topological phases in 2+1 dimensions using the string-net model, encompassing both gauge symmetries that preserve anyon species and global symmetries permuting anyon species, including both invertible symmetries describable by groups and noninvertible symmetries described by categories. As an archetypal example, we reveal the first noninvertible categorical gauge symmetry of topological orders in 2+1 dimensions: the Fibonacci gauge symmetry of the doubled Fibonacci topological order, described by the Fibonacci fusion 2-category. Our approach involves two steps: first, establishing duality between different string-net models with Morita equivalent input fusion categories that describe the same topological order; and second, constructing symmetry transformations within the same string-net model when the dual models have isomorphic input fusion categories, achieved by composing duality maps with isomorphisms of degrees of freedom between the dual models.</description>

      <title>Refining the weighted subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver: compression of ans\"atze into a single pure state and optimization of weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weighted subspace-search variational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE) is a prominent algorithm for calculating excited-state properties of molecular quantum systems. In this work, we elaborate on some of its fundamental features with the aim of improving its practical realization. First, we demonstrate that the initial ans\"atze for various excited states could be prepared into a single pure state through a minimal number of ancilla qubits, followed by the optimization of a subsequent global unitary rotation in the targeted subspace. Since the ancillas' sole purpose is to purify an underlying ensemble $\rho_{\boldsymbol{w}}$ state with spectral weights $\boldsymbol{w}$, their measurement would just collapse $\rho_{\boldsymbol{w}}$ with probabilities $w_j$ to one of its eigenstates $|\Psi_j \rangle$. We thus observe that our realization of SSVQE is equivalent to the original SSVQE improved by importance sampling. Then, we elaborate by numerical means on the potential influence of the auxiliary weights $\boldsymbol{w}$ on the accuracy of the sought-after eigenstates and eigenenergies. Clear trends are discovered which are contrasted with some recent mathematical results concerning the ensemble variational principle that underlies SSVQE.</description>

      <title>A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. So far, only the simplest form of DTCs that exhibit period-doubling dynamics has been unambiguously realized in experiments. We develop an intuitive interacting spin-$1/2$ system that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs) and demonstrate its digital simulation on a noisy quantum processor. Remarkably, we found a strong signature of the predicted $4T$-DTC that is robust against and, in some cases, amplified by different types of disorders. Our findings thus shed light on the interplay between disorder and quantum interactions on the formation of time crystallinity beyond periodic-doubling, as well as demonstrate the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.</description>

      <title>Efficient Local Classical Shadow Tomography with Number Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shadow tomography aims to build a classical description of a quantum state from a sequence of simple random measurements. Physical observables are then reconstructed from the resulting classical shadow. Shadow protocols which use single-body random measurements are simple to implement and capture few-body observables efficiently, but do not apply to systems with fundamental number conservation laws, such as ultracold atoms. We address this shortcoming by proposing and analyzing a new local shadow protocol adapted to such systems. The "All-Pairs" protocol requires one layer of two-body gates and only $\textrm{poly}(V)$ samples to reconstruct arbitrary few body observables. Moreover, by exploiting the permutation symmetry of the protocol, we derive a linear time post-processing algorithm. We provide a proof-of-principle reference implementation and demonstrate the reconstruction of 2- and 4-point functions in a paired Luttinger liquid of hardcore bosons.</description>

      <title>Spatially oscillating correlation functions in $\left(2+1\right)$-dimensional four-fermion models: The mixing of scalar and vector modes at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the mixing of scalar and vector condensates produces spatially oscillating, but exponentially damped correlation functions in fermionic theories at finite density and temperature. We find a regime exhibiting this oscillatory behavior in a Gross-Neveu-type model that also features vector interactions within the mean-field approximation. The existence of this regime aligns with expectations based on symmetry arguments, that are also applicable to QCD at finite baryon density. We compute the phase diagram including both homogeneous phases and regions with spatially oscillating, exponentially damped correlation functions at finite temperature and chemical potential for different strengths of the vector coupling. Furthermore, we find that inhomogeneous condensates are disfavored compared to homogeneous ones akin to previous findings without vector interactions. We show that our results are valid for a broad class of $\left(2+1\right)$-dimensional models with local four-fermion interactions.</description>
