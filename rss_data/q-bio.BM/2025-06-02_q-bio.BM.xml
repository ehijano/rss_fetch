      <title>Aligning Protein Conformation Ensemble Generation with Physical Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein dynamics play a crucial role in protein biological functions and properties, and their traditional study typically relies on time-consuming molecular dynamics (MD) simulations conducted in silico. Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly denoising diffusion models, have enabled efficient accurate protein structure prediction and conformation sampling by learning distributions over crystallographic structures. However, effectively integrating physical supervision into these data-driven approaches remains challenging, as standard energy-based objectives often lead to intractable optimization. In this paper, we introduce Energy-based Alignment (EBA), a method that aligns generative models with feedback from physical models, efficiently calibrating them to appropriately balance conformational states based on their energy differences. Experimental results on the MD ensemble benchmark demonstrate that EBA achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-quality protein ensembles. By improving the physical plausibility of generated structures, our approach enhances model predictions and holds promise for applications in structural biology and drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Refining Platelet Purification Methods: Enhancing Proteomics for Clinical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Platelet proteomics offers valuable insights for clinical research, yet isolating high-purity platelets remains a challenge. Current methods often lead to contamination or platelet loss, compromising data quality and reproducibility.
  Objectives: This study aimed to optimize a platelet isolation technique that yields high-purity samples with minimal loss and to identify the most effective mass spectrometry-based proteomic method for analyzing platelet proteins with optimal coverage and sensitivity.
  Methods: We refined an isolation protocol by adjusting centrifugation time to reduce blood volume requirements while preserving platelet yield and purity. Using this optimized method, we evaluated three proteomic approaches: Label-free Quantification with Data-Independent Acquisition (LFQ-DIA), Label-free Quantification with Data-Dependent Acquisition (LFQ-DDA), and Tandem Mass Tag labeling with DDA (TMT-DDA).
  Results: LFQ-DIA demonstrated superior protein coverage and sensitivity compared to LFQ-DDA and TMT-DDA. The refined isolation protocol effectively minimized contamination and platelet loss. Additionally, age-related differences in platelet protein composition were observed, highlighting the importance of using age-matched controls in biomarker discovery studies.
  Conclusions: The optimized platelet isolation protocol provides a cost-effective and reliable method for preparing high-purity samples for proteomics. LFQ-DIA is the most suitable approach for comprehensive platelet protein analysis. Age-related variation in platelet proteomes underscores the need for demographic matching in clinical proteomic research.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Controllable Multi-property Multi-objective Molecule Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world drug design, molecule optimization requires selectively improving multiple molecular properties up to pharmaceutically relevant levels, while maintaining others that already meet such criteria. However, existing computational approaches and instruction-tuned LLMs fail to capture such nuanced property-specific objectives, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce C-MuMOInstruct, the first instruction-tuning dataset focused on multi-property optimization with explicit, property-specific objectives. Leveraging C-MuMOInstruct, we develop GeLLMO-Cs, a series of instruction-tuned LLMs that can perform targeted property-specific optimization. Our experiments across 5 in-distribution and 5 out-of-distribution tasks show that GeLLMO-Cs consistently outperform strong baselines, achieving up to 126% higher success rate. Notably, GeLLMO-Cs exhibit impressive 0-shot generalization to novel optimization tasks and unseen instructions. This offers a step toward a foundational LLM to support realistic, diverse optimizations with property-specific objectives. C-MuMOInstruct and code are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/GeLLMO-C.</description>
