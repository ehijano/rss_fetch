      <title>InfraredGP: Efficient Graph Partitioning via Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Negative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph partitioning (GP), a.k.a. community detection, is a classic problem that divides nodes of a graph into densely-connected blocks. From a perspective of graph signal processing, we find that graph Laplacian with a negative correction can derive graph frequencies beyond the conventional range $[0, 2]$. To explore whether the low-frequency information beyond this range can encode more informative properties about community structures, we propose InfraredGP. It (\romannumeral1) adopts a spectral GNN as its backbone combined with low-pass filters and a negative correction mechanism, (\romannumeral2) only feeds random inputs to this backbone, (\romannumeral3) derives graph embeddings via one feed-forward propagation (FFP) without any training, and (\romannumeral4) obtains feasible GP results by feeding the derived embeddings to BIRCH. Surprisingly, our experiments demonstrate that based solely on the negative correction mechanism that amplifies low-frequency information beyond $[0, 2]$, InfraredGP can derive distinguishable embeddings for some standard clustering modules (e.g., BIRCH) and obtain high-quality results for GP without any training. Following the IEEE HPEC Graph Challenge benchmark, we evaluate InfraredGP for both static and streaming GP, where InfraredGP can achieve much better efficiency (e.g., 16x-23x faster) and competitive quality over various baselines.

      <title>The Economic Complexity of the Roman Empire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economic complexity is a powerful tool to estimate the productive capabilities and future growth of modern economies. Little is known of how economic complexity evolves over long periods in history. In this paper, we use archaeological evidence from the Roman Empire in the form of short texts preserved on a durable material (i.e. inscriptions) to estimate the economic complexity of the various provinces of the empire. By connecting the occupations listed in the text of inscriptions with the location in which the inscribed objects were found we can estimate that the most complex areas during the first four centuries of the Roman Empire have a remarkable and statistically significant overlap with the most complex countries today. While we lack an explanation for the reason of the preservation of economic complexity through the ages, this evidence provides a suggestion about how difficult the development of economic capabilities might be.</description>

      <title>GegenNet: Spectral Convolutional Neural Networks for Link Sign Prediction in Signed Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a signed bipartite graph (SBG) G with two disjoint node sets U and V, the goal of link sign prediction is to predict the signs of potential links connecting U and V based on known positive and negative edges in G. The majority of existing solutions towards link sign prediction mainly focus on unipartite signed graphs, which are sub-optimal due to the neglect of node heterogeneity and unique bipartite characteristics of SBGs. To this end, recent studies adapt graph neural networks to SBGs by introducing message-passing schemes for both inter-partition (UxV) and intra-partition (UxU or VxV) node pairs. However, the fundamental spectral convolutional operators were originally designed for positive links in unsigned graphs, and thus, are not optimal for inferring missing positive or negative links from known ones in SBGs.
  Motivated by this, this paper proposes GegenNet, a novel and effective spectral convolutional neural network model for link sign prediction in SBGs. In particular, GegenNet achieves enhanced model capacity and high predictive accuracy through three main technical contributions: (i) fast and theoretically grounded spectral decomposition techniques for node feature initialization; (ii) a new spectral graph filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomial basis; and (iii) multi-layer sign-aware spectral convolutional networks alternating Gegenbauer polynomial filters with positive and negative edges. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that GegenNet can achieve significantly superior performance (up to a gain of 4.28% in AUC and 11.69% in F1) in link sign prediction compared to 11 strong competitors over 6 benchmark SBG datasets.</description>

      <title>On the Joint Effect of Culture and Discussion Topics on X (Twitter) Signed Ego Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans are known to structure social relationships according to certain patterns, such as the Ego Network Model (ENM). These patterns result from our innate cognitive limits and can therefore be observed in the vast majority of large human social groups. Until recently, the main focus of research was the structural characteristics of this model. The main aim of this paper is to complement previous findings with systematic and data-driven analyses on the positive and negative sentiments of social relationships, across different cultures, communities and topics of discussion. A total of 26 datasets were collected for this work. It was found that contrary to previous findings, the influence of culture is not easily ``overwhelmed'' by that of the topic of discussion. However, more specific and polarising topics do lead to noticeable increases in negativity across all cultures. These negativities also appear to be stable across the different levels of the ENM, which contradicts previous hypotheses. Finally, the number of generic topics being discussed between users seems to be a good predictor of the overall positivity of their relationships.</description>

      <title>Score-based Generative Diffusion Models for Social Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the prevalence of social networks on online platforms, social recommendation has become a vital technique for enhancing personalized recommendations. The effectiveness of social recommendations largely relies on the social homophily assumption, which presumes that individuals with social connections often share similar preferences. However, this foundational premise has been recently challenged due to the inherent complexity and noise present in real-world social networks. In this paper, we tackle the low social homophily challenge from an innovative generative perspective, directly generating optimal user social representations that maximize consistency with collaborative signals. Specifically, we propose the Score-based Generative Model for Social Recommendation (SGSR), which effectively adapts the Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)-based diffusion models for social recommendations. To better fit the recommendation context, SGSR employs a joint curriculum training strategy to mitigate challenges related to missing supervision signals and leverages self-supervised learning techniques to align knowledge across social and collaborative domains. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in filtering redundant social information and improving recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Unifying the Extremes: Developing a Unified Model for Detecting and Predicting Extremist Traits and Radicalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of ideological movements into extremist factions via social media has become a global concern. While radicalization has been studied extensively within the context of specific ideologies, our ability to accurately characterize extremism in more generalizable terms remains underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a novel method for extracting and analyzing extremist discourse across a range of online community forums. By focusing on verbal behavioral signatures of extremist traits, we develop a framework for quantifying extremism at both user and community levels. Our research identifies 11 distinct factors, which we term ``The Extremist Eleven,'' as a generalized psychosocial model of extremism. Applying our method to various online communities, we demonstrate an ability to characterize ideologically diverse communities across the 11 extremist traits. We demonstrate the power of this method by analyzing user histories from members of the incel community. We find that our framework accurately predicts which users join the incel community up to 10 months before their actual entry with an AUC of $&gt;0.6$, steadily increasing to AUC ~0.9 three to four months before the event. Further, we find that upon entry into an extremist forum, the users tend to maintain their level of extremism within the community, while still remaining distinguishable from the general online discourse. Our findings contribute to the study of extremism by introducing a more holistic, cross-ideological approach that transcends traditional, trait-specific models.</description>

      <title>Using Generative AI to Uncover What Drives Player Enjoyment in PC and VR Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As video games continue to evolve, understanding what drives player enjoyment remains a key challenge. Player reviews provide valuable insights, but their unstructured nature makes large-scale analysis difficult. This study applies generative AI and machine learning, leveraging Microsoft Phi-4 LLM and XGBoost, to quantify and analyze game reviews from Steam and Meta Quest stores. The approach converts qualitative feedback into structured data, enabling comprehensive evaluation of key game design elements, monetization models, and platform-specific trends. The findings reveal distinct patterns in player preferences across PC and VR games, highlighting factors that contribute to higher player satisfaction. By integrating Google Cloud for largescale data storage and processing, this study establishes a scalable framework for game review analysis. The study's insights offer actionable guidance for game developers, helping optimize game mechanics, pricing strategies, and player engagement.</description>
