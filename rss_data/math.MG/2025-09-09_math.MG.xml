      <title>On the Density Problem in Heisenberg Rectifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve a problem posed by Mattila, Serapioni and Serra Cassano concerning the role of density assumptions in the characterization of rectifiable sets of low codimension in Heisenberg groups. Specifically, we prove that the positive lower density condition is not required: rectifiability is completely determined by the geometric property of almost everywhere existence of approximate tangent subgroups. This provides a simplified and intrinsic criterion for rectifiable sets in the subRiemannian setting and sharpens the analogy with Federer's classical Euclidean theorem.</description>

      <title>Semialgebric rank-one convex hulls: 2x2 triangular matrices and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the rank-one convex hull of finitely many $2\times 2$ triangular matrices is a semialgebraic set, defined by linear and quadratic polynomials. We present explicit constructions for five-point configurations and offer evidence suggesting that a similar characterization does not hold in the more general setting of directional convexity.</description>

      <title>Totally real divisors on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the works of Krasnov and Scheiderer, there has been an interest in studying effective totally real divisors on a curve X defined over a real closed field, i.e., effective divisors supported on the real locus. Scheiderer proved that, for smooth curves over the real numbers with nonempty real locus, each divisor of sufficiently high degree is linearly equivalent to an effective totally real one. The smallest degree N(X) with this property is called the totally real divisor threshold.
  When the field is non-Archimedean, we obtain a classification of topological types of smooth curves for which N(X) can be infinite. As a consequence, for curves over the real numbers we prove that N(X) cannot be bounded from above only in terms of the topological type, unless the real locus has many connected components. We complement this qualitative result with a quantitative lower bound for N(X), depending on metric properties of the Jacobian and the curve in the Bergman metric. Finally, we relate these metric properties to period matrices of X, expressed in a way compatible with the real structure.</description>

      <title>On exponential separation of analytic self-conformal sets on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent article, Rapaport showed that the there is no dimension drop for exponentially separated analytic IFSs on the real line. We show that the set of such exponentially separated IFSs in the space of analytic IFSs contains an open and dense set in the $\mathcal{C}^2$ topology. Moreover, we give a sufficient condition for the IFS to be exponentially separated which allows us to construct explicit examples which are exponentially separated. The key technical tool is the introduction of the \textit{dual IFS} which we believe has significant interest in its own right. As an application we also characterise when an analytic IFS can be conjugated to a self-similar IFS.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Tiling with a Tromino</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a periodic placement of copies of a tromino (either L or I), we prove co-RE-completeness (and hence undecidability) of deciding whether it can be completed to a plane tiling. By contrast, the problem becomes decidable if the initial placement is finite, or if the tile is a domino instead of a tromino (in any dimension). As a consequence, tiling a given periodic subset of the plane with a given tromino (L or I) is co-RE-complete.
  We also prove co-RE-completeness of tiling the entire plane with two polyominoes (one of which is disconnected and the other of which has constant size), and of tiling 3D space with two connected polycubes (one of which has constant size). If we restrict to tiling by translation only (no rotation), then we obtain co-RE-completeness with one more tile: two trominoes for a periodic subset of 2D, three polyominoes for the 2D plane, and three connected polycubes for 3D space.
  Along the way, we prove several new complexity and algorithmic results about periodic (infinite) graphs. Notably, we prove that Periodic Planar (1-in-)3SAT-3, 3DM, and Graph Orientation are co-RE-complete in 2D and PSPACE-complete in 1D; we extend basic results in graph drawing to 2D periodic graphs; and we give a polynomial-time algorithm for perfect matching in bipartite periodic graphs.</description>

      <title>A volume correspondence between anti-de Sitter space and its boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$ be the $(n+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter space (AdS), in this paper we propose to extend $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$ conformally to another copy of $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$ by gluing them along the boundary at infinity, and denote the resulting space by \emph{double anti-de Sitter space} $\mathbb{DH}^{n+1}_1$. We propose to introduce a volume (possibly complex valued) on polytopes in $\mathbb{DH}^{n+1}_1$ whose facets all have non-degenerate metrics (called \emph{good} polytopes), and show that the volume is well defined and invariant under isometry, including the case that the good polytope contains a non-trivial portion of $\partial\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$. For $n$ even, the volume of a good polytope in $\mathbb{DH}^{n+1}_1$ is shown to be completely determined by its intersection with $\partial\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$, which leads to the following important applications: it induces a new intrinsic \emph{volume} on $\partial\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$ that is invariant under conformal transformations of $\partial\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$, and establishes an AdS-CFT type correspondence between the volumes on $\mathbb{DH}^{n+1}_1$ and $\partial\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$.</description>

      <title>New fiber and graph combinations of convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three new combinations of convex bodies are introduced and studied: the $L_p$ fiber, $L_p$ chord and graph combinations. These combinations are defined in terms of the fibers and graphs of pairs of convex bodies, and each operation generalizes the classical Steiner symmetral, albeit in different ways. For the $L_p$ fiber and $L_p$ chord combinations, we derive Brunn--Minkowski-type inequalities and the corresponding Minkowski's first inequalities. We also prove that the general affine surface areas are concave (respectively, convex) with respect to the graph sum, thereby generalizing fundamental results of Ye (Indiana Univ. Math. J., 2014) on the monotonicity of the general affine surface areas under Steiner symmetrization. As an application, we deduce a corresponding Minkowski's first inequality for the $L_p$ affine surface area of a graph combination of convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Roots of real-valued zero mean maps: Compositions of linear functionals and equivariant maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel topological framework that yields results constraining the distribution of zeros of certain zero mean real-valued maps, namely those obtained from composing a fixed equivariant map with linear functionals. We use this framework to establish upper bounds for the topology of set systems in the domain where (multivariate) trigonometric polynomials do not change their sign, generalizing and, in certain regimes, strengthening results in the literature. Our results more generally contain restrictions on the distribution of zeros of Chebyshev spaces as special cases. Lastly, we apply this framework to derive existence results for efficient cubature rules for compositions of affine functionals and equivariant maps.</description>

      <title>Convergences of looptrees coded by excursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to study convergences of looptrees, we construct continuum trees and looptrees from real-valued c\`adl\`ag functions without negative jumps called excursions. We then provide a toolbox to manipulate the two resulting codings of metric spaces by excursions and we formalize the principle that jumps correspond to loops and that continuous growths correspond to branches. Combining these codings creates new metric spaces from excursions that we call vernation trees. They consist of a collection of loops and trees glued along a tree structure so that they unify trees and looptrees. We also propose a topological definition for vernation trees, which yields what we argue to be the right space to study convergences of looptrees. However, those first codings lack some functional continuity, so we adjust them. We thus obtain several limit theorems. Finally, we present some probabilistic applications, such as proving an invariance principle for random discrete looptrees.</description>
