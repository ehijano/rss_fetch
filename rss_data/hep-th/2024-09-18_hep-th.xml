      <title>UV complete local field theory of persistent symmetry breaking in 2+1 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking can persist at all temperatures in certain biconical $\mathrm{O}(N)\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ vector models when the underlying field theories are ultraviolet complete. So far, the existence of such theories has been established in fractional dimensions for local but nonunitary models or in 2+1 dimensions but for nonlocal models. Here, we study local models at zero and finite temperature directly in 2+1 dimensions employing functional methods. At zero temperature, we establish that our approach describes the quantum critical behaviour with high accuracy for all $N\geq 2$. We then exhibit the mechanism of discrete symmetry breaking from $\mathrm{O}(N)\times \mathbb{Z}_2\to \mathrm{O}(N)$ for increasing temperature near the biconical critical point when $N$ is finite but large. We calculate the corresponding finite-temperature phase diagram and further show that the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem is fully respected within this approach, i.e., symmetry breaking only occurs in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector. Finally, we determine the critical $N$ above which this phenomenon can be observed to be $N_c \approx 15$.</description>

      <title>The random free field scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field theories with quenched disorder are so hard to study that even exactly solvable free theories present puzzling aspects. We consider a free scalar field $\phi$ in $d$ dimensions coupled to a random source $h$ with quenched disorder. Despite the presence of a mass scale governing the disorder distribution, we derive a new description of the theory that allows us to show that the theory is gapless and invariant under conformal symmetry, which acts in a non-trivial way on $\phi$ and $h$. This manifest CFT description reveals the presence of exotic continuous symmetries, such as nilpotent bosonic ones, in the quenched theory. We also reconsider Cardy's CFT description defined through the replica trick. In this description, the nilpotent symmetries reveal a striking resemblance with Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetries. We provide explicit maps of correlation functions between such CFTs and the original quenched theory. The maps are non-trivial and show that conformal behaviour is manifest only when considering suitable linear combinations of averages of products of correlators. We also briefly discuss how familiar notions like normal ordering of composite operators and OPE can be generalized in the presence of the more complicated local observables in the quenched theory.</description>

      <title>Physical Representations of Corner Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the full representation theory of the gravitational extended corner symmetry group in two-dimensions. This includes projective representations, which correspond to representations of the quantum corner symmetry group. We begin with a review of Mackey's theory of induced representations and then proceed to its application to the corner symmetries. The field representations, induced from the irreducible representations of the special linear group are worked out first. The little group method is then applied to the extended corner symmetry group to obtain the irreducible unitary representations. Finally, we focus on projective representations and their application to the description of local subsystems.</description>

      <title>The full electroweak interaction: an autonomous account</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise renormalizable interactions in the bosonic sector of electroweak theory are intrinsically determined in the autonomous approach to perturbation theory. This proceeds directly on the Hilbert-Fock space built on the Wigner unirreps of the physical particles, with their given masses: those of three massive vector bosons, a photon, and a massive scalar (the "higgs"). Neither "gauge choices" nor an unobservable "mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking" are invoked. Instead, to proceed on Hilbert space requires using string-localized fields to describe the vector bosons. In such a framework, the condition of string independence of the S-matrix yields consistency constraints on the coupling coefficients, the unique outcome being the experimentally known one. The analysis can be largely carried out for other configurations of massive and massless vector bosons, paving the way towards consideration of consistent mass patterns beyond those of the electroweak theory.</description>

      <title>An Interacting, Higher Derivative, Boundary Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a higher derivative scalar field theory in the presence of a boundary and a classically marginal interaction. We first investigate the free limit where the scalar obeys the square of the Klein-Gordon equation. In precisely $d=6$ dimensions, modules generated by $d-2$ and $d-4$ dimensional primaries merge to form a staggered module. We compute the conformal block associated with this module and show that it is a generalized eigenvector of the Casimir operator. Next we include the effect of a classically marginal interaction that involves four scalar fields and two derivatives. The theory has an infrared fixed point in $d=6-{\epsilon}$ dimensions. We compute boundary operator anomalous dimensions and boundary OPE coefficients at leading order in the ${\epsilon}$ expansion for the allowed conformal boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Metallic holography for $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs in 4d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build up the notion of metallic holography for $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs in four dimensions, in the presence of a finite $U(1)$ chemical potential. We compute two point correlation functions and study their properties in the regime of low frequency and low momentum. The color sector reveals gapless excitations, one of which propagates with a finite phase velocity while the other mode attenuates through scattering. The flavour sector, on the other hand, reveals spectrum that contains quasiparticle excitations which propagate with a definite phase velocity together with modes that propagate with a finite group velocity which quantum attenuates quite similar in spirit as that of Landau's zero sound modes. We also compute associated AC conductivities, which exhibit different characteristics for different (color and flavour) sectors of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Rindler Wigner distributions for non-vacuum Minkowski states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, Fulling, Davies, and Unruh demonstrated that the vacuum state perceived by an inertial observer in Minkowski space appears as a thermal bath to a uniformly accelerated observer. We explore the transformation of the Wigner distribution of a real scalar field from an inertial to a Rindler frame, utilizing both Minkowski and Unruh modes. We present a general expression for the reduced Wigner distribution for a specific set of massless scalar field configurations, and validate it against known distributions within this set. This includes arbitrary Gaussian states of Unruh-Minkowski modes, the Minkowski vacuum state, the Rindler vacuum, and the thermal bath of Unruh particles. Additionally, we analyze several other distributions, such as a uniform momentum distribution, a slight deviation from the Minkowski vacuum, and a distribution with a Fermionic component in the Rindler frame. The conclusions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Scrambling in the Charging of Quantum Batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exponentially fast scrambling of an initial state characterizes quantum chaotic systems. Given the importance of quickly populating higher energy levels from low-energy states in quantum battery charging protocols, this Letter investigates the role of quantum scrambling in quantum batteries and its effect on optimal power and charging times. We adopt a bare representation with normalized bandwidths to suppress system energy dependence. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth exploration of quantum scrambling in the context of quantum batteries. By analyzing the dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators, our findings indicate that quantum scrambling does not necessarily lead to faster charging, despite its potential for accelerating the process.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussianity Beyond the Scalar Sector: A Search for Tensor and Mixed Tensor-Scalar Bispectra with Planck Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves could be non-Gaussian, just like primordial scalar perturbations. Although the tensor two-point function has thus-far remained elusive, the three-point function could, in principle, be large enough to be detected in Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization anisotropies. We perform a detailed analysis of tensor and mixed tensor-scalar non-Gaussianity through the Planck PR4 bispectrum, placing constraints on eleven primordial templates, spanning various phenomenological and physical regimes including modifications to gravity, additional fields in inflation, and primordial magnetic fields. All analysis is performed using modern quasi-optimal binned estimators, and yields no evidence for tensor non-Gaussianity, with a maximum detection significance of $1.8\sigma$. Our constraints are derived primarily from large-scales (except for tensor-scalar-scalar models), and benefit greatly from the inclusion of $B$-modes. Although we find some loss of information from binning, mask effects and residual foreground contamination, our $f_{\rm NL}$ bounds improve over those of previous analyses by $40-600\%$, with six of the eleven models being analyzed for the first time. Unlike for scalar non-Gaussianity, future low-noise experiments such as LiteBIRD, the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, will yield considerable improvement in tensor non-Gaussianity constraints.</description>

      <title>Is the real two-Higgs-doublet model consistent?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide strong evidence that the widely-studied real two-Higgs-doublet model is inconsistent under renormalization due to quark-induced divergent CP violation (CPV). We identify the necessary ingredients for the CPV to enter the renormalization-group equations based on symmetry proprieties of the divergent diagrams. We demonstrate that while these ingredients are present starting at six loops, the divergent CPV is zero at that order due to approximate symmetries. We show that these symmetries are broken at seven loops and determine the parameter dependence of the resulting divergent CPV.</description>

      <title>Gravitational chargegenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wash-in leptogenesis is an attractive mechanism to produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. It treats right-handed-neutrino interactions as spectator processes, on the same footing as electroweak sphalerons, that reprocess primordial charge asymmetries in the thermal plasma into a baryon-minus-lepton asymmetry. The origin of these primordial charges must be accounted for by new $CP$-violating dynamics at very high energies. In this paper, we propose such a scenario of chargegenesis that, unlike earlier proposals, primarily relies on new interactions in the gravitational sector. We point out that a coupling of a conserved current to the divergence of the Ricci scalar during reheating can lead to nonzero effective chemical potentials in the plasma that, together with a suitable charge-violating interaction, can result in the production of a primordial charge asymmetry. Gravitational chargegenesis represents a substantial generalization of the idea of gravitational baryogenesis. We provide a detailed analysis of a generic and minimal realization that is consistent with inflation and show that it can successfully explain the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors: cosmological parameters and the structure growth anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore full-shape analysis with simulation-based priors, which is the simplest approach to galaxy clustering data analysis that combines effective field theory (EFT) on large scales and numerical simulations on small scales. The core ingredient of our approach is the prior density of EFT parameters which we extract from a suite of 10500 galaxy simulations based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model. We measure the EFT parameters with the field-level forward model, which enables us to cancel cosmic variance. On the theory side, we develop a new efficient approach to calculate field-level transfer functions using time-sliced perturbation theory and the logarithmic fast Fourier transform. We study cosmology dependence of EFT parameters of dark matter halos and HOD galaxies and find that it can be ignored for the purpose of prior generation. We use neural density estimation to model the measured distribution of EFT parameters. Our distribution model is then used as a prior in a reanalysis of the BOSS full-shape galaxy power spectrum data. Assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find significant ($\approx 30\%$ and $\approx 60\%$) improvements for the matter density fraction and the mass fluctuation amplitude, which are constrained to $\Omega_m= 0.315 \pm 0.010$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.671 \pm 0.027$. The value of the Hubble constant does not change, $H_0= 68.7\pm 1.1$ km/s/Mpc. This reaffirms earlier reports of the structure growth tension from the BOSS data. Finally, we use the measured EFT parameters to constrain galaxy formation physics.</description>

      <title>Duality-preserving deformation of 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory with exact gapped ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a deformation of the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory that preserves the non-invertible Wegner duality symmetry at the self-dual point. We identify a frustration-free point along this deformation where there are nine exactly degenerate ground states (on a periodic cubic lattice) even at finite volume. One of these ground states is a trivial product state and the rest are the topologically-ordered ground states of the 3+1d toric code. We also prove that the frustration-free point is gapped in the thermodynamic limit. Our model, therefore, realizes a gapped phase with spontaneously broken Wegner duality symmetry. Furthermore, by imposing the Gauss law constraints energetically, all the above features can be realized on a tensor product Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss a generalization of this deformation to the 3+1d lattice $\mathbb Z_N$ gauge theory and conjecture the possible phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Eigenoperator approach to Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory and dispersive interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern quantum physics is very modular: we first understand basic building blocks (``XXZ Hamiltonian'' ``Jaynes-Cummings'' etc.) and then combine them to explore novel effects. A typical example is placing known systems inside an optical cavity. The Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation method is particularly suited for dealing with these problems, since it casts the perturbation expansion in terms of operator corrections to a Hamiltonian, which is more intuitive than energy level corrections, as in traditional time-independent perturbation theory. However, the method lacks a systematic approach.% and has largely remained a niche topic. In these notes we discuss how \emph{eigenoperator decompositions}, a concept largely used in open quantum systems, can be employed to construct an intuitive and systematic formulation of Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory. To illustrate this we revisit various papers in the literature, old and new, and show how they can instead be solved using eigenoperators. Particular emphasis is given to perturbations that couple two systems with very different transition frequencies (highly off-resonance), leading to the so-called dispersive interactions.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Probes of Higgs-Axion non-perturbative Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the phenomenological implications of several non-trivial axion-Higgs couplings, which cover most of the possible non-perturbative scenarios. Specifically we consider the combination of having higher order non-renormalizable Higgs-axion couplings originating from a weakly coupled effective theory combined with non-perturbative couplings of the form $\sim \epsilon \Lambda_c^2|H|^2\cos (\frac{\phi}{f_a})$. Since we consider the misalignment axion, the non-perturbative couplings can be expanded in the form of a perturbation expansion in powers of $\phi/f_a$, thus after the electroweak symmetry breaking, the effective potential of the axion is drastically affected by these terms. We investigate the phenomenological implications of these terms for various values of the mass scale $\Lambda_c$, and some scenarios are theoretically disfavored, while other scenarios with non-perturbative Higgs-axion couplings of the form $\sim \epsilon \Lambda_c^2|H|^2\cos (\frac{\phi}{f_a})$ with $\Lambda_c\sim 10^{-10}\times m_a$ and $m_a\sim 10^{-10}\,$eV, lead to a characteristic pattern in the stochastic gravitational wave background via the deformation of the background equation of state parameter occurring at frequencies probed by the Einstein Telescope. We also consider loop effects from the Higgs sector caused by the term $\sim \epsilon \Lambda_c^2|H|^2\cos (\frac{\phi}{f_a})$ if we close the Higgs in one loop.</description>

      <title>Topological K-theory of quasi-BPS categories for Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we introduced quasi-BPS categories for moduli stacks of semistable Higgs bundles. Under a certain condition on the rank, Euler characteristic, and weight, the quasi-BPS categories (called BPS in this case) are non-commutative analogues of Hitchin integrable systems. We proposed a conjectural equivalence between BPS categories which swaps Euler characteristics and weights. The conjecture is inspired by the Dolbeault Geometric Langlands equivalence of Donagi--Pantev, by the Hausel--Thaddeus mirror symmetry, and by the $\chi$-independence phenomenon for BPS invariants of curves on Calabi-Yau threefolds.
  In this paper, we show that the above conjecture holds at the level of topological K-theories. When the rank and the Euler characteristic are coprime, such an isomorphism was proved by Groechenig--Shen. Along the way, we show that the topological K-theory of BPS categories is isomorphic to the BPS cohomology of the moduli of semistable Higgs bundles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study particle production in Vaidya spacetime. Using the WKB approximation, the distribution of Hawking radiation is calculated without the near-horizon approximation, which leads to finite corrections to the purely thermal spectrum. We extend our analysis to extremal and non-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes. Our results can be understood in terms of a thermodynamic toy model, where one regards Hawking radiation as Unruh radiation perceived by observers outside of the black hole. Moreover, we extend the model to incorporate the backreaction of Hawking quanta on spacetime geometry. Our study suggests that the backreaction may prevent the formation of the event horizon and spacetime singularity.</description>

      <title>Zero-jettiness soft function to third order in perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the high-precision result for the zero-jettiness soft function at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO) in perturbative QCD. At this perturbative order, the soft function is the last missing ingredient required for the computation of a hadronic colour singlet production or a colour singlet decay into two jets using the zero-jettiness variable as the slicing parameter. Furthermore, the knowledge of the N3LO soft function enables the re-summed description of the thrust distribution in the process $e^+ e^- \to \textrm{hadrons}$ through next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order, which is important for the extraction of the strong coupling constant using this shape variable. On the methodological side, the complexity of the zero-jettiness variable forced us to develop a new semi-analytic method for phase-space integration in the presence of constraints parameterized through Heaviside functions which, hopefully, will be useful for further development of the $N$-jettiness slicing scheme.</description>

      <title>Crosscap states and duality of Ising field theory in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two distinct crosscap states for the two-dimensional (2D) Ising field theory. These two crosscap states, identifying Ising spins or dual spins (domain walls) at antipodal points, are shown to be related via the Kramers-Wannier duality transformation. We derive their Majorana free field representations and extend bosonization techniques to calculate correlation functions of the 2D Ising conformal field theory (CFT) with different crosscap boundaries. We further develop a conformal perturbation theory to calculate the Klein bottle entropy as a universal scaling function [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 151602 (2023)] in the 2D Ising field theory. The formalism developed in this work is applicable to many other 2D CFTs perturbed by relevant operators.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by quintessence in the generalized uncertainty principle framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of a Schwarzschild black hole, surrounded by the quintessence energy-matter in the linear and quadratic generalized uncertainty principle framework. Considering the variance in the position to be of the order of the event horizon radius and equating the variance in the momentum to the Hawking temperature of the black hole, we substitute these variances in the deformed algebra. From there we obtained the generalized uncertainty principle-modified black hole temperature and eventually the specific heat of the black hole. Then we calculate the critical as well as the remnant mass and obtain the entropy relation. We observe that the entropy relation includes the usual leading order ``\textit{area divided by four}" term, sub-leading logarithmic term, and higher order inverse of the area corrections. Finally, calculating the energy output as a function of time, we obtain the evaporation time of the black hole. The results show the dependence of the quintessence parameter on the thermodynamic quantities in the framework of linear and quadratic generalized uncertainty principle.</description>

      <title>Natural anomalous cyclotron response in a hydrodynamic local quantum critical metal in a periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study DC magnetotransport in a quantum critical metal in the presence of a lattice. In the regime where the transport is hydrodynamical the interplay of the Lorentz force and the lattice gives rise to a natural anomalous contribution to the cyclotron frequency that changes it from its canonical charge-to-mass ratio. The size of this effect is universal as it is determined only by thermodynamic quantities. Remarkably the Drude weight changes in such a way that to first subleading order in the lattice strength the Hall resistivity and Hall coefficient do not change, though the Hall angle does change. We confirm our results with numerical simulations in a holographic model of a strange metal. For weak lattice strength these hydrodynamic effects are shown to be present. The numerical simulations also suggest that strong lattice effects beyond a hydrodynamic regime may provide a resolution to the experimentally observed anomalous Hall response of cuprate strange metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into the deformation of spinor structures within nontrivial topologies and their physical implications. The deformation is modeled by introducing real functions that modify the standard spinor dynamics, leading to distinct physical regions characterized by varying degrees of Lorentz symmetry violation. It allows us to investigate the effects in the dynamical equation and a geometrized nonlinear sigma model. The findings suggest significant implications for the spinor fields in regions with nontrivial topologies, providing a robust mathematical approach to studying exotic spinor behavior.</description>

      <title>Killing (super)algebras associated to connections on spinors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalise the notion of a Killing superalgebra which arises in the physics literature on supergravity to general dimension, signature and choice of spinor module and squaring map, and also allowing for Lie algebras as well as superalgebras, capturing a set of examples of such algebras on higher-dimensional spheres. We demonstrate that the definition requires a connection on a spinor bundle -- provided by supersymmetry transformations in the supergravity examples and by the Killing spinor equation on the spheres -- and obtain a set of sufficient conditions on such a connection for the Killing (super)algebra to exist. We show that these (super)algebras are filtered deformations of graded subalgebras of (a generalisation of) the Poincar\'e superalgebra and then study such deformations abstractly using Spencer cohomology. In the highly supersymmetric Lorentzian case, we describe the filtered subdeformations which are of the appropriate form to arise as Killing superalgebras, lay out a classification scheme for their odd-generated subalgebras and prove that, under certain technical conditions, there exist homogeneous Lorentzian spin manifolds on which these deformations are realised as Killing superalgebras. Our results generalise previous work in the 11-dimensional supergravity literature.</description>

Abstract: A dark sector with a very large number of massive degrees of freedom is generically constrained by radiative corrections to Newton's constant. However, there are caveats to this statement, especially if the degrees of freedom are light or mass-less. Here, we examine in detail and update a number of constraints on the possible number of dark degrees of freedom, including from black hole evaporation, from perturbations to systems including an evaporating black hole, from direct gravitational production at colliders, from high-energy cosmic rays, and from supernovae energy losses.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a Ricci coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes in scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity with an additional coupling between the scalar field and the Ricci scalar using non-linear simulations that employ excision. In this class of theories, black holes possess hair if they lie in a specific mass range, in which case they exhibit a finite-area singularity, unlike general relativity. Our results show that the Ricci coupling can mitigate the loss of hyperbolicity in spherical evolution with black hole initial data. Using excision can enlarge the parameter space for which the system remains well-posed, as one can excise the elliptic region that forms inside the horizon. Furthermore, we explore a possible relation between the loss of hyperbolicity and the formation of the finite-area singularity inside the horizon. We find that the location of the singularity extracted from the static analysis matches the location of the sonic line well. Finally, when possible, we extract the monopolar quasi-normal modes and the time scale of the linear tachyonic instability associated with scalarization. We also check our results by utilizing a continued fraction analysis and supposing linear perturbations of the static solutions.</description>

Abstract: We study the index of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Yang-Mills theory on $S^3\times\mathbb{R}$ at large angular momenta. A generalized Cardy limit exhibits macroscopic entropy at large $N$. Our result is derived using free QFT analysis, and also a background field method on $S^3$. The index sets a lower bound on the entropy. It saturates the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of known supersymmetric AdS$_5$ black holes, thus accounting for their microstates. We further analyze the so-called Macdonald index, exploring small black holes and possibly new black holes reminiscent of hairy black holes. Finally, we study aspects of large supersymmetric AdS$_7$ black holes, using background field method on $S^5$ and 't Hooft anomalies.</description>

Abstract: The quiver Yangians were originally defined for the quiver and superpotential from string theory on general toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, and serve as BPS algebras of these systems. Their characters reproduce the unrefined BPS indices, which correspond to classical Donaldson-Thomas (DT) invariants. We generalize this construction in two directions. First, we show that this definition extends to arbitrary quivers with potentials. Second, we explain how to define the characters to incorporate the refined BPS indices, which correspond to motivic DT invariants. We focus on two main classes of quivers: the BPS quivers of 4D $N=2$ theories and the quivers from the knot-quiver correspondence. The entire construction allows for straightforward generalizations to trigonometric, elliptic, and generalized cohomologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent no-go theorems have ruled out four-dimensional classical de Sitter vacua in heterotic string theory. On the other hand, the absence of a well-defined Wilsonian effective action and other related phenomena also appear to rule out such time-dependent vacua with de Sitter isometries, even in the presence of quantum corrections. In this note, we argue that a four-dimensional de Sitter space can still exist in SO(32) heterotic string theory as a Glauber-Sudarshan state, i.e. as a coherent state, over a supersymmetric Minkowski background, albeit within a finite temporal domain. Borel resummation and resurgence play a crucial role in constructing such a state in the Hilbert space of heterotic theory governed entirely by the IR degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Does the Cosmological Constant really indicate the existence of a Dark Dimension?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the "dark dimension" (DD) scenario, we might live in a universe with a single compact extra dimension, whose mesoscopic size is dictated by the measured value of the cosmological constant. This scenario is based on swampland conjectures, that lead to the relation $\rho_{\rm swamp}\sim m_{_{\rm KK}}^4$ between the vacuum energy $\rho_{\rm swamp}$ and the size of the extra dimension $m_{_{\rm KK}}^{-1}$ ($m_{_{\rm KK}}$ is the mass scale of a Kaluza-Klein tower), and on the corresponding result $\rho_{_{\rm EFT}}$ from the EFT limit. We show that $\rho_{_{\rm EFT}}$ contains previously missed UV-sensitive terms, whose presence invalidates the widely spread belief (based on existing literature) that the calculation gives automatically the finite result $\rho_{_{\rm EFT}}\sim m_{_{\rm KK}}^4$ (with no need for fine-tuning). This renders the matching between $\rho_{\rm swamp}$ and $\rho_{_{\rm EFT}}$ a non-trivial issue. We then comment on the necessity to find a mechanism that implements the suppression of the aforementioned UV-sensitive terms. This should finally allow to frame the DD scenario in a self-consistent framework, also in view of its several phenomenological applications based on EFT calculations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we find a class of Carrollian and Galilean contractions of (extended) BMS algebra in 3+1 and 2+1 dimensions. To this end, we investigate possible embeddings of 3D/4D Poincar\'{e} into the BMS${}_3$ and BMS${}_4$ algebras, respectively. The contraction limits in the 2+1-dimensional case are then enforced by appropriate contractions of its Poincar\'{e} subalgebras. In 3+1 dimensions, we have to apply instead the analogy between the structures of Poincar\'{e} and BMS algebra. In the case of non-vanishing cosmological constant in 2+1 dimensions, we consider the contractions of $\Lambda$-BMS${}_3$ algebra in an analogous manner.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzian from gauge theories</title>

Abstract: The continuum of holographic dual gravitational charges is recovered out of the discrete spectrum of $U(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM on $\mathbb{R}\times S^3\,$. In such a limit, the free energy of the free gauge theory is computed up to logarithmic contributions and exponentially suppressed contributions. Assuming the supergravity dual prediction to correctly capture strong-coupling results in field theory, the answer is bound to encode a complete low-temperature expansion of the Gibbons-Hawking gravitational on-shell action, valid well beyond the vicinity of supersymmetric black hole solutions. The formula recovers the long awaited Schwarzian contribution at low enough temperatures for certain choices of flows to the continuum. One such choice identifies the chemical potentials and thermodynamic charges in field theory with the chemical potentials and thermodynamic charges of the dual black holes. For such a flow the computed mass-gap kinematically matches the conjectured strong-coupling result obtained by Boruch, Heydeman, Iliesiu and Turiaci in supergravity, including small $1/\lambda$-corrections. The {emergent} reparameterizations, broken by the selection of the Schwarzian, correspond to redefinitions of the relevant cutoff scale. Observations are made regarding the existence of $\frac{1}{8}$-BPS black holes and how this is in tension with BPS inequalities. The RG-flow procedure leading to these results opens the way to understanding the emergence of chaos in gauge theories and its relation to non-extremal and non-supersymmetric black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Dark Dimension and the Effective Field Theory limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10068v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [1] we pointed out that in the Dark Dimension scenario [2] theoretical issues arise when the prediction for the vacuum energy $\rho$, that is obtained from swampland conjectures in string theory, is confronted with the corresponding result for $\rho$ in the effective field theory (EFT) limit. One of the problems concerns the widely spread belief that in higher dimensional EFTs with compact dimensions the vacuum energy is automatically finite. On the contrary, our analysis shows that $\rho$ contains (previously missed) UV-sensitive terms. Our work was challenged in [3]. Here we show why in our opinion the claims in [3] are flawed, and provide further support to our findings. We conclude presenting ideas on the physical mechanism that should dispose of the large UV contributions to $\rho$.</description>

      <title>What if string theory has a de Sitter excited state?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose precise effective field theory criteria to obtain a four-dimensional de Sitter space within M-theory. To this effect, starting with the state space described by the action of metric perturbations, fluxes etc over the supersymmetric Minkowski vacuum in eleven-dimensions, we discuss the most general low energy effective action in terms of the eleven-dimensional fields including non-perturbative and non-local terms. Given this, our criteria to obtain a valid four-dimensional de Sitter solution at far IR involve satisfying the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the associated path integral, as well as obeying positivity constraints on the dual IIA string coupling and its time derivative. For excited states, the Schwinger-Dyson equations imply an effective emergent potential different from the original potential. We show that while vacuum solutions and arbitrary coherent states fail to satisfy these criteria, a specific class of excited states called the Glauber-Sudarshan states obey them. Using the resurgent structure of observables computed using the path integral over the Glauber-Sudarshan states, four-dimensional de Sitter in the flat slicing can be constructed using a Glauber-Sudarshan state in M-theory.
  Among other novel results, we discuss the smallness of the positive cosmological constant, including the curious case where the cosmological constant is very slowly varying with time. We also discuss the resolution of identity with the Glauber-Sudarshan states, generation and the convergence properties of the non-perturbative and the non-local effects, the problems with the static patch and other related topics. We analyze briefly the issues related to the compatibility of the Wilsonian effective action with Borel resummations and discuss how they influence the effective field theory description in a four-dimensional de Sitter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The split-orthogonal symmetries of $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$ allow for an equivalence structure `${\sim}$', where two points are identified under exchange of space-like and time-like coordinates. We construct the topological quotient space $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}/{\sim}$ and demonstrate that it is Ricci flat with a degenerate metric on the hyperplane separating the two AdS$_3$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$. This allows us to embed a novel AdS$_3$ spacetime in $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}/{\sim}$ by joining two Poincar\'e patches with opposite signature across the degenerate hyperplane, which is not possible in regular $\mathbb{R}^{2,2}$. We find that this novel AdS$_3$ is globally hyperbolic and that its bulk supports a quantum field theory, which greatly simplifies its properties. Finally, we discuss how this novel AdS$_3$ appears to be T-dual to regular AdS$_3$ and examine the implications on its AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$ correspondence.</description>

Abstract: We formulate scalar field theories in a curved braided $L_\infty$-algebra formalism and analyse their correlation functions using Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. We perform detailed calculations in cubic braided scalar field theory up to two-loop order and three-point multiplicity. The divergent tadpole contributions are eliminated by a suitable choice of central curvature for the $L_\infty$-structure, and we confirm the absence of UV/IR mixing. The calculations of higher loop and higher multiplicity correlators in homological perturbation theory are facilitated by the introduction of a novel diagrammatic calculus. We derive an algebraic version of the Schwinger-Dyson equations based on the homological perturbation lemma, and use them to prove the braided Wick theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the one-loop effective potential of a derivative four-fermion model. As a result, an exact bumblebee-like potential is radiatively generated. Afterwards, we generalize our study for a finite temperature case and explicitly demonstrate the possibility of phase transitions allowing for the restoration of the Lorentz symmetry. We also investigate the low-energy effective action, from which we obtain the usual kinetic term and the corresponding bumblebee potential.</description>

      <title>Higher derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus and supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ignoring ten-dimensional heterotic gauge fields, heterotic supergravity reduced on a $d$-dimensional torus gives rise to a half-maximal supergravity coupled to $d$ vector multiplets. The reduced theory has a continuous $O(d,d;\mathbb R)/O(d)_-\times O(d)_+$ symmetry that persists to all perturbative orders in the string $\alpha'$ expansion. We highlight this symmetry by explicitly reducing the bosonic sector of four-derivative heterotic supergravity as well as its fermionic supersymmetry variations. After appropriate field redefinitions, the resulting action and supersymmetry variations are manifestly $O(d)_-\times O(d)_+$ invariant. This reduction allows us to explore the interplay between the gravity and vector multiplets beyond leading order, where (in our conventions) $O(d)_-$ is the supergravity R-symmetry while $O(d)_+$ is a flavor symmetry of the $d$ vector multiplets.</description>

      <title>Large $D$ gravity and low $D$ string via $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the correspondence between large $D$ gravity and low $D$ string theory to the most general case, including its T-dual solutions. It is well-known that the large $D$ limit of the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole in gravity becomes a two-dimensional near-horizon geometry. Similarly, the large $D$ limit of its T-dual solution, obtained by the Buscher rules, namely the string black hole with a naked singularity, reduces to a two-dimensional near-singularity geometry. Both of these geometries are described by the two-dimensional low-energy effective action of string theory and are related to each other by scale-factor duality. Secondly, we demonstrate that these near-horizon/singuglarity geometries, including complete $\alpha^{\prime}$ corrections, can be described by the two-dimensional Hohm-Zwiebach action. This approach allows for the derivation of non-perturbative and non-singular solutions. Furthermore, the Hohm-Zwiebach action provides a systematic way to investigate the $\alpha^{\prime}$-corrected near-horizon/singularity geometries of different kinds of black holes, which are difficult to achieve through the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model method.</description>

Abstract: The SymTFT construction is an efficient way of studying the symmetries of Quantum Field Theories. In this paper we initiate the study of the SymTFT construction for interacting theories on spaces with boundaries, in the concrete example of $d = 4$ $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills theory with Gaiotto-Witten boundary conditions. The resulting SymTFT has a number of peculiarities, most prominently a fan-like structure with a number of different SymTFT sectors joined by gapless interfaces that merge at the Gaiotto-Witten boundary SCFT.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Cosmology in 1+1 Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I construct a bouncing cosmology by considering the backreaction of the winding condensate on a 1+1 dimensional cosmological model with a periodic spatial coordinate. I based my work on previous results that considered the backreaction of the winding condensate on a 1+1 dimensional Euclidean black hole. This cosmological model is obtained as an analytic continuation of a Euclidean black hole. I solved the equations and obtained non-singular solutions at near-Hagedorn temperatures, both numerically and analytically. To remain within the weak coupling regime, it is necessary to connect two solutions; otherwise, the dilaton, which determines the string coupling, would grow quadratically. This connection is achieved through a smooth coordinate transformation, ensuring the model's validity. As a result, the model becomes geodesically complete and non-singular. The connection is made at a time in which the curvature is small, thereby avoiding higher-order $\alpha'$ corrections.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmological models with positive spatial curvature within the context of mimetic gravity theory by employing dynamical system techniques. Our analysis yields phase-space trajectories that describe physically relevant solutions, capturing various stages of cosmic evolution. We also employ Bayesian statistical analysis to constrain the cosmological parameters of the models, utilizing data from Type Ia supernovae and Hubble parameter data sets. The observational data sets provide support for the viability of mimetic gravity models, which can effectively describe the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

      <title>Generating Functions for Line Bundle Cohomology Dimensions on Complex Projective Varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of constructing multivariate generating functions for all cohomology dimensions of all holomorphic line bundles on certain complex projective varieties of Fano, Calabi-Yau and general type in various dimensions and Picard numbers. Most of the results are conjectural and rely on explicit cohomology computations. We first propose a generating function for the Euler characteristic of all holomorphic line bundles on complete intersections in products of projective spaces and toric varieties. This generating function is constructed by expanding the Hilbert-Poincare series associated with the coordinate ring of the variety around all possible combinations of zero and infinity and then summing up the resulting contributions with alternating signs. Similar generating functions are proposed for the individual cohomology dimensions of all holomorphic line bundles on certain complete intersections, including examples of Mori and non-Mori dream spaces. Surprisingly, the examples studied indicate that a single generating function encodes both the zeroth and all higher cohomologies upon expansion around different combinations of zero and infinity, raising the question whether such generating functions determine the variety uniquely.</description>

Abstract: We present a covariant description of non-vacuum static spherically symmetric spacetimes in $f(R)$ gravity applying the (1+1+2) covariant formalism. The propagation equations are then used to derive a covariant and dimensionless form of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. We then give a solution strategy to these equations and obtain some new exact solutions for the particular case $f(R)=R+\alpha R^{2}$, which have the correct thermodynamic properties for standard matter. We find that one of the solutions represents a stellar object with a unique structure called a double layer.</description>

      <title>Signatures of ultralight bosons in the orbital eccentricity of binary black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the existence of clouds of ultralight particles surrounding black holes during their cosmological history as members of a binary system can leave a measurable imprint on the distribution of masses and orbital eccentricities observable with future gravitational-wave detectors. Notably, we find that for nonprecessing binaries with chirp masses ${\cal M} \lesssim 10\,M_\odot$, formed exclusively in isolation, larger-than-expected values of the eccentricity, i.e. $e\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ at gravitational-wave frequencies $f_{\rm GW} \simeq 10^{-2}\,$Hz, would provide tantalizing evidence for a new particle of mass between $[0.5,2.5] \times 10^{-12}\,$eV in nature. The predicted evolution of the eccentricity can also drastically affect the in-band phase evolution and peak frequency. These results constitute unique signatures of boson clouds of ultralight particles in the dynamics of binary black holes, which will be readily accessible with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, as well as future mid-band and Deci-hertz detectors.</description>

      <title>Resonant history of gravitational atoms in black hole binaries</title>

Abstract: Rotating black holes can produce superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons. When the black hole is part of a binary system, its cloud can undergo resonances and ionization. These processes leave a distinct signature on the gravitational waveform that depends on the cloud's properties. To determine the state of the cloud by the time the system enters the band of future millihertz detectors, we study the chronological sequence of resonances encountered during the inspiral. For the first time, we consistently take into account the nonlinearities induced by the orbital backreaction and we allow the orbit to have generic eccentricity and inclination. We find that the resonance phenomenology exhibits striking new features. Resonances can "start" or "break" above critical thresholds of the parameters, which we compute analytically, and induce dramatic changes in eccentricity and inclination. Applying these results to realistic systems, we find two possible outcomes. If the binary and the cloud are sufficiently close to counter-rotating, the cloud survives in its original state until the system enters in band; otherwise, the cloud is destroyed during a resonance at large separations, but leaves an imprint on the eccentricity and inclination. In both scenarios, we characterize the observational signatures, with particular focus on future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Loop Corrections in Bispectrum in USR Inflation with PBHs Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the one-loop corrections in bispectrum of CMB scale perturbations induced from the small scale modes undergoing an intermediate phase of USR inflation in scenarios employed for PBHs formation. Using the formalism of effective field theory of inflation we calculate the cubic and quartic Hamiltonians and perform the in-in analysis for a subset of Feynman diagrams comprising both the cubic and the quartic exchange vertices. We show the one-loop corrections in bispectrum has the local shape with $f_{NL}$ having the same structure as the one-loop correction in power spectrum in their dependence on the duration of the USR phase and the sharpness of the transition to the final attractor phase. It is shown that in the models with a sharp transition the induced loop corrections in bispectrum can quickly violate the observational bounds on $f_{NL}$.</description>

      <title>A plethora of long-range neutrino interactions probed by DUNE and T2HK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upcoming neutrino experiments will soon search for new neutrino interactions more thoroughly than ever before, boosting the prospects of extending the Standard Model. In anticipation of this, we forecast the capability of two of the leading long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, DUNE and T2HK, to look for new flavor-dependent neutrino interactions with electrons, protons, and neutrons that could affect the transitions between different flavors. We interpret their sensitivity in the context of long-range neutrino interactions, mediated by a new neutral boson lighter than $10^{-10}$ eV, and sourced by the vast amount of nearby and distant matter in the Earth, Moon, Sun, Milky Way, and beyond. For the first time, we explore the sensitivity of DUNE and T2HK to a wide variety of $U(1)^\prime$ symmetries, built from combinations of lepton and baryon numbers, each of which induces new interactions that affect oscillations differently. We find ample sensitivity: in all cases, DUNE and T2HK may constrain the existence of the new interaction even if it is supremely feeble, may discover it, and, in some cases, may identify the symmetry responsible for it.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in primordial tensor non-Gaussianities from matter bounce cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that primordial tensor non-Gaussianities from a cubic Weyl action with a non-dynamical coupling are suppressed by the so-called slow-roll parameter in a conventional framework of slow-roll inflation. In this paper, we consider matter bounce cosmology in which the background spacetime is no longer quasi-de Sitter, and hence one might expect that the matter bounce models could predict non-suppressed non-Gaussianities. Nevertheless, we first show that the corresponding non-Gaussian amplitudes from the cubic Weyl term with a non-dynamical coupling are much smaller than those from the conventional slow-roll inflation, in spite of the fact that there is no slow-roll suppression. We then introduce a dynamical coupling that can boost the magnitude of graviton cubic interactions and clarify that there is a parameter region where the tensor non-Gaussianities can be enhanced and can potentially be tested by cosmic microwave background experiments.</description>

      <title>Galaxy groups in the presence of Cosmological Constant: Increasing the Masses of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14944v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boundaries of galaxy groups and clusters are defined by the interplay between the Newtonian attractive force and the decoupling from the local expansion of the Universe. This work extends the definition of a zero radial acceleration surface (ZRAS) and the turnaround surface (TS) for a general distribution of the masses in an expanding background, governed by the cosmological constant. We apply these definitions to different galaxy groups in the local Universe, mapping these groups up to ten megaparsec distances. We discuss the dipole and the quadrupole rate for the Local Group of Galaxies and the implementations on the Hubble diagram correction and galaxy groups virialization. With these definitions, we present the surfaces showing the interplay between the local expansion vs the local Newtonian attraction for galaxy groups in the local Universe. Further, we estimate the masses of different galaxy groups and show that the inclusion of the Cosmological Constant in the analysis predicts these masses to be higher by 5-10\%. For instance the Local Group of Galaxies is estimated to be $(2.47 \pm 0.08) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. For the groups with enough tracers close to the TS, the contribution of the Cosmological Constant makes the masses to be even higher. The results show the importance of including the local cosmic expansion in analyzing the Cosmic Flow of the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of interacting particles, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures exclusively the integrated quantum metric. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free fermions, we unveil an intimate connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Towards an Interpretation of the First Measurements of Energy Correlators in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently been proposed as a class of jet substructure observables that directly link experimental measurements of the asymptotic energy flux with the field theoretic description of the underlying microscopic dynamics. This link holds particular promise in heavy-ion physics, where both experimental measurements and theoretical interpretations are inherently complex. With recent measurements of energy correlators in proton-proton collisions, the first measurement of these observables on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions underscores the importance of a theoretical understanding of their behavior in this complex environment. In this manuscript, we extend our previous calculations to account for several effects necessary for a qualitative understanding of the behavior of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions. Through a semi-analytic approach implemented in a hydrodynamically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP), we account for medium-induced radiation with leading broadening effects, selection biases arising from energy loss, and a description of the confinement transition. Our results represent a crucial first step towards interpreting the measurements of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions, which marks a significant milestone in connecting heavy-ion experiment and fundamental quantum field theory, in the quest to disentangle the microscopic dynamics of the QGP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons can leave an imprint on the gravitational waveform of black hole binaries through "ionization" and "resonances." We study the sequence of resonances as the binary evolves, and show that there are only two possible outcomes, each with a distinct imprint on the waveform. If the cloud and the binary are nearly counter-rotating, then the cloud survives in its original state until it enters the sensitivity band of future gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. In all other cases, resonances destroy the cloud, while driving the binary to co-rotate with it and its eccentricity close to a fixed point. This opens up the possibility of inferring the existence of a new boson from the statistical analysis of a population of black hole binaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in four spacetime dimensions is reviewed with the emphasis on impact of quantum gravity corrections. As a specific example of the quantum corrections, the Grisaru-Zanon quartic curvature terms in the gravitational effective action of closed superstrings are chosen. Those quartic curvature terms are compared to the Bel-Robinson tensor squared in a flat Friedman universe, and the upper bound on the effective string coupling constant is found by demanding unitarity (causality) and the absence of ghosts. It is found that the quantum corrections to the observables (tilts) of the cosmic microwave background radiation in the Starobinsky inflation may be of the same order of magnitude as the next-to-next-to-next classical contributions in the Starobinsky model with respect to the inverse powers of the e-folding number at the horizon crossing.</description>

      <title>Diffusive hydrodynamics from long-range correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the hydrodynamic theory, the non-equilibrium dynamics of a many-body system is approximated, at large scales of space and time, by irreversible relaxation to local entropy maximisation. This results in a convective equation corrected by viscous or diffusive terms in a gradient expansion, such as the Navier-Stokes equations. Diffusive terms are evaluated using the Kubo formula, and possibly arising from an emergent noise due to discarded microscopic degrees of freedom. In one dimension of space, diffusive scaling is often broken as noise leads to super-diffusion. But in linearly degenerate hydrodynamics, such as that of integrable models, diffusive behaviors are observed, and it has long be thought that the standard diffusive picture remains valid. In this letter, we show that in such systems, the Navier-Stokes equation breaks down beyond linear response. We demonstrate that diffusive-order corrections do not take the form of a gradient expansion. Instead, they are completely determined by ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations, and obtained from the non-local two-point correlations recently predicted by the ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory (BMFT); the resulting hydrodynamic equations are reversible. To do so, we establish a regularised fluctuation theory, putting on a firm basis the recent idea that ballistic transport of initial-state fluctuations determines fluctuations and correlations beyond the Euler scale. This extends the idea of ``diffusion from convection'' previously developed to explain the Kubo formula in integrable systems, to generic non-equilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>Multidimensionality of the Hubble tension: the roles of $\Omega_m$ and $\omega_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important implications for parameters beyond $H_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density $\omega_c$. We argue that once $\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density $\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for $\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ requires raising $\omega_c$ and, under minimal assumptions, also the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify that this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a calibration of $\Omega_m$ as reliable and model-independent as possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements.</description>

In this note we present the results of the computation of the $V_n$ polynomials for $n=1,2,3,4$ and discover applications and emerging patterns, including unexpected Conway mutations that seem undetected by the $V_n$-polynomials as well as by Heegaard Floer Homology and Khovanov Homology.

      <title>Local descriptions of the heterotic SU(3) moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The heterotic $SU(3)$ system, also known as the Hull--Strominger system, arises from compactifications of heterotic string theory to six dimensions. This paper investigates the local structure of the moduli space of solutions to this system on a compact 6-manifold $X$, using a vector bundle $Q=(T^{1,0}X)^* \oplus {End}(E) \oplus T^{1,0}X$, where $E\to X$ is the classical gauge bundle arising in the system. We establish that the moduli space has an expected dimension of zero. We achieve this by studying the deformation complex associated to a differential operator $\bar{D}$, which emulates a holomorphic structure on $Q$, and demonstrating an isomorphism between the two cohomology groups which govern the infinitesimal deformations and obstructions in the deformation theory for the system. We also provide a Dolbeault-type theorem linking these cohomology groups to \v{C}ech cohomology, a result which might be of independent interest, as well as potentially valuable for future research.</description>
