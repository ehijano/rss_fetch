      <title>SyncGait: Robust Long-Distance Authentication for Drone Delivery via Implicit Gait Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, drone delivery, which utilizes unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for package delivery and pickup, has gradually emerged as a crucial method in logistics. Since delivery drones are expensive and may carry valuable packages, they must maintain a safe distance from individuals until user-drone mutual authentication is confirmed. Despite numerous authentication schemes being developed, existing solutions are limited in authentication distance and lack resilience against sophisticated attacks. To this end, we introduce SyncGait, an implicit gait-based mutual authentication system for drone delivery. SyncGait leverages the user's unique arm swing as he walks toward the drone to achieve mutual authentication without requiring additional hardware or specific authentication actions. We conducted extensive experiments on 14 datasets collected from 31 subjects. The results demonstrate that SyncGait achieves an average accuracy of 99.84\% at a long distance ($&gt;18m$) and exhibits strong resilience against various spoofing attacks, making it a robust, secure, and user-friendly solution in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>AHA: Aligning Large Audio-Language Models for Reasoning Hallucinations via Counterfactual Hard Negatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) deliver state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, they frequently suffer from hallucinations, e.g. generating text not grounded in the audio input. We analyze these grounding failures and identify a distinct taxonomy: Event Omission, False Event Identity, Temporal Relation Error, and Quantitative Temporal Error. To address this, we introduce the AHA (Audio Hallucination Alignment) framework. By leveraging counterfactual hard negative mining, our pipeline constructs a high-quality preference dataset that forces models to distinguish strict acoustic evidence from linguistically plausible fabrications. Additionally, we establish AHA-Eval, a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously test these fine-grained temporal reasoning capabilities. We apply this data to align Qwen2.5-Omni. The resulting model, Qwen-Audio-AHA, achieves a 13.7% improvement on AHA-Eval. Crucially, this benefit generalizes beyond our diagnostic set. Our model shows substantial gains on public benchmarks, including 1.3% on MMAU-Test and 1.6% on MMAR, outperforming latest SOTA methods.</description>

      <title>Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels for Cross-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.</description>

      <title>Factorized Learning for Temporally Grounded Video-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.</description>

      <title>LiftProj: Space Lifting and Projection-Based Panorama Stitching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360{\deg} closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360{\deg} panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.</description>

      <title>Generative Video Compression: Towards 0.01% Compression Rate for Video Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether a video can be compressed at an extreme compression rate as low as 0.01%? To this end, we achieve the compression rate as 0.02% at some cases by introducing Generative Video Compression (GVC), a new framework that redefines the limits of video compression by leveraging modern generative video models to achieve extreme compression rates while preserving a perception-centric, task-oriented communication paradigm, corresponding to Level C of the Shannon-Weaver model. Besides, How we trade computation for compression rate or bandwidth? GVC answers this question by shifting the burden from transmission to inference: it encodes video into extremely compact representations and delegates content reconstruction to the receiver, where powerful generative priors synthesize high-quality video from minimal transmitted information. Is GVC practical and deployable? To ensure practical deployment, we propose a compression-computation trade-off strategy, enabling fast inference on consume-grade GPUs. Within the AI Flow framework, GVC opens new possibility for video communication in bandwidth- and resource-constrained environments such as emergency rescue, remote surveillance, and mobile edge computing. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that GVC offers a viable path toward a new effective, efficient, scalable, and practical video communication paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing open-source film restoration methods show limited performance compared to commercial methods due to training with low-quality synthetic data and employing noisy optical flows. In addition, high-resolution films have not been explored by the open-source methods.We propose HaineiFRDM(Film Restoration Diffusion Model), a film restoration framework, to explore diffusion model's powerful content-understanding ability to help human expert better restore indistinguishable film defects.Specifically, we employ a patch-wise training and testing strategy to make restoring high-resolution films on one 24GB-VRAMR GPU possible and design a position-aware Global Prompt and Frame Fusion Modules.Also, we introduce a global-local frequency module to reconstruct consistent textures among different patches. Besides, we firstly restore a low-resolution result and use it as global residual to mitigate blocky artifacts caused by patching process.Furthermore, we construct a film restoration dataset that contains restored real-degraded films and realistic synthetic data.Comprehensive experimental results conclusively demonstrate the superiority of our model in defect restoration ability over existing open-source methods. Code and the dataset will be released.</description>

      <title>GestureHYDRA: Semantic Co-speech Gesture Synthesis via Hybrid Modality Diffusion Transformer and Cascaded-Synchronized Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While increasing attention has been paid to co-speech gesture synthesis, most previous works neglect to investigate hand gestures with explicit and essential semantics. In this paper, we study co-speech gesture generation with an emphasis on specific hand gesture activation, which can deliver more instructional information than common body movements. To achieve this, we first build a high-quality dataset of 3D human body movements including a set of semantically explicit hand gestures that are commonly used by live streamers. Then we present a hybrid-modality gesture generation system GestureHYDRA built upon a hybrid-modality diffusion transformer architecture with novelly designed motion-style injective transformer layers, which enables advanced gesture modeling ability and versatile gesture operations. To guarantee these specific hand gestures can be activated, we introduce a cascaded retrieval-augmented generation strategy built upon a semantic gesture repository annotated for each subject and an adaptive audio-gesture synchronization mechanism, which substantially improves semantic gesture activation and production efficiency. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance over all the counterparts.

      <title>Automatic Stage Lighting Control: Is it a Rule-Driven Process or Generative Task?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stage lighting is a vital component in live music performances, shaping an engaging experience for both musicians and audiences. In recent years, Automatic Stage Lighting Control (ASLC) has attracted growing interest due to the high costs of hiring or training professional lighting engineers. However, most existing ASLC solutions only classify music into limited categories and map them to predefined light patterns, resulting in formulaic and monotonous outcomes that lack rationality. To address this gap, this paper presents Skip-BART, an end-to-end model that directly learns from experienced lighting engineers and predict vivid, human-like stage lighting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to conceptualize ASLC as a generative task rather than merely a classification problem. Our method adapts the BART model to take audio music as input and produce light hue and value (intensity) as output, incorporating a novel skip connection mechanism to enhance the relationship between music and light within the frame grid. To address the lack of available datasets, we create the first stage lighting dataset, along with several pre-training and transfer learning techniques to improve model training with limited data. We validate our method through both quantitative analysis and an human evaluation, demonstrating that Skip-BART outperforms conventional rule-based methods across all evaluation metrics and shows only a limited gap compared to real lighting engineers. To support further research, we have made our self-collected dataset, code, and trained model parameters available at https://github.com/RS2002/Skip-BART .</description>

      <title>Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs on Spatial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13142v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence (SI). We thus propose EASI for holistic Evaluation of multimodAl LLMs on Spatial Intelligence. EASI conceptualizes a comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a growing collection of newly curated ones, enabling systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art models. In this report, we conduct the study across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in SI, yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail the most advanced multimodal models. EASI is an ongoing community effort: we have open-sourced the EASI codebase that provides a one-stop and reproducible solution with standardized interfaces, integrated protocols and prompts that significantly reduce the friction of configuring and running multiple benchmarks; we have also launched an accompanying EASI leaderboard to provide a continually updated snapshot of model performance across the full SI spectrum, accelerating collective progress toward robust SI.</description>

      <title>Scaling Spatial Intelligence with Multimodal Foundation Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Federated Multi-Task Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral clustering has emerged as one of the most effective clustering algorithms due to its superior performance. However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.</description>
