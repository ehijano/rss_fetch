      <title>Combinatorial Courant-Fischer-Weyl Minimax Principle on Cheeger $k$-constants of Weighted Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish novel max-min and minimax characterizations of Cheeger $k$-constants in weighted forests, thereby providing the first combinatorial analogue of the Courant-Fischer-Weyl minimax principle. As for applications, we prove that the forest 1-Laplacian variational eigenvalues are independent of the choice of typical indexes; we propose a refined higher order Cheeger inequality involving numbers of loops of graphs and $p$-Laplacian eigenvalues; and we present a combinatorial proof for the equality $h_k=\lambda_k(\Delta_1)$ which connects the 1-Laplacian variational eigenvalues and the multiway Cheeger constants.</description>

      <title>On convergence structures in infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a graph admits a natural closure operator defined on its vertex set, which also corresponds to a pretopology. In this paper, we describe the classical pretopology on a graph in terms of nets, with the aim of relating combinatorial properties to convergence properties.</description>

      <title>Super-minimally $3$-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce super-minimally $k$-connected graphs, those $k$-connected graphs in which no proper subgraph is $k$-connected. For $k$ greater than or equal to three, this class lies strictly between the classes of minimally $k$-connected graphs and uniformly $k$-connected graphs. In particular, we determine the minimum number of degree-$3$ vertices in a super-minimally $3$-connected graph, thereby extending a result of Halin on minimally $3$-connected graphs. In addition, we determine the maximum number of edges in a super-minimally $3$-connected graph, extending Xu's result for uniformly $3$-connected graphs, and providing an analogue of Halin's result for minimally $3$-connected graphs.</description>

      <title>On orientations preserving edge-connectivity in infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every 2k-edge-connected graph with countably many edge-ends admits a k-arc-connected orientation, extending the previous result by Assem, Koloschin and Pitz that also assumed the hypothesis of the graph being locally finite. We prove that, if every locally finite graph has a well-balanced orientation, so does every graph. Lastly, we explore an alternative to the Nash-Williams Orientation Conjecture via topological paths, and prove that it is true for every finitely separated graph.</description>

      <title>Sum of elements preceding records in set partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to derive an explicit formula for the total number of elements preceding records over all set partitions of $[n]$ with exactly $k$ blocks, as well as an asymptotic estimate for the total sum of elements preceding records in all set partitions of $[n]$, expressed in terms of Bell numbers. To achieve this, we analyze the generating function that enumerates set partitions of $[n]$ according to this statistic, which we denote by $\sumelements$.</description>

      <title>Trickle-down Theorems via C-Lorentzian Polynomials II: Pairwise Spectral Influence and Improved Dobrushin's Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a probability distribution on a multi-state spin system on a set $V$ of sites. Equivalently, we can think of this as a $d$-partite simplical complex with distribution $\mu$ on maximal faces. For any pair of vertices $u,v\in V$, define the pairwise spectral influence $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ as follows. Let $\sigma$ be a choice of spins $s_w\in S_w$ for every $w\in V \setminus \{u,v\}$, and construct a matrix in $\mathbb{R}^{(S_u\cup S_v)\times (S_u\cup S_v)}$ where for any $s_u\in S_u, s_v\in S_v$, the $(us_u,vs_v)$-entry is the probability that $s_v$ is the spin of $v$ conditioned on $s_u$ being the spin of $u$ and on $\sigma$. Then $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is the maximal second eigenvalue of this matrix, over all choices of spins for all $w \in V \setminus \{u,v\}$. Equivalently, $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is the maximum local spectral expansion of links of codimension $2$ that include a spin for every $w \in V \setminus \{u,v\}$.
  We show that if the largest eigenvalue of the pairwise spectral influence matrix with entries $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ is bounded away from 1, i.e. $\lambda_{\max}(\mathcal{I})\leq 1-\epsilon$ (and $X$ is connected), then the Glauber dynamics mixes rapidly and generate samples from $\mu$. This improves/generalizes the classical Dobrushin's influence matrix as the $\mathcal{I}_{u,v}$ lower-bounds the classical influence of $u\to v$. As a by-product, we also prove improved/almost optimal trickle-down theorems for partite simplicial complexes. The proof builds on the trickle-down theorems via $\mathcal{C}$-Lorentzian polynomials machinery recently developed by the authors and Lindberg.</description>

      <title>On defining Kemeny's constant for non-backtracking random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two possible definitions for a version of Kemeny's constant of a graph based on non-backtracking random walks (in place of the usual simple random walk). We show that these two definitions coincide for edge-transitive graphs, and give a condition generalizing edge-transitive for which equality holds, and investigate by how much they can differ in general. We compute our non-backtracking Kemeny's constant for several families of graphs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of a graph $G$ is the set of the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. It turns out that one can say a lot about a graph with the only knowledge being the spectrum of this graph. In this paper we obtain new results about the spectrum of $G(n, \alpha n, \alpha^2 n)$ graphs. We then apply these results to get a giant component theorem for them.</description>

      <title>A short proof of the best known upper bound $3.6108$ on the growth of polyiamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a short and elementary proof that the growth rate of polyiamonds is at most $1+2z+3z^2$ for the only real root $z$ of the equation $2z^3+z^2-1=0$, which is nearly identical to, but slightly below, the best known upper bound $3.6108$. Unlike the previous proof of this bound, which relied on computer-assisted technical arguments and the counts of polyiamonds with up to 75 triangles, our method is based on a straightforward recurrence that can be verified by hand with minimal effort.</description>

      <title>Cop number of partial cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of Cops and Robbers on graphs is a well-studied pursuit--evasion model whose central parameter, the cop number, captures the minimum number of pursuers required to guarantee capture of an adversary on a given graph. While the cop number has been determined for many classical graph families, relatively little is known about the important class of partial cubes, i.e., isometric subgraphs of hypercubes.
  In this paper, we establish a lower bound for the cop number of partial cubes and present an upper bound on a subclass of partial cubes. Additionally, we improve these bounds for a particular family of partial cubes: Fibonacci cubes. These graphs are defined as induced subgraphs of hypercubes obtained by forbidding consecutive ones in binary strings. Beyond their natural combinatorial interest, Fibonacci cubes have connections to chemical graph theory, where they serve as models for resonance graphs of certain classes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>Behavior of The Extremal Bounds on the $\sigma$-Irregularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establishe the extremal bounds of the topological indices -- Sigma index -- focusing on analyzing the sharp upper bounds and the lower bounds of the Sigma index, which is known $\sigma(G)=\sum_{uv\in E(G)}(d_G(u)-d_G(v))^2$. We establish precise lower and upper bounds for the Sigma index, leveraging a non-increasing degree sequence $\mathscr{D} = (d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n)$, A fundamental challenge in the study of topological indices lies in establishing precise bounds, as such findings illuminate intrinsic relationships among diverse indices.</description>

      <title>Extending Ghouila-Houri's Characterization of Comparability Graphs to Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An orientation of a given static graph is called transitive if for any three vertices $a,b,c$, the presence of arcs $(a,b)$ and $(b,c)$ forces the presence of the arc $(a,c)$. If only the presence of an arc between $a$ and $c$ is required, but its orientation is unconstrained, the orientation is called quasi-transitive. A fundamental result presented by Ghouila-Houri guarantees that any static graph admitting a quasi-transitive orientation also admits a transitive orientation. In a seminal work, Mertzios et al. introduced the notion of temporal transitivity in order to model information flows in simple temporal networks. We revisit the model introduced by Mertzios et al. and propose an analogous to Ghouila-Houri's characterization for the temporal scenario. We present a structure theorem that will allow us to express by a 2-SAT formula all the constraints imposed by temporal transitive orientations. The latter produces an efficient recognition algorithm for graphs admitting such orientations. Additionally, we extend the temporal transitivity model to temporal graphs having multiple time-labels associated to their edges and claim that the previous results hold in the multilabel setting. Finally, we propose a characterization of temporal comparability graphs via forbidden temporal ordered patterns.</description>

      <title>Toughness in regular graphs from eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\it toughness} $\tau(G)=\mathrm{min}\{\frac{|S|}{c(G-S)}: S~\mbox{is a vertex cut in}~G\}$ for $G\ncong K_n,$ which was initially proposed by Chv\'{a}tal in 1973. A graph $G$ is called {\it $t$-tough} if $\tau(G)\geq t.$ Let $\lambda_i(G)$ be the $i$-th largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of a graph $G$. In 1996, Brouwer conjectured that $\tau(G)\geq\frac{d}{\lambda}-1$ for a connected $d$-regular graph $G,$ where $\lambda=\mathrm{min}\{|\lambda_2|, |\lambda_n|\}.$ Gu [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 35 (2021) 948-952] completely confirmed this conjecture. From Brouwer and Gu's result $\tau(G)\geq\frac{d}{\lambda}-1,$ we know that if $G$ is a connected $d$-regular graph and $\lambda\leq\frac{bd}{b+1}$, then $\tau(G)\geq\frac{1}{b}$ for an integer $b\geq1.$ Inspired by the above result and utilizing typical spectral techniques and graph construction methods from Cioab\u{a} et al. [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 99 (2009) 287-297], we prove that if $G$ is a connected $d$-regular graph and $\lambda_2(G)&lt;\phi(d,b)$, then $\tau(G)\geq\frac{1}{b}$. Meanwhile, we construct graphs implying that the upper bound on $\lambda_2(G)$ is best possible. Our theorem strengthens the result of Chen et al. [Discrete Math. 348 (2025) 114404]. Finally, we also prove an upper bound of $\lambda_{b+1}(G)$ to guarantee a connected $d$-regular graph to be $\frac{1}{b}$-tough.</description>

      <title>Fractional Clique Decompositions of Dense Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2014, Keevash famously proved the existence of $(n,q,r)$-Steiner systems as part of settling the Existence Conjecture of Combinatorial Designs (dating from the mid-1800s). In 2020, Glock, K\"uhn, and Osthus conjectured a minimum degree generalization: specifically that minimum $(r-1)$-degree at least $(1-\frac{C}{q^{r-1}})n$ suffices to guarantee that every sufficiently large $K_q^r$-divisible $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices admits a $K_q^r$-decomposition (where $C$ is a constant that is allowed to depend on $r$ but not $q$). The best-known progress on this conjecture is from the second proof of the Existence Conjecture by Glock, K\"uhn, Lo, and Osthus in 2016 who showed that $(1-\frac{C}{q^{2r}})n$ suffices. The fractional relaxation of the conjecture is crucial to improving the bound; for that, only the slightly better bound of $(1-\frac{C}{q^{2r-1}})n$ was known due to Barber, K\"uhn, Lo, Montgomery, and Osthus from 2017. Our main result is to prove that $(1-\frac{C}{q^{r-1+o(1)}})n$ suffices for the fractional relaxation. Combined with the work of R{\"o}dl, Schacht, Siggers, and Tokushige from 2007, this also shows that such hypergraphs admit approximate $K_q^r$-decompositions.</description>

      <title>Geometry of dyadic polygons II: isomorphisms of dyadic triangles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of a two-part paper investigating the structure and properties of dyadic polygons. A dyadic polygon is the intersection of the dyadic subplane $D^2$ of the real plane $R^2$ and a real convex polygon with vertices in the dyadic plane. Such polygons are described as subreducts (subalgebras of reducts) of the affine dyadic plane $D^2$, or equivalently as commutative, entropic and idempotent groupoids under the binary operation of arithmetic mean. The first part of the paper contained a new classification of dyadic triangles, considered as such groupoids, and a characterization of dyadic triangles with a pointed vertex. This second part investigates isomorphisms of dyadic triangles, and provides a full classification of their isomorphism types.</description>

      <title>Classification and Ideal Lattices of Leavitt Path Algebras</title>

Abstract: Leavitt path algebras are free algebras subject to relations induced by directed graphs. This paper investigates the ideals of Leavitt path algebras, with an emphasis on the relationship between graph-theoretic properties of a directed graph and the ideals of the associated Leavitt path algebra. We begin by presenting a new proof of a fundamental result characterizing graded and non-graded ideals of a Leavitt path algebra using a condition on the number of closed paths at each vertex in its directed graph. Appealing to this result, we then classify the Leavitt path algebras of directed graphs with two vertices up to isomorphism and determine all possible lattice structures of a class of well-behaved ideals possessed by such algebras.</description>

      <title>Progress in the study of the (non)existence of genuinely unextendible product bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the open problem of the existence of genuinely unextendible product bases (GUPBs), that is, multipartite unextendible product bases (UPBs) which remain unextendible even with respect to biproduct vectors across all bipartitions of the parties. To this end, we exploit the well-known connection between UPBs and graph theory through orthogonality graphs and orthogonal representations, together with recent progress in this framework, and employ forbidden induced subgraph characterizations to single out the admissible local orthogonality graphs for GUPBs. Using this approach, we establish that GUPBs of size thirteen in three-qutrit systems-the smallest candidate GUPBs-do not exist. We further provide a partial characterization of graphs relevant to larger bases and systems with ququart subsystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A family of compact n-manifolds is locally combinatorially defined (LCD) if it can be specified by a finite number of local triangulations. We show that LCD is equivalent to the existence of a compact branched n-manifold W, such that the family is precisely those manifolds that immerse into W. In subsequent papers, the equivalence will be used to show that, for each of the eight Thurston geometries, the family of closed 3-manifolds admitting that geometry is LCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a loopless matroid $M$, we construct a $K$-class $T_M\in K(X_{M})$. When $M$ is realizable, $T_M$ recovers the $K$-class of the tangent bundle of the wonderful compactification $W_L$. We derive two formulas for the total Chern class of $T_M$ and prove that the associated Todd class agrees with the Todd class appearing in the matroid Hirzebruch--Riemann--Roch formula. We define a ``fake effective cone'' so that big and nef divisors in a matroid can be characterized in a manner analogous to how the effective cone characterizes big and nef divisors in classical algebraic geometry. Finally, we define the classes $\beta_S$ and study their properties.</description>

      <title>A class of graphs: Bridging structures in commutative algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize classes of simplicial complexes $\Delta$ for which the generators of the determinantal facet ideal $J_\Delta$ form a reduced Gr\"{o}bner basis. This result provides a new proof for a known fact about determinantal ideals in a special case and extends several existing results concerning binomial edge ideals and determinantal facet ideals.
  We also introduce and examine generalizations of interval graphs and proper interval graphs, aiming to establish equivalent characterizations for these classes. These formulations enable several algebraic applications, including constructing examples of Cohen--Macaulay normal rings, identifying Gr\"{o}bner bases for binomial edge ideals of proper interval graphs, and deriving equivalent conditions for the sortability of $t$-independence complexes. These results demonstrate how the proposed graph-theoretic structures enrich the interplay between combinatorics and commutative algebra, building upon and extending existing connections in the literature.</description>

      <title>On Klee's problem of convex bodies in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that every convex body in a finite dimensional normed space can be uniformly approximated by strictly convex and smooth convex bodies. However, in the case of infinite dimensions, little progress has been made since Klee asked how it is in the case of infinite dimensions in 1959. In this paper, we show that for an infinite dimensional Banach space $X$, (1) every convex body can be uniformly approximated by strictly convex bodies if and only if $X$ admits an equivalent strictly convex norm; (2) every convex body can be uniformly approximated by G\^{a}teaux smooth convex bodies if the dual $X^*$ of $X$ admits an equivalent strictly convex dual norm; in particular, (3) if $X$ is either separable, or reflexive, then every convex body in $X$ can be uniformly approximated by strictly convex and smooth convex bodies. They are done by showing that some correspondences among the sets of all convex bodies endowed with the Hausdorff metric, all continuous coercive Minkowski functionals and Fenchel's transform defined on all quadratic homogenous continuous convex functions equipped with the metric induced by the sup-norm of all bounded continuous functions defined on the closed unit ball $B_X$ are actually locally Lipschitz isomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Brun's inequality for a geometric lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper of 1915, V. Brun introduced Brun's sieve, which is based on Brun's inequality for the M\"{o}bius function and is a very powerful tool in modern number theory. The importance of the M\"{o}bius function in enumeration problems led G.-C. Rota to introduce the concept of the M\"{o}bius function to partially ordered sets. In this article, we prove Brun's inequality for geometric lattices and develop a sieve in this context. One of the main ingredients is a recent work of K. Adiprasito, J. Huh, and E. Katz on the log-concavity of absolute values of the Whitney numbers associated with matroids. We also study shifted convolutions of the Whitney numbers associated with Dowling lattices. Further, we derive an asymptotic formula for generalized Dowling numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a model of $N$ independent, increasing $\mathbb{N}_0$-valued processes, with random, independent waiting times between jumps. It is known that there is either an emergent `leader', in which a single process possesses the maximal value for all sufficiently large times, or every pair of processes alternates leadership infinitely often. We show that in the latter regime, almost surely, one sees every possible permutation of rankings of processes infinitely often. In the case that the waiting times are exponentially distributed, this proves a conjecture from Spencer (appearing in a paper from Oliveira) on the `balls-in-bins' process with feedback [Conjecture 1, Combin. Probab. Comput. 17(1):87-110, (2008)].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The binomial notation (w u) represents the number of occurrences of the word u as a (scattered) subword in w. We first introduce and study possible uses of a geometrical interpretation of (w ab) and (w ba) when a and b are distinct letters. We then study the structure of the 2-binomial equivalence class of a binary word w (two words are 2-binomially equivalent if they have the same binomial coefficients, that is, the same numbers of occurrences, for each word of length at most 2). Especially we prove the existence of an isomorphism between the graph of the 2-binomial equivalence class of w with respect to a particular rewriting rule and the lattice of partitions of the integer (w ab) with (w a) parts and greatest part bounded by (w b). Finally we study binary fair words, the words over {a, b} having the same numbers of occurrences of ab and ba as subwords ((w ab) = (w ba)). In particular, we prove a recent conjecture related to a special case of the least square approximation.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T&gt; n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta&gt;0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a longstanding open problem to find a bijection exchanging area and bounce statistics on Dyck paths. We settle this problem for an exponentially large subset of Dyck paths via an explicit bijection. Moreover, we prove that this bijection is natural by showing that it maps what we call bounce-minimal paths to area-minimal paths. As a consequence of the proof ideas, we show combinatorially that a path with area $a$ and bounce $b$ exists if and only if a path with area $b$ and bounce $a$ exists. We finally show that the number of distinct values of the sum of the area and bounce statistics is the number of nonzero coefficients in Johnson's $q$-Bell polynomial.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we present an elementary proof of the fact that the slice rank of a trilinear form over a finite field is bounded above by a linear expression in the analytic rank. The existing proofs by Adiprasito-Kazhdan-Ziegler and Cohen-Moshkovitz both rely on results of Derksen via geometric invariant theory. A novel feature of our proof is that the linear forms appearing in the slice rank decomposition are obtained from the trilinear form by fixing coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new upper and lower bounds on transversal numbers of several classes of simplicial complexes. Specifically, we establish an upper bound on the transversal numbers of pure simplicial complexes in terms of the number of vertices and the number of facets, and then provide constructions of pure simplicial complexes whose transversal numbers come close to this bound. We introduce a new family of $d$-dimensional polytopes that could be considered as ``siblings'' of cyclic polytopes and show that the transversal ratios of such odd-dimensional polytopes are $2/5-o(1)$. The previous record for the transversal ratios of $(2k+1)$-polytopes was $1/(k+1)$. Finally, we construct infinite families of $3$-, $4$-, and $5$-dimensional simplicial spheres with transversal ratios converging to $4/7$, $1/2$, and $6/11$, respectively. The previous record was $11/21$, $2/5$, and $1/2$, respectively.</description>

Abstract: A graph $\Gamma$ is called edge-regular whenever it is regular and for any two adjacent vertices, the number of their common neighbors is independent of the choice of vertices. A clique $C$ in $\Gamma$ is called regular whenever for any vertex out of $C$, the number of its neighbors in $C$ is independent of the vertex. A Neumaier graph is a non-complete edge-regular graph with a regular clique. In this paper, we study vertex-transitive Neumaier graphs. We give a necessary and sufficient condition under which a vertex-transitive Neumaier graph is strongly regular. We also identify Neumaier Cayley graphs with small valency at most $10$ among vertex-transitive Neumaier graphs.</description>

Abstract: Pin permutations play an important role in the structural study of permutation classes, most notably in relation to simple permutations and well-quasi-ordering, and in enumerative consequences arising from these. In this paper, we continue our study of pin classes, which are permutation classes that comprise all the finite subpermutations contained in an infinite pin permutation. We show that there is a phase transition at $\mu\approx 3.28277$: there are uncountably many different pin classes whose growth rate is equal to $\mu$, yet only countably many below $\mu$. Furthermore, by showing that all pin classes with growth rate less than $\mu$ are essentially defined by pin permutations that possess a periodic structure, we classify the set of growth rates of pin classes up to $\mu$.</description>

      <title>On The Optimal General Solution To The Multi-Peg Tower of Hanoi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12941v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a unified closed-form expression for the Frame-Stewart algorithm in the multi-peg Tower of Hanoi: M(p,n) = 2^(i(p,n)+1)*n - sum_{k=0}^{i(p,n)} 2^k * C(p+k-2, k), where i(p,n) = min{ j &gt;= 0 : n &lt;= C(p-1+j, j+1) }.
  and prove it satisfies the Frame-Stewart recurrence for all (p,n) via double induction using discrete slope analysis with simplex boundaries. It shows that M(p,n) grows linearly within each regime, with slopes doubling at successive boundaries. We also prove Frame-Stewart optimality for the first two regimes indexed by i: for p-1 &lt; n &lt;= C(p,2), M(p,n) = 4n - 2p + 1; for C(p,2) &lt; n &lt;= C(p+1,3), M(p,n) = 8n - 2p^2 + 1. These results give optimality proofs for infinitely many (p,n) pairs beyond trivial cases, settling the conjecture up to n &lt;= C(p+1,3).</description>

      <title>Labeled Chip-Firing on Undirected $k$-ary Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore labeled chip-firing on undirected $k$-ary trees, trees where every vertex has degree $k+1$. First, we extend known results for binary trees from Musiker and Nguyen, including the endgame and the locations of the smallest and largest chips, as well as relations between chips at different vertices. Then, inspired by recent work on the binary tree by the first author, Khovanova, and Luo, we use these properties to construct an upper bound, which we call the zigzag bound, on the number of stable configurations in labeled chip-firing on $k$-ary trees with $\frac{k^{\ell}-1}{k-1}$ labeled chips starting at the root. We further provide a novel lower bound on the number of stable configurations of $k$-ary trees, complementing our upper bounds.</description>

      <title>Fractionally colouring $P_5$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain some $d\ge2$ such that every graph $G$ with no induced copy of the five-vertex path $P_5$ has at most $\alpha(G)\omega(G)^d$ vertices. This ``off-diagonal Ramsey'' statement implies that every such graph $G$ has fractional chromatic number at most $\omega(G)^d$, and is another step towards the polynomial Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture for $P_5$. The proof uses the recent Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal result for $P_5$ and adapts a decomposition argument for $P_5$-free graphs developed by the author in an earlier paper.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Covering Two-vertex Multigraphs with Semi-edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.15214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of computational complexity of graph coverings, aka locally bijective graph homomorphisms, for {\em graphs with semi-edges}. The notion of graph covering is a discretization of coverings between surfaces or topological spaces, a notion well known and deeply studied in classical topology. Graph covers have found applications in discrete mathematics for constructing highly symmetric graphs, and in computer science in the theory of local computations. In 1991, Abello, Fellows, and Stillwell asked for a classification of the computational complexity of deciding if an input graph covers a fixed target graph, in the ordinary setting (of graphs with only edges). Although many general results are known, the full classification is still open. In spite of that, we propose to study the more general case of covering graphs composed of normal edges (including multiedges and loops) and so-called semi-edges. Semi-edges are becoming increasingly popular in modern topological graph theory, as well as in mathematical physics. They also naturally occur in the local computation setting, since they are lifted to matchings in the covering graph. We show some solvable cases and, in particular, completely characterize the complexity of the already very nontrivial problem of covering one- and two-vertex (multi)graphs with semi-edges. Our NP-hardness results are proven for simple input graphs, and in the case of regular two-vertex target graphs, even for bipartite ones. We remark that our new characterization results also strengthen previously known results for covering graphs without semi-edges, and they in turn apply to an infinite class of simple target graphs with at most two vertices of degree more than two. Some of the results are moreover proven in a more general setting (e.g., finding $k$-tuples of pairwise disjoint perfect matchings in regular graphs).</description>

      <title>A characterization of Kazhdan-Lusztig right cells containing smooth elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})$. Its Weyl group is the symmetric group $S_n$. In this paper, we want to describe some Kazhdan-Lusztig right cells containing smooth elements which parameterize the smooth Schubert varieties. These elements are closely related to the study of associated varieties of highest weight modules of $\mathfrak{sl}(n,\mathbb{C})$. Firstly, we give a complete classification of the KL right cells containing only smooth elements. Then we give a sufficient condition for a KL right cell to contain only non-smooth elements by using invariant subsequences and a sufficient condition for a KL right cell to contain some smooth elements. Finally, we give an efficient algorithm to find out all the smooth elements in a given KL right cell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We enhance the pointed quandle counting invariant of linkoids through the use of quivers analogously to quandle coloring quivers. This allows us to generalize the in-degree polynomial invariant of links to linkoids. Additionally, we introduce a new linkoid invariant, which we call the in-degree quiver polynomial matrix. Lastly, we study the pointed quandle coloring quivers of linkoids of $(p,2)$-torus type with respect to pointed dihedral quandles.</description>

      <title>Some Lagrangian quiver Grassmannians for the equioriented cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to better understand a family of linear degenerations of the classical Lagrangian Grassmannians $\Lambda(2n)$. It is the special case for $k=n$ of the varieties $X(k,2n)^{sp}$, introduced in previous joint work with Evgeny Feigin, Martina Lanini and Alexander P\"utz. These varieties are obtained as isotropic subvarieties of a family of quiver Grassmannians $X(n,2n)$, and are acted on by a linear degeneration of the algebraic group $Sp_{2n}$. We prove a conjecture proposed in the paper above for this particular case, which states that the ordering on the set of orbits in $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ given by closure-inclusion coincides with a combinatorially defined order on what are called symplectic $(n,2n)$-juggling patterns, much in the same way that the $Sp_{2n}$ orbits in $\Lambda(2n)$ are parametrized by a type C Weyl group with the Bruhat order. The dimension of such orbits is computed via the combinatorics of bounded affine permutations, and it coincides with the length of some permutation in a Coxeter group of affine type C. Furthermore, the varieties $X(n,2n)$ are GKM, that is, they have trivial cohomology in odd degree and are equipped with the action of an algebraic torus with finitely many fixed points and 1-dimensional orbits. In this paper it is proven that $X(n,2n)^{sp}$ is also GKM, with respect to the action of a subtorus of the above torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of intersective polynomials having coefficients in the ring of integers $\mathscr{O}_K$ of a number field $K$, and define a notion of upper density of subsets of $\mathscr{O}_K$. We prove that given any intersective polynomial $p(x)$ over $\mathscr{O}_K$, every subset $A$ of $\mathscr{O}_K$ of positive upper density contains two distinct elements whose difference is equal to $p(x)$ for some element $x$ in $\mathscr{O}_K$. Moreover, we obtain a quantitative version of this result. The proof is motivated by an argument due to Lucier, and the Fourier-free proof of the Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy theorem over the integers by Green, Tao and Ziegler.</description>

      <title>Graph enumeration for moduli spaces of curves and maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a calculus based on graph enumeration for $S_n$-equivariant motivic invariants of graphically stratified moduli spaces. We apply our theory to the Deligne--Mumford moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}$ and to the space of torus-fixed stable maps $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, \beta)^{\mathbb{C}^\star}$ when the target $X$ admits an appropriate $\mathbb{C}^\star$-action, deriving new formulas in each case. A key role is played by the P\'olya--Petersen character of a graph, which enriches P\'olya's classical cycle index polynomial. This character is valued in an algebra $\Lambda^{[2]}$ of wreath product symmetric functions, which we study from combinatorial and representation-theoretic perspectives. We prove that this algebra may be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of the category of polynomial functors which take symmetric sequences of vector spaces to vector spaces, building on foundational work of Macdonald. This leads to a plethystic action of $\Lambda^{[2]}$ on the ring $\Lambda$ of ordinary symmetric functions. Using this action, we derive our formulas, which ultimately involve only ordinary symmetric functions and the Grothendieck ring of mixed Hodge structures.</description>

      <title>Modularity from $q$-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1975, G. E. Andrews challenged the mathematics community to address L. Ehrenpreis' problem, which was to directly prove the modularity of the Rogers-Ramanujan $q$-series' summatory forms. This question is important because many different $q$-series appearing in combinatorics, representation theory, and physics often seem to be "mysteriously" modular, yet there is no general test to confirm this directly from the exotic $q$-series expressions. In this note, we solve this general problem using $q$-series algebra and $q$-series systems of differential equations. Specifically, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which a vector of holomorphic $q$-series on $|q|&lt;1$ forms a vector-valued modular function. This result offers a clear and conceptual path to modularity for "strange" $q$-series.</description>

      <title>M\"obius transforms and Shapley values for vector-valued functions on weighted directed acyclic multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of M\"obius inversion and Shapley values to directed acyclic multigraphs and weighted versions thereof. We further allow value functions (games) and thus their M\"obius transforms (synergy function) and Shapley values to have values in any abelian group that is a module over a ring that contains the graph weights, e.g. vector-valued functions. To achieve this and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity, efficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine Shapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two novel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to interpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of higher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of the null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements and flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with vanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The latter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of hierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply a unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical properties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the projection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion algebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain previously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new perspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph structured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up the possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine learning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many more.</description>
