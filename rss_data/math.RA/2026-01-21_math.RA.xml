      <title>Multiary gradings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article develops a comprehensive theory of multiary graded polyadic algebras, extending the classical concept of group-graded algebras to higher-arity structures. We introduce the notion of grading by multiary groups and investigate various compatibility conditions between the arity of algebra operations and grading group operations. Key results include quantization rules connecting arities, classification of graded homomorphisms, and concrete examples including ternary superalgebras and polynomial algebras over $n$-ary matrices. The theory reveals fundamentally new phenomena not present in the binary case, such as the existence of higher power gradings and nontrivial constraints on arity compatibility.</description>

      <title>On dihedral invariants of the free associative algebra of rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K\langle X_d\rangle$ denote the free associative algebra of rank $d \geq 2$ over a field $K$. By results of Lane (1976) and Kharchenko (1978), the algebra of invariants $K\langle X_d\rangle ^G$ is free for any subgroup $G \leq \GL_d(K)$ and any field $K$.
  Koryukin (1984) introduced an additional action of the symmetric group $Sym(n)$ on the homogeneous component of degree $n$ of $K\langle X_d\rangle$, given by permuting the positions of the variables. This endows $K\langle X_d\rangle $ with the structure of a $(K\langle X_d\rangle,\circ)$-$S$-algebra. With respect to this action, Koryukin proved that the invariant algebra $K\langle X_d\rangle ^G$ is finitely generated for every reductive group $G$.
  In this paper we study the algebra ${\mathbb C}\langle u,v\rangle^{D_{2n}}$ of invariants under the action of the dihedral group D_{2n} $ on the free associative algebra ${\mathbb C} \langle u,v\rangle$ of rank $2$. We compute the Hilbert series of ${\mathbb C}\langle u,v\rangle^{D_{2n}}$ and construct an explicit set of generators for ${\mathbb C}\langle u,v\rangle^{D_{2n}}$ as a free algebra. Furthermore, we describe a finite generating set for the $S$-algebra ${\mathbb C}\langle u,v\rangle^{D_{2n}}$.</description>

      <title>A curvature-regularized variational problem with an area constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlocking interfaces are commonly employed to mitigate relative sliding under shear.Indeed, Their geometry is typically selected on grounds of fabrication convenience rather than analytical optimality. There is no reason to suppose that circular or polygonal profiles minimize localized stress concentration under fixed geometric constraints. We propose a variational model in which the interface is represented by a planar curve $y=f(x)$, and localized stress amplification is quantified by a curvature-sensitive functional \[ J[f] = \int_{-a}^{a} \bigl(1+\gamma \kappa^2\bigr) \sqrt{1+f'(x)^2}\,dx, \] defined on the Sobolev space $W^{2,2}([-a,a])$. The functional is motivated by elasticity-theoretic considerations in which curvature enters the leading-order stress field near a singular interface.Indeed, any profile possessing discontinuous tangents yields a divergent integral, thereby rendering it energetically inadmissible within the Sobolev space $W^{2,2}$. An area constraint $\int_{-a}^{a} f(x)\,dx = A_0$ is imposed to model fixed material volume. Using the direct method of the calculus of variations, we establish the existence of a minimizer and derive the associated Euler--Lagrange equation, a nonlinear fourth-order boundary value problem.
  Note, however, that constant-curvature and piecewise-linear profiles fail to satisfy the necessary optimality conditions under the imposed constraint. Indeed, we are thus forced to conclude that analytical optimality necessitates a more complex variation in the local tangent angle
  The analysis indicates that commonly employed interlock geometries are not variationally optimal for minimizing localized shear stress within this class of admissible interfaces.</description>

      <title>Elementary proofs of ring commutativity theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jacobson's commutativity theorem says that a ring is commutative if, for each $x$, $x^n = x$ for some $n &gt; 1$. Herstein's generalization says that the condition can be weakened to $x^n-x$ being central. In both theorems, $n$ may depend on $x$. In this paper, in certain cases where $n$ is a fixed constant, we find equational proofs of each theorem. For the odd exponent cases $n = 2k+1$ of Jacobson's theorem, our main tool is a lemma stating that for each $x$, $x^k$ is central. For Herstein's theorem, we consider the cases $n=4$ and $n=8$, obtaining proofs with the assistance of the automated theorem prover Prover9.</description>

Furthermore, we show that such an equivalence also holds for differential Lie bialgebras, together with their associated Manin triples and corresponding matched pairs.</description>

      <title>Strong Hollowness in Commutative Rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study strongly hollow ideals and completely strongly hollow ideals in commutative rings without finiteness assumptions. We establish basic structural properties, including maximality phenomena and permanence under quotients and surjective homomorphisms. We obtain several characterizations of completely strongly hollow ideals in terms of extremal ideals avoiding a given ideal, and we show that a strongly hollow ideal which is not contained in the Jacobson radical is necessarily completely strongly hollow. As applications, we derive strong restrictions in integral domains and consequences for principal ideal domains, including a discrete valuation ring criterion. We develop the connection between complete hollowness and complete irreducibility and obtain a correspondence between completely strongly hollow ideals and completely strongly irreducible ideals. Finally, we develop a condition related to greatest common divisors which is equivalent to strongly hollowness under mild finiteness conditions.</description>

      <title>Ribbon complexes for the 0-Hecke algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit tableau-level maps between indecomposable projective modules for the type A 0-Hecke algebra that assemble into canonical split short exact sequences lifting the basic ribbon product rule in NSym via concatenation and near-concatenation. Iterating these maps yields cochain complexes indexed by generalized ribbons; we prove these complexes are acyclic in positive degrees and that their zeroth cohomology is the projective module indexed by full concatenation. We apply these complexes, together with VandeBogert's ribbon Schur module criterion, to prove Koszulness for a naturally defined internally graded algebra object built from the 0-Hecke tower. Finally, we define skew projective modules whose noncommutative Frobenius characteristics realize skewing by fundamental quasisymmetric functions on NSym.</description>

      <title>Mirror construction of Hecke correspondence between Nakajima quiver varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nakajima constructed geometric representations of a deformed Kac-Moody Lie algebra using Hecke correspondences between quiver varieties. In this paper, we show that Hecke correspondences, which are holomorphic Lagrangians in products of Nakajima quiver varieties, can be obtained by applying the localized mirror construction to the morphism spaces between families of framed Lagrangian branes supported on the core of a plumbing of two-spheres. Moreover, for a non-ADE quiver, we show that the localized mirror functor is fully-faithful.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Geometry on Severi-Brauer Schemes: Subsystem Reductions of Azumaya Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate pure-state entanglement in families as a geometric obstruction. In standard quantum information, entanglement is defined relative to a chosen tensor-product factorization of a fixed Hilbert space. In contrast, for a twisted family of pure-state spaces, which can be described by Azumaya algebras $A$ of degree $n$ on $X$ and their Severi-Brauer schemes \[ SB(A)=P\times^{PGL_n}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}\to X, \] such a subsystem choice may fail to globalize. We formalize this algebro-geometrically: fixing a factorization type $\mathbf d=(d_1,\dots,d_s)$ with $n=\prod_i d_i$, the existence of a global product-state locus of type $\mathbf d$ is equivalent to a reduction of the underlying $PGL_n$-torsor $P\to X$ to the stabilizer $G_{\mathbf d}\subset PGL_n$. Thus, entanglement is the obstruction to the existence of a relative Segre subscheme inside $SB(A)$.
  Writing $\Sigma_{\mathbf d}\subset \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ for the Segre variety, we call a reduction to $G_{\mathbf d}$ a $\mathbf d$-subsystem structure. Our first main result identifies the moduli of $\mathbf d$-subsystem structures with the quotient $P/G_{\mathbf d}$. Moreover, we realize naturally $P/G_{\mathbf d}$ as a locally closed subscheme of the relative Hilbert scheme, \[ \text{Hilb}^{\Sigma_{\mathbf d}}\!\bigl(SB(A)/X\bigr)\ \subset\ \text{Hilb}\bigl(SB(A)/X\bigr), \] parametrizing relative closed subschemes fppf-locally isomorphic to $\Sigma_{\mathbf d}\times X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite type degree-wise nilpotent $L_\infty$-algebra, we construct an abelian group that acts on the set of Maurer-Cartan elements of the given $L_\infty$-algebra so that the quotient by this action becomes the moduli space of equivalence classes of Maurer-Cartan elements. Specializing this to degree-wise nilpotent dg Lie algebras, we find that the associated ordinary gauge group of the dg Lie algebra with the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff multiplication might be substituted by the underlying additive group. This additive group acts on the Maurer-Cartan elements, and the quotient by this action yields the moduli space of gauge-equivalence classes of Maurer-Cartan elements.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macaulay representations of Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras of dimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05925v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tilting theory is one of the central tools in modern representation theory, in particular in the study of Cohen-Macaulay representations. We study Cohen-Macaulay representations of $\mathbb N$-graded Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras $A$ of dimension one, without assuming the connectedness condition. This framework covers a broad class of noncommutative Gorenstein rings, including classical $\mathbb N$-graded Gorenstein orders. We prove that the stable category $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a silting object if and only if $A_0$ has finite global dimension. In this case we give such a silting object explicitly. Assuming that $A$ is ring-indecomposable, we further show that $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a tilting object if and only if either $A$ is Artin-Schelter regular or the average Gorenstein parameter of $A$ is non-positive. These results generalize those of Buchweitz, Iyama, and Yamaura. We give two proofs of the second result: one via Orlov-type semiorthogonal decompositions, and the other via a direct calculation. As an application, we show that for a Gorenstein tiled order $A$, the category $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}^{\mathbb Z}A$ is equivalent to the derived category of the incidence algebra of an explicitly constructed poset.
  We also apply our results and Koszul duality to study smooth noncommutative projective quadric hypersurfaces $\mathsf{qgr}\,B$ of arbitrary dimension. We prove that $\mathsf{D}^{\mathrm b}(\mathsf{qgr}\,B)$ admits an explicitly constructed tilting object, which contains the tilting object of $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}^{\mathbb Z}B$ due to Smith and Van den Bergh as a direct summand via Orlov's semiorthogonal decomposition.</description>
