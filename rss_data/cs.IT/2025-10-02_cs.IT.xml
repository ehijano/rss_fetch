      <title>Next-Generation AI-Native Wireless Communications: MCMC-Based Receiver Architectures for Unified Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver processing is a key technology for current and next-generation wireless communications. However, it faces significant challenges related to complexity and scalability as the number of antennas increases. Artificial intelligence (AI), a cornerstone of next-generation wireless networks, offers considerable potential for addressing these challenges. This paper proposes an AI-driven, universal MIMO receiver architecture based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Unlike existing AI-based methods that treat receiver processing as a black box, our MCMC-based approach functions as a generic Bayesian computing engine applicable to various processing tasks, including channel estimation, symbol detection, and channel decoding. This method enhances the interpretability, scalability, and flexibility of receivers in diverse scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed approach integrates these tasks into a unified probabilistic framework, thereby enabling overall performance optimization. This unified framework can also be seamlessly combined with data-driven learning methods to facilitate the development of fully intelligent communication receivers.</description>

      <title>On Algebraic Approaches for DNA Codes with Multiple Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA strings and their properties are widely studied since last 20 years due to its applications in DNA computing. In this area, one designs a set of DNA strings (called DNA code) which satisfies certain thermodynamic and combinatorial constraints such as reverse constraint, reverse-complement constraint, $GC$-content constraint and Hamming constraint. However recent applications of DNA codes in DNA data storage resulted in many new constraints on DNA codes such as avoiding tandem repeats constraint (a generalization of non-homopolymer constraint) and avoiding secondary structures constraint. Therefore, in this chapter, we introduce DNA codes with recently developed constraints. In particular, we discuss reverse, reverse-complement, $GC$-content, Hamming, uncorrelated-correlated, thermodynamic, avoiding tandem repeats and avoiding secondary structures constraints. DNA codes are constructed using various approaches such as algebraic, computational, and combinatorial. In particular, in algebraic approaches, one uses a finite ring and a map to construct a DNA code. Most of such approaches does not yield DNA codes with high Hamming distance. In this chapter, we focus on algebraic constructions using maps (usually an isometry on some finite ring) which yields DNA codes with high Hamming distance. We focus on non-cyclic DNA codes. We briefly discuss various metrics such as Gau distance, Non-Homopolymer distance etc. We discuss about algebraic constructions of families of DNA codes that satisfy multiple constraints and/or properties. Further, we also discuss about algebraic bounds on DNA codes with multiple constraints. Finally, we present some open research directions in this area.</description>

      <title>List decoding of evaluation codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial evaluation codes hold a prominent place in coding theory. In this work, we study the problem of list decoding for a general class of polynomial evaluation codes, also known as Toric codes, that are defined for any given convex polytope P. Special cases, such as Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller codes, have been studied extensively. We present a generalization of the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm that takes into account the geometry and the combinatorics of P and compute bounds for the decoding radius.</description>

      <title>Parallelism Empowered Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in parallel hardware platforms have motivated the development of efficient universal decoders capable of meeting stringent throughput and latency requirements. Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) is a recently proposed decoding paradigm that sequentially tests Error Patterns (EPs) until finding a valid codeword. While Soft GRAND (SGRAND) achieves maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding, its inherently sequential nature hinders parallelism and results in high decoding latency. In this work, we utilize a unified binary tree representation of EPs, termed the EP tree, which enables compact representation, efficient manipulation, and parallel exploration. Building upon this EP tree representation, we propose a parallel design of SGRAND, preserving its ML optimality while significantly reducing decoding latency through pruning strategies and tree-based computation. Furthermore, we develop a hybrid GRAND algorithm that enhances Ordered Reliability Bits (ORB) GRAND with the EP tree representation, thereby achieving ML decoding with minimal additional computational cost beyond ORBGRAND while retaining parallel efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that parallel SGRAND achieves a $3.75\times$ acceleration compared to serial implementation, while the hybrid enhanced method achieves a $4.8\times$ acceleration, with further gains expected under hardware mapping.</description>

      <title>The dimension and Bose distance of some BCH codes of length $\frac{q^{m}-1}{\lambda}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BCH codes are important error correction codes, widely utilized due to their robust algebraic structure, multi-error correcting capability, and efficient decoding algorithms. Despite their practical importance and extensive study, their parameters, including dimension, minimum distance and Bose distance, remain largely unknown in general. This paper addresses this challenge by investigating the dimension and Bose distance of BCH codes of length $(q^m - 1)/\lambda$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\lambda$ is a positive divisor of $q - 1$. Specifically, for narrow-sense BCH codes of this length with $m \geq 4$, we derive explicit formulas for their dimension for designed distance $2 \leq \delta \leq (q^{\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\lambda} + 1$. We also provide explicit formulas for their Bose distance in the range $2 \leq \delta \leq (q^{\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\lambda}$. These ranges for $\delta$ are notably larger than the previously known results for this class of BCH codes. Furthermore, we extend these findings to determine the dimension and Bose distance for certain non-narrow-sense BCH codes of the same length. Applying our results, we identify several BCH codes with good parameters.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of RIS-Assisted UAV Communication in NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks enhanced by partitionable reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). We analyze three types of links between base station (BS) and UAVs: direct, RIS-only indirect, and composite links, under both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and Non-LoS (NLoS) propagation. The RIS-only indirect link and direct link are modeled using double Nakagami-m and Nakagami-m fading, respectively, while the composite link follows a combined fading channel model. Closed-form expressions for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are derived for all links, enabling tractable outage probability analysis. Then, we formulate a fairness-efficiency bilevel optimization problem to minimize the maximum outage probability among UAVs while minimizing the total number of required RIS reflecting elements. Accordingly, an RIS-assisted UAV Outage Minimization (RUOM) algorithm is proposed, which fairly allocates the NOMA power coefficients while minimizing the total number of RIS reflecting elements required, subject to NOMA-defined constraints, RIS resource limitations, and maximum allowable outage threshold. Simulation results validate the analytical models and demonstrate that the proposed RUOM algorithm significantly improves fairness and efficiency in BS-UAV communication.</description>

      <title>Variational Secret Common Randomness Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of extracting common randomness (CR) or secret keys from correlated random sources observed by two legitimate parties, Alice and Bob, through public discussion in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. We propose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the variational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice and Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their observations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high agreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is realized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial training. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction reconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is guaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study physical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely on the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus suffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility scenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps measured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified through both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR) measurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's position. The results demonstrate the feasibility and convincing performance of both the proposed CR extraction framework and sensing-based PLK generation method.</description>

      <title>Interference Resilient Quantum Receivers with Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing has attracted significant attention due to its ability to measure physical quantities with extremely high accuracy. Rydberg atoms - typically alkali atoms with a highly excited valence electron that is far from the nucleus - exhibit strong sensitivity to external electromagnetic fields. This sensitivity leads to coupling between different atomic energy levels, which can be observed by monitoring changes in a control laser beam before and after it passes through a vapor cell containing the Rydberg atoms. By analyzing the transmitted laser signal with a photodetector, variations in transmission can be attributed to the presence and characteristics of the external electromagnetic field. Because Rydberg atoms operate in a highly excited quantum state without relying on traditional electronic circuitry, they inherently avoid thermal noise, thereby enabling more sensitive detection. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a Rydberg atomic receiver based on Rb-85 and compare it with that of a conventional receiver in detecting an 8-level pulse amplitude modulation (8-PAM) signal in the presence of off-resonant interference. We demonstrate that the Rydberg receiver can suppress interference without the need for an additional filter. Effectively, our results show that the Rydberg receiver serves as an integrated filter and demodulator, outperforming conventional circuit-based receivers in terms of achievable symbol error rate</description>

      <title>Joint Channel and Semantic-aware Grouping for Effective Collaborative Edge Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on collaborative edge inference over wireless, which enables multiple devices to cooperate to improve inference performance in the presence of corrupted data. Exploiting a key-query mechanism for selective information exchange (or, group formation for collaboration), we recall the effect of wireless channel impairments in feature communication. We argue and show that a disjoint approach, which only considers either the semantic relevance or channel state between devices, performs poorly, especially in harsh propagation conditions. Based on these findings, we propose a joint approach that takes into account semantic information relevance and channel states when grouping devices for collaboration, by making the general attention weights dependent of the channel information. Numerical simulations show the superiority of the joint approach against local inference on corrupted data, as well as compared to collaborative inference with disjoint decisions that either consider application or physical layer parameters when forming groups.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Edge Inference via Semantic Grouping under Wireless Channel Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the framework of collaborative inference, or edge ensembles. This framework enables multiple edge devices to improve classification accuracy by exchanging intermediate features rather than raw observations. However, efficient communication strategies are essential to balance accuracy and bandwidth limitations. Building upon a key-query mechanism for selective information exchange, this work extends collaborative inference by studying the impact of channel noise in feature communication, the choice of intermediate collaboration points, and the communication-accuracy trade-off across tasks. By analyzing how different collaboration points affect performance and exploring communication pruning, we show that it is possible to optimize accuracy while minimizing resource usage. We show that the intermediate collaboration approach is robust to channel errors and that the query transmission needs a higher degree of reliability than the data transmission itself.</description>

      <title>Redundancy-as-Masking: Formalizing the Artificial Age Score (AAS) to Model Memory Aging in Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models, semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions, while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled, entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0), yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset, the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded, task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy, and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.</description>

      <title>Kant: An Efficient Unified Scheduling System for Large-Scale AI Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI cluster sizes continue to expand and the demand for large-language-model (LLM) training and inference workloads grows rapidly, traditional scheduling systems face significant challenges in balancing resource utilization, scheduling efficiency, and service quality. This paper presents and evaluates Kant: an efficient unified scheduling platform designed for large-scale AI container clusters, supporting the co-scheduling of both training and inference jobs. Based on the practical implementation of the Kant system, we systematically define a set of key evaluation metrics for AI clusters, including GPU Allocation Ratio (GAR), Scheduling Occupancy Rate (SOR), GPU Node Fragmentation Ratio (GFR), Job Waiting Time Distribution (JWTD), and Job Training Time Estimation Distribution (JTTED), providing a foundation for quantitative performance analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that Kant achieves exceptional performance in clusters ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs. By leveraging scheduling strategies such as Backfill and Enhanced Binpack (E-Binpack), the system significantly improves resource utilization and scheduling efficiency, while effectively reducing resource fragmentation and communication overhead in distributed training. The system has been deployed in multiple AI data center clusters, where it stably supports large-scale intelligent computing workloads. This work provides a practical engineering approach for building high-performance, highly available, AI-native scheduling infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Isogeny Graphs in Superposition and Quantum Onion Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Onion routing provides anonymity by layering encryption so that no relay can link sender to destination. A quantum analogue faces a core obstacle: layered quantum encryption generally requires symmetric encryption schemes, whereas classically one would rely on public-key encryption. We propose a symmetric-encryption-based quantum onion routing (QOR) scheme by instantiating each layer with the abelian ideal class group action from the Theory of Complex Multiplication. Session keys are established locally via a Diffie-Hellman key exchange between neighbors in the chain of communication. Furthermore, we propose a novel ''non-local'' key exchange between the sender and receiver. The underlying problem remains hard even for quantum adversaries and underpins the security of current post-quantum schemes. We connect our construction to isogeny graphs and their association schemes, using the Bose-Mesner algebra to formalize commutativity and guide implementation. We give two implementation paths: (i) a universal quantum oracle evaluating the class group action with polynomially many quantum resources, and (ii) an intrinsically quantum approach via continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs), outlined here and developed in a companion paper. A small Qiskit example illustrates the mechanics (by design, not the efficiency) of the QOR.</description>

      <title>NGGAN: Noise Generation GAN Based on the Practical Measurement Dataset for Narrowband Powerline Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive noise is a critical issue in enhancing impulse noise processing for narrowband powerline communication (NB-PLC) transceivers. However, existing mathematical noise generative models capture only some of the characteristics of additive noise. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), called the noise-generation GAN (NGGAN), that learns the complicated characteristics of practically measured noise samples for data augmentation. To closely match the statistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC modem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches based on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate cyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training dataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various applications. (iii) To measure the similarity performance of the GAN-based models based on mathematical and practically measured datasets, we perform quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include (1) a piecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a frequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NGGAN trained using waveform characteristics is closer to the practically measured dataset in terms of the quality of the generated noise.</description>

      <title>Computing on Dirty Paper: Interference-Free Integrated Communication and Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Costa's pioneering work on dirty paper coding (DPC), this paper proposes a novel scheme for integrated communication and computing (ICC), named Computing on Dirty Paper, whereby the transmission of discrete data symbols for communication, and over-the-air computation (AirComp) of nomographic functions can be achieved simultaneously over common multiple-access channels. In particular, the proposed scheme allows for the integration of communication and computation in a manner that is asymptotically interference-free, by precanceling the computing symbols at the transmitters (TXs) using DPC principles. A simulation-based assessment of the proposed ICC scheme under a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) setup is also offered, including the evaluation of performance for data detection, and of mean-squared-error (MSE) performance for function computation, over a block of symbols. The results validate the proposed method and demonstrate its ability to significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SotA) ICC schemes in terms of both bit error rate (BER) and MSE.</description>

      <title>Joint Jammer Mitigation and Data Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-antenna (or MIMO) processing is a promising solution to the problem of jammer mitigation. Existing methods mitigate the jammer based on an estimate of its spatial signature that is acquired through a dedicated training phase. This strategy has two main drawbacks: (i) it reduces the communication rate since no data can be transmitted during the training phase and (ii) it can be evaded by smart or multi-antenna jammers that do not transmit during the training phase or that dynamically change their subspace through time-varying beamforming. To address these drawbacks, we propose Joint jammer Mitigation and data Detection (JMD), a novel paradigm for MIMO jammer mitigation. The core idea of JMD is to estimate and remove the jammer interference subspace jointly with detecting the legitimate transmit data over multiple time slots. Doing so removes the need for a dedicated and rate-reducing training period while being able to mitigate smart and dynamic multi-antenna jammers. We provide two JMD-type algorithms, SANDMAN and MAED, that differ in the way they estimate the channels of the legitimate transmitters and achieve different complexity-performance tradeoffs. Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of JMD for jammer mitigation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information matrices from R\'enyi relative entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the R\'enyi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\alpha$-$z$, and geometric R\'enyi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$, the log-Euclidean R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric R\'enyi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\alpha$-$z$ R\'enyi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states, I establish formulas for their $\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel coding: Approximation algorithms and strong converse exponents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study relaxations of entanglement-assisted quantum channel coding and establish that non-signaling assistance and a natural semi-definite programming relaxation\, -- \,termed meta-converse\, -- \,are equivalent in terms of success probabilities. We then present a rounding procedure that transforms any non-signaling-assisted strategy into an entanglement-assisted one and prove an approximation ratio of $(1 - e^{-1})$ in success probabilities for the special case of measurement channels. For fully quantum channels, we give a weaker (dimension dependent) approximation ratio, that is nevertheless still tight to characterize the strong converse exponent of entanglement-assisted channel coding [Li and Yao, IEEE Tran.~Inf.~Theory (2024)]. Our derivations leverage ideas from position-based coding, quantum decoupling theorems, the matrix Chernoff inequality, and input flattening techniques.</description>

      <title>Antenna Coding Empowered by Pixel Antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pixel antennas, based on discretizing a continuous radiation surface into small elements called pixels, are a flexible reconfigurable antenna technology. By controlling the connections between pixels via switches, the characteristics of pixel antennas can be adjusted to enhance the wireless channel. Inspired by this, we propose a novel technique denoted antenna coding empowered by pixel antennas. We first derive a physical and electromagnetic based communication model for pixel antennas using microwave multiport network theory and beamspace channel representation. With the model, we optimize the antenna coding to maximize the channel gain in a single-input single-output (SISO) pixel antenna system and develop a codebook design for antenna coding to reduce the computational complexity. We analyze the average channel gain of SISO pixel antenna system and derive the corresponding upper bound. In addition, we jointly optimize the antenna coding and transmit signal covariance matrix to maximize the channel capacity in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) pixel antenna system. Simulation results show that using pixel antennas can enhance the average channel gain by up to 5.4 times and channel capacity by up to 3.1 times, demonstrating the significant potential of pixel antennas as a new dimension to design and optimize wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Tackling Federated Unlearning as a Parameter Estimation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models. This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random, categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario, our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Polarimetry with Zak-OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarimetry, which is the ability to measure the scattering response of the environment across orthogonal polarizations, is fundamental to enhancing wireless communication and radar system performance. In this paper, we utilize the Zak-OTFS modulation to enable instantaneous polarimetry within a single transmission frame. We transmit a Zak-OTFS carrier waveform and a spread carrier waveform mutually unbiased to it simultaneously over orthogonal polarizations. The mutual unbiasedness of the two waveforms enables the receiver to estimate the full polarimetric response of the scattering environment from a single received frame. Unlike existing methods for instantaneous polarimetry with computational complexity quadratic in the time-bandwidth product, the proposed method enables instantaneous polarimetry at near-linear complexity in the time-bandwidth product. Via numerical simulations, we show ideal polarimetric target detection and parameter estimation results with the proposed method, with improvements in performance and computational complexity over comparable baselines.</description>
